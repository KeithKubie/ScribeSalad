My name is Stuart Duncan,

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:19.025
but I'm actually probably
better known online as "AutismFather."

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:21.126
That's me on the internet.

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.541
I know the resemblance is uncanny.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:24.687
(Laughter)

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:27.805
But I'm going to talk
a little bit today about Minecraft.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.356
That's my Minecraft character.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.651
If you don't know the game very well,
don't worry too much about it.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:36.205
It's just the medium that I used
at the time to fill a need.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.825
And what I want to talk about applies
to pretty much every situation.

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:43.482
So about four years ago,
I started a Minecraft server

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:45.940
for children with autism
and their families,

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:47.710
and I called it "Autcraft."

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.674
And since then, we've been in the news
all around the world,

00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:52.825
on television and radio and magazines.

00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:56.336
Buzzfeed called us "one of
the best places on the internet."

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.822
We're also the subject
of an award-winning research paper called

00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:04.693
"Appropriating Minecraft as an Assistive
Technology for Youth with Autism."

00:01:04.717 --> 00:01:05.968
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:08.042
But you get the idea, I think.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.388
So I want to talk a little bit
about that research paper

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:12.715
and what it's about,

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.233
but first I have to give you
a little bit of history

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:16.687
on how the server came to be.

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:20.401
Back in 2013, everybody
was playing Minecraft,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.693
kids and adults alike,

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.905
with and without autism, of course.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.351
But it was the big thing.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.422
But I saw parents on social media
reaching out to other parents,

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:32.231
asking if their autistic children
could play together.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.357
And the reason is that when they tried
to play on public servers,

00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:37.666
they kept running into bullies and trolls.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.820
When you have autism, you behave
a little differently sometimes,

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:42.548
sometimes a lot differently.

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:45.694
And we all know a little bit of difference
is all you really need

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.079
for a bully to make you their next target.

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:50.154
So these terrible, terrible people online,

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.645
they would destroy everything
that they tried to make,

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:55.287
they would steal all their stuff,

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.429
and they would kill them
over and over again,

00:01:57.453 --> 00:01:59.236
making the game virtually unplayable.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.943
But the worst part,
the part that really hurt the most,

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.379
was what these bullies
would say to these kids.

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:06.278
They'd call them rejects

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:07.920
and defects

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:09.782
and retards.

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:13.622
And they would tell these kids,
some as young as six years old,

00:02:13.646 --> 00:02:15.277
that society doesn't want them,

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.689
and their own parents
never wanted a broken child,

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:19.503
so they should just kill themselves.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.838
And of course, these kids, you understand,

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:25.406
they would sign off
from these servers angry and hurt.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.905
They would break their keyboards,
they'd quite literally hate themselves,

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.362
and their parents felt powerless
to do anything.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:33.646
So I decided I had to try and help.

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:35.567
I have autism,

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.693
my oldest son has autism,

00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:40.431
and both my kids and I love Minecraft,

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:42.439
so I have to do something.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.296
So I got myself a Minecraft server,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.348
and I spent some time,
built a little village with some roads

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:53.654
and a big welcome sign and this guy
and a lodge up on a mountaintop,

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:55.539
and tried to make it inviting.

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:56.937
The idea was pretty simple.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.368
I had a white list, so only people
that I approved could join,

00:03:00.392 --> 00:03:02.990
and I would just monitor
the server as much as I could,

00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:05.037
just to make sure that nothing went wrong.

00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:08.212
And that was it, that was the whole
promise: to keep the kids safe

00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:09.387
so they could play.

00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:11.126
When it was done, I went to Facebook

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.365
and posted a pretty simple message
to my friends list, not publicly.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.742
I wanted to see if there
was any interest in this,

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:18.107
and if it really could help.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.537
Turns out that I greatly underestimated
just how much this was needed,

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:24.447
because within 48 hours, I got 750 emails.

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:27.485
I don't have that many Facebook friends.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.434
(Laughter)

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:33.071
Within eight days, I had to upgrade
the hosting package eight times,

00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.076
from the bottom package
to the most expensive package they had,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.709
and now, almost four years later,

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.885
I have 8,000 names on the white list
from all around the world.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.144
But the reason I'm up here
today to talk to you

00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:45.725
isn't just because I gave kids
a safe place to play.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.523
It's what happened while they played.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:48.982
I started hearing from parents

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.634
who said their children
were learning to read and write

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:52.868
by playing on the server.

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:55.607
At first they spelled things
by sound, like most kids do,

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.701
but because they were part of a community,

00:03:57.725 --> 00:04:00.307
they saw other people
spelling the same words properly

00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:01.492
and just picked it up.

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:04.782
I started hearing from parents
who said that their nonverbal children

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:05.962
were starting to speak.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:08.658
They only talked about Minecraft,
but they were talking.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.006
(Laughter)

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.717
Some kids made friends at school
for the first time ever.

00:04:12.741 --> 00:04:15.377
Some started to share,
even give things to other people.

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.559
It was amazing.

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:19.957
And every single parent came to me
and said it was because of Autcraft,

00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:21.384
because of what you're doing.

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:22.559
But why, though?

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:25.446
How could all of this be
just from a video game server?

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:29.263
Well, it goes back to that
research paper I was talking about.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:32.996
In it, she covers some of the guidelines
I used when I created the server,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.520
guidelines that I think help encourage
people to be their very best.

00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:37.740
I hope.

00:04:37.764 --> 00:04:39.060
For example, communication.

00:04:39.084 --> 00:04:40.857
It can be tough for kids with autism.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.395
It could be tough
for grown-ups without autism.

00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:46.216
But I think that kids
should not be punished,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.686
they should be talked to.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.496
Nine times out of ten, when the kids
on the server act out,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.866
it's because of something that's happened
in the day at school or home.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.042
Maybe a pet died.

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.704
Sometimes it's just
a miscommunication between two kids.

00:04:57.728 --> 00:04:59.851
One doesn't say what they're about to do.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.283
And so we just offer to help.

00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:04.194
We always tell the children
on the server that we're not mad,

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:05.532
and they're not in trouble;

00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:06.707
we only want to help.

00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.585
And it shows that not only do we care,

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:11.806
but we respect them enough
to listen to their point of view.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.460
Respect goes a long way.

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:16.097
Plus, it shows them that they have
everything they need

00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:19.093
to be able to resolve these problems
on their own in the future

00:05:19.117 --> 00:05:22.178
and maybe even avoid them,
because, you know, communication.

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.604
On most servers, as video games are,

00:05:26.628 --> 00:05:29.418
children are rewarded,
well, players are rewarded,

00:05:29.442 --> 00:05:31.602
for how well they do
in a competition, right?

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:33.809
The better you do,
the better reward you get.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.266
That can be automated; the server
does the work, the code is there.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.766
On Autcraft, we don't do that.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.240
We have things like
"Player of the Week" and "CBAs,"

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:43.254
which is "Caught Being Awesome."

00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:44.508
(Laughter)

00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:49.179
We award players ranks on the servers
based on the attributes they exhibit,

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:52.480
such as the "Buddy" rank for people
who are friendly towards others,

00:05:52.504 --> 00:05:55.488
and "Junior Helper" for people
that are helpful towards others.

00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:57.980
We have "Senior Helper" for the adults.

00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:01.501
But they're obvious, right?

00:06:01.525 --> 00:06:04.934
Like, people know what to expect
and how to earn these things

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.468
because of how they're named.

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:08.883
As soon as somebody signs onto the server,

00:06:08.907 --> 00:06:11.805
they know that they're going
to be rewarded for who they are

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:13.177
and not what they can do.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.980
Our top award, the AutismFather Sword,

00:06:16.004 --> 00:06:18.745
which is named after me
because I'm the founder,

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:22.062
is a very powerful sword that
you can't get in the game any other way

00:06:22.086 --> 00:06:25.704
than to show that you completely put
the community above yourself,

00:06:25.728 --> 00:06:28.709
and that compassion and kindness
is at the core of who you are.

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:31.313
We've given away quite a few
of those swords, actually.

00:06:31.337 --> 00:06:34.868
I figure, if we're watching the server
to make sure nothing bad happens,

00:06:34.892 --> 00:06:38.695
we should also watch for the good things
that happen and reward people for them.

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.780
We're always trying
to show all the players

00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:43.188
that everybody is considered
to be equal, even me.

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:45.920
But we know we can't treat
people equally to do that.

00:06:45.944 --> 00:06:48.431
Some of the players get angry very easily.

00:06:48.455 --> 00:06:51.130
Some of them have additional
struggles on top of autism,

00:06:51.154 --> 00:06:52.917
such as OCD or Tourette's.

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:57.573
So, I have this knack
of remembering all of the players.

00:06:57.597 --> 00:07:00.243
I remember their first day,
the conversations we've had,

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:02.522
things we've talked about,
things they've built.

00:07:02.546 --> 00:07:04.609
So when somebody comes
to me with a problem,

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:08.010
I handle that situation differently
than I would with any other player,

00:07:08.034 --> 00:07:09.673
based on what I know about them.

00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:12.784
For the other admins and helpers,
we document everything

00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:16.120
so that, whether it's good or bad
or a concerning conversation,

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.928
it's there, so everybody is aware.

00:07:18.562 --> 00:07:20.971
I want to give you one example
of this one player.

00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:23.146
He was with us for a little while,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.295
but at some point he started
spamming dashes in the chat,

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.265
like a big long line of dashes
all the way across the screen.

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.209
A little while later, he'd do it again.

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:34.410
The other players asked him
not to do that, and he'd say, "OK."

00:07:34.434 --> 00:07:35.785
And then he'd do it again.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.814
It started to frustrate the other players.

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:40.959
They asked me to mute him
or to punish him for breaking the rules,

00:07:40.983 --> 00:07:43.226
but I knew there had to be
something more to it.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.257
So I went to his aunt, who is
the contact that I have for him.

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.489
She explained that
he had gone blind in one eye

00:07:48.513 --> 00:07:50.405
and was losing his vision in the other.

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.604
So what he was doing
was splitting up the chat

00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:54.474
into easier-to-see blocks of text,

00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:55.966
which is pretty smart.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.252
So that very same night, I talked
to a friend of mine who writes code

00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.624
and we created a brand-new
plug-in for the server

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.854
that makes it so that
any player on the server,

00:08:03.878 --> 00:08:05.314
including him, of course,

00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:08.378
could just enter a command
and instantly have every single line

00:08:08.402 --> 00:08:09.556
separated by dashes.

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:12.685
Plus, they can make it
asterisks or blank lines

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:15.311
or anything they want --
whatever works best for them.

00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:18.772
We even went a little bit extra
and made it so it highlights your name,

00:08:18.796 --> 00:08:21.326
so that it's easier to see
if somebody mentions you.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.485
It's just one example of how
doing a little bit extra,

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:25.942
a small modification,

00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:28.009
still helps everybody be on equal footing,

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:30.872
even though you did a little extra
just for that one player.

00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:34.462
The big one is to be not afraid.

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:36.870
The children on my server are not afraid.

00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:39.077
They are free to just be themselves,

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.826
and it's because we support
and encourage and celebrate each other.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.148
We all know what it feels like
to be the outcast

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:47.972
and to be hated simply for existing,

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:51.466
and so when we're together on the server,
we're not afraid anymore.

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:54.093
For the first two years
or so on the server,

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:57.987
I talked to two children per week
on average that were suicidal.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:01.795
But they came to me because
I'm the one that made them feel safe.

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:05.182
They felt like I was the only person
in the world they could talk to.

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:07.372
So I guess my message is:

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.353
whether you have a charity
or some other organization,

00:09:10.377 --> 00:09:12.040
or you're a teacher or a therapist

00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:14.539
or you're a parent
who is just doing your very best,

00:09:14.563 --> 00:09:16.281
or you're an autistic, like I am,

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:17.628
no matter who you are,

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:22.076
you absolutely must help these children
strip away those fears

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.446
before you do anything else,

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.683
because anything else
is going to feel forced

00:09:25.707 --> 00:09:27.464
unless they're not afraid.

00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:30.023
It's why positive reinforcement
will always do better

00:09:30.047 --> 00:09:31.805
than any form of punishment.

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:34.188
They want to learn when they
feel safe and happy.

00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:36.875
It just happens naturally;
they don't even try to learn.

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:40.208
These are words from the kids
on the server to describe the server.

00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:42.642
The one thing I would hope
that you could take away

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:46.420
is that no matter what somebody else
is going through in life right now,

00:09:46.444 --> 00:09:49.722
whether they're being bullied
at school or at home,

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:52.586
if they're questioning their sexuality
or even their gender,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.075
which happens a lot
in the autism community,

00:09:55.099 --> 00:09:57.814
if they're feeling alone or even suicidal,

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:01.600
you have to live your life in such a way

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:05.096
that that person feels like they can
come to and tell you.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.083
They have to feel perfectly safe
in talking to you about it.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.710
If you want to see
a group of autistic children --

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:14.378
kids who society wrongly thinks
are supposed to be antisocial

00:10:14.402 --> 00:10:15.954
and lacking in empathy --

00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:19.291
if you want to see them come together
and build the most compassionate

00:10:19.315 --> 00:10:21.992
and friendly and generous
community you've ever seen,

00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:24.298
the kind of place that people
would write about

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:26.509
as one of the best places on the internet,

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:27.684
they'll do that.

00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:28.859
I've seen it.

00:10:28.883 --> 00:10:30.235
I'm there every day.

00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:34.719
But they have some huge obstacles
that they have to overcome to do that,

00:10:34.743 --> 00:10:37.389
and it would be really helpful
to have somebody there

00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:40.876
who could help to show them that
the only thing they really have to fear

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.053
is self-doubt.

00:10:42.077 --> 00:10:44.954
So I guess I'm asking you
to please be that person for them,

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.282
because to them,

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:49.597
those kids --

00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:50.807
it means everything.

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.675
Thank you very much.

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.071
(Applause)
