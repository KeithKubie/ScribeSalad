00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.632
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Cay.

00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:03.050
&gt;&gt; I'm Sara.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.710
&gt;&gt; We'll be the instructors for this course. The way most people interact with

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.530
their computer is in the same way that I just did with my Word Processor. There

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.680
were a lot of buttons, but if there isn't a button for what I want to do then

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.560
I'm stuck.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.590
&gt;&gt; However, there's a secret language that you can use to make your computer do

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.515
whatever you want it to do.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:22.820
&gt;&gt; In this course, we teach you that secret language. When you learn it, you will

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.065
have power over your computer.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:27.190
&gt;&gt; We'll get you started with the Java programming environment, and you'll write

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.935
your first programs.

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:32.650
&gt;&gt; You might make a few mistakes. That's okay. Actually, it's good, because you

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.375
learn from your mistakes.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.730
&gt;&gt; We're really excited to teach you the secret language, so that you can make the

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.070
computer do what you want it to do. Let's get started.
