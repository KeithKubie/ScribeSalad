[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.330
LISA GOREN: So I'm a polar
and frozen landscape artist.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.570
And exclusively I
work in watercolors.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.580
The first thing
that everybody asks

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.470
me is, why would you
want to go there?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.600
And the first place I
got to go was Antarctica.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.119
Since I was about 15, I had read
every adventure book around.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.490
This is a small painting I
did of The Endurance trapped

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.000
in ice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.900
I'm a big Shackleton fan.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.810
And I always just have been
fascinated by cold places.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.290
I was raised in New York
City, so there isn't really

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.760
a lot of connection, except
for having read these books.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.480
There were no girls on any
of these adventure trips,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.260
certainly no Jews from
Brooklyn, on any of these ships.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.155
And yet, I always knew this
was where I was going to go,

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.330
and I was going to do it.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.160
21 years ago I got to go
as a tourist to Antarctica.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.600
It was a two week trip.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000
People generally ask
how'd you get there?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.490
I took a plane from
Boston to New York,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.020
New York to Argentina, and
then Argentina all the way down

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.110
to the tip of Argentina-- so
Buenos Aries the Ushuaia--

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.900
and then the boat
ride where that arrow

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.440
is from the tip of Argentina
to the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.870
That took two days,
that ride, through some

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.040
of the roughest waters in the
world, which was very exciting.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.650
The ice ceiling
is something that

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.860
is referred to when you talk
about women on Antarctica.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.660
I had a girl ask
me once in a class,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.290
were you the first
woman in Antarctica?

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510
I was like, no.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.060
But actually,
women in Antarctica

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
were really only
there since the '50s.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.340
And it's still a
small percentage.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.570
What I wanted to see
was the blue, the ice.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.910
This was the most
exciting thing for me.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.240
And does anyone know how that
blue happens, scientists here?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.490
It's the density of the ice.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.240
All other light
waves are trapped.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.130
And the only light
wave that can come out

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.830
is the small blue,
the really deep blue.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.670
It's really exciting to
see when you see that.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.620
I started painting
about two years later,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.470
although I knew I always
wanted to paint it.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.495
I don't know why, but
it was in my head.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.370
And so these are some
of the first paintings.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.810
They're fairly realistic.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.310
And I'll show you
the next one, this

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.710
is the original
photo on the left

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.690
and on the right
is the painting.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.120
You can see the
camera mark there

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.323
because I was using
film 21 years ago.

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.490
I didn't take them any
pictures, because it was film

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.110
and it was expensive.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.310
Those black dots
there are seals.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.000
In general, I try not to
put animals in my paintings

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.450
because then you kind of
know exactly where you are.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.550
I like this sense of this
is sort of a mystery.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.720
You can see there's some
pink on top of the ice there.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.957
That's snow algae
that grows on ice.

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:23.540
And so you start to see some of
the colors, which were amazing

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.590
there.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.888
This is the first photo you saw,
and that's the original photo

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:28.430
it came from.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.340
You can see the ship
next to the iceberg.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.990
We were trying to get some
sort of shelter from the wind.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.120
And it's actually
quite dangerous

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.680
to be next to an
iceberg like that,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.980
because the water below
is warmer than the air.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.520
And so the ice
begins to melt below.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.422
Eventually-- you
know this is the tip

00:03:48.422 --> 00:03:49.880
of the iceberg--
eventually the tip

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.030
part is heavier than the
bottom part and it flips.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.280
And you don't really know
when that's going to happen.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.030
So it's very dangerous.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.680
You're not supposed to climb
on them or do anything nearby.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.170
But most of the
boats that go there

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.090
have underwater
radar at this point.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.100
I decided to start painting.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.020
Why would I think that
I could even do this?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.670
I have no experience
as a painter.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.970
I started painting
essentially 17 years ago,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.480
so that's four years
after I was in Antarctica.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.160
I had some friends--

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.460
we were called the bad
girls-- who just really

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.630
were super supportive.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.360
They had bought me
watercolors to take with me.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.460
And my kid who would do
anything that I told them to do.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.220
And so here I'm making
him do some canvassing.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.190
So people were optimistic and
thinking that I could do this.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.650
So that was OK.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.820
And I was a parent at home,
so it was a good way for me

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.490
to use some of that time.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.740
In Antarctica, the first
thing I would say that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.500
surprised me was how
much color there was.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500
And this is the color of kelp.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.350
These are paintings
that I made from kelp

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.920
that was on the shore.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.090
And there were also bones from
abandoned whaling stations.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.240
We think these were most likely
blue whale bones because that's

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.480
the gold standard of
whaling because you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.040
get so much bang for
your harpoon buck.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.000
And there were just bones
littered all over the shore.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.790
The International Whaling
agreement was from 1965, so

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.750
these bones are at least--

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.110
were at least 50 years
old when I was there,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.120
or 40 years old when I was
there, but they're now older.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.470
And so they will not be eaten.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.070
There are no land
mammals in Antarctica.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.210
And there are no bugs.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.010
So what will eventually
get rid of those is wind.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.280
I started being able to
travel with my family.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.970
I had more subjects
and more confidence.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.090
The one on the left is Iceland
and the one on the right

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.450
is Alaska, the
Mendenhall glacier,

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.550
for those of you
who've been to Alaska.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.430
As a painter, I
started to really think

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.500
about my own style.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.910
And so I began to do more
and more abstract pieces.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.160
And this is one of
the things about not

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.410
having animals in my photos--

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.110
I mean, my paintings-- is
again, you put a penguin

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.140
in a painting, you know where
it is, even if the rest of it

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.040
is fairly abstract.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.410
But these are all
based on real photos

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.620
of what the real world
that we live in looks like.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.560
The one on the left is
from an aerial photo

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.300
of tundra melting in Alaska.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.460
And this is pack
ice in Antarctica.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.510
So you can see it's getting
more and more abstract.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.050
5 and 1/2 years
ago, 6 years ago,

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.690
I decided I would apply
for an artist residency.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.270
A lot of my artist friends
were really supportive

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.110
and said, oh, you
should try one of those.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.050
And I did apply for
one and didn't get it,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.030
but I got a letter
with it that said,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.630
you should apply for others.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.590
The reason you didn't get it is
because of your financial range

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.410
didn't fit what
this residency was.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.780
So I started looking and
there was this residency

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.160
at the top of the world.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.500
And I thought, oh,
that looks interesting.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.170
And I did not tell anyone that
I applied for it, because I was

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.410
like, I'm not going to get it.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.400
And then I get an email saying,
we're sorry to tell you--

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.180
so it's like, OK.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.810
Didn't get it.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.430
But I thought, well,
I should read it

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.805
in case they give
me some advice.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.388
And they said, we're
sorry to tell you

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.930
you didn't get it this year,
but you're going next year.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.440
So I was like, OK, I guess
I got to tell my husband.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.360
You know, I really
hadn't told anyone.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.850
So I was like, oh my god.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.220
So this is with
the Arctic Circle.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.060
And this is-- we were
sailing on a tall ship

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.190
around the island of Svalbard.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.040
Anybody here read
"The Golden Compass?"

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.720
That's the island of polar bears
where Iorek Byrnison lives.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.110
We didn't see any
armored polar bears.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.670
But this is 500 miles
from the North Pole.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.650
Just to give you a sense
of how far north it

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.820
is, almost too far north
to see the northern lights.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.100
The northern lights are
more available closer

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.210
to the Arctic Circle.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.355
To go on a trip like this
where I was gone for a month--

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.480
it was two weeks on the
boat, but I was essentially

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.560
gone for a month--

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.230
as a mom with, at that
time, a 12-year-old kid,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.160
you have to really--

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.990
I had to really
spend a lot of time

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.710
figuring out what am I going
to do, how am I going to do it?

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.235
And so the first thing I
had to do was a Kickstarter.

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:31.120
I had to raise money.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.059
So if you think, six
years ago Kickstarter

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.960
was still not as
all over the place.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.789
And I had to explain Kickstarter
as like WGBH fundraiser,

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.998
only you'd be
sending me somewhere.

00:08:43.998 --> 00:08:46.290
So there were still people
didn't really know about it.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.370
And I was very successful in my
Kickstarter, which was great.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.040
Shopping, I had to do some
shopping for this trip.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.370
Most people asked
what I need to buy.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.540
As a New Englander, I didn't
really need to buy that much.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.630
The weather was pretty much
the same as winter here.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.080
But the organization of an
absence is the big part.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.462
And this is, as an artist,
this isn't really something

00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:10.920
that you would
think, oh, you know,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.790
you have to do all these things.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.620
I had to get the dog
sitter for a month.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.370
I had to make sure that my
kid was going to have dinner

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.968
every night, you know,
because my husband was home

00:09:22.968 --> 00:09:23.760
but he was working.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.510
He had rehearsals.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.040
You know, he has a life, too.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.790
So it's interesting because
when I speak to groups,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.820
I often have mothers
come up to me

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.740
and say, how did you do that?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.430
Because it is-- in
retrospect, it was insane.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.980
But I did that.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.200
And it left a mark on my family.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.500
This is my son and
my nephew and me.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.720
We're in Brookline Ice.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.980
I don't know if any of you've
driven past that place.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.520
Brookline Ice is where
all the ice sculptures

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.200
for New Year's Eve are stored.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.530
And so they let us do the
video for the Kickstarter

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.760
in Brookline Ice.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.340
So that was pretty cool.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.220
The residency itself
had 27 artists--

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.310
six men, 21 women.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.940
It was gender neutral when
they do the applications.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.840
They don't know the
names of the people.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.870
So this was the one with
the most amount of women.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.960
There were from 10 countries.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.310
And you can see on the map kind
of all where they were from.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.280
There were all different
types of artists--

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.860
painters, spoken word, poetry.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.790
You can read all that.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.870
You can see.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.970
This is a picture of us the
day we started on the ship.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.560
It hadn't snowed
yet in Svalbard.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.530
And then it snowed pretty
consistently after that.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.860
This was in September, so
right before winter sets in.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.980
And then you see
the sign that says

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.140
beware throughout Svalbard.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.600
Danger throughout Svalbard.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.210
Svalbard has more polar bears
than people in the winter.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.560
In the summer, there's a
lot of tourists that go by.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.440
This is what the on board
experience looked like.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.510
You have kind of a higher
level part of the galley

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.770
and then lower level.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.830
And most people had
laptops of some sort.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.170
And those artists
actually were able to do

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.573
a lot of work, the people
who use their laptops,

00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:23.490
so that would be
photographers, videographers,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.870
the sound artists.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.890
Those of us who were
painters, dancers, writers, we

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.500
couldn't really do a
lot of our work there.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.750
So it was more of a gathering
expedition as opposed to--

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.230
it was just not enough space.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.670
My pieces, as you
can see, are large.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.705
So it would take
up the whole table.

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:44.110
It would not be possible.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.500
And of course, the boat's
moving the whole time.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.350
You know, there's no flat time.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.980
The places we slept were below.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.530
So there's our staircase.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.430
We were in bunks.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.630
That's a bunk there.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.220
We called it the nest.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.080
Then, of course, the bar,
which was very important.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.600
And that's part of the galley.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.475
Considering we'd never
met each other before,

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.280
we did pretty well together.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.860
We were working when
we were on the ship.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:16.380
This is someone who had a GoPro
that she put on top of a kite--

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.190
because of course, there
weren't drones then.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.240
So this was pre-drone,
first, second year of GoPro.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.000
So we were really avant garde.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.850
And so she was sailing
the kite above and doing

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.350
these really cool imaging.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.800
And she was doing a
lot of map projects.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.730
Everybody had their own kind of
work that they were focused on.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.890
And everybody had to
give a presentation

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:46.890
during the evenings.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.130
So each evening there'd
be like three artists.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.830
And this is my roommate
giving a presentation talking

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.460
about her dog.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.580
But she is a fantastic artist.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.450
Her work is quilts
made out of wood that

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.890
are taken from Hurricane Sandy.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.240
And so she breaks them up
and makes them into quilts.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.407
So really interesting stuff.

00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:10.860
She collected garbage that
was on the shore, which

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.810
unfortunately there
was quite a lot,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:18.450
because where we were in
Svalbard was on the route of--

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.740
we were from Russia.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.840
We'd get Russian garbage
was where there's

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.760
the stream of water came from.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.950
And nets, too.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.710
Every time we got off
the boat, somebody

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.280
would take a trip
in that zodiac--

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.030
that's the pack ice
right in front of you.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.730
That means the ice
that's breaking there.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.320
We'd take a trip on the zodiac.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.800
And they would go and
they would look and do

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.308
a tour of the area that
we were going to be.

00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:44.850
And the reason they
needed to do this

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.545
was to see if it
was polar bear free.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.050
The dog was a new
addition to the tour.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.180
They had never had a dog before.

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.993
I can't tell you
how thrilled I was

00:13:55.993 --> 00:13:57.660
that this dog was on
the tour, because I

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.530
knew the dog could smell a
bear before we could see it.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.930
I have never felt more
urban than when we

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.640
were talking about polar bears.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.230
You can't walk
anywhere in Svalbard

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.450
without a guide with a gun.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.070
Get onto shore.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.630
These are the rifles.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.830
They'd gather us all together.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.940
So maybe four or five trips on
this zodiac from the boat once

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.590
everything was clear.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.820
Get onto the shore.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.510
We'd get our sort of water gear
off and get our work gear on.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.790
And they'd say, OK,
everybody stand around.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.620
We're loading the guns.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.630
The bullets are this big.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.580
And they said, you don't get
two shots with a polar bear.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.440
No polar bears were hurt.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.640
That's always a big fear.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:47.640
But they are absolutely
terrifying because, you know,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.140
one shot-- you have to get that
shot right with a polar bear.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.970
So the dog, I stuck
to the dog like glue.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.300
I was like, Nemo is my hero.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.860
So then when we
were there, we were

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.640
in this triangulated space,
generally on the shore,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.400
where on each point
of the triangle

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.980
would be someone with a gun.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.443
Sometimes we would take hikes.

00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:15.360
There would be a guide
at the front with a gun

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.730
and a guide at the
back with the gun.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.370
And I would never go on
the hike unless the dog

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.070
was going, because the dog
didn't go on every hike.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.410
People would always
say, you're so

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.930
brave to have gone
to Antarctica.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.080
That was no fear.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.280
This was fear, but
made it through it.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.820
So here's my feelings
about polar bears.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.520
So this is a polar bear from
the distance, you can see.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.177
He's kind of far off.

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:44.010
We were on the boat.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.500
Whenever we saw the polar
bears, we were on the boat.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.630
That just was how
it worked for us.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.030
I was thrilled about that.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.290
This is a polar bear.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.790
We had just gotten
back on the boat.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.200
The polar bear was sniffing
around where we had just been.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.140
I was like-- everybody's
like, polar bear!

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.070
Oh, god.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.350
But I did want to do
some stuff with my art,

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.090
as opposed to just fear.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.780
This is arctic ice,
to some extent,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.720
every place you go
with this kind of ice

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.180
is going to have different ice.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:23.160
In the Arctic, the jade ice is
because moss and green things

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.480
have been frozen.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.470
And then 10,000 years
later, that's what's left.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.850
So jade ice is--

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.290
and then you can see those
sort of brown or red stripes.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.920
That's iron in the soil.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.960
That's called glass ice.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.860
Glass ice occurs when
an iceberg has flipped.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.180
So this is a very recent flipped
iceberg, because you get that--

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.030
you have an ice
cube in your water,

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.490
the part that's
under water is clear.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.590
The part that's on top
is somewhat oxidized

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.863
and has that kind of
white burnished bit.

00:16:55.863 --> 00:16:57.780
And that's what happens
when an iceberg flips,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.400
is you get the clear part up.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.790
And you can see it's starting
to turn white at the top.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.170
Those stripes are
due to layers of soot

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.480
that came on top
of dirt or whatever

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.150
blew onto the
glacier, frozen in,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.030
and then 10,000 years later
that's how you get a stripe.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.240
And that's the beginning
of that on the left

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.890
is moss freezing inside of ice,
just right in front of my face.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.510
Obviously, that's not
ready to be an iceberg,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.570
but that's the beginning
of the process.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.790
The next two pictures are
interesting because they're

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.680
both taken with color film.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.890
This is within a day or two.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.000
The left you can see
at the very edge,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.340
you can see the
blue a little bit.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.020
There's a color--
it's a color picture

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.220
of the crazy
formations in the rock

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.570
and the glaciers
areas in Svalbard.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.380
Svalbard is a newer
earth formation

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.850
compared to Antarctica.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.810
And so Antarctica
has much, much,

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.340
much more in terms
of heavy glaciers

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.450
because they're so big.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.120
They've been there
for a long time.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.820
In a way, it's more like
Iceland, up near Svalbard,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.250
which is Iceland being
a volcanic island.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.960
This is just a sunset, you know.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.880
You look for one
minute, it's there,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.880
and the next minute, it's gone.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.270
As we were in September, we
were heading towards October,

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.750
the beginning of November,
maybe 10th of November,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.350
there's no more light.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.500
So the days are getting
much, much, much shorter.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.240
You have a sunrise.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.190
Five hours later, sunset.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.260
You never have high noon.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.540
It just is, like, up, down.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.420
And it's always this
really weak light.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.790
You know, it's never
really super sunny.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.110
And when you do
see the sun, you're

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.440
just like, oh, there it is.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.260
There was life in the
Arctic, unlike in Antarctica.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.750
You did see penguins
and you'd see birds.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.823
But the Arctic has
a lot of mammals,

00:18:53.823 --> 00:18:54.990
as we know from polar bears.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.820
And there's whales.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.970
And these are reindeer.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.640
We were actually on a
hike there with Nemo.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.970
And the reindeer didn't
come anywhere near us.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.600
We had some Canadians
on the trip.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.700
And the Canadians said, if you
hold your hands up like this,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.340
the reindeer have
terrible eyesight,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.610
and they will come to
see if you are reindeer.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.490
And I was like,
this is so stupid.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.150
So there's maybe eight
or 10 of us going--

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.940
I'm telling you, they
came right up to us.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.230
It was like, whoa,
here comes a reindeer.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.870
And they were totally fine.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.940
They weren't interested
in us, really.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.470
And then this is
the big city called

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.660
Longyearbyen on Svalbard.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.460
And you can see
it's not a big city.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.300
There is a university
there, though.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.200
And there are people who
live there all year round.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.025
There are schools for
kids, because there

00:19:49.025 --> 00:19:51.610
are professors and people who
live there all year round.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:57.020
The children in the schools,
they have a play area.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.602
At the play area they go out in
their very, very bright vests.

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:03.810
Remember that part of the
time they're going out it's

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.830
totally dark.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.990
They have lights on their vests.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.080
And there's always
someone with a gun.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.340
They count them coming in.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.380
They count them going--

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.700
you know coming out,
they count them going in.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.650
Because you just don't want to
lose a child to a polar bear.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.490
That's a painting of some of
that same earth formation.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.070
To the left, this is an
abandoned whaling station

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.270
in the Arctic.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.720
They don't have any buildings
really left in the Arctic.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.710
And that's because,
for the most part,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.920
they're still whaling
in the Arctic.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.315
And they whale on factory ships.

00:20:37.315 --> 00:20:38.940
So anything that
would have been there,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.390
would have moved off into
something that they could use.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.630
But this is moss that's
growing in the area that

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.340
was a whaling station.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.590
And the moss we weren't
allowed to get close to it.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.060
You could not touch it.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.880
It was about 50
years old this moss,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.830
and it grows on the oil that
is spilt from the whales.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.780
So it's this crazy--

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.270
grows tiny, tiny amounts,
so there must just

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.420
be tons of it in the soil,
because it grows just

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.860
based on that.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.280
There is the painting
of the moss in the ice,

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.780
another one of the formation,
and then some of the glaciers.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.637
So then the question is,
what did I learn from it?

00:21:21.637 --> 00:21:22.470
What am I doing now?

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.895
This is obviously
a picture of me.

00:21:24.895 --> 00:21:26.520
One of the things
about being an artist

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.040
is you could get a degree,
but it doesn't really

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.640
mean you're an artist.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.160
You kind of just
have to say you're

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.170
an artist to be an artist.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.430
And that's it.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.010
And then people believe you.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.790
And so, one of the
things on the trip, I

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.710
was feeling very self-conscious.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.930
I felt like, well, I haven't
been doing it this long,

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.430
and there are people
here whose work

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.240
is in museums,
who teach college,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.530
who are retired artists.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.880
I mean, there were some
famous artists on the trip.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.960
And I thought, I should just
kind of keep my mouth shut.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.910
And they were
really encouraging.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.130
And one of the things
they talked about

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.730
is permission, permission to
say I'm going to try this.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.180
I'm going to do
something different.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.130
And it doesn't matter,
because I'm an artist,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.420
and I can try and do that.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.030
And it's just sort of
owning that word, which

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.930
is the own your artist self.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.250
Practice.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.730
This is something that
pretty much everybody knows,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:31.610
that you do a little bit
all the time and it adds up.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.900
You have to just keep at it.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.600
And a lot of artists go and
they just work and maybe they're

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.090
not doing something
that's focused

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.970
on what their show might
be or what they're teaching

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.730
or whatever.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:51.300
But it's just always sort
of fueling that artist head.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.940
And you just have
to keep working.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.760
Small steps add up.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.680
You just do a little
bit all the time.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.500
Walking into your
studio, do a little bit,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.360
walk out, walk back in.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.920
It just does add up.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.420
And I found that
communicating through a blog

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.240
and then doing writing was
actually really helpful,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.960
because a lot of putting
your art out there

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.120
is about sort of
being able to say,

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.720
this is what this package
is, and this is why

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.590
you might be interested in it.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:29.340
A lot of times, I'd say that
artists don't feel comfortable

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.220
writing about their work or
talking about their work.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.680
And I obviously don't
have any problem about it,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.570
but that is a really
important part

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.220
of being able to share
your work with the world.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.280
There's nobody who's-- or the
person who is being discovered

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.645
by Instagram with no
other explanation is rare.

00:23:50.645 --> 00:23:52.770
You're going to have to
sort of talk about yourself

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.000
a little bit or your work.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.860
So now it's 5 and
1/2 years later

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.740
and I'm still processing
what I've learned there.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.420
I'm still a full time mom.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.140
I still have my kid at home,
for another four or five months,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.170
but--

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.540
and that is something
to try and balance that.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.500
There's no question
that that's tough.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.460
I have not been able to
travel as much as I wanted.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.430
It was actually a very
difficult thing for my son,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.850
for me to be gone a month.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.220
He had started a new school
and that was the first four

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.390
weeks of his new school.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.490
And we really paid for that.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.980
I had to come back and
be not just full time

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.670
mom, I had to be 110%
mom, and then maybe I

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.230
could do some art on the side.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.690
And you just have to find
which weeks you can do which.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.920
And we didn't get
to travel as much--

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.650
I've been to Iceland
since I got back,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.810
but that's the only
place I've been to since.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.750
And so I started
taking photographs

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.390
of winters in Boston,
some of the ice formations

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.580
here, and doing some
more abstract pieces.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.670
And I'll show you a few of them.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.840
I have new surfaces.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.860
You can see over there
that square piece is

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.510
on something called clayboard.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.460
It's actually not
made for watercolor.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.770
Everything I work
on is watercolor.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.220
And that's because I like
to use water to paint water,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.320
and also I really feel
that ecologically, it's

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.750
the best paint for me to use.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.800
You don't use a lot.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.360
You don't waste a lot.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.140
And it is dissolvable.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.930
So by using that surface, it
does something very different

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.800
than the surface next to it,
which is traditional paper.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.060
So I'm working on
different sizes.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.630
I have some 5 feet
by 5 feet pieces.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.130
And that's unusual
for watercolor.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.510
And this is part of that
whole thing of permission.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.570
I'd just like-- let's try this.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.650
And then I'm just doing small
steps, bits and bits and bits.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.600
A year and a half
after I got back,

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.470
I was asked to write an
article for "The New York

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:03.660
Times," for the travel section,
about being on a cruise ship,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.780
because my cruise ship was a
different kind of cruise ship.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:14.310
And I was amazed to get a full
page in the travel section.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.820
As a New Yorker, my father
opened it and it was--

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.980
I had just won the
Oscar, you know.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.380
That was it, to be in
"The New York Times."

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.480
But it's a game changer.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.652
People still remember
this article.

00:26:26.652 --> 00:26:27.360
They talk to me--

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.010
I still get responses from it.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:32.850
It is still clicked on on
"The New York Times" website.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.140
It's just astonishing.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:38.820
And so I have a copy of it
there because I milk it for all

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.470
it's worth.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:45.600
But this is my son looking at
me thinking, you are not famous.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.280
But the day, literally the
day that came out on paper--

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.390
because it was out online on a
Friday, the Sunday morning it

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.830
was out someone
emailed me and bought

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.860
one of the paintings
that was in the article.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.050
And here's a funny thing
about being an artist,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.350
the first thing they said is,
will you give me a discount?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.220
And because I didn't
speak to them in person--

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.470
I hadn't sold that
much at that point,

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.770
and we have always been
told, don't give discounts,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.450
don't give discounts--

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:25.180
because I was not speaking
to them in person, I said no.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.360
And I was like, I just blew it.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.090
Sent the email.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.930
I mean, right back, OK.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.000
And it's funny because
all of a sudden I

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.890
was in a different level.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:39.390
Like, I just didn't
realize that.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.160
But by being in "The
New York Times,"

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.130
it's like you get to call
the shots a bit more.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.097
So that was very
exciting for me.

00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:48.180
So now here's some photos.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.720
That's top left is a photo
of Spy Pond in Arlington

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.130
this year.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.280
In December-- actually,
it was last year--

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.220
in December when it was
so cold and the bubbles

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.240
had frozen in the pond.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.950
The photo on the
bottom right is a photo

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.300
I took while walking the dog.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.250
That's in Stony
Brook reservation.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.700
Just an ice formation
on the ground.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:22.020
It's amazing to see what you see
with ice in every place that's

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.970
different.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.160
So that's near.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.300
This is far.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.960
That's Iceland on the top here.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.050
You have these black
stripes in the ice.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.180
Again, the ice is
different in Iceland,

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.800
and that's because
of the volcanoes.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.140
So the ash lands on
the ice, freezes,

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.550
and then 10 years later,
20 years later, you know,

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.050
it's covered in snow.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:51.540
And then as it comes off of
the glacier, flips, it goes up,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.200
obviously the volcano didn't
make the stripes that way.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.190
But the iceberg is
flipped on its side.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.660
And then this is just amazing
to be living in this time

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.970
where we can see ice on Mars.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.600
That's ice on Mars
from a photo from NASA.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.680
I have sent the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory some of my paintings

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.510
and they are rock stars.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.590
They tweeted it all over the
place, which was really cool.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.310
I'm a bit of a NASA geek,
so it was fantastic.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.600
Isn't that amazing
that we can see that?

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.140
So that is not my photo.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.840
I've been asked that,
as well, by kids,

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.300
if I was the first
woman in Antarctica

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.500
and if I took the
pictures of Mars.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.070
So neither of us do.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.080
But those are both
public domain.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.340
Because of NASA, we own those.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.620
The next thing is
the final slide.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.215
And I just-- this is me
swimming in the Arctic.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.850
This is the only
place we could go

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.530
where there were no polar bears,
because polar bears can swim.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:03.365
The dog did the
tour of the beach,

00:30:03.365 --> 00:30:04.490
making sure there were no--

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.940
but there was a town on one side
and the dock on the other side.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.300
The point was we were
going to go in, take a dip,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:15.530
and then run back out, wash on
the boat, you know, hot water.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:20.840
So I went in and I
said, it's like Maine.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.800
It's not bad.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.923
Maine in April, right?

00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:25.090
I was in for about a second.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.680
Then I was like,
oh, it's so bad.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.552
I ran out.

00:30:29.552 --> 00:30:31.010
My roommate was
right on the beach.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.030
She didn't want to go.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.460
And she wrapped me in a towel.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.970
And ran up to the thing.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.640
And to this day, I
still have a little bit

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.100
of frostbite in my fingers
when it's really, really cold.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.030
I always have to wear gloves.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:46.910
But I encourage you to be
brave, even if it's stupid.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.060
That's it.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.628
So does anybody
have any questions?

00:30:50.628 --> 00:30:53.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.580
Thank you.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.830
Any questions about anything?

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.280
AUDIENCE: Have you found
that your perception of color

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.645
in your day-to-day life has
changed since your trips

00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:09.030
to the Arctic and Antarctic?

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.390
LISA GOREN: Yes, definitely,
because I look at color more.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.430
I would say I brought--

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.860
because I bought film
to the Antarctic,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.450
I brought a roll
of black and white.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.570
I was going to be all Ansel
Adams, you know, fantastic.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:24.600
It was the worst roll I
took, because there are so

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.380
many colors there.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.170
And it really opened my
eyes to seeing things.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.290
And so now I see a lot,
especially in the winter

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.990
here, because I
don't particularly

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.580
enjoy the summers here.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.780
Winter is my season.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.055
And people often see the winter
as kind of boring and white

00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:41.820
and dead.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.870
And there's just so much color
in the snow and on the ground

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.770
and in the leaves and with
the evergreens, obviously.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.510
So I do see more.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.880
I would say it's not so
much about the trip--

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.270
although that opened my
eyes to some extent--

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.178
it's that I look at color
more as I paint more,

00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:01.470
if you think about it that way.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.310
I'd say that may have had
more of an effect on it.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.110
I mean, I do love color.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.370
And I'm glad that there's
color in all the places I love.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.722
Anybody else?

00:32:15.722 --> 00:32:18.180
AUDIENCE: What happens if you
touch the scary whale blubber

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.117
moss?

00:32:19.117 --> 00:32:20.700
LISA GOREN: Traveling
to these places,

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.890
you have to be respectful.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:26.685
This is not-- there's
nobody who's going to say--

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.430
well, I mean, people
who were the tour guides

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.630
would have said something.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.880
They said, you
can't go over there.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.750
But you go on to a trip like
this with the understanding

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.970
that you respect that
this is part of our planet

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.230
that we want to preserve.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.620
If everybody took a piece of
that moss, it would be gone.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.660
And the same is true
with those whale bones.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.200
I was interviewed by a woman
who said, did you take one home?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.700
And I was like,
first of all, do you

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.810
understand the size
of a blue whale?

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:58.890
But it's illegal.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.820
You cannot bring that--

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:08.190
I'm not 100% sure
of the actual laws

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:13.170
in terms of bringing pieces of
mammal stuff into the states.

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.710
But there's definitely
restrictions. .

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.800
And I think anytime you
go to a place that's

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.320
a nature preserve,
that's what these are.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.260
You have to act respectful.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:30.490
We did have one artist who
painted some of the rocks.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.080
And he was really yelled
at by the tour guides.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.050
And they were like,
you have to clean that.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.420
And it's already disturbed then.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.060
So you know, it isn't
a silly question.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:49.990
It's more about, we're not just
there to put our stamp on it.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.240
Yeah.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.650
Anyone else?

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.790
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank
you for the talk.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.190
So, you mentioned the garbage.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.710
Where is this
garbage coming from?

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.350
From the sea?

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.330
LISA GOREN: The garbage
that was collected was--

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.740
there's all sorts of currents.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.630
So wherever the
current comes from

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.489
is where the garbage
will flow from.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.800
Because we're so far
north in Svalbard,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.330
we were near the Russian coast.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.800
And I can pull up that map
if you want to see that.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.530
So they were fishing villages up
there and mining camps up there

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.440
and boats, cold water fishing.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.960
So there would be nets.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.409
I mean, we found a
sneaker, you know--

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:41.190
and things take a long
time to degrade there,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:43.650
even longer than when it's hot.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.570
Because when it's hot,
you do have the bugs.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.510
You do have more animals
that would decompose

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.460
what you could decompose.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.040
I think the worst part
of it is the nets,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:58.710
because those are the things
that whales and other mammals

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.530
that need to breathe in the
water-- and fish in general--

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.730
they get caught.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.710
And that's sad and horrible.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:11.530
But it was coming from Russia,
from that kind of thing.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.040
Some days we didn't see any.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.090
But if you think about
even the coast here,

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.380
we get currents from the north.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.170
They come down.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:24.140
So we get garbage from there.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.780
Yeah.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.560
OK, no problem.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.747
Anybody else?

00:35:26.747 --> 00:35:28.830
AUDIENCE: So I'm always
trying to find new places.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.413
And one of the places-- you also
said you like the cold a lot.

00:35:31.413 --> 00:35:34.170
So you must have a list of
places for five years and all

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.620
that, some non-standard
places, like Northern Quebec

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.650
is on my list.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.042
Do you have stuff like
that on your list?

00:35:41.042 --> 00:35:43.500
LISA GOREN: Well, the place
I'd really like to go right now

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.420
is Greenland.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:52.460
Greenland is just beginning
to get on tourist's radars.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.500
And part of it is
because of the melting.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.440
And people want to see it.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.800
But the glaciers in
Greenland are amazing.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.710
I've flown over them
in the daylight.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.720
And you can see the
glacier movement--

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.510
a glacier is a frozen river.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.610
And so it's always moving.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.020
And even though
it's small amounts--

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:18.160
so you can see the
motion from the plane.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.000
I can't wait to go to Greenland.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.180
But it's expensive.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.770
All of these island places--

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.540
Iceland is expensive.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.850
Places where they don't grow
a lot of their own food.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.700
Alaska can be expensive.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.160
But Greenland would
be my first place.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.040
Iceland, anybody who
talks to me about Iceland,

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.240
that's an amazing place.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.530
There's so much in Iceland.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.640
There's lava.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.690
There's hot springs.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.570
But there's glaciers and
there's-- you can swim

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:48.490
in the water, the
hot waters as well.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:49.840
And it's so close.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.160
That's the other thing.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.530
Iceland is a very
tourist-friendly place.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.020
They all speak English.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.440
After Greenland, I'd love
to go back to Antarctica.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.682
But it's a really
long trip, you know.

00:37:01.682 --> 00:37:02.390
That's the thing.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.960
And expensive, also.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.800
I've talked to
people about trying

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.860
to be an artist in
residence on a tour boat,

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:14.250
you know, something like that,
to kind of mitigate the cost.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.000
And again, I don't
mind talking to people,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.880
so I'm fine with that.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.790
But that would be top
of the line there.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:23.860
Yeah.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.820
Anyone else?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.590
AUDIENCE: I was just curious if
you had any big travel plans--

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:32.438
I guess you just got back--
but if you have any new travel

00:37:32.438 --> 00:37:34.760
plans for--

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.270
it sounded like your kid was
going to move out of the house.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.937
LISA GOREN: Yes.

00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:44.110
Once he's gone,
that's when I can--

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.320
I've started applying for
grants to go to places

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.970
like Greenland and Iceland.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.670
There are a lot of artists
residences on Iceland.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.700
But they're mostly inland.

00:37:56.278 --> 00:37:57.820
And I really want
to be on the shore.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:04.240
But yeah, again, you know,
I'll start applying--

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.000
I could never go
back to Antarctica.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.860
I went before he was born and
that is during the school year.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.020
So unless you're in
Australia or something

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.960
where the school
year is different,

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.120
it would be impossible.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.550
And like I said, it really
took a hit on the family.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:26.582
I would say just
pulling him back

00:38:26.582 --> 00:38:28.040
from what was a
really tough time--

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040
I mean, to be honest,
it sucks to be

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.040
12, right, in a new school.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.300
And then it's not helpful
if your parents are kind of

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.640
trying to figure out
what's going on for a month

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.960
during that time.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.140
So, yes, once he's
gone, see you.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:54.510
But people often ask me what
people wore or ate on the ship.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.610
Does anybody want to know that?

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.350
I always get asked that.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.980
The ship had to have
two weeks worth of food.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.630
There was no place to stop.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:08.290
And so we had these
huge freezers.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.660
And the fresh fruit
was like really,

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.670
really-- they had been
refrigerated pears,

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.440
refrigerated apples,
stuff with that.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.260
But we had a lot of
fish and a lot of stuff

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.970
that you could freeze.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.280
In terms of clothing,
it was all the same

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.320
that what you would
wear in February here.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.990
But the one thing
on this ship is

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.500
that because it was almost
all women in this group,

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.710
they did not buy
enough toilet paper.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:38.590
So my roommate [? Nai-- ?] we're
both from the New York area--

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.430
we're not-- we were
like, we're taking it.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.570
I don't care.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.690
We put on our best New York
thug attitude, so to speak.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.800
And we would sneak in
to the group bathroom

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.560
and steal rolls before--

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.480
and then we arrived at
this one store, the most

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.270
northernmost store, and they
bought a ton of toilet paper.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.990
But it was like, the things that
they can't prepare for, you're

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.630
in trouble when you're on that.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.210
So you were going
to have a question?

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:09.710
Yeah.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.168
AUDIENCE: Unrelated question,
though, if you wouldn't mind.

00:40:12.168 --> 00:40:13.450
You were on a tall ship.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:14.158
Did you sail?

00:40:14.158 --> 00:40:14.950
LISA GOREN: We did.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.420
We did.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.678
It was a barquentine.

00:40:18.678 --> 00:40:20.470
I don't know if that
means anything to you.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.860
There were times when
we were under full sail.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:33.070
But for much of the
time, it was combined.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.360
But yes, we were
often used to help

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.420
pull the sails up, pull them
down, wrap them up, whatever.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.220
There was a point
when we were sailing

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.880
and it was really rough.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.500
And they said you
have to be below.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.120
And we were like, OK.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.802
And I don't particularly
get seasick,

00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:50.760
so that was no problem.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.740
There were people in
other rooms who were just

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.300
tossing their cookies.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.430
But me and my
roommate were fine.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.620
And we've just-- just
going like this, like this.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.370
And I was so proud.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.720
I was like, look at us
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.830
You know, because I'm
all like, Shackleton.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:12.600
And we get out and I realize
we were in, like, a fjord.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.330
It was nothing.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.830
So I was like, oh, we
don't know anything.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.930
It was rough.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.070
But don't think we had any kind
of experience of that really

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:27.360
rough weather, although
in the Antarctic,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.370
a storm was chasing us.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.190
So as we went down, there
was a storm behind us.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.560
You could only get
off the boat if it was

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.400
less than 35 knots, the wind.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.020
And we got off the
boat every day,

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.430
two or three times every day.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.793
The boat that was
behind us never got off.

00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:45.210
They could never
get off the boat.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.620
So you never know
what's going to happen

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.703
when you go to Antarctica.

00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:51.150
But when we came back, we
went into the teeth of it.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.490
And we got hit by
a rogue wave, which

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.320
stove the side of the boat in.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.690
It wasn't a sailboat.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.280
And I was in the cheap seats.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.108
I was in the bottom
of the boat because I

00:42:01.108 --> 00:42:02.400
couldn't afford more than that.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.900
The people who had paid a lot
of money where they could have

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.720
like a balcony here,
so it was like this.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.640
So this part doesn't
move as much.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.900
So I didn't really know.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.280
I didn't even feel it.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.720
I was like, whatever.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.167
And then we went up.

00:42:14.167 --> 00:42:15.250
And I was like, oh my god.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.910
The whole side of the
boat is, like, punched in.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.280
And they had to change
course, because we

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.680
can't keep going into this.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.200
They said, oh, yeah,
we'll fix it in a day.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.180
Happens all the time.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.640
And there was going to be
another tour group leaving--

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.760
like we get off on Saturday,
they leave on Sunday.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.030
They said, oh yeah,
we'll be ready for that.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.295
Yeah, it was-- they're used
to a very different scale

00:42:37.295 --> 00:42:39.373
of those things.

00:42:39.373 --> 00:42:40.790
AUDIENCE: Last
question, at night,

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.605
we have so much light here.

00:42:42.605 --> 00:42:44.230
What were the stars like?

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.190
Was it amazing?

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.440
LISA GOREN: They were amazing.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.090
It's cold at night.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.160
When the sun is down,
it's really cold.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:53.550
And so you have a lot of tears.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.900
And I wear glasses.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.860
So it's not as easy.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.620
But I would say probably
one of the first times

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.190
I've ever seen the Milky Way.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.020
I don't see that
in New York here.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.360
I have no experience with it.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.750
And so they were amazing,
but I couldn't see them

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.340
all the time that well.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.200
We did see tiny bit
of northern lights,

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.660
but they were to the south
of us, just a little bit.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.382
It's very hallucinogenic
in that kind of thing

00:43:22.382 --> 00:43:24.840
where you just see this tiny
bit of green, and you're like,

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.650
is that real?

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:28.270
And you're tearing that
amount of time, too.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:29.630
So it's like, what's real?

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.680
What am I imagining?

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.736
So kind of cool, but
also a little bit weird.

00:43:36.736 --> 00:43:37.704
Anybody else?

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.080
Thank you so much
for listening to me.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.430
[APPLAUSE]
