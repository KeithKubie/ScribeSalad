00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.570
 this capsule have another network 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.910
 dynamic beziers 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.960
 the dynamical model bégin network of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 markov then hide in a model of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.599
 markov hide or and black like 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 bordeaux and jamel or h and even in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 English I will often used 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.869
 the acronym h and even to talk about 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 markov so hiding in a model of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.470
 markov hide we are going to have 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 unlike the markov chain of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 hidden variables in addition to observations 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.399
 so is the two variables these two 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.030
 random variables there are going to be 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.200
 discreet and this is what characterizes in 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.850
 troll the hmm ie in the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 general case we had variables 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 hidden excited and variables 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.550
 of observation purchased agrees to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.469
 buy but I t have as long as general ex 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.289
 and an overall sound of several 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.010
 variables with different domains 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.820
 in a hlm phoenix t it corresponds in 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.470
 made to buy and correspond to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.659
 prompt and so we have variables 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.869
 hidden and observation variables 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.140
 which are specifically discrete 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 we will see a chain of markov often 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.180
 of the first order that will determine the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.720
 distribution of hidden variables and this 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 who will be observed here will spend 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.930
 the equivalent of symbols that are going to be 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.689
 issued from hidden variables 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 buy so the is quoted actually go 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.850
 in the generative history of the model 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 so in the graphical model are going 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 depend directly on the variables 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.880
 hidden buy in the graphic template 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.979
 so that would mean that as we have 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.860
 seen previously one could model a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.869
 string with a string of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.939
 markov rus now we could 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.730
 suppose that in a string of characters 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.190
 hidden that might be the word 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:12.150
 the word that a person wants to write so 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 words that you want to write weighing on a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.020
 keyboard so and instead we what 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.760
 observe office is the written word 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.110
 maybe with spelling errors 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.820
 or with wii so grammar hours 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 anything so what would be 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.730
 hid her sister all of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.690
 characters that form the word that that the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.490
 nobody wanted to write 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 we observe rather the characters 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.740
 that have been typed is an application 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 that would be to infer from twins 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.920
 which was written that she was the word that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.600
 the person really wanted to write with 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.600
 possibly the good art hogan 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.150
 here is the graphic illustration of hm 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.630
 then we note initial distribution on 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.060
 the first and to hide h1 from his 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.690
 ax have it we assume that from 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.900
 zoning generates the first observation 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.870
 for the first moment then this is 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.680
 from there also we will generate 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.130
 h2 so the description of h2 is going to be 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.190
 conditioned on h1 and from h2o 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.140
 could generate its s it is also 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.410
 we will continue like this and so for all 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.160
 the times you are there for all 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.500
 instants tht will condition the variable 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.770
 is quoted the observation and at the moment t 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.170
 have bought will also conditioned the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.690
 distribution of smallpox hide as much 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.040
 follow to buy more and continue 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.700
 like that until we get to the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.880
 end of the sequence that we are mobilizing 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.020
 is tall and growing here 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.940
 that's the Béziers network 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.200
 the associated Bézian network illustration 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.200
 to hlm 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.910
 now we can write that she is 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.480
 according to this model there the probability of a 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.660
 series of observations s-21 up to grant 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.510
 and a series of state assignments 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.660
 hidden h1 until grown up 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.419
 and as usual it's the product of 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.690
 priorities of each each of the variables 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.639
 random but conditioned on its 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.169
 parents so purchase him no lyrics 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.770
 launched up to enjoy the chain 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.010
 sf1 are not shaven h 20 so the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.750
 policy contains the essence h1h1 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.210
 then happily the t2 redit 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.729
 so if we are above that the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.740
 product for all others and to all 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.310
 the others a stage was equal 2 up 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:52.560
 The probability of buying Sasha 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.490
 milk hide you the moment before and 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.770
 least 1 time also the scope of this 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.580
 which is observed at time t given 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.030
 the hidden state buy so that's the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.650
 definition of our distribution on the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.680
 sequence ds and dh according to the model 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.300
 hmm so here's what we'll have this is 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.389
 once again a distribution 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.169
 initial we will see the arms lity 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.210
 to observe our observations knowing the 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.900
 hiding states so we know actually our 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:33.990
 what was called our model 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.910
 observation the observation and here we have 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.360
 our model of transition between and 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.360
 with seals 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.630
 so what is sometimes called history 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.910
 generative ie how are you this 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.599
 that in this model we assume that our 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.419
 observations were generated so the 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:55.819
 way to generate in the shem m it's going 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.710
 as if we start with so as in 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:01.160
 any network beziers we start with 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.919
 ancestors that a year and then from 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.720
 its above the arrows for one generates 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:10.490
 all the other descendants of the ancestors 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.800
 so in this case also the only one at 700 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.270
 by ach 1 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.599
 so see champion is worth 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.110
 small h 1 of the distribution a priori 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:24.440
 p2h 1 and then his calf was stiff 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.860
 is equal 2 until grant is unfortunately for 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.800
 every moment we will exchange give the 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.099
 value for now 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.360
 follow to buy from the value 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.849
 from the value that we are champion 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.159
 and for the previous hidden state and then 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:43.069
 to buy that we sampled 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:44.570
 called little buy well there being 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:48.620
 given that we want a champion and a 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.449
 observation so an assignment of the 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.159
 random variable is quoted for the same 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.289
 moment t and continue like this 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.820
 until the end 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.870
 the other valid way champions and 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.560
 in fact it would have been to do 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.090
 sampling of all 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.240
 hidden variables so 2h 1 up 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.039
 buy 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.690
 so we had champion is hashed in 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.930
 first then his ax two so much 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.240
 from years h to 2 h 3 and in energy and a 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.159
 site up to buy then from that 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.139
 we would have one more time and terry in 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.409
 galas 1 until grown up for one has 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.030
 wandered sampled all s1 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.509
 until assist and everyone and 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.669
 sampled only from 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:31.310
 their hidden variables associated with 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.569
 buy so that's another way of 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.630
 championship so we really see that 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:37.039
 it's a process where we have process 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.830
 stochastic on something that is 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.449
 hidden and we at every moment t one to 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.720
 an observation that can be seen as 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:46.670
 a kind of raw observation and / or 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.490
 who gives the information but who is not 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:52.850
 perfect sure she was possibly 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:58.490
 the value of the hidden state to each of 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:01.330
 instants finally here we have a 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:05.030
 more illustration in the form of a 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.100
 automaton finished but where in this case we 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.650
 again circles here 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.270
 correspond to the different states of the 

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:16.280
 hidden value so here here we'll assume 

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:22.730
 that the htc take a value that is 

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:25.850
 the symbol yj or like and so the 

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.530
 stochastic process associated with 

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.840
 sampling in a hlm is going 

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.670
 match to walk between the 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.010
 states possible according to the probabilities 

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:37.060
 transitions that correspond to 

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:39.169
 transition model of our model hm 

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.240
 is also every time we go 

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:45.250
 reach 1 and in cash and we're all going from 

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:48.740
 following and m a symbol from the model 

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:51.589
 of the observation model in this if the 

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.550
 observation model this has occurred 

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:59.570
 and here also that each bought is equal to 

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.320
 the probability that st is equal to o that 

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.780
 will be points 1 

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.880
 the probability is and be equal to besson 

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.750
 will be points 3 the part of ikea cited 

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.760
 equal to 6 or 2.6 and so buy 

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:13.430
 is equal to as when if the part 

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.640
 to observe at this is going to be beautiful his widow and 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:19.010
 7.2 institute for all the details so 

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.690
 that's one it's not an observation 

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.690
 a visualization to match 

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.900
 obediences and an associated visualization 

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:29.089
 to a finite automaton and again I 

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.710
 the world because sometimes in the 

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:33.110
 literature when reading articles 

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.850
 it is under this representation that we 

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.470
 going to represent cow is even rather than 

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.940
 in the form of bezier network where the 

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.080
 are random variables 

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.210
 rather than being values ​​of 

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.890
 two of the possible tops for 

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.580
 hidden variables and variables to 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.580
 observe here
