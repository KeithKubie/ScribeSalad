00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.940
- [Instructor] In the last few videos,

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.370
we were studying our watch factory,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.950
ABC Watch Factory.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.490
And based on some data, knowing what our

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520
fixed costs are, our labor units,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.570
our variable costs, our total costs,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.943
and then our total
output, and that would be

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:17.020
for for different amounts of labor,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.810
we were able to calculate
marginal product of labor,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.360
marginal costs, average variable cost,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.810
average fixed cost,
and average total cost.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.380
What we're gonna do in
this video is start to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.900
explore how these various calculations

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.560
will change, and
eventually, how these curves

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.560
will change based on changes
in cost and productivity.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.610
So let's say our rent has
gone up by $2000 a month,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.830
and we have to pay that extra rent

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.470
regardless of what our output is.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.540
So what is that going to do
to marginal product of labor,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.490
marginal costs, average variable cost,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.930
average fixed cost,
and average total cost?

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930
Pause this video and think about what's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.550
going to happen before
we actually model it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700
in this spreadsheet by
raising our fixed costs,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030
our monthly fixed costs.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.930
So we are going to go from $5000 a month

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.110
of fixed costs to $7000
a month of fixed costs.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.310
So it's gonna be $7000,
but we're not done yet.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.260
We want to scroll all the way down.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.980
And so, what changed
from what I had before?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.950
Well if you were paying close attention,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.070
your marginal product
of labor hasn't changed,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.180
your marginal cost hasn't changed,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.670
your average variable cost hasn't changed,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.650
your average fixed and
average total cost did change.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.510
And that should, hopefully,
make intuitive sense.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.690
If you look at the
formulas for these things,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.850
for example, the marginal
product of labor,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.480
you would see that it
involves total output

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.430
and the labor units.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.290
It doesn't involve the fixed costs at all.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.450
So if the fixed costs
change, you wouldn't expect

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.290
our marginal product of labor to change.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.500
When you look at marginal costs,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
you are involving total costs.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.460
And you say hey, isn't fixed costs

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.430
part of total costs?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.330
But remember, fixed cost is, the $7000

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.100
is part of the $13000, and it's part of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.570
this $9000 right over here.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.390
So when you take the
$13000 minus the $9000,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.230
which we do in the
numerator right over here,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.130
we're doing our change in total costs

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.900
over our change in output,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
those two $7000 cancel out.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.510
The fixed costs cancel out,
and so your marginal costs

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.453
is not dependent on your fixed costs.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.550
Similarly, your variable
costs is separate,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.200
you can view in a lot of
ways, from your fixed costs.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.210
So your average variable
costs aren't going to be

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.450
affected by fixed costs.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.010
And, of course, you would expect your

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.220
average fixed costs to change,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.770
because that is directly derived

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.710
from your fixed costs and your output.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.306
And then, average total
costs are also derived

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:57.730
from total costs.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.760
It's not a change between total cost,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.940
and that total cost has
the fixed cost in it.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.540
So you might be asking yourself,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.655
well what would change your
marginal product of labor,

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.896
your marginal costs, your
average variable cost,

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:11.672
or your average total cost?

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:15.950
Well, think about a change
in labor productivity.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.950
Let's say that each person,
there's some magical

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.790
new device, or new
process, that allows them

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.750
to be a little bit more productive?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.240
Well then one person,
instead of producing 10,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.690
let's say they now produce 11.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.210
And let's say two people
now, instead of 25,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.660
can now producer 27.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.420
Let's say three people, instead of 45,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.180
can now produce 47.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.830
And now four people, and
I'm making these numbers up,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.620
they can no produce 59.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.210
Lemme say this is 66.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.000
And then let's say that this is 72.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.890
And so notice, that did change

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.840
our marginal product of labor.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.470
And once again, marginal product of labor

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.870
is based on the difference
in total output,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.240
as we have a difference
in our labor units.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.210
And that change in productivity,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.330
it might be more pronounced.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.220
In the way I just happened
to pick the numbers,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.730
it was more pronounced
when you have fewer people,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.810
and then it got more diminished as you had

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.230
more and more people.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.680
But when you had that
change in productivity,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.020
you might have noticed that that changed

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.340
our marginal cost, and that changed

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.070
our average variable cost.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.300
Because, once again, your marginal cost,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.530
if we look at it right over here,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.960
it is calculated by looking at your

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.200
change in total cost,
divided by your change

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.500
in total output.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.260
And when we had this
productivity improvement,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.250
our change in total output improved.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.700
Now there could be a
situation where you have

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.960
a productivity improvement, but the change

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.520
in total output from
one person to the next,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.450
might not change.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.290
So it's not always going to change either

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.500
the marginal product of
labor or the marginal cost.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.510
But changes in productivity will often

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.590
change those two things.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.970
And similarly, if you look at

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.320
your average variable
cost, it is based on your

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.010
variable costs and your output.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.830
When you have this
productivity improvement,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.410
that's going to improve your output

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.200
for any given amount of variable cost.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.320
And so, that's going to have an affect

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.040
on your average variable cost.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.650
And then your average
total cost is, of course,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.400
based in part on your total variable cost,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.240
which is driven by that
productivity improvement.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.610
Similarly, you could have
changes in variable cost.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.720
Let's say all of the people who work

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960
at your factory have
gotten together and say

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.793
we want a raise.

00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:38.920
And you give in, and you give a raise,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.250
well now, instead of $2000 per worker,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.570
it's going to cost $2200 per worker.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.370
You gave a 10% raise per month.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.570
And so let me get that all the way down.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.370
And notice, the things that you would have

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.170
expected to change did change.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.130
Your marginal product
of labor didn't change,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.340
because marginal product of
labor is not driven by cost.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.080
It only looks at the labor
units and the total output.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.280
But your marginal cost did change,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.260
even though our output for every

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.380
incremental person did not change,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.030
because the underlying
cost of the people changed.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.750
Similarly, the average variable cost,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.490
you would of course expect it to change,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.470
'cause our variable
costs all went up by 10%.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.870
Your average fixed cost isn't going to

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.900
be affected, 'cause we changed

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.320
the variable cost, not the fixed.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.840
And the total costs were,
of course, affected,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.373
because the average
variable cost were affected.
