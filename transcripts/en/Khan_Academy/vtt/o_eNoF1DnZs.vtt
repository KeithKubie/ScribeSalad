00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.900
We're on 121.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:19.520
It says, if x/2 is equal to
3/y, is x less than y?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.280
So this is essentially saying
that x times y is equal to 6.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.000
I just cross multiplied.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.110
Or you could do that
step by step.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.380
Multiply both sides by 2.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.740
Then, multiply both
sides by y.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.610
And you get xy is equal to 6.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.920
And they want to know whether
x is less than y.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.545
Statement 1 says, y is greater
than or equal to 3.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.880
If y is greater than or equal
to 3, what does that mean?

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.630
So let's think about this.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.300
x is equal to 6 divided by y.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.710
If y is greater than or equal
to 3-- so if it's 3, that's

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.610
the largest that x
can be if y is 3.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.320
If y is any larger number, then
x will only be smaller.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.780
So x will be less than
or equal to 6/3.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.090
Or x will be less than
or equal to 2.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.220
And just, I want you to
understand why I said that.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.220
Think about this.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.980
It says, y is greater
than or equal to 3.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.170
If y is 3, x is going to be 2.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.370
If y is 4, x is going
to be 1 and 1/2.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.990
If y is 6, x is going to be 1.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.760
So the highest value for x
happens when y is equal to 3.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.920
And then, as y gets larger and
larger, x just gets smaller.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.350
So y being greater than or equal
to 3 says that x is less

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.310
than or equal to 2.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.060
So statement 1, alone, is
sufficient to say that x is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.480
less than y.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.950
If x is less than 2 and y is
greater than 3, then x is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.720
definitely less than y.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.885
Statement 2 tells us, y is
less than or equal to 4.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.990
So this is interesting.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.190
It's really just the inverse of
this statement right here.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.080
Now, you're saying, instead of y
being greater than a certain

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.700
number, y is less than
a certain number.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.210
So if you think about it
this way-- so let's go

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.840
back to this equation.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.480
If y is 4, x is going to be--
let's do a little table.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.400
y, x.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.570
If y is equal to 4,
x is equal to 1.5.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.070
If y is equal to 3,
x is equal to 2.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.780
If y is equal to 2, then
x is equal to 3.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.790
So actually, this constraint,
I can pick a bunch of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.420
different y's that meet
this constraint.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.220
But it still doesn't tell me
about anything whether x is

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.470
greater than or less than y.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.540
Here, x is less than y.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.300
And here, x is greater than y.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.270
So this statement is useless.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.060
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.270
to answer this question.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.660
Statement 2 doesn't
help us much.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.300
122.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.140
If v and w are different
integers, does v equal 0?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.420
Different integers.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.090
Remember, it says, different.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.433
They say that vw is equal
to v squared.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.420
Now, let's think about this.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.280
This doesn't tell me for sure
that v is equal to 0.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.420
And, in fact, as long as-- well,
let's think about this.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.670
The only way that this could be
true is if v is equal to 0,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.490
that's one case.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.770
Now, if v does not equal to 0--
So if v does not equal to

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.760
0, then this case
implies what?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.110
That soon. w equals v.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.680
Think about it.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.430
If v doesn't equal 0, we can
divide both sides by v.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.440
Because we know we're
not dividing by 0.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.270
You divide both sides by
v, you get, on the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.589
left-hand side, w.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.149
Because this v cancels out.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.089
And then v squared divided
by v, you get v.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.330
And so you are left with--

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.710
Well, I want to be careful
here, though.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.770
Because w would have
to equal v.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.690
And they already told
us that w and v are

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.060
two different numbers.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.370
So we know that this situation--
if w equals v,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.340
then v does not equal 0.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.870
But they tell us in the problem
statement that w and v

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.520
are two different integers.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.280
They tell us that w
does not equal v.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.420
So we know that the only way
that this could be satisfied,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.120
if w does not equal v, is
if v is equal to 0.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.780
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.140
to answer this question.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.620
Statement 2.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.170
w is equal to 2.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.830
Well, that doesn't do
anything for me.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.030
I mean w could be 2
and v could be 0.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.990
Or v could be 3.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.150
All they told us was that v and
w are different integers

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.080
and that they don't
equal each other.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.220
So this doesn't help me at all
in determining whether v is

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.810
equal to 0.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.100
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.910
I just want to make sure I got
that first part right.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.290
I mean the only way that this is
true, this is true if v is

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.330
equal to 0.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.220
Or it's true if w
is equal to v.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.940
Either of those cases
are true.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.950
That's the only way it works.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.640
And we know w does
not equal v.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.215
So v has to be equal to 0.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.510
What are we on?

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.680
123.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:15.430
What is the value of 36,500
times 1.05 to the nth power?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.510
All right, statement number 1
tells us, n squared minus 5n

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.730
plus 6 is equal to 0.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.930
So we could solve for n.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.940
There will be two solutions.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.500
So this is n minus 2
times n minus 3.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.220
I just factored it.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.920
I said, what two numbers, when
I multiply them, equal

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.630
positive 6?

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.130
So I said, minus 2, minus 3.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.970
And when you add them
become minus 5.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.065
That's why I picked the minuses,
as opposed to plus 2

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.320
and plus 3 or some other
combination.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.440
Equals 0.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.140
So statement 1 tells us that
n is equal to 2 or

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.020
n is equal to 3.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.890
So statement 1, by itself,
isn't enough.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.530
Because I don't know whether
I should put a

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.680
2 here or a 3 here.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.690
So I can't determine this
value just yet.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:07.630
Statement 2 tells us, n minus
2 does not equal 0.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.730
This statement, by itself,
is fairly useless.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.430
Because it just tells me that
n does not equal 2.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.680
So n could be any
other number.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.150
So I don't know what
number to put here.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.250
But used in conjunction, these
two statements-- statement 1

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.430
says that it is either 2 or 3.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.230
Statement 2 says, well,
it's not 2.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.860
So if you use both of these
together, we know that n is

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.750
equal to 3.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.010
And then we can, obviously,
solve this problem.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.190
Taking 1.05 to the third power
and multiplying by 36,500,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.220
which I won't do because it
would be a waste of time.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.220
124.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.200
In the rectangular
coordinate system

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.212
above-- let me draw that.

00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:51.320
They have the y-axis.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.870
They have the x-axis.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.020
Then, they draw on a triangle.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.540
I'll do that in a
different color.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.140
That and like that.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:14.210
And the letters are
O, P, you and Q.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.000
In the rectangular coordinate
system above, if OP is less

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.260
than PQ-- so OP is
less than PQ.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.130
Let me write that down.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.850
OP is less than PQ.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.100
Is the area of OPQ
greater than 48?

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.039
So we want to know, is
area greater than 48?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.690
OP is less than PQ.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.190
So the way I drew this
actually isn't right.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.080
It's probably a little
bit shifted to the

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.179
left a little bit.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.620
But fair enough.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.540
We can visualize.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.070
We can imagine that.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.770
So let's see.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.610
Statement number 1.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.090
The coordinates of point
P are 6 comma 8.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.430
So this is 6 comma 8.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.720
Let's see.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.230
That tells us the height.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.246
When we figure out the area of
a triangle, we need to know

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:04.100
the base times the height.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.700
And then multiply
that times 1/2.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.400
The height of this triangle is
the y-coordinate, which is 8.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.720
So the altitude of this
triangle is 8.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.440
So we have the height, but we
still don't know the distance

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.210
from O to Q.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.810
So statement 1, by itself,
isn't much information.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.380
So that tells that the
point was 6, 8.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.130
That P was 6, 8.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.790
Statement 2 says, the
coordinates of point Q

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.860
are 13 comma 0.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.590
Well, this is helpful.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.020
13 comma 0.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.830
So this distance right
here is 13.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.020
So by itself, that's useless.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.600
Because if I didn't have the
height, I still wouldn't be

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.190
able to figure out the area
of this triangle.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.200
But now, if I use both
statements, I know the base

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.940
times the height.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.650
So the area is going to
be the base times the

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.740
height times 1/2.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.410
So 8 times 1/2 is 4.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.170
Times 13 is 52.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.015
And so 52 is clearly
greater than 48.

00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:01.520
Let me make sure.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.135
Because I didn't use
this information.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.410
I didn't use that information
at all.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.090
Let's see.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.290
Let me think about it.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.970
Actually, no.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.140
I think I'm wrong.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.250
I think statement 1, alone,
might be enough.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.860
Let's assume that we don't
have-- these are tricky.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.750
Let's assume that we don't
have statement 2 there.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.420
Let me see if I can figure out
whether the area is greater

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.860
than 48 without it.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.230
Let me see.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.630
Yeah, I think I'm wrong.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.920
I caught myself.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.800
OK, so if this is 6 comma 8,
the area of this triangle

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800
right here, well, this
distance right here

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.050
is going to be 6.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.570
This distance right here is 6.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:50.960
6 comma 8.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.330
Right.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.920
OK, so the area of this
triangle is 6 times 8.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.930
48 times 1/2.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.580
So the area of this
triangle is 24.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.580
But they told us that
OP is less than PQ.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.020
That this distance is less
than this distance.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.450
Maybe I should draw it
like that, so you

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.940
can kind of see it.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.780
And the only way that this
distance is less than this

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.150
distance is if this distance
is less than this distance.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.840
This is a tricky problem.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.380
This has to be less than this.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.620
Q has to be further away.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.310
Because that's the only way
you're going to get this

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.390
altitude to be longer
than this altitude.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.700
Because you're assuming that
Q is along the axes.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.890
So that's the only thing that
you can shift back and forth.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.860
So if this distance is larger
than this distance, then the

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.550
area of this triangle is going
to be at least 24.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.250
So the area is going to
be greater than 48.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.400
So actually, all you needed
was statement 1

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.130
to solve this problem.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.620
That's all you needed.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.170
Statement 1 gave you
enough information.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.200
Statement 2 does not, by
itself, give you enough

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.670
information because you don't
know how high P is.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.947
It could be really low down
here, in which case the area

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:04.860
is going to be less than 48.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.920
It could be really high, in
which case the area would be

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.150
greater than 48.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.090
But anyway, see, I almost
got that one wrong.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.810
But I'll leave you there.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.830
I'll see you in the
next video.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.790
Statement 1, alone, was
sufficient for this one.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.040
