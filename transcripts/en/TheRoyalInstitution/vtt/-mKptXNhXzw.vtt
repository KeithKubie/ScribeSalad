00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.839
The different approach of New Guineans
to assessing risk

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.139
is perhaps the aspect of living in New
Guinea that is most

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.159
affected my personal life.

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:12.830
In one of my early
trips to New Guinea

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.880
I was with a batch of New Guineans on a mountain side. We saw birds, we moved up the mountain

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.540
I was ready to pick a new campsite

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.220
and I found a gorgeous potential campsite in the forest

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.840
on the flat top of a ridge, steep drop-off where I could watch

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.179
parrots and pigeons, underneath a giant tree.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.679
So I told the New Guineans let's pitch camp here and to my surprise they refused

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.740
to pitch camp there and they said look this
tree is dead.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.690
So I looked up and yes, this giant tree
was dead.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.180
But I thought that's ridiculous it's not going to fall for
forty years

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.080
But they were adamant they were not going
to sleep under a dead tree.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.620
In fact they slept in the open.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
I thought that they were being paranoid with
exaggerated fears

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.979
and then as I spent more time in New Guinea,
every night you're in New Guinea

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.739
sleeping in forests you hear a tree
fall somewhere

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.979
and then you go do the numbers.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.840
Suppose
the risk of that tree falling on me tonight is 1 in 1000.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.580
I sleep under dead
trees for a thousand nights.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.540
In three years I'm
gonna be dead.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.440
The example in western life for me
there was taking a shower.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.880
The most dangerous thing I
did today was to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.150
to take a shower and you're gonna say that is ridiculous.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.060
Your chance of falling in the shower is 1 in 1000. But again do the numbers.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.850
I'm 76. Statistically I have 15 years ahead of me.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030
That means 5475 showers ahead of me.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.100
If my risk of breaking my leg in the shower
is 1 in 1000,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.340
I'm gonna kill myself 5.5 times
before I live out my life expectancy

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.460
And that brought it home - 
the New Guinea attitude is to be

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.200
sensitive to the risks of events, of things that you're gonna do regularly.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.840
Each time they carry a low risk

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.180
But if you're not cautious it will catch
up with you.
