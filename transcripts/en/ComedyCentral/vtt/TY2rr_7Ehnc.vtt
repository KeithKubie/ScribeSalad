Today we are cracking down

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.336 line:0%
on the massage parlors
here in Reno.

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:05.805 line:0%
We are sending in our very own
Travis Jr. undercover

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:09.809
with these high-tech glasses,
which have a very small camera.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.111
He will infiltrate
the massage parlor

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.647
try to get them to perform
the sex act on him

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.084
'and then we will swoop in
and start makin' arrests.'

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.254
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.856
- Okay. He's in. He's in.
- Ooh. Ooh.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.993
Hi. You want a massage?

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.328
You want, uh, long time,
short time?

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.164
(Travis)
'Uh, the full,
everything you've got.'

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.665
'Uh, on the menu,
off the menu...'

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.867
- I give you everything.
- 'Everything. Alright.'

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.836
- Come this way.
- 'Okay. What do we do here?'

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.838
'This is my first time
in one of these places.'

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.940
First you have to take off
your clothes.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.542
- Okay.
- 'Thank you.'

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.311
- I like your belt buckle.
- 'Yeah. That was my daddy's.'

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.980
- It's so nice and shiny.
- 'Thank you.'

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.949
You have to take off
your glasses.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.484
- 'Oh, I'm not supposed...'
- I take off for you.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.252
- 'Ok-okay. Oh. Okay, well--'
- I take off for you.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.588
- Is that the glasses?
- Oh, oh, oh. Oh, no.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.323
- I put glasses your down here.
- Yeah.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.325
- Yeah. You look cute.
- I'm very careful.

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.893
Go right to the super deluxe.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.362
Now, I don't know if there's
some kind of special code

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.664
I'm supposed to say.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.666
No, no, no.
You get whole package.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.169
- That's all.
- Oh. Ow! Aah! Okay!

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.905
Oh, God! What the [bleep]

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:15.374
- Is it, is it too hard?
- Ah. Ow. OW.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:16.709
- Is it too hard?
- Oh. That's great.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.277
- Okay.
- That's... Aah! Thank you!

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.680
- Oh. It feels so good.
- Ow! Ow!

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.316
- Ow! Oh, God!
- Okay. I now get some lotion.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.017
- Oh, ow!
- Oh, good. Thank you.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.652
Here you go.
Just put that right there.

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:28.921
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay, okay.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.823
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.059
[grunting]

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.461
- Aah!
- Ow! Okay, okay.

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.396
[indistinct chatter]

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.298
Whee! It's so much fun!

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.202
[groaning]

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.304
- Is good?
- It's great.

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:47.240
And now, happy ending.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.041
- Okay.
- All better?

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.743
- It's more relaxing?
- Yeah. It's more relaxing

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.478
- That's great. Okay. Ah!
- Okay.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.313
- Aah!
- Oh. Ow.

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:56.015
- That's better, right?
- Oh.

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.283
That's so much better.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.218
So I'm supposed to get
on my side, or...

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.321
No. You just go on the floor.
That's good. Okay.

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:03.956
Is she dancing?
She's dancing on him.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.925
- 'She's not dancing.'
- She's dancing on him.

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.560
- Aah!
- 'Get off me! Get off me!'

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.163
- 'Get off me! Ah! Damn!'
- Aah!

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.731
You know, there's more.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.367
No, I don't want any more.
I don't want any more.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.002
- Okay.
- I don't want any more.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.205
- Just one...
- Oh, no! [bleep]

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:20.640
Just leave me alone!
Leave me alone.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.675
It's such a pleasure
to hear on you!

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:25.244
Oh, come on.
Let's get him.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.013
'Travis!'

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.448
Frank, Lisa.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.818
Yeah, I don't think the cops
will be here again anytime soon.
