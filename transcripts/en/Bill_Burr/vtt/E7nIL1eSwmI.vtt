1
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.680
Like a boss. Somebody told me on a Twitter to watch this,

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.370
hang on a on Netflix, on green berets

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.760
<v 1>before a man is trained to be a green moray.</v>

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.610
He must prove he's cut out for the job.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.040
This special forces assessment and selection

6
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.950
survive two weeks in hell and navy. They'll take you out.

7
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840
<v 0>You know if I rented the right one, there's a couple of them.</v>

8
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.030
The one that I rented was a, I don't know, something.

9
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.540
11 weeks of hell or something to hang on a second.

10
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:47.520
Let me see if I can find this shit. Oh sorry. The 11 weeks, two weeks.

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.730
Do you know why I said 11 cause of the two L's in hell, I swear to God,

12
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:54.060
the way my brain works, this is the only fucking job I could ever do.

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.961
So there's a couple,

14
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.950
there's one national GRI of geographic special forces put over this two weeks in

15
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.784
hell.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.450
I was watching this thing they just showed the first couple of fucking days.

17
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.350
I could tell you right now,

18
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:08.580
there's no fucking way I could ever be a green baret.

19
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.750
You'll lie to yourself having never been in the military that I could do that.

20
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.690
You know, I put my fucking head down no fucking way.

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.340
Go on Netflix and check that out. That's my youtube video of the week,

22
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:24.430
except it's on Netflix. Watch two weeks of hell.

23
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440
I've only watched the first episode, Dude. It's just fucking insane.

24
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.860
<v 1>The special forces assessment and selection process has officially started.</v>

25
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.470
We've would a pit, there'll be no spitting in the pit, no puking.

26
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.130
Everyone expects to get their ass kicked.

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.290
<v 0>The first day you're there, they have a thousand pound log that 12 guys grab</v>

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.910
<v 1>with 12 people to a log.</v>

29
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.330
It's attempting not to carry your weight all the way up

30
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.880
<v 0>and you're just sitting there bending over at the waist as you're holding it,</v>

31
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:02.820
like you're going to do curls up, down, up, down, up, down, up,

32
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:05.010
down. Like my lower back would just, that would be it.

33
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.420
I would never walk right again.

34
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.350
And then they have it on your shoulder and you've got to pick it up over your

35
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.990
head and then down and they're sitting there going,

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.870
move the log around your head.

37
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.660
Not your head around the log,

38
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.050
<v 2>you're not moving your head around a log door,</v>

39
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900
picking up the log and moving it around your head.

40
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.450
<v 0>Number one 67 what is your problem? They fucking going off on him.</v>

41
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.483
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.180
<v 0>And uh, you do that for like a fucking hour.</v>

43
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.140
Then they just have you rolling on the ground from one side of the pit to the

44
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:42.570
other. And if you too slow, other people rollover you.

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.810
<v 2>Hello? Hey, if your body is weaker,</v>

46
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.570
then you roll over half ways on hell,

47
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.420
no way on you.

48
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.320
<v 0>And it's supposed to make you dizzy and disoriented.</v>

49
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.740
And when you puke, you have to get up and run out of the pit.

50
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.620
There's no puking in the pit, but they know you're going to puke.

51
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.400
So you have to run out of the pit and Puke. If you puke in the pit,

52
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.660
you have to pick the puke up and put it in your pockets and then get back on the

53
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.950
ground and start rolling again.

54
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.010
<v 2>They've got that week. What are your</v>

55
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.850
[inaudible]

56
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.660
<v 0>and even the people who are dropping like flies,</v>

57
00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:30.230
I got to commend them for even less than an hour. That shit, you got to see it.

58
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.250
All right. If you think you're working out doing your insanity workout,

59
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.100
go fuck yourself and watch this thick.

60
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.470
It's the sick I have now.

61
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:44.240
I'm just on the second episode where the just showing the teamwork. Oh my God,

62
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:45.460
do they have one thing there?

63
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.950
When you're your mill in North Carolina and they call this thing like the star,

64
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.640
<v 1>this is the star land navigation test.</v>

65
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.720
The distances, the dense terrain and the time pressure. Make it a killer.

66
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.820
<v 0>Well you have these five points that make a star that you have to find using</v>

67
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:08.240
navigation and you can't use your light and you can't go on the roads and you're

68
00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.160
just walking through the fucking forest.

69
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.560
<v 3>This is our chance to see their ability to comprehend and learn basic line</v>

70
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:19.340
navigation skills with a simple map, a compass and a protractor.

71
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.570
And we want the guy that's gonna go out there and find all of his points no

72
00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:24.404
matter what.

73
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.480
<v 0>And when you come upon a river or a pond,</v>

74
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:32.310
you have to walk through the fucking thing.

75
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.730
You can't go on a road and they bust all, you can't sleep.

76
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.340
They bust and they got these guys with these infrared goggles like Rambo hiding

77
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.670
and catching all of these guys when they cheat,

78
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.360
<v 4>getting ready to go out,</v>

79
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.390
down to a choke point where candidates like to get out onto the road,

80
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:51.930
get out of the woods and try to keep their feet dry. It's basically cheating.

81
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.560
Basically. I'm just going to be there and try to catch these guys in the act.

82
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.370
<v 0>And then you're out of the fucking program.</v>

83
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.240
<v 1>Here's your region. There's one area, it's got tire tracks and it's wide,</v>

84
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.310
which you just walked down. Let me see your scorecard candidate.

85
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.510
You have just become a roadkill, continue your point,

86
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.450
get off my road.

87
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.190
<v 0>Um, it's just like,</v>

88
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.570
I don't think I could go more than 18 seconds watching this thing without going.

89
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.050
I quit there. I'd quit there. I would fail that.

90
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.310
The only thing I thought I'd be halfway decent on is the a the obstacle course

91
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because, uh, I do pull ups and climb a rope.

92
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.900
<v 1>25 obstacles stretch over two miles</v>

93
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.780
for candidates. Lacking upper body strength, balance

94
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.490
and coordination. This course is a killer.

95
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.940
But

96
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.120
<v 0>even then I do pull ups and climb a rope after eight hours sleep.</v>

97
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.340
And I had a nice bowl of oatmeal, you know,

98
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.550
my wife gives me a kiss on the cheek and then I go down there and I do is I go

99
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.680
and you know, I do as many as I can until it starts to hurt. That hurts.

100
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.543
And then I stopped.

101
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.533
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 6>Are you waiting on me? Whoa.</v>

103
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.800
Are you glad you find me? Fucking baller.

104
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.650
Fucking treat the shit. Get the fuck off.

105
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.750
Get the fuck down off of the obstacle.

106
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.100
<v 0>Oh, Jesus. I thought I was way closer to being in Greenbrae than I actually am.</v>

107
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.730
I thought I was only, you know, 1 million miles away from it.

108
00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:42.810
I didn't realize I was light years away. So, uh, anybody listened to this?

109
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:47.811
If you ever even attempted to become one if or if you are one or whatever you,

110
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:53.061
if you have any fucking personal stories that you could send in about attempting

111
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:57.610
that, uh, I don't know. The level of pain, whatever,

112
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.890
what it's like to scoop up puke and put it in any fucking pockets. I mean,

113
00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:06.730
Jesus Christ, you know what's funny is those,

114
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:08.830
you know when you join a Frat, how they go, Hey,

115
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:10.750
they have hell week and all that type of shit.

116
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.760
Like anybody who's a Greenbrae should be an honorary member member of every

117
00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:19.840
fraternity in the country because I know that those fucking,

118
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.860
what a why can't I remember how long it is? I want to say two weeks.

119
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.590
It is two weeks. I keep thinking 11 that right there dude,

120
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:30.120
look at that.

121
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.580
I am already fucked in the head before they actually deprived me of sleep.

122
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.460
They asked this one guy, they go, how long you been in here?

123
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.690
And he said Hash browns

124
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.060
<v 7>number 90 has completely lost his bearings. So I know where you lost</v>

125
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.590
<v 0>and this is the thing, he didn't take a head shot.</v>

126
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:58.000
It's not like a football player.

127
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.180
They just had him pick a log up for a fucking hour.

128
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.880
It'll roll around in the ground and they asked him,

129
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.960
they asked him something like that, like how you feeling? And he said,

130
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.950
hashbrowns so I dunno Jesus Christ.

131
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:16.260
If that doesn't make you want to watch it, I don't know what will

132
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.970
<v 7>going through seven two ropes, k, they don't want their a three.</v>

133
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.570
You need to see a medic one, three, seven they continue to train.

134
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.660
<v 8>It's the most stressful part of selection. Instead of this,</v>

135
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:38.310
your test within a test, you told me that you would start performing.

136
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.950
Let's just see. Go take your break.

137
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.890
Just see you. One six seven let's just see the

138
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.280
<v 0>number one 67 what is your problem?</v>
