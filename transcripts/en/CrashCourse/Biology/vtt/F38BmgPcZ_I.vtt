00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.940
Taxonomy! It's the science
of classifying living things.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.000
That sounds exciting.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.030
Today we'll basically be learning
the Dewey Decimel System

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.050
of evolution!

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.860
It's like filing!

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.110
You must be on the
edge of your seat.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.339
OK, shut up.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.489
When it comes down to it,
this science doesn't just

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.859
categorize organisms,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.019
when you look a little deeper,
you realize it's telling the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.739
story of all life on earth.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:32.739
And it's a pretty good story.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.890
Every living thing on this planet
is related to every other

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.780
living thing.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.930
If you go far enough back,
we all have a common ancestor.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.560
An organism that both you
and I are descended from.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.870
Or something that a star fish and
a blue whale are descended from.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.880
Or, even weirder, that an
oak tree and a salmon are

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.410
both descended from.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.220
That organism lived.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.230
It lived very long ago.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.770
But it was here.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.700
And I dig that.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.369
The trick of taxonomy,
is basically figuring out

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.859
where all those branches
of the evolutionary tree are,

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.990
and finding some convenient labels
to help us understand all of these

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.219
remarkable interrelationships.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.649
Let's be clear though,
taxonomy isn't about describing

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.649
life in all of it's
ridiculous detail,

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.880
it's mostly about helping
humans understand it,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.619
because it's way too
complicated without structure.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.999
To get that structure biologists
use the taxonomic system to

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.990
classify all the
organisms on the Earth.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.740
It's sometimes called
the Phylogenetic Tree,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.039
or the Tree of Life,

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.499
and it illustrates the
evolutionary relationships

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.079
between all living species.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.429
There are about 2 million
known species, but there could be

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.229
anywhere from 5 million
to 100 million species

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.350
scientists really have
no freaking idea.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.229
New species keep getting
discovered all the time,

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.770
and the more organisms we
have to keep track of,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.459
the more complex the
Phylogenetic Tree becomes.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.429
So, there's not always a consensus
about how to classify this stuff.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.920
There's a lot of gray
area in the Natural World.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709
Actually, let me rephrase that:

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.670
the Natural World is
one giant Gray Area.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.060
Sometimes it's just hard
to know where to put

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.530
a certain group of organisms,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.780
and eventually the
group gets so big,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.000
the classification system has to
be messed with to make room for it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.160
So, the system isn't perfect,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.850
but it's good enough that we've
been using it for around 250 years.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.400
[Sniffing] What's that?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Do you smell a
Bio-lography coming on?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.040
Carl Linnaeus was a
Swede born in 1707.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.460
And early in his career as a
botanist he realized that the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.330
botanical nomenclature of
18th century Europe was..

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.390
well,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.870
just crap.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.400
For instance, in his day, the
"formal" name of a tomato plant

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.580
was Solanum caule inerme herbaceo,
foliis pinnatis incisis,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.900
racemis simplicibus.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.910
Linnaeus actually said once,
"I shudder at the sight

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.870
of most botanical names
given by modern authorities."

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.060
Not only did this sloppiness
bother him, he saw a whole

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.490
sugarstorm blowing in:

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.320
New plants were still being
discovered in Europe,

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.650
but that was nothing compared
to the crazy stuff that was

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.410
coming from the New World.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.620
Linnaeus saw that pretty soon,
naming conventions were

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.670
just going to collapse under
all these new things to name.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.540
And THEN what?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.280
Linnaeus famously started
off by naming himself.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.700
He came from a peasant family,
and at the time,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.650
surnames were just for
rich people, so when Carl

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.170
went to college, they asked him
for his surname and he

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.960
just made one up: Linneaus, after
the Linden trees that grew

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.470
on his family's homestead.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.700
Linnaeus got a medical degree
and became a professor at

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.290
Uppsala University where he
devoted himself to the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.250
study of nomenclature.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.310
He had his students go places and
bring back specimens for him to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.640
study and categorize.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.480
The method he eventually adopted
was based on morphology,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.340
or physical form and structure.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.110
This wasn't necessarily a new idea.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.230
Back then, people grouped organisms
by analogous or homoplasic traits,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.230
structures that appear similar
but actually come from

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.790
completely independent origins.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.480
By this definition, birds would be
more closely related to

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.150
butterflies than to reptiles because
birds and butterflies can both fly.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.060
But Linnaeus had a good mind for
this stuff and turned out to have

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.000
a real knack for choosing actual
homologous traits for

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.150
his classification system

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.390
traits that stem from a
common evolutionary ancestor.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.680
Linnaeus didn't know
jack about evolution

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.799
Darwin wouldn't come around
for another 100 plus years

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.430
but he just intuited that some
traits were more important than others.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.560
For instance, he was struck by the
fact that reproductive apparatus

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.550
seemed to be a good way
of classifying plants.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.250
He also caused a scandal by
classifying the Class Mammalia

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.790
based on the female's ability to
produce milk from their nipples.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.300
Because apparently that was
pretty racy stuff back then.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.270
In his lifetime Linnaeus catalogued
roughly 7,700 plants

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.200
and 4,400 animals,
and he published his

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.550
classifications in a catalog
called Systema Naturae,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.950
which by the time he wrote the
12th edition, was 2,300 pages long.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.520
In the meantime, Linneaus actually
adopted a personal motto:

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.250
"God created, Linnaeus organized."

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.130
Although taxonomy has come a long
way since Linnaeus, we still use a

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.700
bunch of the conventions
that he invented.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.020
For instance, we still arrange
things into taxa, or groups of

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.020
organisms, and we still us the
same Taxa as Linnaeus:

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.290
kingdom, phylum, class, order,
family, genus and species.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.690
We also still use Linnaeus'
convention of binomial nomenclature

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.370
using a unique, two-part
name for every species

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.590
the genus and species name,
in Latin or Latin-ish.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.250
This practice actually started back
in the Middle Ages when educated

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.020
people were expected to know Latin.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.320
We know a lot less latin now,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.800
but we know a lot more about
evolution which Linnaeus didn't.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.570
And we have technologies like
genetic testing to classify

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.870
relationships between organisms.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.130
And yet we still use Linnaeus's
morphology-based system because

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.290
genetic evidence generally agrees
with classifications that are made

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.930
based on structure and form.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.310
However, because there was a lot
of life that Linnaeus had no idea

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.380
about, we had to stick a new
taxa above Linnaeus' Kingdom.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.300
We call it Domain.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.990
And it's as broad as you can get.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.389
The Domains are Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.050
The bacteria and archae are
prokaryotes, meaning their

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.490
genetic material goes commando
with no nucleus to enclose it.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.169
While the Eukarya make up all the
life forms with a nucleus and

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.240
include pretty much all the
life that you think of as life,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.350
and quite a lot of the life
that you don't think about at all.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.040
It might seem like, since all
macroscopic life only gets

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.110
one domain, it's kinda silly
to give prokaryotes two

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.430
and for a long time, we didn't.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.290
We didn't divide them up
into different domains.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.919
They hung out together in
a single domain called Monera.

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.550
But it later became clear that
Bacteria, which live pretty much

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.240
everywhere on earth, including
inside of you and deep in the

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.389
Earth's crust, and Archaea
which are even more hardy

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.510
than bacteria, have distinct
evolutionary histories.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.500
Archaea being more closely
related to eukaryotes and,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.389
yes, thus me and you.

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.930
They have totally different cell
membranes and the enzymes they use

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.020
to make RNA, their RNA polymerase,
is much more like ours.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.760
Under the domain Eukarya,
which is by far the most

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.630
interesting and even occasionally
adorable domain, we have Kingdoms:

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.740
Protista, Fungi,
Plantae and Animalia.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.690
Now, scientists have settled on
these four. For now.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.870
But these are categories that
are a human creation, but there

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.090
are good reasons for
that human creation.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.540
The unscientific truth is that we
looked at life and divided it up

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.610
based on what we saw.
So we were like,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.979
"Well, protists are single-celled
organisms, so, they're very

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.180
different from the
rest of the domain.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.040
Plants get their energy from the
sun and fungi look and act very

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.930
different from plants and animals,
and we already know what

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.520
animals are, so they have
to get their own kingdom."

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.440
And though scientists are loathe
to admit it, that system of just

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.210
looking and dividing things up
actually worked pretty well for us.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.639
Not perfectly, but pretty well.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.510
But there's a reason why
this worked so well.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.120
Evolutionarily, there are
actual categories.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.120
Each of these kingdoms is a
huge branch in the tree of life.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.669
At each branch, an evolutionary
change occurred that was

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:56.460
so massively helpful that
it spawned a vast diversity

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.380
of descendents.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.320
Plants or Plantae are the
autotrophs of the Domain Eukarya.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.030
Autotrophs meaning that
they can feed themselves,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.840
through photosynthesis of course.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.870
Their cellulose-based cell walls
and chloroplasts giving

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.440
them a distinct difference from
all other multi-cellular life.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.300
There are two other
sorts of -trophs.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.699
The heterotrophs, which get their
energy by eating other organisms.

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:20.449
And Chemotrophs, which are weird
and crazy and only show up

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:23.509
in bacteria and achaea, and they
get their energy from chemicals.

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:26.590
Now the kingdom Protista is weird
because it contains both

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.699
autotrophs and heterotrophs.

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:31.770
Some protists can photosynthesize,
while others eat living things.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.349
Protists are basically a bunch of
weird, eukaryotic single-celled

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.710
organisms that may or may not
be evolutionarily related

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.289
to each other

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.250
scientists are still
trying to figure it out.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.659
Some are plant-like,
like algae,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.500
some are more animal-like,
like amoebas,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.960
and some are fungus-like,
like slime molds.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.070
Protists are one of those gray
areas I was telling you about.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.610
So don't be surprised if,
by the time you're teaching this

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.170
to your biology students,
there are more than

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.899
four kingdoms in Eukarya.

00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:59.529
Fungi, which are,
you know—the funguses.

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:01.420
They include mushrooms,
smuts, puffballs,

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.510
truffles, molds, and yeasts

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.649
and they're pretty cool because
they have cell walls like plants,

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:08.220
but instead of being
made of cellulose,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.190
they're made of another
carbohydrate called chitin,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.020
which is also what the beak of a
giant squid is made out of,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.800
or the exoskeleton of a beetle.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.480
Because fungi are heterotrophs
like animals, they have these

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.750
sort of digestive enzymes that
break down their food

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.430
and get reabsorbed.
But they can't move,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.279
they don't require a
stomach for digestion

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.399
they just grow on top
of whatever it is they're

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.950
digesting and digest it
right where it is.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:31.850
Which is super convenient!

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.550
And finally, we have
Kingdom Animalia.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.420
Which is the lovely kingdom that
we find ourselves and 100% of

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.510
adorable organisms in.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.360
Animals are multicellular, always.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.540
We're heterotrophic, so we spend a
lot of our time hunting down food

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.680
because we can't make it ourselves.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.760
Almost all of us can move,
at least during some stage

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.649
of our life cycle.

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:54.520
And most of us develop either
two or three germ layers

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.540
during embryonic development,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.390
wait for it...

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.820
...unless you're a sponge.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.060
So like I said, we use this
taxonomic system to describe

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.550
the common ancestry and
evolutionary history

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.110
of an organism.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.420
Looking at the phylogenetic tree,
you can tell that humans are more

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.260
closely related to mice
than we are to fish,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.660
and more closely related to fish
than we are to fruit flies.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.230
So how about we pick an organism
and follow it all the way through

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.290
the taxa, from kingdom to species,
just to see how it works.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.380
I know!

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.860
Let's pick this kitty.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.540
Because I know she'd like it.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.470
Right, cat?

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.529
So, kitties have cells that have
nuclei and membrane

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.089
surrounded organelles.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:33.170
And they're multicellular
and heterotrophic and have

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.779
three germ layers of cells
when they're embryos,

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:39.050
so they're in the
kingdom Animalia.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.110
And they have a spinal cord
running down their backs,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.810
protected by vertebrae,
and disks in between them.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.649
And they have a tail that doesn't
have a butthole at the end of it

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:50.640
like a worm, which
I'm really glad about.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.750
And that puts her in
the phylum Chordata.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.959
Kitty clearly does not like this,
so I'm going to put her down now.

00:10:55.959 --> 00:10:59.720
And the kitty lactates and gives
birth to young like a cow,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.350
instead of laying eggs
like a chicken,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.760
and they have fur and three
special tiny bones in

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.420
their ears that only mammals have,
so they're in the class Mammalia.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.420
So, she is more closely related
to a cow than a chicken.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.060
Good to know!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.220
And like a bunch of other
placental mammals that eat meat

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.110
like weasels (the mustelids),
and dogs, (the canines),

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.399
kitties are in the order Carnivora.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.149
And they're in the cat family,
Felidae, whose members have lithe

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:27.540
bodies and roundish heads and,
except for cheetahs,

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.510
retractable claws.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.029
And they're littler than tigers
and panthers, which puts them

00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:32.209
in the genus Felis.

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:34.839
And then, at the level of the
species, the descriptions get

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.880
pretty dang detailed, so let's
just say that, you know

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.779
what a cat is right?
So the species name is catus.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:42.680
And look at that: Felis catus!

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.000
Aw. Kitty. I could have that whole
thing cross-stitched onto

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.649
a pillow for you to sleep on!

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:49.060
And it would be cute!

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.860
Thank you for watching our taxider-

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.019

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.640
We hope that you learned something.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.360

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.360
And we will get to them.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.459
Hopefully very quickly.
