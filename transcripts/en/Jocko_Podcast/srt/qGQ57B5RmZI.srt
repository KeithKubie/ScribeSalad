1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,350
What are the best ways of police officer
can condition themselves to violence

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,580
and confrontation? I currently
train Jujitsu, but I'm not. I am,

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,600
but I am curious what else I can do
to keep myself and others safe from

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,640
unpredictable violence.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,750
This is not a self defense question or
either mental conditioning question.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,570
Very cool question.
Uh,

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,860
appreciate that question because this
individual recognizes that there is a

8
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:33,140
little bit more to it than
just the physical self defense.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,760
Then that's the mental and
he's 100% right. So here's
some things that you can do

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
when you get the opportunity. You've got
to get some realistic training going.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,320
And I've talked about it a little bit
on here with the kind of realistic

12
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,030
training that we did in the seal teams.

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,030
There's things that up
the intensity greatly.

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,780
Simunition or uh,
like a paintball scenario.

15
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,440
Another good thing is
getting, uh, you know,

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,150
really heavy sparring equipment
on. So face gear, you know,

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,040
and really go to town.

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,250
We are trying to attack someone
and take them down and do it,

19
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:18,530
you know, three on one, four on one.
Gotta be careful not to get hurt.

20
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:22,970
You don't want to go that extreme. But
if someone puts on headgear, you know,

21
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,010
with a face mask and the whole nine yards,

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,810
shin guards in padded outfit on and people
can attack them and you have to react

23
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,740
to it. The other good thing to do is
do it in a situation where you know,

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,750
you don't let the guy know
what's going to happen.

25
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,020
You know he's gotta keep his eyes closed
until you say go. And he opens his eyes.

26
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,940
There's someone there with a knife
right in front of a fake knife,

27
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:47,360
right in front of him is going to stab
him and he's got to draw his weapon and

28
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,310
shoot or defend himself somehow.

29
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,450
So you want to hit him with these
unexpected drills, with your weapons,

30
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:56,660
without your weapons shooting and moving.
So those are,

31
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,620
those are the kinds of things.

32
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,800
As soon as you get the opportunity
to do it and it's even good. I mean,

33
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,860
if you've been in a, in a, in a,

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,630
you know, shooting drill with like a
barricaded shooter, which is, you know,

35
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,060
you put a shooter or the end
of a hallway and he's hidden,

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,120
but he shooting at you with
paint ball and you get,

37
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,870
you can get the intensity up very high.
It's getting shot with paintball hurts.

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,960
And if you're getting nailed and you've
got to do something, and people are like,

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,940
I gotta make a call, go do something.
You've got to make it happen.

40
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,810
How are you gonna stop this guy?

41
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,870
You can get your intensity up
and you can get used to that.

42
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:33,871
You can inoculate yourself somewhat to
that stress and learn to detach yourself

43
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,580
from it and not let it affect
you and not let it grind on you.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,800
So that's the realistic
training. And, and honestly, I,

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,340
when I watch some of the police
videos of the bad shootings,

46
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:56,491
now we know police officers throughout
the country every day are under a burden

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,720
of hostility.

48
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,300
And they do an outstanding job over
and over again making great arrests and

49
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,200
helping people and saving people that are
suicidal, incredible amount of things,

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,160
right? Of course, no one releases
those videos and they don't go viral.

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,880
The videos that go viral and the videos
that people watch or the bad ones,

52
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,140
the bad ones,
the bad ones.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,680
And I hope that the police departments
across America are doing something to

54
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:36,691
inoculate their troopers from the stress
cause that when I watch these videos,

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,110
that is what I see happening.
The,

56
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,810
the stress level and the,

57
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,490
the inexperience of the
stressful situation.

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,360
And there's one video that
I watched which is awful,

59
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,790
and the guy gets a call,
uh, you see as you see his,

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,580
the first thing you see it,
the whole thing is a body camera.

61
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,830
And forgive me if someone
pulls this video up,

62
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,560
and I'm not a hundred percent accurate,
but he gets a call,

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,040
it's at a seven 11 guy with a
gun guy pulls a new seven 11.

64
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,010
The cop pulls into the
seven 11 as he's getting,

65
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,000
he gets out of his car and he sees a
guy kind of walk in one direction out of

66
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,720
the seven 11 and turn and walk into
another direction. Guys got a Hoodie on.

67
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:24,400
He's walking away so the cop
gets out, he's yelling at
him, Hey, stop, stop, stop.

68
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,980
That guy doesn't stop.
Finally he's,

69
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,520
he's now approaching him and
he's standing in the open,

70
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,730
and this is something that I see in
a lot of these videos. These cops,

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,731
they stand in the open when if you
imagine that the other guy has a gun,

72
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:43,420
why would you stand in the open?
Take cover, you take cover.

73
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,820
That's the first thing you do.
If you're,

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,060
even if you're trying to stop
somebody or trying to yell at someone,

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,220
you take cover.
So if they turn around and have a gun,

76
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,480
you only have a small portion of your
body exposed and you don't get scared

77
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,110
because you're hanging out in
the open. So yeah. So anyways,

78
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,980
this guy is approaching, he's standing
out in the open, he's yelling at the guy.

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,840
Finally the guy turns around.
And when the guy turns around,

80
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,970
he reaches in his jacket and boom,
the cop shoots him,

81
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,070
the guy falls down,
he kind of rolls into a curb,

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,000
the cop comes over.
As soon as the cop comes over,

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,490
you very quickly realize what's going on.

84
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,290
And that is that the guy had headphones
on underneath his hoodie and he couldn't

85
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,950
hear the cop yelling at him.
And then as the cop searches him,

86
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,570
he pulls out of his pocket, his iPhone.
And so he was just listening to music,

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,070
reached in his pocket to uh, turn it
off, turn it off, and he got shot.

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,100
Horrible situation.
So how do you inoculate yourself to that?

89
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,460
You've got to put yourself into training
situations where you do have the

90
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:49,630
instinct to take cover.

91
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,970
Will you do have the instinct
to see what people's hands are?

92
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,440
We do have the instinct to realize that
you put yourself in a better situation

93
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,330
where if the guy does pull out a gun,

94
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:04,331
you have time to react to it and you
can react to it from a safer distance,

95
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,540
you know, as a, so there's a lot
of things I would love to, uh,

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,890
start to, and I don't know how,
you know, I don't know how, um,

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,510
I don't know how to go about this,

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,610
but I would love to start working with
police departments in some manner to get

99
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,760
some training setup. Like the
training we had in the seal teams,

100
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,780
which was the training that I sit
up in the seal teams was psychotic.

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,880
How stressful we would make it so
that these guys were overwhelmed.

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,450
They were as explosions, machine,
gunfire, paint balls, hitting them, uh,

103
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,960
smoke everywhere, screaming, civilians,

104
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,100
screaming wounded, uh, actors.

105
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,770
We'd hire actors that were amputees. They
have blood spurting all over the place.

106
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
It was incredibly realistic.
And that way when guys got into combat,

107
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,210
like one of the first time I ever
got shot and I was like, okay,

108
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,480
here's what's going on.
So I hope at some point I can,

109
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,850
I can help the military with that.

110
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,090
Now in addition to that,

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,770
as you're trying to knock yourself your
to this violence and get used to this,

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,930
watch those youtube videos,

113
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,290
watch those youtube videos of street
fights of stupid encounters with,

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,420
with bars,
with drunk people and bouncers with uh,

115
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,390
the shoot or don't shoot
scenarios with cops,

116
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,830
military situations where they have
helmet cams on and you can see things

117
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:28,191
happening.

118
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,710
And what you want to do is you want to
watch those videos and you want to pay

119
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,540
attention to the people,

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,250
to the humans and watch the reactions
and watch their movements and watch their

121
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:42,251
body language and watch their expressions
on their faces and see and judge and

122
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:46,610
predict and go to another
video and hit pause and say,

123
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,340
this is what I see right here.
This is what I think is about to happen.

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,700
And educate yourself on human nature
because human nature is what you're going

125
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:59,210
to be dealing with.
And violence is a part of human nature.

126
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,600
And sometimes things go violent
and sometimes they don't.

127
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,670
So how do you predict that? And if
you're unsure, which you will be,

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,860
how do you protect yourself first and
give yourself the maximum amount of time

129
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:16,130
to make a judgment call
so you don't have to rush

130
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,900
on top of that.

131
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah,

132
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,310
it's awesome that you're doing Jujitsu.
Do Boxing,

133
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,990
do Moitai do wrestling.
So you get used to getting hit.

134
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:33,740
So you start to see what a person's face
looks like when they're about to hit

135
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:38,680
you. So you start to see
what changes in their, their,

136
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,020
their, their posture makes when
they're about to throw a punch.

137
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,450
Those are all things that will help view.

138
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,960
Jujitsu is obviously
great for the grinding,

139
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,730
physical grappling situation, but
a lot of times, hopefully as a cop,

140
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,040
most of the time you're not in that
situation. You're standing at a little

141
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,880
bit of a distance and or
you're, you know, you're,

142
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,310
you've got a little
bit more time to judge.

143
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,580
So fight as much as you can.

144
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,750
Watch those law enforcement
and military videos again,

145
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,980
see the reactions, see the noise,
see the fear, see that panic,

146
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,600
look at people's eyes, judge them,
predict what they're going to do.

147
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,940
Press pause and figure out if you will,
right or wrong,

148
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,210
watch horrible violence happen so that
you can understand it better so that you

149
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,320
can handle it when the time arises.
Yeah.

150
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,770
O and m and just kind of to add on
some of the stuff you're saying,

151
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,680
I wouldn't even say compete if you can.

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,010
Cause a lot of times
in training you can't,

153
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:43,680
especially if you're training every day
or pretty often you can get into the

154
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:48,240
mindset that I can just train casual
today. And if a guy taps me out,

155
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,080
which everyone says it doesn't matter
that much. You know, so when you compete,

156
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,460
that's, that's one of the
significant things that I got. Um,

157
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,340
of that I realized when I was
competing. It's your, your re,

158
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,940
your senses are heightened because
everything matters. If you get taken down,

159
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,800
it matters. If you go for a submission
and you don't get it, it matters in,

160
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,460
in competition. So you have
that, that mindset more so,

161
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,650
and you'll get used to that mindset.
And to your point,

162
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,350
I tell this guy's at Jujitsu,
when you're training for a competition,

163
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,030
no matter what we do,

164
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,060
just about no matter 98% of the time I
can't get two guys in training to go as

165
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,620
hard against each other as
they're going to in competition.

166
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,710
As someone when someone gets a
grip of your g and competition.

167
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,740
Yeah it is 10 times stronger
than it is when you're training.

168
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,621
Cause if you rip,

169
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:45,030
if I go to grab your g color and you go
through some effort to rip it away and

170
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:45,511
we're training,

171
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,830
I'm going to let it go because I don't
care if it happens in competition and I

172
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:53,130
only have seven minutes to
work and get you submitted,

173
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm going to hang on to that thing and
I'm going to hang onto it hard. Yeah.

174
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,040
And I'm not going to let go. And
so you end up with a much, much,

175
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:04,041
much more intense seven minutes in a
competition or three minutes in a boxing

176
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,590
sparring match or,
or an a Moitai the intensity.

177
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,800
You cannot simulate the intensity in co
in training that you're going to get in

178
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,020
competition.
And take that one step further.

179
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,420
When you get into a
life and death struggle,

180
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,310
you're going to have the same level of
jump to the intensity that's going to be

181
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,900
there. So that's a good
point as well. Yeah.

182
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,220
In that kind of goes from Moitai as well.

183
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm not even necessarily
saying competing Moitai,

184
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,880
but when we ties a good one because you
get cracked in your body and your legs

185
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:40,800
and you get to feel some pain. Um,
and if you're not used to that.

186
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay. Before I even started, when we,
today I went in, um, remember Terry,

187
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,590
so could you, he was like, Hey, you know,
we, we've trained you do two together.

188
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,560
There was like, Hey, I'm training
MMA today. Come, let's spar with me.

189
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,360
My other partners are doing.
And I was like, Hey, I don't
have any striking threes.

190
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,910
It's like, oh, I don't care, you
know, Jujitsu. So just train with me.

191
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,620
So proud. He punched me in the face
really hard and those, you know,

192
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,390
and I was like, man, just how you're
talking about this crash grenades.

193
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,910
Before it was kind of like that.
Just the fact that I got piped in,

194
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:14,350
knocked me out. It didn't days meet in
that way. It was just the fact that Dang,

195
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,640
I wasn't used to this.

196
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,370
I didn't know he was just going to
start punching me in my face. You know,

197
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,660
I thought we were just going to warm up.

198
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,930
So that's actually the main thing that
made me go into more type of specifically

199
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,140
to be used to getting cracked. Yeah.
Cause I was like, Bro, I'm not even,

200
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,090
I would thought I was pretty good
at Jujitsu. So I figured, you know,

201
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:37,030
like oh solid. You know, but brands,
so what if I get into some thing,

202
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,260
you know, outside of the
gym, the Guy Cracks me in my
face and I'm not used to it.

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,390
Yeah. You know, so meant, so the,

204
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,160
what the movies I did help is
when you get hit in the face,

205
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:49,510
it's like Jujitsu,

206
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,720
someone grinding on you and they're
breathing all in your nose or they're

207
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,750
sweating all in your eye or whatever.
That doesn't bother you at all.

208
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,210
You barely notice it introduced.
It doesn't matter. Right.

209
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,230
So the same thing with [inaudible].

210
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,550
When you get punched in the nose and it's
bleeding and you see your own blood or

211
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:06,460
whatever, but if you're not used
to that yet, that'll mess you up.

212
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,910
If you notice back in the day,
like they're old UFC or whatever,

213
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:13,170
guys will get cracked in the face like
three, four times hard and they'll be,

214
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,880
oh tap, holy cow. You know, cause
they're just not used to it.

215
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,470
Nowadays guys are just, they
won't, they won't talk. Yeah,

216
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,680
the referee got to start on it and they're
used to it rarely does anyone tapped

217
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,970
in the UFC from strikes.
Very rare.

218
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,540
Unless they're like
injured even then it won't.

219
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,340
Probably Laurie Mcdonald did know.
Yeah. So anyway, so, so the point is,

220
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,740
so when we tie situation in specific,

221
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:39,060
because that's where you feel the
most pain, like more than boxing,

222
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:41,590
like even even,
I mean you'll take brain injury for sure,

223
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:45,100
but it's not actual paint and we take it
kicked in the leg and they teach you to

224
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:49,510
hide the pain and to not let it affect
you and go in the end in the ribs like

225
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:54,040
body, like needs to the ribs. It's
super painful when you get used to that.

226
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,400
I think doubt out cause like if you're in
a situation, the streets on the cracks,

227
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,360
you hard in the face.

228
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,390
You know what's interesting about that
though is that there are some people that

229
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,590
can,

230
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,590
can easily or more easily take
the pain of Moy Thai or boxing.

231
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,970
Like it's okay with them then.
Then they,

232
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,360
then they can take the grind of Jujitsu
and some people can take the grind of

233
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:26,080
Jujitsu all day long,
but they can never take the striking pain.

234
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,580
So it's, there's just some
genetic or mental situations.

235
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,380
But to your point,

236
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,340
you need to be comfortable
with both of those situations.

237
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,360
And at the very least just familiar
with it. Oh, I'd like I said,

238
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:43,420
that first punch that I took
in my face and granted it was,

239
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:47,470
I wasn't ready for him to just wail on
me like that played football too. Yeah.

240
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,410
I mean so you've been hit, you've been
knocked out before on the field. Right.

241
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,840
So it's, it's kind of it. If
I were to try to remember it,

242
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:57,740
it was a combination of
sure that physical impact,

243
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,680
but just the fact that this guy just
punched me in my face right now.

244
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,740
Like it's always like Dang to discus
punch me in my base right now.

245
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,830
We're going to, yeah, I
ain't like that. But yeah,

246
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:10,430
after a while it doesn't mean the hardest
I ever got punched in the face was

247
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:14,350
from Greg right in the like right between
my eyes. And it was like happenstance.

248
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,480
He threw a real solid one.
Um,

249
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,020
as I went to kind of shoot who's kind
of coming up off his knees kind of,

250
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,730
and I went to shoot like I got,

251
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,370
I got from off my back and then forward
in shot forward and he just went boom.

252
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:29,260
And the,
the,

253
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,070
the force of me shooting forward and
then pull and I felt it in my neck is

254
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,580
really bad. But it was in a hard
part, lucky in code. But yeah,

255
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,500
fully that was a Kale Punch.
She just happened to be in
that really hard part. Um,

256
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,920
but I had been through that before.
I train Muay Thai before and it didn't,

257
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,240
it didn't even slow me down.

258
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,940
I remember thinking that was probably
the hardest punch I ever took.

259
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:52,940
And news with the MMA glove. It wasn't
with a big boxing gloves. Oh yeah.

260
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,871
Back in the old days,

261
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:58,871
we used to just spark or full on
with MMA gloves on a regular basis.

262
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,520
Yes. Stupid. Yeah. And, but
don't do that folks. Yeah, yeah.

263
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,710
Don't do that.
There's the whole deal.

264
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,040
But what I'm saying is that [inaudible]
good again, I was used to it.

265
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,701
It didn't slow me down.

266
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:15,560
If that was like a situation where I took
that kind of hard hit in a, you know,

267
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,320
or a cop would take that kind of hard
hit and they're used to that in training

268
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:19,670
or whatever,
that's not going to slow them down.

269
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,740
That's not going to stun them unless it
physically stuns them on the jars to me.

270
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,170
Yeah. And that's, you know, even if you're
trained, that's, that's, that's gonna.

271
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,520
That's gonna January fact,

272
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,690
if you train too much and you
get yourself hit too often,

273
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,860
you'll actually decrease your
ability to withstand punishment.

274
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:41,180
So careful about that. You want to
train enough that you're used to it,

275
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,530
you want to know that you can take it,

276
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:45,800
but then you don't want
to overtrain at all. Yeah.

277
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,580
You never get better it take,
well, no, let me rephrase that.

278
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,570
You get better at taking punches for a
short period of time and then it goes,

279
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,230
starts to go backwards. You know, and
unfortunately that's just the way the uh,

280
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,231
the body's built.

281
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:02,840
And you can see as some of the
older UFC fighters get older,

282
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,900
you know, there's no doubt they don't
have the chin that they once had.

283
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,530
And that's when they usually
decide to hang it up. Or if they,

284
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,780
if they get the right counsel from people.

285
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,110
But nowadays people are sparring a lot
less and they're trying to not take all

286
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:21,920
that punishment because everyone
realizes that you have a,

287
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,650
you have a limited number
of hits you can take to the,

288
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,000
to the head and then it starts to
go backwards. And it's, you know,

289
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:33,890
a lot of this information is coming
from the dupe soldiers overseas,

290
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,180
the marines overseas that have taken
concussions and IED strikes and they're

291
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:41,210
realizing that that is a permanent,
you know,

292
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,920
downgrade of their systems and
they, they, you know, so they,

293
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:49,260
so they, that's where a lot of this
information came from about football,

294
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,830
this concussion stuff in football.
A lot of that is coming from the,

295
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,300
the Iud is that our soldiers and marines
if taken overseas and they've realized

296
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:01,440
that this traumatic trauma,
traumatic brain injury is problematic.

297
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,290
And so we need to, we need
to watch out for it. So yeah,

298
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,360
especially if you're being a
cop and you gotta be alert.

299
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,280
But that's why I like the way I like the
Muy Thai. That's why I personally I did,

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,350
because it was a lot of like
clenching needs in those, if you, if,

301
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,610
if you've never done it,

302
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,390
you would think they'd been punched in
the nose square in the nose real hard

303
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,340
would be probably one of
the more painful things,

304
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,890
but it wasn't compared to
the ribs and the legs, man.

305
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,230
So if you're kind of used to just
taking impacts and pain, yeah. You just,

306
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,550
you just, not to mention the physical
part, but just mentally, they're like,

307
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,110
when that,
when that comes about,

308
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,350
you can just just keep on keeping on now
cause you're used to it or you're gone

309
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:45,990
to the moon from inoculate,
inoculate yourself, not Kulish.
