00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.830
about this ancient form of
storytelling through the use

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.030
of puppets and shadows.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.630

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.880
At age six, Mr. Sudarta began
extensive and continuous study

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.800
of traditional Balinese
performing arts, music, dance,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.030
and theater with family

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.240
Please join me to
welcome our guests.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.040
Thank you.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.370
[ Applause ]

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.670
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Hi, folks.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.690
Thanks for coming.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.950
So this is how this
talk is going to go.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.850
We're going to demonstrate
some traditional shadow theater

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.660
techniques and talk about
a traditional performance

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.040
that has informed
some experimental work

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.240
that Pat Gutsi has been doing.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.300
And what we'll do first is I'll
give a really brief introduction

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.580
on Indonesia and Bali
and shadow theater,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.660
and then I'll hand
it over to Pat Gusti.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.410
He's not completely
fluent in English

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.530
so the way we put this paper
together was yesterday I sat

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.680
down with him and
interviewed him on this topic,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.150
wrote up the notes in English,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.850
and he will be reading
them today,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.540
and I'll be running the slides
and showing the video and kind

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.580
of coming back and maybe
helping pronunciation if

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.440
and when it needs a little
bit of clarification.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.060
So I'm assuming if
you're in the room,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.870
you know where the
nation of Indonesia is.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.020
I don't need to go very
deeply into this, I hope,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.080
other than to remind you
that it's very large,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.680
very complicated nation with a
lot of different ethnicities.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.460
A lot of different languages and
many, many waves of migrations.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.590
So a lot of religious
syncretism, cultural syncretism,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.550
and in Bali and Java, a really
complicated mix of Buddhists,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.500
Hindu, and Islamic
ideas, cultural practices,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.410
and mixture with
indigenous animism.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.120
That's all I'm going
to go with that.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.370
We could spend the rest of the
talk on it but I get a sense

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.980
that you already know this.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.090
Here is a sense of
Bali and its regencies.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.420
Pat Gutsi is from the village
of [inaudible] and [inaudible]

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.970
which was the seat of
the Balinese kingdom

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.640
when the military
expedition from [inaudible]

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.020
in the 14th century came over
to Bali and changed a lot

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.350
of Balinese culture and
introduced new religious

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.080
and cultural practices.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.060
So, Pat Gutsi and I have
been working together

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.640
since about 2001, 2002.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.830
So he is one of my teachers of
the rather specialized music

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.000
that accompanies the
Balinese shadow play.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.770
It's called [inaudible],
but we've done a lot

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.310
of collaborations
together over the years.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.940
And we were just
performing this weekend

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.930
at the IluminAsia Festival

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.340
over at the Smithsonian Saturday
night and then Sunday morning

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.380
and then over at the Kennedy
Center Sunday evening.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.620
And we'll show you
some footage from that.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.830
I assume also that you know WMR.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:13.760
So could we show the traditional
shadow puppets of Indonesia.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.930
It's buffalo hide
that's been perforated,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.700
cut, and then painted.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.800
Why do they paint it when
you only see the shadow?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.350
It's both to help remind the
puppeteer or the [inaudible]

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.600
of the character
traits of the puppets,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.570
but also because the audience
often sits on both sides

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.860
of the screen and they move
around the performances.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.890
And after our talk, you
can get a chance to come up

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.380
and check them out more closely.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.060
So what we thought what we would
do is actually open up this talk

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.700
by Pat Gutsi doing the
traditional [inaudible].

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.460
The [inaudible] is
the tree of life.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.880
Sometimes called the [inaudible]
in the [inaudible] tradition,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.760
and it dances to create
the universe of the play.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.210
So we found what we would open

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.200
up with a traditional
[inaudible] performance

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.520
and then what's called
the [inaudible]

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.950
or the fragrant forest
which is the scene

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.810
in which the [inaudible]
recites poetry

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.850
in the [inaudible]
language that sets the scene

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.250
and introduces the main
characters before Pat Gutsi

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.070
reads his section of the paper.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:39.790
So what we'll do here is we'll
play -- so we have some music.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:47.110
We'll play; if this
works, we'll play the scene

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.120
from the Kennedy Center
performance yesterday.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.720
So we had some music to
accompany the [inaudible] here.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.500
Oh, error loading media file.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.800
Wonderful.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.100
Nice. Yes.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.400
Let's see.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.370
Let's try it one more time.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.200
There we go.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.260
Cue it up.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:17.740
&gt;&gt; If you click on
select [inaudible].

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:35.510
&gt;&gt; Yes. I want you to look
at him though and listen.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:49.040
[ Music ]

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.800
So when you hear that knocking
it's him hitting the side

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.890
of the shadow puppet box and
that wakes the puppets up

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.510
and invites the gods
to descend into them.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:12.880
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.020
&gt;&gt; I will.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.510
I will. Look at him now.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:12:13.970
[ Music ]

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.270
So there were moments in there

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:23.930
where I think you can
see it represents wind,

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.840
represents water,
represents land.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.470
And then what he would do
is he would sing the scene

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.640
for [inaudible] and he
chose some special texts

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.190
for these performances based
on a legend called Sutasoma.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.100
A story called Sutasoma.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.940
Normally it's a different
text that's used,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.830
but he took this text from
this story, and the author

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.370
or the scribe that
set this version

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.900
of Sutasoma has been informing
Pat Gutsi's experimental work.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.420
So we wanted to start from there
so you have a sense of the kind

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.050
of evolution from
the traditional text

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.770
to the experimental work that
we'll show later at the end.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.170
And I'll slide through the
translations of the [inaudible]

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.520
that he's going to sing.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.510
That would be the next
session of the shadow play.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.400
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: I'm going
to talk today about the story

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.060
of Sutasoma and the place
and describe [inaudible]

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.400
who played the story
through his poetry.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.770
During the [inaudible] in
the central Balinese kingdom

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.970
of [inaudible], Sutasoma
is believed

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.870
to be the grandson
of [inaudible].

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:45.190
The last king mentioned in
the Hindu Mahabharata epic.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:50.480
The story combines elements
of Hinduism and Buddhism

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.230
and Sutasoma himself is
thought to be the [inaudible].

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:59.360
The supreme Buddha in the
[inaudible] tradition.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.610
Today the story is well-known in
Bali especially in the village

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:10.310
of [inaudible] with its
history of Buddhists priests.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:17.390
And among the flowers
[inaudible] that combines Hundi,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:24.580

As this thing from
Indian tradition

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.000
because it combines
many different beliefs

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.230
and for most religious
pluralism.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:47.170
The story of Sumasota begins
with Purusada, an honorable king

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.800
who enjoys hunting [inaudible].

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.710
This is Purusada.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.660
Purusada enjoyed eating the
animals he hunted and one day

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.730
of his assistants accidentally
cut his finger while cooking the

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:16.360
animal he cut bleeding
into the food.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.750

the most delicious and it awoke

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.500
So the assistant
cut his own fingers.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.900
Not [inaudible].

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.370
&gt;&gt; Gusti Puti Sudarta: He
became addicted to the taste

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.050
of human flesh and begin

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:45.040
to become a cruel ruler
enforcing corporal punishment

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.000
to feed his habit.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.180
Slowly he became
[inaudible], an ogre.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:57.740
One day, [inaudible] endured
himself in [inaudible]

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:02.040
so he asked for help

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.730
from [inaudible] the
god of time and death.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:15.700
Kali demanded the corpses
of 100 kings in [inaudible]

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:22.040
and so [inaudible] begin to
wage war across the country

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.920
in the form of the
[inaudible] ogre, [inaudible].

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.330
[Inaudible] like that.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:47.950
[ Laughter ]

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.960
Eventually Kali demanded
Sutasoma,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.800
the king of the [inaudible]
as a sacrifice as well.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.520
[Inaudible] as you know is
very handsome king like that.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.320
[Inaudible].

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:15.040
[ Singing ]

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.250
Very handsome and
very fine character.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.300
So Sutasoma's brother-in-law
Dasabahu,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.570
this character Dasabahu.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:36.020
[Inaudible].

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:42.930
Dasabahu was given a
bone by Lord Brahma

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:47.730
and Purusada was given a
bone by Lord [inaudible],

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.140
a manifestation of Shiva.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.370
Because they were
both very powerful,

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:58.040
they were destroy
the environment.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.190
It looked like a
nuclear wasteland.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.250
Eventually Purusada
defeated Dasabahu.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:10.000
When Sutasoma came out of
the court to face Prusada,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.480
all of the flowers
begin to bloom again.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:19.080
The aura of the Buddha
brought the land back to life.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.700
When Purusada saw this
he suddenly became aware

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.830
of what he had become and
asked, "Why have I done this?

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.230
Why have I become [inaudible]?"

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.020
Purusada begged Sutasoma
for forgiveness and asked

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.330
to become his disciple.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.630
But Sutasoma first
offered himself a sacrifice

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.820
to [inaudible] who
became an innermost dragon

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.120
in [inaudible] and swallow him.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:59.510
[Inaudible] already transformed
to be the giant dragon.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:12.310
[ Growling ]

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:24.170
Just as he swallowed
Sutasoma's feet [inaudible]

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:30.150
that time cannot eat Suma
because it's the Buddha.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.580
It transcends time itself
and so like Purusada

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.240
and [inaudible] begged
for forgiveness and asked

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.250
to become his disciple.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:49.640
The story of Sutasoma includes
very important poem called the

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.510
[inaudible] structures
[inaudible].

00:24:52.510 --> 00:25:01.040
[ Singing ]

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.240
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: This is a very
creative translation here.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.320
It's said that there
are two truths.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.510
One known as Buddha
and one as Shiva.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:16.040
[ Singing ]

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.730
And they appear different

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:22.510
but in fact spiritual truth
cannot be split in two.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:32.260
[ Singing ]

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.300
Truly the essence of
Buddhism and Shivaism are one.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.100
The deepest truth.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:46.040
[ Singing ]

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.630
It's difference is
only apparent.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.420
In diversity there is oneness.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.340
An essence that cannot
be divided

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.730
because it encompasses
everything.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.250
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: In Bali
this poem is often sung during

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.550
the [inaudible].

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.250
It evokes a feeling

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.680
of a beautiful blooming
spring transition.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.750
Now this idea of
religious pluralism,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.550
[inaudible] essential
oneness has in my opinion,

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:19.280
a very strong moral
ethics and it relates

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:27.190
to [inaudible] political
and historical context.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.390
[Inaudible] outside the
court during the rule

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:34.410
of [inaudible] whose prime
minister [inaudible] wanted

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.960
to expand the [inaudible] empire
through military expedition.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.400
[Inaudible] didn't agree with
this military state approach.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.330
He thought that [inaudible]
could expand through hearts

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.270
and minds, through
diplomacy rather than force.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.950
He believed that force
would only lead to problems

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.490
and temporary [inaudible].

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.060
And this is exactly
what happened

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.510
in [inaudible] military
expedition

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.810
in Bali in [inaudible].

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:12.190
[Inaudible] thought
that religious tolerancy

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.530
and pluralism was an
essential part of diplomacy.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.770
He followed the Buddhist
tradition but was open

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.780
to the Shiva teachings.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.490
[Inaudible] himself was Hindu
while [inaudible] was Buddhist

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.730
with some Chinese ancestry.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.540
The eventual collapse of
the [inaudible] empire

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.910
in the 15th century was partly
due to the religious tension

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.970
between the Hindu
rulers [inaudible]

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:47.120
and his Muslim son [inaudible].

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.730
Indonesia independence.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.980
[Inaudible] Indonesia
[inaudible] incorporates many

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.650
concepts from the Sutasoma story

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.960
in developing the
nation's philosophy.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.220
This is clearly seen in
the [inaudible] principles,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:08.330
[inaudible] first expressed
by [inaudible] in 1945,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.920
[inaudible] believed in one God.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.220
[Inaudible].

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.580
A unified Indonesia.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.790
[Inaudible], democracy, and
[inaudible] social justice.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.800
These five principles
are displayed

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.450
under the national motto of
[inaudible] united in diversity.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.590
The relationship
between the [inaudible]

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.790
and bravery expressed in
Sutasoma is symbolized

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.960
in the Indonesian flag.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:41.800
The white symbolizing
[inaudible] position

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.100

If you have a [inaudible] you
can avoid the need for violence.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.500
[Inaudible] without
[inaudible] creates confusion.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.890
Religious pluralism.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:56.680
Adopting the principles
of religious tolerancy

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:02.690
and pluralism from Sutasoma was
a strategic move for [inaudible]

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.580
who was attempting to
unite the inhabitants

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:12.370
of [inaudible] Islands
representing hundreds

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:17.890
of ethnicities, language, and
culture in a single new nation.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.440
But a spirit of [inaudible]
tolerancy was already present

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.330
in many of these cultures.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.270
My father who lived from 1917

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:34.340
and 2004 was a traditional
healer,

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.760
village priest, and
a [inaudible].

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:46.040
In his personal library, he had
many traditional Balinese Hindu

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.950
and Buddhist parliament
manuscripts, Christian text,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:58.920
[inaudible] text, Islamic texts
including the Javanese written

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.650
by [inaudible], and
writings by [inaudible].

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:10.150
His attitude wasn't
dogmatic or fanatical.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.710
If he thought a text

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:21.650
or tradition includes valuable
teachings he would adopt them.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.950
He would say [inaudible].

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.120
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Which
we didn't translate.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.750
That means it's got
great stuff in it.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.900
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: I
do not think he was unusual

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.290
for his generation.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:40.700
I know of many other Balinese
who read a similar combination

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.300
of texts from several
religious traditions.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.780
In fact, in Bali there
is a strong tradition

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.250
of religious pluralism in
connection between Hindu

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.510
and Muslim communities.

There's a good example
that Pat Gutsi found

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.890
and he posted it on Facebook.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.010
So we'll see if we can -- yes.

This was just posted
a couple of days ago.

but I love Indonesian Facebook.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.350

I mean these lines are
right out of Sutasoma.

&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: Yes.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.650
There is an Islamic
neighborhood that participates

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.710
in the temple ceremony
of their Hindu neighbors.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.420
The Muslims often
perform their [inaudible]

in the Hindu temple ceremonies.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.370
And the Hindu's bring a frame

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.380
to the Islamic community
on the holy days.

in 1999 after considerable
violence.

Following the [Inaudible]

there has been an increasing

While Sutasoma was perform

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.010
it fell out of favor

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.220
It was considered
too hippy today.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.670

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.990

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.310
As my father used to say,
a poor man [inaudible].

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:48.000
What is it you can take home you
cannot take home a puppeteer,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.250
fancy techniques
or beautiful voice,

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:54.640
but you can take home
his philosophicalism.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.200
In a way stories like
Sutasoma [inaudible]

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:03.900
in which there is the bit about
the marriage and commonalities

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.170
of different [inaudible]
teaching.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.040
We learn how to think
on our own.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.200
To make our own personal
relationship of [inaudible]

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:20.740
but [inaudible] is open
[inaudible] with ethnicity

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.180
and [inaudible] political power.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:27.040
There is also an increasing
fundamentalist tendency towards

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.370
[inaudible] pure
[inaudible] teachings either

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.900
in Arabic Islam or [inaudible].

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:37.870
[Inaudible] of the unique
Indonesian adaptation

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.930
of those tradition.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.880
I worry that there are
[inaudible] political

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.790
[inaudible], the unique
philosophical basis

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.580
of the nation.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.020
They have gotten the kingdoms
like [inaudible] was manipulated

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.640
in setting power and wealth.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.490
The closer of two power you
get, the more [inaudible]

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.930
and dogmatic composition

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:09.100
about religion become
as in Jakarta today.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.400
[Inaudible].

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.700
This is the situation

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.790
that inspired my
experiential theater work,

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:21.850
[inaudible] which I originally
composed for my master thesis

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:27.190
with studying at the Institute
of the Art in [inaudible].

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.360
I have seen revised and
perform the works [inaudible].

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.570
My idea was to imagine
[inaudible] and the condition

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.380
that inspired him to set
the story of Sutasoma.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.480
My regiment includes element
of Balinese and Javanese Hindu,

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.020
Buddhist, and Islamic
music and instruments.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.580
I use Balinese [inaudible]
and [inaudible] used

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.730
by Muslim communities in Bali.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:59.180
I also used the [inaudible]
that Indonesian Muslim use

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:05.340
for the call to prayer
in the mosque.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:12.200
Some of my [inaudible] critique
this approach and accommodate

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.730
that I erase the Muslim
aspect of the music

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:19.130
but I think they
missed the point.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:25.480
Audience enthusiastically
accepted this [inaudible].

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:31.160
The focal of [inaudible] I use
is to create a setting of poetry

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.170
from the [inaudible], but
using Muslim instruments

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:39.230
from Indonesia in the
focus style influenced

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:43.070
by Pakistani [inaudible]
Muslim [inaudible] music.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.000
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Give me a
minute while I try to do this.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:09.940
[ Music ]

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:18.120
So there is the [inaudible]

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.380
in the back [inaudible]
tradition [inaudible].

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.470
[Inaudible] these guys
are from [inaudible].

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.510
These guys are Hindu.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:58.880
[ Music ]

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.750
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: The piece
combines extreme [inaudible]

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.110
and mask dancing.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.750
The [inaudible] was performed
using two [inaudible]

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.530
for the performance including
a [inaudible] as the source

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.800
of the flowering
[inaudible] of world religion.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.830
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: So yes,
there was an innovative --

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:26.290
obviously this is innovative.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.040
There's several screens.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.600
There are dancers, but there are
also new puppets that were made.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.100
And so, this puppet
includes an image

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.490
of [inaudible], the
ultimate deity.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:57.460
You'll notice the
symbols around it.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:33.910
There's many complaints
about the videography.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:41:04.530
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: Near
the end of the performance,

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.610
important [inaudible]

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:14.580
by practicing your
[inaudible], he is vilified.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.650
He is visited by the
character's [inaudible] in Bali,

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.610
a court jester who is
actually a wise god.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.720
An incarnation of
Shiva who helps

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.370
to guide humans throughout
their dharma.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.180
[Inaudible] important to
compose and arrange the story

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:38.030
of Sutasoma to help deliver
the nation from disaster.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:45.020
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: And this
will be the last example --

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:54.630
I need to find it here.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.510
Then we can open it
up for questions.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:03.370
It doesn't preview.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:12.610
Okay. Bear with me for a minute.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.910
[Inaudible].

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.650
And that's your niece?

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:17.950
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta: Yes.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.250
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Okay.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:24.740
Let's see if it's in this one.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:31.610
Divided up the files strangely
when we loaded it on the PC.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:37.290
So here is [inaudible] in Bali.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:42.250
The [inaudible] version is
called [inaudible] who appears

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:49.700
to be a court jester just kind
of a funky guy not very refined

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:55.200
but in fact he's an incarnation
of Shiva to help from below kind

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.160
of guide people to
the proper dharma.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.410
And he appears in the show

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:06.520
to help [inaudible] set
and express Sutasoma.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:46.110
So now there's a kind
of theatrical transition

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.920
in which Gutsi appears
now as [inaudible]

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:58.310
but in the mask dance version
who then has the interaction

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:06.790
with Tantula now represented
as a shadow puppet.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:22.110
And this music we're not
discussing this today,

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:29.380
but this music is quite
[inaudible] as well.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:35.870
Okay. We'll end it there.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:53.400
Thank you very much and if you
have questions for Pat Gutsi.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:45:06.780
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:12.430
So Bali is this tiny
island in a Muslim nation

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:27.360
of that has 1700 islands

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:42.480
and is pretty much the largest
Muslim country in the world

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.100
or maybe the second largest.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:55.290
And since the 1990s we
have these tensions,

00:45:55.290 --> 00:46:02.170
these religious tensions
globally, and you only have

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:07.020
to think of [inaudible]
right now.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:12.030
So I'm wondering Bali has this
unique fusion of Hinduism,

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:17.410
Buddhism, and what's
the other one?

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.420
Islam of course.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.590
And Islam is a dominant
religion and sort of Muslim.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.770
Bali is this tiny
island surrounded

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.260
by this huge Muslim country.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:33.450
So to what extent are your
wonderful traditions threated

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:40.500
by the current political events?

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:51.960
To what extent are there
tensions within Indonesia

00:46:51.960 --> 00:47:03.530
that threaten the
continuation of your tradition?

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:06.510
No. It's not this
feeling of threat.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.300
Not yet.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.470
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Well,
I'll just add one thing.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:15.490
I've never really been
able to wrap my head

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:17.130
around the description
of Indonesia

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.240
which you often hear
is the world's largest

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.100
or most populous Muslim nation.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.970
So much is left out of
that description it's kind

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:32.360
of like saying America has the
most Americans of any country.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:38.680
There is different kinds of
Islam in Indonesia and a lot

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.820
of it, especially in central
Java is very [inaudible],

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.800
and obviously it's weird
for me to talk about this

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.670
because it's offending
the audience.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:51.500
So it's a very localized
form of Hinduism.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.110
I've been in mosques in
central Java that have painted

00:47:55.110 --> 00:48:00.030
around the interior the
story of the [inaudible].

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:02.820
The [inaudible], the shadow
puppeteers in central Java --

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.120
&gt;&gt; Muslim.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.650
&gt;&gt; -- most of them
are Hindu and most

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.820
of their audience is Muslim.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.780
So it's a very complicated
scene and a lot of --

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.570
even though there are problems
of terminology in Bali,

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.640
there are many Balinese
with names like Madai

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.940
which is a [inaudible] --

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.220
it's a form of birth
order naming in Bali.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.390
They'll have a name like Madai
Mohammed because they're Islamic

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.100
and maybe they have some
[inaudible] ancestry

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.950
but they've been there for
hundreds and hundreds of years

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:42.400
and they have these
long-standing pretty positive

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.740
relationships with their
neighbors of different faiths.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:57.370
So I think there was a sense of
threat after the bombing in 2002

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:05.010
in Bali because it was a
fundamentalism [inaudible]

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:06.540
in Kuta.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:18.090
But nothing - I was there at the
time and there wasn't violence

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:22.270
against Muslims that I saw.

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.170
Thank you.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:32.890
&gt;&gt; I [inaudible] because Islam
is the dominant [inaudible] more

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.650
Islamic than any other religion.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.640
[Inaudible] that's where they
have those kind of [inaudible]

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:46.190
and they show it in the
building address and everything.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.500
It look more like
[inaudible]Islam [inaudible].

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:56.100
I can [inaudible] I
see all the manuscripts

00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.550
which are [inaudible]
collections

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:04.390
and [inaudible] language

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:08.290
and they [inaudible] Islamic
[inaudible]but maybe that's what

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:09.800
it is [inaudible].

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.600
&gt;&gt; Isn't Hinduism pretty unique

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.890
to Indonesia just
focusing on Bali?

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:25.280
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Well, it's
multiple waves, and it was never

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:43.090
through - there doesn't seem to
be a lot of historical evidence

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:49.480
for strong armed prelatizing
before the Dutch arrived

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.880
as a colonial power.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:51:00.420
But I mean since probably before
the 5th century there's been

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.670
Hindu influence, of course,
[inaudible] all these issues

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:07.240
with naming and colonial
naming and religious practices.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:12.080
But there's also quite an
[inaudible] tradition throughout

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.380
that area.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.990
So this summer I was sitting
in a village called [inaudible]

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:20.270
which is [inaudible] village or
sometimes incorrectly described

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.640
as pre-Hindu village
[inaudible].

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.750
But it's more around would
you call it certain sects.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.060
So that village is
an Indra sect.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:37.330
So and they identify with
Indra but they have a lot

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:41.700
of what appear to be
Austronesian or even kind

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.340
of Polynesian or Hawaiian
type cultural practices there

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.460
and [inaudible] in
these kinds of temples.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.820
And I think - it partly had
to do with the Dutch coming

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.160
from that direction and
that conditioned a view

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.460
of their place like Bali.

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.110
Had they come from Hawaii first,

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.960
they might have seen a
lot more Austronesian

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.780
or Polynesian practice
in a lot of this.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.150
But it's very [inaudible].

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:11.560
It's very mixed and I think
what Pat Gutsi is responding

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:19.570
with a critical eye
against is this eye looking

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.580
out for a so-called pure
versions through which

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:29.400
to correct or improve
what has proven over time

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:35.170
to be a quite resilient form
of religious practice in Bali.

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:39.290
Am I putting words in
your mouth [inaudible]?

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.210
Elizabeth.

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.510
&gt;&gt; Yes. So thank you.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.820
It was wonderful.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.310
So this is really
awe-inspiring in the way

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:54.580
that the [inaudible]
ideals are really elevated

00:52:54.580 --> 00:53:03.110
through the interfaith diversity
mixture that this is showing.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:06.100
And in some ways
it's so impressive

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.260
because the traditions
are so strong.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.670
So that in the - in one sense,

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:16.700
the [inaudible] is
always evolving

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.420
and traditions are always
evolving and melding

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:25.060
with one another, but
in another way you kind

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:33.600
of need some traditional
form and order for something

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.470
like this to be so
kind of so well.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:45.430
So I'm wondering if you can talk

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:51.420
about the experimental
[inaudible] as a separate genre

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:58.110
versus kind of the slow
evolution of practices.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:59.410
&gt;&gt; Gutsi Putu Sudarta:
The new creation

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.770
of [inaudible] in Bali today.

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:04.150
They say the basic, the roots

00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:09.600
from the [inaudible] shadow
puppet performance like that.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:16.490
And we bring [inaudible]
context with the new idea

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:20.320
and new element and new
[inaudible] also like that,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.330
and we [inaudible] to
be the new [inaudible].

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:28.600
&gt;&gt; So every generation - because
every generation thought along

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:35.900
those lines or can you
define this as kind

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:43.310
of a new thing that's happening?

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.610
&gt;&gt; If I -

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:53.270
&gt;&gt; We can say that in the shadow
puppet tradition, they help also

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:58.760
like new creation in the
context of frame tradition,

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.220
but the other side if there
are new experimental creation

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:04.520
like that.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.220
For example, when I
collaboration with my friend

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.370
in [inaudible] doing
the new performance,

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:13.000
[inaudible], this is very good.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.380
The new element like the video
graphics like [inaudible]

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.680
and many things new [inaudible],

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.730
but I think the most important
is how I keep the [inaudible]

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.870
of my tradition and I bring

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:31.140
to the [inaudible] the most
important sense of tradition.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.520
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Yes we were
talking on the drive up here.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.360
There's a major new
shadow puppet collection

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:45.120
from Germany that's just
been donated to Yale.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:50.150
And a friend of ours is
up there and going through

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.580
and posting all these pictures.

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:59.310
And there was this picture of
how they put the box together,

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:06.020
and there was like
a spring in there.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:11.730
It looked like it was
from the 30s or 40s,

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:21.390
and there was a spring in there
and I thought what is this?

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.290
How they were putting
it all together,

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.310
and he was explaining oh
the way we hid the box now

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.670
and the way we put
it all together,

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:29.970
that just emerged
four years ago.

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.950
And there are these new kind
of [inaudible] techniques.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:36.210
And for me, I mean, this
is part of my experience

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:39.240
as an American everything
is tradition and ancient

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.370
and wonderful and beautiful,
and I'm constantly having this

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.740
like oh that's brand new.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.040
That's okay.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.360
And reminding myself
that's okay.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.730
That's still totally valid.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:52.540
I think part of the
difference here is

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:57.370
that new technology is
available, the projection,

00:56:57.370 --> 00:56:59.210
and they're available
everywhere.

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:01.270
And at this point, they're
available everywhere more

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.170
or less at the same time.

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:06.100
So you get experiments in
California and Australia

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:10.010
and Bali with shadows and
projections and graphics

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.750
at almost the same time.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:18.620
&gt;&gt; I think you also look
at it as a form of theater.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.520
It's different than the form
of theater we're accustomed to.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.580
Our theater is not [inaudible]

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:29.960
so why would you expect
theirs to [inaudible]?

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:32.670
&gt;&gt; Andy McGraw: Right.

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:33.970
Other questions?

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:39.540
&gt;&gt; I think the way I see it is
that in Bali the tradition is

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.070
so old and everybody,
all the Balinese,

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:49.280
the Hindu Balinese are
practicing it every hour

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.330
of the day.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:55.780
So when they wake up, they
have all the tradition

00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.150
to give to whoever it is.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:07.160
They have what do you call them,
they have offering everywhere.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.910
So the tradition is very strong.

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:16.220
And so that's why nobody - you
know, you have so many tourists

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:26.620
and whatever, but it's very
strong so nobody can touch it.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.170
And when they dance
and [inaudible]

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:35.150
and everything it's all to God.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:38.700
It's all for their God.

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.790
You know, it's not
for the people.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:42.510
It's for God.

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:48.030
And so, everything is for God,
and it's very [inaudible].

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:54.330
And they practice every day,
every minute, every hour.

00:58:54.330 --> 00:59:00.110
It's the practice is
very - I mean it's -

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:04.600
so nobody can touch it and
everybody leave them alone.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.500
Is that correct?

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:15.200
Yes. But you go there, you see
all the offering everywhere,

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.500
and [inaudible].

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:22.460
You know like the one
[inaudible] the priest went

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.860
up to see what's going on.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.130
&gt;&gt; Even though it's
about to explode.

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:30.430
Yes.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:34.820
&gt;&gt; In spite of the technology
and everything, he wasn't afraid

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.460
to go up because he wanted

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:44.160
to do his own thing
according to his religion.

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.750
So that's how I see it.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:49.520
I don't know whether
I'm correct or not.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:55.160
&gt;&gt; What I'm always
fascinated with is this - yes,

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.950
there's a lot of [inaudible].

00:59:56.950 --> 01:00:00.200
There's a lot of just
doing of the religions.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.630
The making of the
offerings and the praying,

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.910
the temple ceremonies
it's every exhausting.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:12.900
And yet, I'm always meeting
people that - a cab driver

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.900
on the way to the airport
after research this summer was

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.870
from this traditional
village where I was sitting,

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:22.250
but he was really getting
into this new Buddhist text

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.020
that was coming out of
being published in China.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.540
It was kind of being introduced
into Indonesia, and he wanted

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.200
to ask me about had I ever been

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.200
to a charismatic Christian
service and what's that like?

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.080
I mean, my experience as
an American is you're kind

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.870
of totally assimilated
and there's not a lot

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:44.430
of critical thought
or you reject it all

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.940
and you're completely
idiosyncratic

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.480
and you don't even
have a [inaudible].

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.010
And to find people that are part
of very structured communities

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:58.350
and yet have a real critical eye
and they're saying it's almost

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:00.110
like they're in a buffet.

01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:04.270
I'll take a little bit of
this and a little bit of that.

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:08.380
And maybe 10 years later, I'm
going to be a different person

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:14.970
and I would have
learned other things.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:20.410
And I'll evolve as a spiritual
being even though I'm still

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.800
doing these things within
a particular community.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.090
And for me as an American
that's so unique and different

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:31.030
and I kind of have this
hang up and jealousy.

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:32.810
&gt;&gt; If we had that
on a global level,

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.660
we would be in a
different state.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:39.520
&gt;&gt; Yes. Any other questions?

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.660
Great. Let's give Pat Gutsi a -

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:50.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:53.920
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
