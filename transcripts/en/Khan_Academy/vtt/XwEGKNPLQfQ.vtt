00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:03.869
- [Instructor] A 20-meter ladder
is leaning against a wall.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:07.650
The distance X of T between
the bottom of the ladder

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.989
and the wall is increasing at a rate

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.235
of three meters per minute.

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:14.818
At a certain instant T sub zero

00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:20.219
the top of the ladder is
a distance Y of T sub zero

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.212
of 15 meters from the ground.

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:26.440
What is the rate of change of the angle

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.954
theta of T between the ground

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.664
and the ladder at that instant?

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.058
So what I want to do is draw this out.

00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:36.303
And really, the first
step is to think about,

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.223
well, what equation will be helpful

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.603
for us to solve this problem.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.219
And then we might just go ahead and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.513
actually solve the problem.

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:45.154
So a 20-meter ladder is
leaning against a wall.

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:48.782
So let me draw ourselves a wall here.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.115
That is my wall.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.477
Now let me draw our 20-meter ladder.

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:57.644
So maybe it looks something like that.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:59.722
So that is 20

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.567
meters.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.251
They say the distance X
of T between the bottom

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.759
of the ladder and the wall.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.744
So, this distance right over here.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:09.577
This is

00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:13.208
this distance right over here is

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:14.041
X of T.

00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:16.898
They say it's increasing at a rate of

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:18.340
three meters per minute.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.654
So, we know that we could either say

00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:23.374
X prime of T, which is the same thing

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:24.207
as DX DT.

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:28.030
Is equal to three meters,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.171
I'll write it out because
it's hard if I said M per M

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.133
it might not be that clear.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.363
Meters per minute, so they give us

00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:36.386
that piece of information.

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:39.287
So the rate of change of
X, with respect to time,

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:40.890
they gave us that.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.318
At a certain sub T sub zero

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:45.638
the top of the ladder is a distance

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:46.799
of 15 meters.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.983
So the top of the ladder, so
let's make this very clear.

00:01:49.983 --> 00:01:52.070
So, this distance

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.113
right

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.560
over here

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.393
is Y of T.

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:58.253
Y of T.

00:01:58.253 --> 00:02:01.406
And they say, at time T sub zero

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.549
Y of T is 15 meters.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.772
So let me just write it
in here, Y of T sub zero

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:08.919
is equal to 15 meters.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.278
And so, maybe let me write
this right over here.

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:14.271
This is Y of T sub zero.

00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:16.398
Let's just assume that we're drawing it

00:02:16.398 --> 00:02:18.322
at that moment T sub zero, because I think

00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:19.588
that's going to be important.

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:22.088
Y of T sub zero is equal to 15

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:24.415
meters.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.364
So they want to know,
what is the rate of change

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:28.995
of the angle theta between
the ground and the ladder.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:31.203
And this is saying theta
is also going to change

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:32.296
with respect to time.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.114
There's going to be a function of time

00:02:34.114 --> 00:02:36.617
between the ground and the
ladder at that instant.

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:39.608
So theta, get a new color here.

00:02:39.608 --> 00:02:42.543
Theta is this angle right
over here, this is theta.

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:44.603
And it's also going to
be a function of time.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:46.720
So, what we'll always want to do in these

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.834
related rates problems is we want to

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:52.344
set up an equation, and
really, an algebraic equation

00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:54.475
maybe a little bit of
trigonometry involved.

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:56.515
That relates the things
that we care about.

00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:58.130
And then we're likely to have to take

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.850
the derivative of both sides of that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.015
in order to relate the related rates.

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.202
So let's see.

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:05.545
We want to know

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:08.160
we want to know the rate of change

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.868
of the angle between

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.417
the ground and the ladder at that instant.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:13.562
So what we need to figure out

00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:18.094
we want to figure out,
theta prime, at T sub zero.

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:20.811
This is what we want to figure out.

00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:22.953
Now, they've given us
some interesting things,

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.078
they've given us, I
guess, our rate of change

00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:27.459
of X with perspective time is constant

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.714
at three meters per minute.

00:03:29.714 --> 00:03:32.881
And, we know what Y is at that moment.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.911
So let's see, can we create a relationship

00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.883
because they gave us DX DT

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:40.557
it'll actually be more useful

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:44.051
to find a relationship
between X and theta,

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.013
and then take the
derivative of both sides.

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:48.287
And then use this information possibly

00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:50.372
to figure out what the appropriate

00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:52.310
value of X or theta is

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.423
at that moment.

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:54.438
So let's do that.

00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:57.030
So how does X relate to theta?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.765
Well, we use a little bit of

00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:00.362
trigonometry right over here.

00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:02.675
If you took the hypotenuse

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.758
times the cosine of theta

00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:08.041
you would get X.

00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.741
So let me write this right up here, X of T

00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:12.310
X of T

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.711
is equal to

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.094
the hypotenuse

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:17.404
20 meters, because that's
the length of the ladder,

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:18.737
times the cosine

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:21.227
cosine of theta.

00:04:22.073 --> 00:04:24.304
And I can say the cosine of theta of T

00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:26.087
just to make it clear that this

00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:27.312
is a function of time.

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:30.114
This comes straight out of trigonometry.

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:32.787
Actually, our basic trig, trigonometric

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:34.261
function definitions.

00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:36.964
Now, why is this useful, why
do I think this is useful?

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.864
Well let's think about
what happens when I take

00:04:38.864 --> 00:04:41.668
the derivative of both
sides using the chain rule.

00:04:41.668 --> 00:04:44.444
On the left hand side, I am going to have

00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:45.777
an X prime of T.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:49.474
And then that's going to
be equal to, what do I end

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:51.270
up with on the right hand side?

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.240
Well, using the chain
rule, first, I'll take

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.522
the derivative with respect to theta.

00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:57.133
And so that's just going to be

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.466
negative 20 sine

00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:02.499
of

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:03.416
theta of T.

00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:06.223
And I need to multiple that

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.140
times theta prime of T.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.748
So what I can do is, say hey look,

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:16.052
at T sub zero, I know
what X prime of T is.

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:19.355
I could try to figure out
what sine of theta of T is

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.845
and then I'll just solve for this

00:05:21.845 --> 00:05:22.845
right over there.

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:24.140
So let's do that.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.557
So, at T sub zero

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.214
so at T is equal to

00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:30.131
T sub zero.

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.230
What we're gonna have X prime of T.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.500
Well that, at every time,
it's three meters per minute

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.974
we'll assume that our rates
are in meters per minute.

00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:39.990
And just our values are in meters

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.403
when we're talking about distance

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:42.702
and our angles are in radians.

00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:46.191
So, this is going to be equal to three

00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:47.763
is equal to

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:48.680
negative 20

00:05:50.744 --> 00:05:53.078
times sine of theta of T

00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:55.491
times the derivative of
data with respect to time.

00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:57.707
So, how do we figure
out what sine of theta

00:05:57.707 --> 00:05:59.617
of T is going to be?

00:05:59.617 --> 00:06:03.369
Well, let's just use that
other information they gave us.

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:05.319
And I'm gonna scroll down a little bit

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.140
to get a little bit more real estate.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.481
So sine of theta, let
me write it over here.

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.100
Sine

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.933
of theta

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:17.349
at time T sub not,
that's what we care about

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.043
T is equal to T sub not.

00:06:19.043 --> 00:06:21.602
What's that gonna be?

00:06:21.602 --> 00:06:23.754
Well sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:06:23.754 --> 00:06:25.935
So that's gonna be Y

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:27.498
at T sub not.

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:29.483
Over our hypotenuse

00:06:29.483 --> 00:06:30.566
of 20 meters.

00:06:32.175 --> 00:06:34.881
Well that's going to be equal to

00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:36.685
that's going to be equal to, they tell us,

00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.030
Y of T sub not is 15 meters

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.280
over 20 meters.

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:44.224
Which is the same thing as three fourths.

00:06:44.224 --> 00:06:46.638
So, by this yellow
information, they actually

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:48.677
told us that this right over here

00:06:48.677 --> 00:06:51.594
is going to be equal to three fourths.

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:53.974
So this times three fourths

00:06:53.974 --> 00:06:56.325
times the rate of change

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:57.158
of theta

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.823
with respect to T.

00:06:59.823 --> 00:07:02.753
And so now we just have to
solve for this and we're done.

00:07:02.753 --> 00:07:04.659
So, this is going to be what's

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.298
negative 20 times three fourths?

00:07:07.298 --> 00:07:08.965
That is negative 15.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.690
That is negative 15.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.233
If we divide both sides by negative 15

00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:16.311
we get

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.926
theta prime of T is equal to

00:07:18.926 --> 00:07:20.843
three over negative 15.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.750
Three over negative 15.

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:28.466
Which is the same thing as being equal to

00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:30.405
negative one fifth.

00:07:30.405 --> 00:07:32.606
And this, the units here would be in

00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:34.920
radians per minute.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.277
Because our rates are all in per minute.

00:07:37.277 --> 00:07:40.825
So, if I wanted to I could write radians

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:41.658
per

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:43.800
minute.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.587
Ideally I would write it

00:07:45.587 --> 00:07:46.616
right over here.

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:47.636
But here you go.

00:07:47.636 --> 00:07:51.239
We were able to figure out and
this is an interesting one.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:53.185
Because, they give you
that information on Y

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:54.573
but really, use that information of Y

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:55.959
to figure out what sine of theta of T is.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:59.976
But the equation you set
up involves X and theta.
