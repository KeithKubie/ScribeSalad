PAIGE BAILEY: Hi,
I'm Paige Bailey

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.150
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.040
Today, we're at the
TensorFlow Dev Summit

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.850
in Sunnyvale, California.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.000
And if you didn't
already know, TensorFlow

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.530
is an open source
machine learning

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.300
platform for everyone--

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.898
every skill level, every
industry, and every platform.

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:22.940
Whether you're deploying
a machine learning model

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.060
to a mobile device or training
a massive neural network

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.320
on a cluster of TPUs, TensorFlow
is an entire end-to-end machine

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.689
learning ecosystem for you.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.100
The full keynote from
today is linked below,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.670
but if you want just the
highlights, here they are--

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.340
the TensorFlow Dev
Summit top five.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.060
Number one, the TensorFlow
2.0 alpha release.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.090
This is really the biggest
announcement of the summit.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.110
TF 2.0 is all about making
TensorFlow simple and easy

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.180
to use with higher-level
APIs focused

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.690
on Keras and eager execution.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.440
Keras gives you the
ability to train

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.290
scalable, multi-platform
neural networks with less

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.380
than 10 lines of code.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.430
And if you need more
low-level functionality,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.160
you can use Keras's
subclassing capabilities,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.920
or go even deeper to
TensorFlow's core ops

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.460
with TF module.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010
And if you are a
fan of estimators,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.870
don't worry,
they're still around

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.930
and will continue to be for
the lifetime of TensorFlow 2.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.030
To migrate your existing
models to TensorFlow 2.0,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.040
we've created an upgrade
utility called TF Upgrade V2.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.870
From the command
line, you just input

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.710
a Python file or
a Jupyter Notebook

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.430
and a location for the
file to be exported.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.220
The file will be converted
along with a report.txt

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.022
that details changes
that were made

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:37.730
and recommends manual
changes that you'll

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.343
have to make yourself.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:41.510
And if you'd like to upgrade
your notebook on GitHub

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.748
in-place, check out
this bookmarklet

00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:46.040
created by one of our machine
learning Google Developer

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.050
Experts, Sergii Khomenko.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.010
Just replace github.com with
tf2up.ml, and there you go.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.200
The general release
of TensorFlow 2.0

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.530
is coming in Q2 later this
year, but try it out now

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.210
and make sure to
provide your feedback

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.400
to testing@tensorflow.org.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.760
Next up at number two are
the new online courses

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.092
from deeplearning.ai
and Udacity.

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:09.800
TensorFlow is
collaborating with partners

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.560
like Udacity,
deeplearning.ai and fast.ai

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.800
to foster the open source
machine learning ecosystem

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.490
and train the next generation
of machine learning developers.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.050
At the dev summit
this week, we're

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.720
excited to announce
two new courses focused

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.450
on the alpha release
of TensorFlow 2.0,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.450
as well as a complete
curriculum from MIT.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.230
Make sure to check out these
materials at no cost, created

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.390
alongside deep learning legends
like Sebastian Thrun and Andrew

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.136
Ng.

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:41.520
Number three on the list is
O'Reilly's TensorFlow World,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.260
which will be held in Santa
Clara the week of October 28.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.920
The vision is to bring together
the entire TensorFlow world--

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.770
practitioners, contributors,
machine learning experts,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.060
and enterprises--

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.650
to connect and to
learn from each other.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.800
The call for
proposals is open now,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.650
so make sure to submit
your talk ideas.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.440
And if you want a fully paid
trip to TensorFlow World,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.390
there's number
four on our list--

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.810
the PoweredByTF challenge.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.810
To enter, build a cool
example with TF 2.0

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.810
and add it to the
examples repo on GitHub.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.610
More details, of
course, can be found

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.120
at tensorflow.devpost.com.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120
And number five, the one
I'm most excited about.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.340
If you're a student
working in machine learning

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.750
or any other
academic discipline,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.310
this is your chance to work with
the TensorFlow team at Google

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.200
and get paid for it.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.710
You could work on anything from
TensorFlow.js to TensorFlow

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.260
Lite or even TensorFlow core--

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.880
the same machine
learning framework

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.550
used across Google in
products like Gmail, Photos,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.260
Search, and more.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.910
For all the announcements
and updates,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.897

the description below.

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:51.230
And on your way there, take
a moment to share this video

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.400
with your friends.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.930
They'll thank you
for it and we'll

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.020
thank you by doing more videos.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.770
I'm Paige Bailey for
"The Developer Show,"

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.080
and I'll see you next time.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.130
