(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:48.090
- Welcome to a Conversation
with History, I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.300
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.970
Our guest is George
Packer, his new book is

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.230
The Unwinding, an Inner
History of the New America.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.750
George, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.610
- It's great to be here.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.550
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.775
- Down in Stanford, the rival.

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.180
I grew up on campus, my parents
were both faculty members,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.490
and I lived 18 years in
that idyllic place before

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.180
leaving for good when I
graduated from high school.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.300
- And where were you educated?

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.040
- I went to Yale, I got
a B.A., went off to the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.970
Peace Corps in West Africa,
a little tiny village,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.713
and that was the end
of my formal education.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.290
- And your mother was a professor

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.020
of creative writing at Stanford.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.540
- Yes, she was a short
story writer, she still is.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.540
She actually just published
her latest book at age 87.

00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:41.760
And she taught in the english department

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.140
and ran the creative
writing program for a while.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.510
My father was in the law school,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.840
and then became an administrator.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.290
He was the vice provost just in time

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.880
for the revolution of '67, '68.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.720
So I grew up in a family of writers

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.314
and of politically-minded people.

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:05.130
- You have an earlier book
which I would like to talk about

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.350
because it's called Blood of the Liberals,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.350
it was published in 2000,
and it's a book about

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.480
your coming to terms with
the political tradition

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.470
that your family was a part of,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.470
both your grandfather was
an important progressive

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.280
congressman from Alabama, and your father

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.763
was a distinguished liberal lawyer.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:46.190
Talk a little about that,
because it was important for you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.190
to shape your identity, and
it's an elaborate process,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.470
looking back at the tradition
that they were a part of.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.470
- Yeah, my mother's
father, George Huddleston,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.070
was a Congressman from
Birmingham, Alabama,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.340
from Wilson to Roosevelt.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.670
And he came out of an
old tradition of populism

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
that goes back to
Jefferson, and forward to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.530
William Jennings Bryan
and Robert LeFollett.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.060
And his career is a reminder
that back in the teens

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.320
and 20s and 30s, there were real radicals

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.320
at the highest levels of
government, in Congress.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.030
And he was one of them, but his radicalism

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.350
was just as suspicious
of Roosevelt's new deal

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.560
as it was of J.P. Morgan and the trusts.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.560
So he ended up losing out
to a new dealer in 1936.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.450
So that is one strain of
liberalism in this country.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.700
It's very old, it flourished in

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.840
the South and in the Midwest.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.988
There's another strain which
is more urban and more modern,

00:03:57.988 --> 00:03:59.840
which my father represented.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.260
He was Jewish, he grew
up in the northeast,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.860
was one of the Jews to
survive the barriers

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.460
and get into Yale in spite of its quotas.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.530
He fought in World War II, and then he was

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.210
a legal scholar who ran
afoul of Herbert Hoover

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.790
and the witch hunters of the
50s because he wrote a book

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.710
about Alger Hiss and other ex-communists,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.710
and other communists who
were outed by ex-communists.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.330
His book didn't find his
innocent, but it was enough of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.103
a study of what went wrong
in the pursuit of the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.190
communists of that period
that it sort of branded him

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.140
a lefty, he was not, he was a liberal.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.270
My family is full of liberals,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.320
who are sort of the most vulnerable

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.760
political species in our country.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.760
And my father's career came
up against a different kind of

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.490
radicalism in the 60s, when he
was a Stanford Administrator

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.680
during the student revolution,
and that was kind of

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.000
the end of his career and
ultimately he fell ill with

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.260
a stroke, and that was
the end of his life, too.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.970
So the book, Blood of the
Liberals looks at these

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.090
past generations to try to
understand, how did liberalism

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.350
flourish and fail during the 20th century.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.300
So by the time I was an adult,
it hardly even seemed to have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.450
a pulse as a vibrant political
movement in this country.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.300
- And your family was very
much influenced by the events

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.000
at Stanford and the protests
against the Vietnam War

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in the sense that Stanford
was confronted by the new

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.053
radicalism that was emerging
in protest to the war.

00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:54.225
- Yeah, my father was a, he
was a believer in procedure.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:58.890
He was a scholar of criminal
law, he believed in argument.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.460
And what he found was, the
students who he was running

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.370
up against as an administrator
seemed to want to

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.510
dispense with reason
all together, which they

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.390
in some cases regarded
as like a tool of power.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.030
It was kinda the beginning
of post-modern critique of

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.060
the Enlightenment, and of
reason on the part of the Left.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.570
And for my father, this was abhorrent.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.883
He saw in their appeals
to feeling something

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.910
frighteningly like some of
the ideologies of Europe

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.080
that brought the continent
into a conflagration.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.080
So he was, he saw sit-ins as
being coercive, and against

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.350
the tradition of academic
and intellectual freedom.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.880
He was that kind of a
liberal, an ACLU liberal,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.880
a free speech liberal, but
not a believer in overthrowing

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.180
established institutions,
he was a reformed liberal.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.773
And that kind of liberal
died in the 60s and 70s,

00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.640
and in a sense we've been waiting

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.460
for its revival ever since.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.160
- You write, you say I was
trying to sift through the ruins

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.290
of liberalism to seek and
choose a new mode of politics,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.560
rather than live out
the one I was born to.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.330
So this...

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.923
Period that you were
coming to your maturity,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.760
really was a time in which
the world was coming apart,

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.480
politically and so on.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.350
- I had a strong sense as a child even

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.749
that the world was coming apart and that

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:49.749
the ideals and creed of my forefathers

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.750
was not strong enough to withstand it.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.740
When I was eight years
old, I was keenly aware

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.420
of the assassinations of King and Kennedy,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.093
the protests here at
Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.903
The Vietnam War, the body counts.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.390
Drugs and the Manson killings, and it just

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.720
seemed like society was coming apart.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.720
And my father's faith in
reason, I just had on an

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.260
elemental level a sense that
it didn't stand a chance.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.040
Without thinking it through in those terms

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.580
'cause I was only eight, I just feared

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.300
for the fragile world
that I had been born into,

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.720
that my parents had created
kind of as a shelter,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.370
as a protection for me and for my sister,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.740
it just didn't seem able to
stand up to what seemed like

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.783
a world going mad.

00:08:47.058 --> 00:08:52.058
- You say in addition, my
generation has no Jefferson

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.580
and no New Deal to set our compass by.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.413
- Right.

00:08:57.413 --> 00:09:02.413
And I think we've been, my
whole adult life, which,

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:05.310
if you look at 18 as the beginning of it,

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.310
has coincided with the
rise of conservative power

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.470
in Washington, and business
power across the country.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.810
I've been waiting for,
looking for, thinking about,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.650
how you could build a new
reformed liberal politics

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.650
on the bones of the old, of the
period from the progressives

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.500
through the New Deal, into
the post-war social contract.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.720
Which, I wasn't alive then
so I'm probably prone to

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.910
romanticizing and to
missing out on something,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.120
obviously there was massive injustice

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.350
committed against black Americans,

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.560
women had no opportunities,
gay Americans were non-people.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.680
But it was a social order that

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.090
had the tools of self-correction.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.610
The institutions were healthy
enough that they could

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.673
fix what was wrong, and
they did, they began to.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.910
I've seen those efforts at reform and at

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.593
creating more equal
opportunity rather than less,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.390
come up against the new power,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.830
which is not government, it's business.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
And I've been waiting for
a politician or a politics

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.320
to come up with a new
version, 'cause it never dies

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.630
completely, of what Jefferson and the

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.680
Progressives and Roosevelt created.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.260
We haven't seen it.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.450
I thought maybe in 2008 Barack
Obama was going to be that

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.380
politician, but I think he was up against

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.230
forces that were stronger than he is.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:50.550
- After your undergraduate work,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.570
you went on an odyssey, really.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.200
Let's talk a little about
that, because you end up

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.970
as a writer, but before you
did that, you essentially

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.090
were in the Peace Corps, you
worked in a homeless shelter --

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.080
- Worked in construction for a few years.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.040
- [Harry] Construction.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.040
- [George] Yeah.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.040
- And what did you learn
from that experience?

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.200
Clearly you learned to be
an observer at some point

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.130
of these different worlds
that were around you.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.967
- I think a key experience for me was

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:30.050
living in a little village
in Togo in West Africa.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.803
Totally on my own, no American near me.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.310
And trying to survive,
because I did not have

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.990
the inner resources that
it took to live in that

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.910
kind of alien environment,
in that kind of isolation.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.640
I was 22, all my life I had been

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.140
at one University or another.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.740
I'd been a good student, I had done well,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.480
I'd been rewarded, and suddenly there was

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.210
nothing like that to sustain me.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.640
And I guess I felt, to
survive I'm gonna have to

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.060
make connections to the
people in this village.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.060
And I did learn a lot about
how to listen to people

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.260
from very different
backgrounds and experiences.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.200
I was just intensely interested in them.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.483
And never stopped asking them questions.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.880
And it was partly because that
was the only companionship

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.160
I had, and partly 'cause it
seemed like my life had been

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.180
too limited, it was
necessary to kind of break it

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.220
in order to find out what
life was really about.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.380
It was sort of like someone from an

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.010
earlier generation maybe joining the army,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.550
or just going and
traveling around the world.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.550
And it damn near killed me,
but it was an incredible,

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.380
changing experience, and I think it was

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.313
the beginning of my becoming a writer.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.000
Learning to observe, learning
to in a sense suppress

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.240
my own inner reaction
enough that I could render

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.210
the visible world and the people around me

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.180
vividly and concretely, which
is what writers have to do.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.780
- And when you were at
the homeless shelter,

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.880
you talk about going home and doing notes,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.700
writing up what had happened.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.760
Did that actually start in
Africa, were you doing it then,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.740
or when did, because
clearly, as we'll talk about

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:30.740
in your new book, you really
have an enormous talent

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:35.640
for observing and then taking down

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.630
what you're observing and
what people are saying.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.640
- You know, I kept a journal
in Togo, but when I went

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.180
back to it in order to write
a book, 'cause my first book,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.730
The Village of Waiting, is
about those years in Africa,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.690
it was useless, it was just
a record of my feelings,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.090
and it turned out that my feelings

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.860
were not very interesting in retrospect.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.190
I remembered them, I knew what they were.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.910
But I also wrote lots of letters,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.020
and that was back when
letters were still written.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.870
This was such a different
time, 1982, three, four, that

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.460
to make a phone call home I
needed weeks of preparation,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.470
letters took six weeks to arrive,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.960
of course there was no internet,
there were no cell phones.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.410
So that made the
isolation pretty complete,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.970
but it also meant I had to
pour a lot into the letters

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.170
just to convey to people
at home what I was doing.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.050
So I gathered up those letters
when I set out to write

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.410
The Village of Waiting, and
they were a huge help in

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.410
reconstructing scenes,
characters, dialog, description.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.430
And those are the building
blocks of narrative.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.930
- You say in this book that liberals

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.250
learn to adjust to reality, and then

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.123
you also talk about the power of reason.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.360
What's striking about this book
is, you go visit your aunt,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.743
and she's become an
evangelical, and you really can

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.490
distance yourself, be objective,
but paint a portrait of

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.960
evangelicals, and even
wind up comparing them to

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.400
the socialist, which you
had been in the interim.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.000
- Part of a group of socialists.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.120
- So writing, in a way,
has allowed you to use

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.998
the characteristics of a
liberal, in a way, is that fair?

00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:33.070
Although you can't be
a liberal in politics.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.300
- I think, I wouldn't go quite that far.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.970
I mean obviously there are
great conservative writers,

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.380
there are great liberal writers,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.883
there are bad liberal writers.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.800
I would say, to write
well, it helps to have

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.020
some framework for understanding life and

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.460
some set of ideals and values,

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.190
but it also helps to be able to set them

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.250
aside long enough to pay attention.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.430
And to take in things
that are going to run

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.670
a counter to your idea of
the way the world should be.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.340
Because otherwise you're
constantly eliding and erasing

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.455
what you're seeing,
and you're manipulating

00:16:12.455 --> 00:16:16.530
your portraits of people
into stock figures,

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.470
and that's just bad
prose, that's bad writing.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.850
I think some instinct has always told me,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.570
whatever you may think about the world,

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.860
the world is gonna be a far
more interesting and complicated

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.970
place, and you'll get
more out of it as a writer

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.610
if you just stay alert and pay attention,

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.020
and don't try to make it
conform to your expectations.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.150
Otherwise, among other
things it'll be boring.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.600
So all of this was me learning to write,

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.653
and the model was Orwell,
I was reading Orwell

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:52.423
all the time in my 20s, and he
was like my graduate program.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.330
And my idea of a writer
was someone who wrote

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.180
autobiographically, like
Orwell in his essays and in

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.930
Down and Out in Paris and
London, Homage to Catalonia,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.640
I didn't have a notion
of being a journalist.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.770
Of going out and interviewing
people and recording

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.930
observations that didn't
start with my own life.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.990
So my first few books
were autobiographical,

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.180
my first articles for
magazines were essays.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.880
And it was only like, at
40, when I moved to New York

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.330
and began writing for The New
Yorker and The New York Times

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.440
Magazine that I really
became a journalist.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.031
But the tools were already
there, they were the same tools.

00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:37.463
- And what, I like to ask my guests,

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.540
what are the skills and
temperament involved in

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.950
what they do, you really helped
us understand the skills,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.603
what about the temperament
of being a writer?

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.490
- I have, I think a pretty
passionate attachment to certain

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.670
ideas which really are political ideas,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.513
I'm a political writer pretty
much down to the marrow.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.570
Which are a dislike of unfairness,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.180
I'm speaking basically
here, I'm talking about

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.993
kinda stuff that starts on the playground.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.203
A sympathy for the underdog.

00:18:21.596 --> 00:18:25.593
An interest in what seems
different and alien.

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:30.959
And a belief that underneath it,

00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:33.770
we're actually not that different.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:38.610
Because everywhere I've
gone, from Togo, to Burma,

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.610
to Baghdad, I've found it
easy to talk to people,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.910
and easy to get them to
tell me their stories,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.480
and their stories are
easily understandable

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.330
as the aspirations of
people like the people

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.920
that I grew up with,
or people that I know.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.510
So I guess I'm a
universalist in that sense,

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.800
and that's not quite a temperament,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.960
but it is a sort of approach to life.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.050
I believe that...

00:19:09.428 --> 00:19:12.480
Above or beneath the
differences in language

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.890
and in experience, I can understand you

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.930
if I want to, and if I try hard enough.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.630
And that means really
empathizing, not pretending,

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.320
because people immediately
pick up insincerity

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.540
in the intimate bond that's established

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.420
between a journalist and a subject.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.830
It has to be a real desire to know you,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.320
and I think I have a talent for

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.580
getting people to talk to me
and for getting to know them,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.283
and I think it's because
they sense that I mean it.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.770
- And what is your work process like?

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.820
We'll talk about the book in a minute but

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.465
you follow four main characters

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:59.465
at different levels of
society throughout the book.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.760
So it's talking with and identifying them,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.550
talking with them, winning their trust,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.850
recording what they're saying,
but you're suggesting also

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.390
seeing in a way how they
fit into a bigger picture.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.770
- Right, well that happens
later, I don't think I'm

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.840
thinking about how am
I gonna use this story,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.710
what am I looking for,
it's much more intuitive

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.133
and spontaneous, it's in the moment.

00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:29.890
We could talk about the
characters in the book

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.290
as individuals, but in
general, in each case

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.430
I just found myself wanting
to hang out with them,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.620
wanting to be admitted
into their world because

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.053
they all live in interesting worlds.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.420
And I intuited that those worlds
were part of a larger story

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.510
and that if I spent enough
time with them and won

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.380
their trust and got to hear
their story, and see it,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.290
and follow them around
as they live their life,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.530
it would be connected to a larger picture

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.050
that was the picture of The Unwinding.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.030
I didn't know exactly
what I was looking for at

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.000
the beginning, and that's
usually how I work.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.600
I might go, for example to post-war Iraq,

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.080
post-invasion Iraq, or to Lagos, Nigeria

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.940
with a general idea of
I'm gonna write about

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.210
the reconstruction, or I'm
gonna write about the mega city.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:23.840
But who I talk to and where
those conversations lead

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.110
and what picture builds,
that's something I have to

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.330
learn as I go, and that's
the excitement of the work.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.730
It's always a process of
revelation, I never know

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.730
what I'm going to say until
I've finished talking to people.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.530
- The end of the book,
this first book that we're

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.610
talking about, you come to
certain conclusions about

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.610
where society is, and I
wanna bring that up because

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:55.640
it struck me as being a kind
of prologue to The Unwinding,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.530
and there were several characteristics

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.830
you identified of the times.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.290
'The main force of our lives is'

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.420
'the overwhelming force of un-reason'.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.290
So reason has moved away from center stage

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.310
in the world you're looking at.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:17.143
'There is a lack of a vision, and moral'

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.230
'and intellectual energy
such vision confers'

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.400
we're talking just generally
now about American society,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.500
the collapse of all of the structures.

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.370
You were identifying them in
this book in the year 2000.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.670
And then the kind of
de-legitimizing of what you call

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.360
the collective self-betterment,
that people don't believe

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.630
in reason, and they don't
believe through reason

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.260
that government can solve problems.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.568
Just comment on that, I found
it, not having read the book

00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:56.568
until after I read The
Unwounding, I really found it

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.213
a very compelling
introduction to The Unwinding.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.270
- It's interesting to hear
those things quoted back

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.750
because that was what I
wrote 10 or 15 years ago,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.300
and that was the state of mind I was in,

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.690
mainly through excavating the past,

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.620
my own past, my family's past.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.760
Going back to this man I never
met who I was named after,

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.533
my maternal grandfather,
George Huddleston.

00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:28.575
I think I would put it a
little differently today,

00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:31.233
and I would approach it
a little differently.

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:37.050
What I didn't quite see was how...

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.860
The 60s was more of a
prologue than the main event.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.860
And how so much of the era we live in now,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.877
some of it was prepared
for during that time

00:23:52.877 --> 00:23:56.180
but I think most of it came later.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.760
And if anything, it's a kind of return to

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.340
the period my grandfather came out of,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.670
the period of the robber
barons and of populism.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.900
I mean, what is Occupy
Wall Street but a kind of

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.950
resurgence of populist politics?

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.950
What is Dodd-Frank but an
effort to re-create some

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.110
regulation of the financial
system that was undone.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.530
So I think the 60s no longer seems

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.563
like this signal period to me.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.333
And when I set out to write The Unwinding,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.960
it came out of events that happened

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.200
after Blood of the Liberals was written.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.040
Starting with the Iraq
war, which I covered for

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.870
The New Yorker and wrote a
book out, The Assassin's Gate.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.460
And what I saw there was
a failure of not just

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.063
individual American leaders,
but American institutions.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:56.870
Ones that I'd probably had
faith in without even knowing

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.770
I did, such as the military,
the intelligence system,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.250
the media, and Congress
and the executives.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:09.250
So I began to wonder, when
did that failure begin?

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.370
Has it been happening for a
long time, and we never noticed

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.830
until we tried to do
something that required

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.680
all of our talents and
energies and we simply

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.080
didn't have it in us to
do it, to rebuild Iraq.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.700
And then I came back from
that war to cover the 2008

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.660
election, and suddenly every institution

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.663
in the country seemed to be collapsing.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.443
The Wall Street investment banks,

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.050
lenders like Country
Wide, Washington Mutual.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.640
General Motors, Chrysler, my
god, just the core pillars

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.950
of our economic life were falling apart.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.540
And out of it came Barack Obama,

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.540
who seemed like the first
truly new and promising

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.563
national figure in a really long time.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.140
That story, which obviously
builds on the history in

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.930
Blood of the Liberals, is a new story,

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.470
it's the story of my generation.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.840
And I wanted to write an
account of this past generation

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.710
where the failure of these
institutions, and essentially of

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.580
the deal that held the country together,

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.823
which is basically the social contract.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.870
Where that fell apart,
and how that fell apart,

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.280
so I needed to find a new
form for storytelling,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.690
which is very different
from Blood of the Liberals.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.270
No longer autobiographical, there is no

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.430
first person anywhere in The Unwinding.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.970
It is all told through the
stories of my characters.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.920
That was a real departure for
me, but it seemed necessary

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.100
to get my arms around as big a subject as

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.590
what has happened in America
in the last 30 years,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.710
and to paint a portrait of
where the country is today.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.380
- So you...

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.453
You start working on this
say in 2008, approximately,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.940
and you then set about creating profiles.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.300
Stories that people tell you or that

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.060
you research, and we'll talk about it.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.180
So how does this
structure come into being?

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.810
We should explain to people
who've not read the book,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.810
you have let's say four
main characters who are

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.080
people in different walks of life,

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.853
and you're looking at
what happens to them.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.420
- It's a chronological
story, each of them is

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:37.550
of a certain cohort,
born into the 50s or 60s,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.390
coming of age in the 70s and 80s.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.320
And then living out
their lives and careers

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.840
in this period of real destabilization,

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.930
where things are coming apart.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.930
One of them is Dean Price, who
is an entrepreneur in rural

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.360
North Carolina, in the bible
belt, very conservative area.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.280
But out of this conservative background,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.230
and he's a Reagan Republican
growing up but he sort of

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.820
latches onto alternative
energy and bio diesel fuel

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:15.820
as the way to revive all
the poverty and to revive

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.170
the troubles in the
countryside that he grew up in.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.800
Tammy Thomas is a black
woman in Youngstown, Ohio,

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.810
who rose up amid the
de-industrialization of the rust belt,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.070
the collapse of the steel
industry, and she survives and

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.040
raises her three kids by
latching onto one of the few

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.590
good blue collar jobs left
in an auto parts factory.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.880
Jeff Connaughton is an
ambitious young guy from Alabama

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.670
who latches onto Joe Biden
as his ticket to power

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.060
and to idealism, and then
becomes disillusioned

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.900
with Biden, and becomes a lobbyist.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.230
So the three of them are in
different parts of the country

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.250
and different, some are more
successful, some are not,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.240
there is a kind of winners
and losers dichotomy.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.860
The fourth is Peter Thiel,
who becomes a Silicon Valley

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.620
billionaire and a libertarian
with a sort of a vision of

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.320
a need for radical
technological change in order to

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.640
pull the country out
of economic stagnation.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.700
And there's a fifth character

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.683
who isn't a person, it's Tampa.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:25.570
Ground Zero of the housing
bust, and of all the trouble

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.660
in the way people got into
debt and got into bigger houses

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.550
than they could afford, and
then when it all went south,

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.310
the financial crisis was the result.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.310
So five parts of the
country, five characters,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.089
we follow them moving back
and forth between them as

00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:47.670
their stories unfold from
the late 70s to the present.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.670
That's a big package of
stories to tell anyway,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.470
but I also wanted to tell
the stories of the most

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.700
influential people of the
same period, 'cause you can't

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.340
write about America today without
writing about celebrities,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.170
and without looking at
the role of the elites.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.280
From politics there's Newt
Gingrich, from entertainment

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.423
there's Oprah Winfrey, from
business there's Sam Walton.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.990
From finance there's Robert Rubin,

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.413
from government there's Colin Powell.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.860
From sort of food culture there's

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.070
Berkeley's own Alice Waters.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:30.070
So I had this tremendous
amount of reporting

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.860
and research and stories,
I didn't have a structure.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.310
And this is an unusual thing for me,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.670
I usually have a structure early on

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.313
so I know where things go.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:44.370
This all had to come together really fast.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.683
When I began to write at
the beginning of 2012.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.200
The structure...

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.710
Had actually come to me earlier.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.820
But I forgot, or I discarded it,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.300
I didn't think it could work,
and my wife reminded me.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.020
You had an idea, it was to
do a kind of experimental

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.990
non-fiction book along the
lines of the Dos Passos trilogy

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.990
USA, where you would combine
ordinary people and the famous,

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.870
the centers of power and
obscure backwaters, and even

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.080
a kind of mish-mash of
quotes and news stories

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.130
at different moments to give a sense of

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.200
what the collective mind was like

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.453
at individual years along the way.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.010
I gave that a try, not
knowing if it was gonna work,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.690
it seemed like a juggling
act, but that became the form

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.230
to tell all these stories,
to hold them together

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.693
through the writing of The Unwinding.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.840
- The only thing that I
would add to what you said,

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.910
and you know your book
better than I do, is that

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:48.160
in Tampa you follow a number
of secondary characters,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.440
a journalist, a lawyer, a
woman who attends hearings

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.830
and discovers --
- In foreclosure courts, yeah.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.540
- Who discovers the corruption.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:01.540
So let's talk about the
four main characters.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:06.670
Is there something that you found

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.593
that told you about what
was going on in the country

00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:16.410
that was common to all of
them, which ones were winners,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:21.410
which one were losers, but they
all seemed to have a kind of

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:26.340
a sense of hope, resiliency,
determination, it's just

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.950
they're differently placed
in the way they can succeed.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.450
- That's a good way to put it.

00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:36.940
Each of them keeps running
up against setbacks,

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.020
obstacles, dramatic changes of course.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.170
They have to remake themselves
as the country goes through

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.890
upheavals, and I think that's
part of what allows this

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.790
disparate batch of stories
to cohere into a narrative.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.520
There's some suspense,
what's gonna happen next with

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.513
Jeff Connaughton after he
quits working for Joe Biden.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.400
How will Tammy Thomas
survive once her job at

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.610
the auto parts factory
gets sent to Mexico?

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.260
Will Dean Price keep pursuing
his almost religious vision of

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:15.260
biodiesel as the cure for what
ails the Carolina Piedmont

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.730
after his partnership
collapses and he goes bankrupt?

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.290
So their lives are interesting,
and they're surprising.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.840
There's lots of unexpected turns.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.670
I think what all of them are
contending with is a period,

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.380
which gives the book its title,

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.870
in which structures that
used to support these

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.700
kinds of aspirations
have begun to disappear.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.250
And people feel more and more
that they're on their own

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.390
and have to improvise, and
figure it out for themselves.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:52.101
Dean Price, who is a
son of the bible belt,

00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:55.960
his family had been in
tobacco farming forever,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.773
his father was a fire
and brimstone preacher.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.930
He wanted to be a successful entrepreneur,

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.545
kind of rebelled against his father's

00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:08.563
darker and more constrained vision.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.480
Dean Price had no organization
to support his ambitions.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.054
There was no business association.

00:34:21.054 --> 00:34:26.054
No local newspaper, no trade
union, no political party.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:31.180
What he's got is his own
dreams, some old books like

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.720
Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill,

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.900
who was a kind of how to
succeed in business writer

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.660
from the early 20th
century, and the internet,

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.720
where Dean finds out about things

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.300
like peak oil, and bio diesel.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.436
And he's kind of improvising
and pulling it all together

00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:54.940
in a very idiosyncratic
way, and inevitably screws

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.760
some of it up or gets some of it wrong,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.830
or makes mistakes or
doesn't quite know what

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.140
he's doing, but keeps persisting at it.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:07.140
So it's this resilience in the
face of dissolving structures

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:12.030
that is the drama of their
lives, and it is the thing

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.350
that unites all of the
characters in the book.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:18.993
- And they all are learners,
I mean, in other words they

00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:23.780
try something, it may fail,
they pick up the pieces,

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.780
and when given the opportunity,
they move to a new level.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.810
They may end up with
disappointment, but the frustration

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:43.810
doesn't lead them to stop
in their quest, basically.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.460
- And I think for different
reasons in difference cases.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.460
In Dean Price's case, if he
were to lose faith in his quest

00:35:55.448 --> 00:36:00.448
for redemption in rural North
Carolina through biofuels,

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.230
he would kinda lose faith in America.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:07.080
It would tell him that a lonely man

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.540
with a dream no longer could make it.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.010
And I think he did almost give up

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.683
a few times when he went bankrupt.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.650
For Tammy Thomas, it was more a

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.240
sense that people counted on her.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.880
Her children, her family, her community.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.880
She's very much connected
to Youngstown as the city is

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.840
entering a death spiral
after the steel mills close.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.950
I mean, my god, 50 thousand jobs lost

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:40.540
in a rather small section of
the Mahoning River Valley.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.270
It's as if New York City
lost half a million jobs.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.200
So it was an economic cataclysm.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.830
It was happening all over the rust belt,

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.940
so there are many Tammy
Thomas' around the country.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.170
She kept going because as
she said over and over,

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.990
I did what I was supposed to do.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.840
She is not someone driven
by a grandiose dream

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.040
of achievement and
becoming a national figure

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.520
or an entrepreneur or anything like that,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.550
she did what she was supposed to do.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.610
Which stands in such contrast to

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.390
the culture of celebrity
that we live with.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:20.300
Where you don't do what
you're supposed to do,

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.750
in fact, you win by doing what
you're not supposed to do.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:28.750
You break things, you break
the rules, you cut corners,

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.540
and that's the story of many of the

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.027
celebrities in the book, including Jay-Z.

00:37:34.027 --> 00:37:35.750
- Let's talk about the
celebrities in a minute.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:40.150
I just wanna make a point about,

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.407
it comes out in Tammy, which is the,

00:37:44.484 --> 00:37:48.770
she is, through her grandmother she gets

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.460
to live in a mansion by a former...

00:37:53.003 --> 00:37:53.990
- A steel baron.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.060
- A steel baron.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.460
And what comes out is the
extent to which the barons

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.910
of the city.
- Of Youngstown.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:06.009
- Of Youngstown did not
realize what was happening

00:38:06.009 --> 00:38:08.230
as the place collapsed.

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.810
They had kept other businesses out,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.510
but then they didn't kinda understand.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:18.500
But she then becomes an
organizer and is learning

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.043
by being part of a community organization,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.970
that takes about mapping
the city to see where the,

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:31.810
and so through that she
gets a larger vision

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.270
of what's going on in the city.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.470
- Yeah, I mean here she is, a little girl.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.530
Her mother was a heroin addict,
so rather than taking care

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.620
of Tammy, Tammy really had
to take care of her mother.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:46.280
She told me this story of how
her mother would smoke in bed,

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.340
and when Tammy was a very
little girl, she would try to

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.510
keep herself awake so that
after her mother fell asleep

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.620
she could take the cigarette
out of her hands and

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.962
put it out, which is a
little detail that gives you

00:38:57.962 --> 00:39:00.710
a big picture of what
her childhood was like.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.680
She was raised by her great
grandmother, who worked in

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.120
white peoples' homes,
rich white peoples' homes,

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.120
and at one point when her
longest standing boss,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:17.040
the widow of a steel baron,
died, and the house was

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.360
in escrow, the estate
was sort of undecided,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.440
Tammy and her great
grandmother and her mother

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.830
went to live in this giant
old mansion on the north side

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.500
of Youngstown where the rich people lived.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.130
And it was this magical
year in Tammy's life,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.509
and then it ended, and she had
to return to the east side.

00:39:36.509 --> 00:39:41.509
Which was on the verge
of falling apart when,

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.980
a few years later, the bills close.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:48.700
But Youngstown's a story
of a one industry city

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.340
controlled by a handful of
families, who when they sold out

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.830
to the multi-national steel
companies, or at least to the

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.190
steel companies headquartered
outside Youngstown,

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.470
that was the death sentence.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.130
No one any longer had a stake
in the survival of Youngstown.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.460
And when Youngstown Sheet and
Tube, which was the largest,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:13.460
locally owned mill in
Youngstown, when it was sold to

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.630
Lykes Corporation of New Orleans and then

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.630
10 years later, in a vote of the board

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.540
that happened at the Pittsburgh airport.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.000
People flew in, they didn't
even go to Youngstown

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.770
to take the vote, they went to Pittsburgh.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:29.860
And voted to close the Campbell Works,

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.870
which was the biggest part
of Youngstown Sheet and Tube,

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.056
five thousand people lost their
jobs, it was the beginning

00:40:35.056 --> 00:40:37.762
of the death of
Youngstown, and it happened

00:40:37.762 --> 00:40:42.762
almost without anyone in a
position of power noticing.

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.960
Suddenly this whole way of
life ended, and Tammy had to

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.840
grow up and raise her own
children in the debris,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.917
in the ruins of this old industrial city.

00:40:55.917 --> 00:41:00.310
And as you say, once her job
disappeared, years later,

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:04.870
and it was sent overseas,
she had to remake herself.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.560
It was a matter of
survival, and she became

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.570
a community organizer, and it was like

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.040
seeing the city for the first time.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.900
What she had taken for granted
while she was surviving

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.570
suddenly struck her with full force,

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.820
some injustice had happened here.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.090
It angered her, she kept
using the word frustrated

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:27.540
while we drove around her
old haunts of the east side.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.730
And that told me she hadn't given up.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:33.070
It still, she had some
fight, and she was not

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.010
willing to let go of
Youngstown, and that spirit

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:40.210
remade her as a community organizer.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.000
- Before we talk about the celebrities,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.543
because there you're creating
another kind of mosaic

00:41:47.543 --> 00:41:52.370
that's quite fascinating and
disturbing at the same time.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.430
- Cannot --
- Connaughton.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.880
- Jeff Connaughton.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.780
- Connaughton.
- Yeah.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.780
- Was an idealist who rose
in American politics on the

00:42:02.474 --> 00:42:06.730
coattails of Biden, who he
became very disappointed in.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.130
But in the end he becomes a lobbyist.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.870
And it's quite extraordinary
because there's a period

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:17.300
from 2000 to 2010 when what a lobbyist is

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.050
and what a public servant is changes.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.881
So we move from not selling out,

00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:27.230
to I think he says cashing in.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.493
- Yeah, suddenly, there had
been a kind of unseemliness

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:36.470
to going from Capital Hill
to the big lobbying firms.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.230
Like, you did it, lot of people did it,

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:43.980
but it was slightly unseemly,
to being what everyone did.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.220
I mean, astonishing numbers
of aides on Capital Hill,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.030
fully half of retired
or defeated senators,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.446
same number of congressmen,
end up in lobbying.

00:42:55.446 --> 00:42:58.554
It's the obvious way to
make money in Washington

00:42:58.554 --> 00:43:01.050
once you've been on the inside.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.410
Jeff Connaughton followed
suit and got very rich at it.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:08.040
Because his firm, Quinn
Gillespie, had connections

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.880
to both the democrats and republicans.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.940
- It was bipartisan.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.620
- It was bipartisan, they couldn't lose.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.360
They used to say, we're not of
the democratic or republican

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.410
party, we're with the green party.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.120
Meaning, we're about making
money, and whoever wins,

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.080
Bush, Gore, kind of didn't
matter all that much to

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.150
Quinn Gillespie because
they were gonna do well

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.060
no matter what, and Jeff was the

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.140
third wheel and did very well himself.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.110
But he also became a
creature of that period.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:41.110
He put his money into some
unwise real estate investments

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:45.050
in Costa Rica, as he said
to me, he got greedy.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.321
He's a very honest, candid
guy, and ended up losing

00:43:49.321 --> 00:43:54.321
a lot of his wealth in the
financial collapse of 2008.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.720
And that partly, and I think also

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.640
just a sense of self-respect.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.000
We were talking about
what kept them going.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.090
With Dean it was a dream, a vision.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.850
With Tammy it was survival and her

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:08.316
attachment to the people around her.

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:10.760
But Jeff Connaughton I
think it was a need to

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.030
look at himself in the
mirror, and to be able to.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.110
He went back into government
as the Chief of Staff

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.370
of the guy who took
Biden's seat when Biden

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.100
became vice president, Ted Kaufman.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.880
And Kaufman and Connaughton did something

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.020
kind of extraordinary in Washington.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.940
They decided, they were only
gonna be there for two years,

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.300
they weren't worried about reelection,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.220
they were gonna take on Wall Street.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.260
And Connaughton came back
into government and was

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.110
sort of astonished to see
it, even though he'd been

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.740
a lobbyist all this time,
he hadn't seen what lobbying

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.350
had done to Washington,
how money drove so much of

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.340
what happens on Capital Hill, and how

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.740
the public voice is hardly heard at all.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.480
So they went after the
big banks, they tried to

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.320
break them up, to
reinstate Glass-Steagall,

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.292
to prosecute the individual executives who

00:45:01.292 --> 00:45:04.785
might have been committing crimes of fraud

00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:07.820
that led to the financial crisis.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.295
We know how that story turned
out, but for Connaughton

00:45:11.295 --> 00:45:15.680
it was kind of a matter of
pride and self-respect to try.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.780
And his story is the story of
Washington during this period

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.960
and how Washington, even
though the newspaper versions,

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.220
what we read about every
day, is divided into extremes

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.030
of right and left, with tremendous
vitriol and deteriorating

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.810
norms and etiquettes, all
that is true, but I think that

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.330
distracts us from the real
story of the last generation,

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.860
which is that Washington has
become what it was in the

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.983
late 19th century, which is
a pawn of organized money.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.370
- Let's talk about the celebrities,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.320
and I think there are about 10 of them.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.630
And we can say first off
that the only one that

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.420
comes off looking really
good is Elizabeth Warren,

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.370
we'll put her aside.
- Don't forget Raymond Carver.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.490
- Oh, and Raymond Carver,
the writer, that's correct.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:10.010
But I want to try to
distinguish them in some way,

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.960
to find a common characteristic.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.720
And one thing that struck
me was in the ruins,

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.640
and we're talking about the ruins,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.293
each of them found a niche, basically.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.160
And in the case of some who
thought the old institutions

00:46:28.526 --> 00:46:31.580
still existed, Colin Powell,
well we know what happened

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.040
to him, he was in an administration where

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.160
the people didn't really
care about the institution.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.840
- Right, I think two of them,
you're absolutely right.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.390
Two of them were creatures
of the old institutions.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.920
Colin Powell from the military and

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.010
essentially government service,

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:54.010
and Robert Rubin from Wall
Street, and the treasury.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.350
They both believed in those
institutions and were leaders

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:01.140
of them, and didn't see the
rot that was setting in.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.630
So that when, in Powell's case,

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.570
Bush took the country to war in Iraq.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.570
And when in Rubin's case,
his last job at City Group

00:47:13.395 --> 00:47:16.115
as a very well-paid executive.

00:47:16.115 --> 00:47:17.500
- 15 million a year.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.880
- 15 million a year, for
doing not all that much.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.810
Became inextricably tied to the practices

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:27.450
that brought the economy down in collapse.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.400
They didn't see it, they
didn't see their own,

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.740
that whether or not their
intentions were good,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.533
and I think in both cases they were,

00:47:35.533 --> 00:47:37.740
that they had become a
part of something that

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.360
not only no longer worked
but that was actually

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.840
undermining the larger public interest.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.790
Wall Street and the public
interest parted ways a long

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:51.430
time ago, and I don't think
Robert Rubin ever saw that.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.510
So their stories are a little more,

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.320
I would use the word advisedly,
but a little more tragic.

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.883
I think the other celebrities in the book,

00:48:02.478 --> 00:48:04.630
one thing that's
interesting is a lot of them

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.999
come from nowhere, rather like the

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:08.880
characters we've been talking about.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.700
They come from very, Oprah Winfrey

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.070
grew up in poverty in Mississippi.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.300
Jay-Z from the housing
projects of Brooklyn.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:20.300
Sam Walton from a little town in Arkansas

00:48:20.447 --> 00:48:23.880
and Oklahoma, in that part of the country.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.900
Newt Gingrich, terrible childhood.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:31.900
Sort of an angry and hard
stepfather, Gingrich was adopted.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:35.920
No one in his immediate
family seemed capable

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.020
of just loving him, and
he became a hard man.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:43.980
So they all come up out of
very difficult circumstances,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.510
and they reinvent themselves,
they kind of create

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.240
a new way of being an American.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.810
And they, rather than building up

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.830
institutions, they break them down.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.700
Gingrich comes into Congress in '78,

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.490
the year that the book begins,

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.896
and immediately starts throwing rocks

00:49:01.896 --> 00:49:04.150
and baiting the speakers of the house,

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.660
and really trying to polarize the place.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.620
And to force the democrats
into mistakes that will

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.220
lead to a republican takeover,
he's a revolutionary.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:19.180
Jay-Z comes out of Brooklyn
and very calculatedly

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.640
starts selling crack in
order make enough money

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.240
to launch a career as a rap star.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.320
And his story is of
meteoric success, but almost

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.690
success at all costs, and
as its own justification.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:35.840
So that breaking the rules
isn't just something you are

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.130
allowed to do, but something
you're encouraged to do,

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:42.630
because the old way of
holding down a job and going

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:46.300
to school and putting one
foot in front of the other,

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.290
it just doesn't work anymore,
it's a sucker's game.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:54.290
Sam Walton institutes business
practices that lay waste

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.490
to retail establishments
across the heartland,

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:02.380
including in Dean Price's
part of North Carolina,

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:07.380
and turn Americans into
low-wage, low-price consumers

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:11.250
and drive manufacturing,
help to drive it overseas.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:16.160
So these are all in some
ways empire builders

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.960
who are doing it in the ruins of the old

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.040
and are partly responsible for

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.840
destroying the old institutions.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.070
And that is a new kind of leader

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:26.810
in this country, a new kind of elite.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.450
They're not custodians, they don't have

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:33.100
a sense of a higher national interest.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.870
They have their own interest,
the interest of the empire

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.640
that they're building,
and damn the consequences.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.590
- And Walton is extremely
interesting I found because

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.590
he starts with a rural model,
cheaper and cheaper prices,

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:51.470
paying employees less and
less, to beat the local rural

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.650
and Main Street competition.
- Yeah.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.850
- And then somehow the country
comes to him as it collapses,

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:02.720
in the sense that as we get
more and more inequality,

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.840
basically, this model makes
sense, especially when

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.990
the products are being
made by the Chinese.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.480
- Right, and Walton and
his defenders say that

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.480
Walmart made life cheaper for
people in parts of the country

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:21.420
where it was hard to make a living.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.650
They raised standards of
living by lowering prices.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:27.720
But you could also say they
lowered standards of living

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.720
by lowering wages, by driving
factories out and turning

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.390
former factory workers into
part-time store greeters

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:42.580
who made $8 an hour and
worked 20 hours a week.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.760
There's a family in the
Tampa chapters in the book,

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.110
the Hartzels, who end up
pretty much dependent on

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:51.780
a job like that just to stay afloat.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.520
And they do all their
shopping where, of course,

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.730
at Walmart, even though
they hate the place,

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.720
because that has the cheapest prices.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.690
So that in a way, the
depression of the heartland

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.510
and the hollowing out of the Main Streets

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.130
ends up being good for the company,

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.370
because it forces people
to buy products at

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.223
the cheapest price possible,
which is at Walmart.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.590
It's a race to the bottom.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.554
- Two other celebrities.

00:52:17.554 --> 00:52:22.350
Alice Waters from Berkeley
and Oprah Winford.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.471
- [George] Winfrey.

00:52:23.471 --> 00:52:27.843
- Oprah Winfrey, sorry, I'm
excited watching the clock here.

00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:33.870
What's kind of interesting
is they unintentionally or

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:38.570
intentionally wind up
responding to different

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.713
levels of the society
that's being created.

00:52:42.722 --> 00:52:47.722
Alice, with the whole focus
on eating properly and so on,

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:52.640
which you suggest is kind
of an elite sensibility.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.360
And Oprah, sort of reaching
into the heart of people

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.580
who are really being hurt by where we are.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:03.490
- Well, the abiding
theme of this whole book

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:06.300
and of the period it's
about is inequality.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.300
Which is growing every
day, and nothing seems to

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.380
arrest it, let alone turn it around.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.470
Even the financial
crisis increased the gap

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:20.470
between the top 1% or 5%
and the rest of the country

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.523
so that, one figure that
I mention in the book,

00:53:23.523 --> 00:53:27.380
the six surviving Walmart
heirs of Sam Walton

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.260
have the wealth of the
bottom 30% of Americans.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.060
Which is about 90 million people,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:36.330
so it's an incredible level of inequality.

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:40.100
So that everything seems to feed into it,

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.140
it's almost, it's like a
gas that you can't escape,

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.710
it just creeps into every corner of life.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:48.300
So in Oprah Winfrey's
case, her story is this

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.280
tremendously inspiring
one of a very ambitious,

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.432
driven, talented girl from the rock bottom

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:58.850
of society, willing her way to the top,

00:53:58.850 --> 00:54:02.770
and becoming the empress of television.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.990
And in doing so, kind of living in a class

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.020
unto itself, the class of celebrities.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.640
That's her group, that's
who she's comfortable with.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.110
Her viewers are left behind,
and they sort of are,

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:21.250
in a sense worshiping at
the altar of a goddess

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:22.850
whom they can't hope to touch.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.931
And there's this constant
sense with her that

00:54:25.931 --> 00:54:29.060
although the message may be,
if I can do it, you can do it,

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:33.231
the reality is, I did it, and
so you don't have to do it.

00:54:33.231 --> 00:54:36.790
You can live through
me, through my success.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.860
Alice Waters I think did
some very valuable things,

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:44.270
as Oprah also did, in
making American conscious of

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.890
what we eat, where it comes from,

00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:51.710
of reminding us that food
should come from where we live,

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:53.450
and that it should be seasonal,

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:55.920
and that it should not
be full of chemicals.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.973
But that, too, has become a kind of,

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.370
I see it as like a way for
a certain class of Americans

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:06.970
almost to keep out the contamination

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.540
coming from the bottom, from Walmart.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.430
And although its origins
I think are very positive

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:18.360
and very strong, it's been
turned into a kind of a code,

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:24.990
or even a rigid set of rules
people impose on themselves,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.040
in a way that is intensely,
I think, class-driven,

00:55:32.444 --> 00:55:36.168
and that divides Americans
by what they eat,

00:55:36.168 --> 00:55:39.070
as everything else divides us

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.740
according to our socio-economic level.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.360
When I was growing up everyone

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.890
ate the same kind of crappy food.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:50.890
And today, some people eat
very expensive organic food,

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.420
and that's all they're going
to eat, and other people eat

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.140
what Dean Price sold when
he was a fast food owner,

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:03.140
which is to say mass
produced hormone fed chicken

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:07.410
that's cooked in deep
fryers in Bojangles'.

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.830
So it's like, you can't get away from it.

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:14.140
It's not to blame Alice
Waters, but it has fed into

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:18.050
the sense that Americans
need to wall themselves off

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:23.050
from each other in order
to live a good life.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:29.230
- You talk, in the first
book we talked about, about

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.849
whether you change things
by changing the culture

00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:34.840
of changing the structure, you even

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.140
quote Orwell about that problem.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:41.160
Have you come to any
conclusion as a result

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.790
of this odyssey in writing this book?

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.021
- I think that's still
a perpetual question.

00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:51.870
Orwell was writing about
Dickens, and saying,

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.070
with Dickens, change of structure

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.550
begins with a change of heart.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.823
He was not a Marxist, with
Marx it's the other way around.

00:57:01.482 --> 00:57:05.060
I'm basically a moralist,
I basically think

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:10.060
what we need at the beginning
of any social change

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:14.300
is a change of thinking and feeling.

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.890
And it might begin with
something as simple as

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:21.890
restoring a sense of shame,
and a respect for limits.

00:57:23.951 --> 00:57:26.610
Perhaps we don't need to exercise

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.010
the incredible freedom of
choice that we now have

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:32.000
all the time, we don't need
to say everything we think

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.090
on the internet, because it might end up

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.596
having destructive consequences.

00:57:37.596 --> 00:57:40.130
But on the other hand, I
don't have any illusions

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:45.130
that either this can happen
by spontaneous combustion,

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.880
or that it can lead to structural change.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:52.880
'Cause we also need things
in our, in Washington,

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.293
on Wall Street, in business,
in the media to change.

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:03.030
Whether it's reviving old
structures or more likely

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.660
rebuilding institutions in new ways.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.623
'Cause things never return
to the way they were.

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:11.290
I don't know how that's gonna happen.

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:16.290
I do not claim to be either
a profit or a prescriber.

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:19.170
The book does not have policy
answers, it's a narrative,

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.220
and that was a deliberate choice.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.740
I thought, we have
enough books that tell us

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.100
what's wrong with America
and how to fix it.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.680
And somehow they're all
both true and not true.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.160
We know what's wrong with America,

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.420
we don't know how to fix it.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.840
The answers are never enough.

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.730
So instead I wanted to hold up a mirror,

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.210
or to at least paint a
portrait, so that we could see

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:43.710
what we are, within the limits
of what one book can do.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.958
And that might be the
beginning of thinking about

00:58:46.958 --> 00:58:50.640
how we got here, and how it can change.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.720
- George, I wanna thank you for
taking the time to come here

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:58.210
and discuss the book, it's an
extraordinary book which we

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:02.470
really can't do justice
to in an hour's time.

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:05.730
But thank you very much,
and thank you very much

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.230
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.

00:59:10.493 --> 00:59:13.993
(upbeat electronic music)
