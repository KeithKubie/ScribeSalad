00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.851
- As a little bit of
a review, we know that

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:04.754
if we have some function,
let's call it "f".

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.461
We don't have to call it
"f", but "f" is the letter

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.655
most typically used for functions,

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.221
that if I give it an input, a valid input,

00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.785
if I give it a valid input,
and I use the variable "x"

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.785
for that valid input, it is
going to map that to an output.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:21.992
It is going to map that, or produce,

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:24.453
given this x, it's going
to product an output

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:26.926
that we would call "f(x)."

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.087
And we've already talked a little bit

00:00:28.087 --> 00:00:29.921
about the notion of a domain.

00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:32.882
A domain is the set of all of the inputs

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:35.088
over which the function is defined.

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:39.291
So if this the domain here,
if this is the domain here,

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.657
and I take a value here,
and I put that in for x,

00:00:42.657 --> 00:00:45.386
then the function is
going to output an f(x).

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.917
If I take something that's
outside of the domain,

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:49.693
let me do that in a different color...

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.723
If I take something that
is outside of the domain

00:00:52.723 --> 00:00:55.161
and try to input it into this function,

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:56.322
the function will say, "hey, wait wait,"

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.994
"I'm not defined for that thing"

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:00.061
"that's outside of the domain."

00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:04.081
Now another interesting
thing to think about,

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.258
and that's actually what
the focus of this video is,

00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:08.661
okay, we know the set of
all of the valid inputs,

00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.960
that's called the domain,
but what about all,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.293
the set of all of the
outputs that the function

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:14.861
could actually produce?

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:16.591
And we have a name for that.

00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.551
That is called the range of the function.

00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:20.771
So the range.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.690
The range, and the most typical,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.386
there's actually a couple
of definitions for range,

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:27.359
but the most typical definition for range

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.018
is "the set of all possible outputs."

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.514
So you give me, you input
something from the domain,

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:34.894
it's going to output
something, and by definition,

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.856
because we have outputted
it from this function,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:39.016
that thing is going to be in the range,

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:40.722
and if we take the set
of all of the things

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:42.115
that the function could output,

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:44.821
that is going to make up the range.

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:49.755
So this right over here is
the set of all possible,

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.284
all possible outputs.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.188
All possible outputs.

00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:57.023
So let's make that a
little bit more concrete,

00:01:57.023 --> 00:01:58.590
with an example.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.317
So let's say that I have the function f(x)

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:06.195
defined as, so once again,
I'm gonna input x's,

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:10.990
and I have my function f,
and I'm gonna output f(x).

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.359
And let's say this def...

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:13.950
The function definition
here, the thing that tries to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.620
figure out, "okay, given an
x, what f(x) do I produce?",

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.359
the definition says "f(x)
is going to be equal"

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.284
"to whatever my input is, squared."

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:24.562
Well, just as a little bit of review,

00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:26.988
we know what the domain
here is going to be.

00:02:26.988 --> 00:02:30.959
The domain is the set of all valid inputs.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.118
So what are the valid inputs here?

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.894
Well, I could take any real number

00:02:34.894 --> 00:02:37.251
and input into this, and I
could take any real number

00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.388
and I can square it, there's
nothing wrong with that,

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:42.151
and so the domain is all real numbers.

00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:47.151
All, all real, all real numbers.

00:02:48.153 --> 00:02:49.825
But what's the range?

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:50.855
Maybe I'll do that in a different color

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:52.260
just to highlight it.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.025
What is going to be the range here,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.209
what is the set of all possible outputs?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.490
Well if you think about, actually,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.160
to help us think about, let
me actually draw a graph here.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.157
Of what this looks like.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.224
What this looks like.

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:08.546
So the graph of "f(x)
is equal to x squared"

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.287
is going to look something like this.

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:15.024
So, it's gonna look, it's going
to look something like this.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:17.056
I'm obviously hand-drawing
it, so it's not perfect.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:19.320
It's gonna be a parabola with a,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.153
with a vertex right here at the origin.

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:24.591
So this is the graph, this is the graph,

00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:28.921
"y is equal to f(x)," this
of course is the x-axis,

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:31.592
this of course is the y-axis.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:33.089
So let's think about it, what is the set

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.052
of all possible outputs?

00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:36.723
Well in this case, the set
of all possible outputs

00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.952
is the set of all possible y's here.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:43.295
Well, we see, y can take
on any non-negative value.

00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:47.857
y could be zero, y could one,
y could be pi, y could be e,

00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:51.027
but y cannot be negative.

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:54.324
So the range here is, the range...

00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:56.124
We could, well we could
say it a couple of ways,

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:59.189
we could say, "f(x)",
let me write it this way.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.252
"f(x) is a member of the real numbers"

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:08.252
"such that, is such that
f(x) is greater than"

00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:11.391
"or equal to zero."

00:04:11.391 --> 00:04:13.051
We could write it that
way, if we wanted to

00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.559
write it in a less mathy notation,

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:19.355
we could say that "f(x) is going to be"

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:21.921
"greater than or equal to zero."

00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:24.185
f(x) is not going to be negative,

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:27.621
so any non-negative number, the set of all

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.824
non-negative numbers, that is our range.

00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:33.055
Let's do another example of this,

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.981
just to make it a little bit,
just to make it a little bit,

00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.420
a little bit clearer.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.250
Let's say that I had,
let's say that I had g(x),

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.153
let's say I have g(x),
I'll do this in white,

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:49.820
let's say it's equal
to "x squared over x."

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.595
So we could try to
simplify g(x) a little bit,

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:53.825
we could say, "look, if I have x squared"

00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.590
"and I divide it by x, that's gonna,"

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.653
"that's the same thing as
g(x) being equal to x."

00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:02.347
"x squared over x" is x,
but we have to be careful.

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:04.657
Because right over here, we have to,

00:05:04.657 --> 00:05:08.094
in our domain, x cannot be equal to zero.

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:10.393
If x is equal to zero,
we get zero over zero,

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.786
we get indeterminate form.

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:14.828
So in order for this function
to be the exact same function,

00:05:14.828 --> 00:05:16.987
we have to put that,
'cause it's not obvious now

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:21.204
from the definition, we have to say,

00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:23.988
"x cannot be equal to zero."

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:25.985
So g(x) is equal to x for any x

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.284
as long as x is not equal to zero.

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:31.291
Now these two function
definitions are equivalent.

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:32.710
And we could even graph it.

00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:35.455
We could graph it, it's going to look,

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:38.961
I'm gonna do a quick and
dirty version of this graph.

00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:40.784
It's gonna look something like, this.

00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:43.222
It's gonna have a slope of one,

00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:44.859
but it's gonna have a hole right at zero,

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.019
'cause it's not defined at zero.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.958
So it's gonna look like this.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.625
So the domain here, the domain of g

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:57.027
is going to be, "x is a
member of the real numbers"

00:05:57.027 --> 00:06:00.486
"such that x does not equal zero,"

00:06:00.486 --> 00:06:03.853
and the range is actually
going to be the same thing.

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.407
The range here is going to be,

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:10.761
we could say "f(x) is a
member of the real numbers"

00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.860
"such that f(x) does not equal zero."

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.692
"f(x) does not equal zero."

00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:19.852
So the domain is all real
numbers except for zero,

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:24.852
the range is all real
numbers except for zero.

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:28.118
So the big takeaway here is
the range is all the pos...

00:06:28.118 --> 00:06:32.054
The set of all possible
outputs of your function.

00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:35.061
The domain is the set of all valid inputs

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.472
into your function.
