00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.590
The average movie fan might think that the
story, script, action and drama is everything

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.730
a movie is made of.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.650
But sometimes, a movie's greatest moments,
jokes, and meaning can be found in the background,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.580
just waiting for viewers to spot them - and
feel like they're seeing their favorite films

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.160
for the very first time.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.510
If you love to watch Hidden Messages videos,
make sure you stick around until the end,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.680
we have a whole series of them!

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.081
Before you get to those, here are more of
Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Hidden Messages in

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:33.950
Movies.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.079
Django Unchained

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.519
Any fan of classic westerns knows Clint Eastwood's
A Fistful of Dollars, but the 1966 movie Django

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.100
is less well known in the West, despite being
famous throughout Europe.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.100
The movie starred Franco Nero as the title
gunslinger, and was considered the most violent

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.260
movie ever made when it released.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.449
So it's no surprise it inspired Quentin Tarantino,
among other directors, who would name the

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.289
star of his own western after Nero's character.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.530
Nero even makes a cameo in Django Unchained.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.120
He's officially playing a different character,
but when he asks the former slave how his

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.060
name is spelled, the audience gets a one of
a kind reference that will fly over most of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.090
their heads.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.119
Hot Fuzz

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.520
Edgar Wright made sure that the movies of
his "Cornetto Trilogy" would be linked by

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.920
stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but there
are too many small connections to count.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.170
One of the best can be spotted in Hot Fuzz,
when Frost's character is sifting through

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.780
DVDs in a grocery store.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.469
Look fast, and you can spot the unmistakable
cover of Shaun of the Dead, the trio's previous

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.450
film - with a price tag planted over Pegg's
face . The movie apparently exists in Hot

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.789
Fuzz's universe, since the title "Zombie's
Party" was actually the movie's title in foreign

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.180
markets.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.180
Indiana Jones

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.590
Fans might never have noticed that the villain
of the third Indiana Jones movie first appeared

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.700
as an Imperial officer in The Empire Strikes
Back, played by actor Julian Glover, but they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.789
probably should have, thanks to a clever gag
from director Steven Spielberg.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.460
Long before the character is revealed to be
up to no good, he meets with Indy to discuss

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.460
the Holy Grail.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.280
But pay attention to the music coming in from
the party outside, and you'll hear a lighter

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.480
take on Darth Vader's Imperial March.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.709
It's an awesome nod to the actor's previous
role, but an even funnier hint that he wasn't

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.510
to be trusted.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.730
Gravity

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.590
This survival story set in Earth's orbit took
a few liberties with its physics, but got

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.120
more right than it did wrong.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.760
That's largely thanks to astronaut Andy Thomas,
who used his multiple space flights as a consultant

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000
for the cast and crew.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560
For his hard work, Thomas earned a funny,
but dark homage, listed as one of the deceased

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.010
members of the Explorer's mission.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.459
But that wasn't all: the Australian-born astronaut
got a nod to his homeland in the form of a

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.680
"Kangaroo Crossing" sticker slyly planted
in the movie's version of the International

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.459
Space Station.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.900
Iron Man 3

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.750
Tony Stark's former chauffeur showed he has
a sophisticated side when a run-in with a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.560
superpowered soldier sent him into the hospital.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.670
But the reveal that Happy Hogan was a Downton
Abbey fan was far more than it seemed.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.910
The scene being shown features the characters
Branson and Sybill - or put simply, a wealthy

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.240
young woman and a chauffeur.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.050
A perfect storyline, since the Marvel Comics
universe saw the chauffeur fall in love with

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.040
a wealthy young woman: Pepper Potts.&nbsp;

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.250
I Am Legend

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.299
You don't think of background jokes or secret
humor when it comes to I am Legend, but Robert

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.170
Neville found plenty of clever ways to keep
himself busy as the only human left alive

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.010
(in New York, at least).

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.939
But take a closer look at his house and you'll
notice he's used the lack of security to indulge

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.170
his love of art, decorating the walls with
priceless paintings, including Vincent Van

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.610
Gogh's "Starry Night".

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.519
The best part is that not all of them are
fake: the movie's hero had to steal them from

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.700
New York's Museum of Modern Art, but the real
world museum actually let the filmmakers use

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.549
some of their prized possessions in the movie.

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.070
Apparently, it was too good a joke for them
to pass up.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.879
Wreck-it it Ralph

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.160
Disney's trip inside the world of video games
packed in all kinds of famous cameos, but

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.140
the animators showed they were serious, hardcore
arcade gamers, if the grafitti is anything

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.140
to go by.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.329
There's the messages referring to the Warcraft
legend Leroy Jenkins, and a hopeful promise

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.190
for Final Fantasy fans that "Aerith Lives".

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.440
But the most inside joke comes with the tag
"Sheng Long Was Here".

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.759
The Street Fighter character began as an April
Fool's Joke in EGM, sending fans everywhere

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.420
chasing the urban legend for years.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.580
But in Game Central Station, the hope is still
alive.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.860
Saving Private Ryan

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.169
Steven Spielberg was careful not to glamorize
any part of World War 2, but after seeing

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.620
the nearly half hour sequence of American
soldiers charging Omaha Beach, losing countless

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.639
men in the process, it's hard to not be satisfied
when they finally break through the German

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.389
lines, and start turning the battle in their
favor.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.620
But Spielberg concealed another tragic moment
in that victory.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.840
When two German soldiers come out with hands
up to surrender, their please of mercy are

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.730
ignored, and they're shot where they stand.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.199
What they were actually saying: "don't shoot,
I didn't kill anyone, I'm Czech," implying

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.830
they were men taken prisoner when Germany
occupied their homeland, and forced to man

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.890
the front lines - making an ugly moment even
more tragic.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.979
Furious 7

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.340
Dwayne The Rock Johnson unfortunately spent
most of the movie in a hospital room, but

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.530
he didn't let that keep him out of the fight
entirely.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.330
But what was Hobbs doing all that time in
bed?

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.610
One scene reveals that he's taking in a football
game, before the action is interrupted by

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.229
breaking news.

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.639
But take a closer look at the sack being made
by "Number 94".

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.110
It's no random game, it’s the showdown between
the University of Miami and Florida State

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.539
in 1991.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.479
The defensive tackle making the sack?

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.289
None other than Johnson himself at age 19.

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.010
His season would end due to injury, but considering
how his career turned out, we don't think

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.800
it's a touchy subject.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.530
Skyfall

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.660
In the world of super spy James Bond, everyone
has a codename.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.120
There's Moneypenny, Q, and the woman in charge,
“M”.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.949
Judi Dench's version of the fearless leader
has held the title for longer than most, even

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.240
when the series was recast and rebooted with
star Daniel Craig.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.150
But her real name was never revealed - or
was it?

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.960
When Skyfall's final act saw her killed in
the field, she left James one of her prized

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
possessions.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.581
But take a closer look at the outside of the
box: she didn't sign with her codename, but

00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:28.720
her real one - Olivia Mansfield.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.479
Turns out the "M" was more fitting than fans
realized.

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.080
Those are the best hidden messages and meanings
we could find in movies, but which ones have

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.080
we missed?

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.190
