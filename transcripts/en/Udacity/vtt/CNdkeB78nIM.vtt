00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.120
For this assignment, discuss how you'd use frames to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.130
represent Raven's Progressive Matrices. At a basic level, what are the slots and

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.690
fillers associated with different Raven's problems? Where are these frames going

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.820
to come from? Is the agent going to receive the problem in terms of frames

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.780
initially, or it going to generate these frames based on its own reasoning?

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.560
Once it has these frames, what exactly are the reasoning methods it's going to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.540
use to solve the problem based on these frames?

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.890
We've also talked about frames representing individual figures from the problem.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.330
But what about a frame representing the problem,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.500
as a whole? What about a frame representing individual shapes within figures?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.630
How would representing the problems at that different level of abstraction,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.150
help the agents solve the problem more easily.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.880
What are frames going to enable us to do, that we couldn't do otherwise?
