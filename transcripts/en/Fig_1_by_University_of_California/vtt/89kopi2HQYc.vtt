00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.029
The problem for environmental chemicals

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.240
is that many of them have structures
that are not commonly seen in nature,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.150
so organism simply have not had a chance to
evolve defenses against these compounds.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.569
It may be something like 80,000
synthetic industrial compounds in the

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:21.509
last century

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.449
and that includes everything from
plastics to flame retardant

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.009
to pesticides that are used essentially
to deal with many of the problems that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.340
you have in modern life

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.000
and their exceedingly complicated. You
have a very, very complex experiment in

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.820
which I love us are the subject

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.339
and many of these compounds are known to
have endocrine-disrupting activity which

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.109
means that they will behind

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.410
to are hormone receptors and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.780
act like or Mon mimics many types as
diseases

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.370
these are things like breast cancer and
prostate

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.640
are caused by mis-regulation of our
hormone systems.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.640
The cell is adapted to deal with
compounds in the environment.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.960
An analogy we use is to say that cells are
a little bit like

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.390
nightclubs. What we mean by that is that
a cell really has to decide what gets in and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.360
what doesn't

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.340
the mechanism for this is by proteins
called drug transporters

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.299
and in that analogy you can think of
these as being a bit like the bouncers

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.049
of the cell

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.120
they decide who gets and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.260
who doesn't and their ability to
recognize a compound is very important

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.900
for determining whether a compound is
going to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.390
accumulate or be eliminated from the
body

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840
So in our lab what we want to do with
that big

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.670
pile of 80,000 compounds is decide which
ones

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.010
are problems and regulate them
accordingly

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.230
and have rules for designing safer

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.440
alternatives rather than simply
banning a compound we can actually

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.430
figure out whether a compound can be
redesigned or tweaked in a certain way

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.940
so that it still gives us the beneficial
properties that we want

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.580
without being as persistent and that's
going to change the face

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.400
how we do environmental chemistry. The
design of compounds that'll be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.140
much safer
