podcast name is boy onslaught and he
 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.270
podcast name is boy onslaught and he
created a device that he's using to try

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280
created a device that he's using to try
 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.090
created a device that he's using to try
to pull the plastic out of the ocean and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100
to pull the plastic out of the ocean and
 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070
to pull the plastic out of the ocean and
they'll maybe convert that plastic into

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080
they'll maybe convert that plastic into
 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.060
they'll maybe convert that plastic into
you know things that we can use and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
you know things that we can use and
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.860
you know things that we can use and
they're I don't think it worked on the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870
they're I don't think it worked on the
 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.930
they're I don't think it worked on the
first attempt but they're they're

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940
first attempt but they're they're
 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.820
first attempt but they're they're
relaunching it right didn't he they had

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830
relaunching it right didn't he they had
 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.380
relaunching it right didn't he they had
to do something to fix things they're

you know still in like sort of the
type stage but it's gonna have these

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690
type stage but it's gonna have these
 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.560
type stage but it's gonna have these
machines or this giant nets that move

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
machines or this giant nets that move
 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.810
machines or this giant nets that move
around through the ocean casualties that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820
around through the ocean casualties that

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.130
seems like that it wouldn't be that hard
 

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.579
seems like that it wouldn't be that hard
to be more conscious about it well at

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:33.589

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.180
consideration the fact that they need to
 

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.210
consideration the fact that they need to
maybe develop some sort of an

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.220
maybe develop some sort of an
 

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.740
maybe develop some sort of an
international program to breed these

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:41.750
international program to breed these
 

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.230
international program to breed these
things yeah you know it's it's a like

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240
things yeah you know it's it's a like
 

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.240

they've done that with yellowtail the

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.250
they've done that with yellowtail the
 

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.150
they've done that with yellowtail the
they have these like ocean sort of

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160
they have these like ocean sort of
 

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.240
they have these like ocean sort of
almost like a like corralled in area and

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.250
almost like a like corralled in area and
 

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.189
almost like a like corralled in area and
they're out in the ocean but they're

00:10:54.189 --> 00:10:54.199
they're out in the ocean but they're
 

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:55.929
they're out in the ocean but they're
only in this one trapped area and

00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:55.939
only in this one trapped area and
 

00:10:55.939 --> 00:10:57.490
only in this one trapped area and
they're feeding them you know and

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:57.500
they're feeding them you know and
 

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.259
they're feeding them you know and
occasionally they get out like to get

00:10:59.259 --> 00:10:59.269
occasionally they get out like to get
 

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:01.119

they're
 

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.720
they're
so all these hamachi grade like

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:07.730
so all these hamachi grade like
 

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.480

sushi-grade yellowtail are swimming

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.490
sushi-grade yellowtail are swimming
 

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.699
sushi-grade yellowtail are swimming
around all over the place outside and

around all over the place outside and
 

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:14.139
around all over the place outside and
they're breeding they're getting bigger

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:14.149
they're breeding they're getting bigger
 

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:16.660
they're breeding they're getting bigger
guys it's crazy it's interesting but but

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:16.670
guys it's crazy it's interesting but but
 

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.710
guys it's crazy it's interesting but but
I was thinking when they were telling me

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720
I was thinking when they were telling me
 

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.420
I was thinking when they were telling me
that well so if that's what they did

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:19.430
that well so if that's what they did
 

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.860
that well so if that's what they did
like maybe they should do that and just

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:20.870
like maybe they should do that and just
 

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.569
like maybe they should do that and just
keep releasing them maybe we should be a

00:11:22.569 --> 00:11:22.579
keep releasing them maybe we should be a
 

00:11:22.579 --> 00:11:25.480
keep releasing them maybe we should be a
program that all the people who buy

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:25.490
program that all the people who buy
 

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.660
program that all the people who buy
sushi fund into that just takes a little

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.670
sushi fund into that just takes a little
 

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.530
sushi fund into that just takes a little
piece of the sushi money and uses it to

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:31.540
piece of the sushi money and uses it to
 

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.940
piece of the sushi money and uses it to
develop these programs to make sure that

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:33.950
develop these programs to make sure that
 

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.980
develop these programs to make sure that
these fucking fish keep breeding so you

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:35.990
these fucking fish keep breeding so you
 

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.079
these fucking fish keep breeding so you
can have more sushi I think people will

yeah I feel better me you're helping out
 

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.639
yeah I feel better me you're helping out
yeah that's what I think we can leave

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:45.649
yeah that's what I think we can leave
 

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:48.639
yeah that's what I think we can leave
this next next next next generation they

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:48.649
this next next next next generation they
 

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:50.019
this next next next next generation they
have a real good possibility of like

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:50.029
have a real good possibility of like
 

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:53.079
have a real good possibility of like
making things work out better
