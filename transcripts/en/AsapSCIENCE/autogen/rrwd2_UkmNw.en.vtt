00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.000
 This episode is supported by "Blue Apron". 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.500
 We all have habits that we love to break 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.000
 Whether it's biting your nails, smoking or eating late at night 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 But why is it so hard to break these habits 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.685
 You may think that your day is made up of 

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:14.500
 Deliberate and conscious decisions 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 But in fact, a university study found that 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.835
 45% of your daily behaviors are actions you repeat every day 

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:25.105
 And tend to be carried out in the same location. These are your habits. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 Habits are attributed to one of the most primitive structures in your mind 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.300
 "Base nodes", the same area that helps control operations 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.825
 Such as breathing and swallowing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800
 In an MIT experiment, a mouse sits behind a maze gate (T) 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.885
 To his left is a piece of chocolate. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.655
 When he clicks the door, the mouse explores the maze 

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:44.200
 Inhale and scratch the walls 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.315
 First he explores the right then to the left, eventually finding the chocolates. 

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.315
 A survey of the base contract shows that he is working ferociously 

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:52.700
 Throughout the whole process. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 But after a week of training, 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 The mouse immediately runs towards the chocolate as soon as you click the gate. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.800
 At this point, there is very little brain activity once the portal is clicked 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.245
 The brain does not work again until it reaches the chocolate 

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:08.285
 Our brain seeks to reduce effort and space 

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:12.000
 This type of automatic brain behavior is referred to as "CHANKING - ORDER" 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800
 It aims to usually create a new pattern in brain cells. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.440
 It's like a task you do every day and no longer needs to think about 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 Brush your teeth or retreat from your own path 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
 Skills that were difficult to control but now become automatic. 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.400
 This process is 3 steps 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.825
 Step 1 is the "signal" that is for the mouse clicking on the gate 

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.620
 Step 2 is the 'style' jogging across the maze 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.240
 Step 3 is the "bonus", in this case chocolate. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.400
 The "signal" and "reward" are eventually intertwined to create "expectation" and "desire" 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.640
 Another basic part of habits 

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.445
 Because we go into automatic mode during patterns 

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.765
 Our brain depends entirely on participation in decision-making 

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.095
 Our habits will automatically unfold every time there is a signal 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 These habits can be so entrenched that rewards do not require to be good. 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.960
 A study on the habit of popcorn eaters in films found that they were minimally affected 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.740
 Hungry or how much they loved the food 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.880
 They ate the same amount of popcorn regardless of whether they were old or fresh 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.480
 Our habits often outweigh what we know is good for us 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.420
 For example, a study on the US "TAKE 5" campaign to encourage citizens to eat 5 fruits and vegetables a day 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.300
 Found that the program was effective in educating the public 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.000
 But the assessment found that it did not change the US income, where only 11% achieved the goal. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.700
 I changed people's intentions but not their habits 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.320
 So what should you do? 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.420
 Charles Duheij, author of "The Power of the Habit," offers an example of buying biscuits every day at about 3:15 pm at work 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.040
 The "signal" is the third hour, but the "reward" is somewhat more complicated 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.060
 Cookies can also be a pack of many bonuses 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.300
 It can be a relief from hunger or an increase in energy to satisfy your appetite for something sweet 

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.700
 Or it can be a nice break from work 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.760
 Or even an opportunity to talk to people 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.660
 "Dohij" wanted to break his habit of biscuits after some trial and error 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.800
 Discover that what you really aspire to is the socialization that came from buying biscuits 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.800
 If about 3 was up and find someone to chatter with him for 10 minutes instead 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.180
 Using the same "reference" and the same "reward" of socialization 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.880
 He was able to break the biscuits normally 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.900
 But what about customs that you do not always notice 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.320
 Such as biting your nails 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.000
 Psychologists suggest that you first think "when" you bite your nails 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.700
 Are you nervous? 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.500
 Or are you bored? 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.200
 In the case of boredom, the fingernails provide physical stimulation 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.980
 So, after that you need to mark each time in your day you feel bored and you have to force your fingernails to bite 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.900
 Maybe this is 5 times a day 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.300
 Maybe 28 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.000
 But then want to implement an equal response 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.160
 Whenever you feel the urge to bite, immediately put your hands in your pockets 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.140
 Then find a replacement that provides quick physical stimulation 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.800
 Such as rubbing your arm 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.500
 Or tap your joints on the desk 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.500
 This allows a replacement usually with a "reward" similar but also uses the same "cue" 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.980
 So when you're ready to accept a bad habit, just remember 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.460
 Know what your body really wants, and use the same signal and reward that serves the right purpose 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.840
 Be patient to build this new habit 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.280

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.025
 Fresh ingredients from the farm to your home door

 To choose from depending on the number of people who cook them, whether they like 

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:58.375
 A family or couple like us, only two people 

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.445
 They have 8 meals a week, and all meals take less than 

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:04.305
 40 minutes. Thank you very much for "Blue Apron" for support
