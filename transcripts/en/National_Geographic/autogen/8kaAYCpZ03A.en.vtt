00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310
of the plate on the image extracts it
 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.460
of the plate on the image extracts it
and breaks the plate into individual

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470
and breaks the plate into individual
 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.070
and breaks the plate into individual
characters number and letter recognition

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080
characters number and letter recognition
 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.380
characters number and letter recognition
programs determine what each character

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390
programs determine what each character
 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.780
programs determine what each character
is the plate number is then compared

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790
is the plate number is then compared
 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.930
is the plate number is then compared
against a database of more than 300,000

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
against a database of more than 300,000
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.660
against a database of more than 300,000
vehicles of interest and if a vehicle's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670
vehicles of interest and if a vehicle's
 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.290
vehicles of interest and if a vehicle's
plate matches oh there we go we got a

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300
plate matches oh there we go we got a
 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.780
plate matches oh there we go we got a
stone right there
