00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt; Hello Neotoy and the rest of the YouTube
community. I did listen to part of your complaints

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.230
about that we need to develop other measures
of say human progress or happiness or whatever.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.920
The GDP is too restricted. That is true. Gross
Domestic Product, as you refer really measures

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.560
a lot of the staff available economy. The
new economy, if you take that innovation and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.510
things like that, the service sector isn't
adequately reflected in that and if you broaden

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.830
it further than that, we are trying to develop
the UN system and others much broader index.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.840
There is probably for example by the UNDD,
the United Nations Development Program every

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.050
year, the Human Development Index, where one
tries to look at how countries progress across

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.580
a very broad range of different things, be
that health or social indicators, environmental

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.940
indicators. I don't think happiness is really,
we haven't found a way of measuring happiness.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.610
But much broader measurements of the way which
society's progress, that's called for and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.960
that's just circumstance on the way.
