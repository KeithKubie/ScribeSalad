00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.030
MALE SPEAKER: --to another
round of investing talks.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.840
Today we have a very, very
special guest with us.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.270
So if you've ever tried to ask
people about recommendations

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.130
on how to learn about
Warren Buffett's thought

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.750
about investing,
thoughts about investing,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.780
chances are that you've come
across two resources most

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.770
often.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.620
Of course his annual
letters to the shareholders.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.130
But the other resource
that comes up most often

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.270
is "The Essays of
Warren Buffett," which

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.160
have been edited and
compiled and published

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.520
by none other than our guest
today, Larry Cunningham.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.520
He is also the author of this
new upcoming book, "Berkshire

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.170
Beyond Buffett," and I'm just
going to read a couple of lines

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.490
from the foreword written
by the legendary Tom Murphy.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.960
"From afar it may
look like Berkshire's

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.810
wide-ranging businesses are
very different from one another.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.450
In fact, as Larry's
book discusses,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.910
though they span industries
different from one another,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.410
they are united by
certain key values,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.340
like managerial autonomy,
entrepreneurship, frugality,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.170
and integrity.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.120
This is not happenstance."

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.663
And to tell us more,
Larry Cunningham.

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:19.437
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:21.020
LARRY CUNNINGHAM:
Thank you very much.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.170
It's great to be here at
Google's physical campus.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.720
Having used its virtual assets
for many years in my research,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.735
including for this book,
"Berkshire Beyond Buffett."

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:36.180
And I'm grateful
for the opportunity

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.130
to discuss the book here with
you as part of the book tour.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.430
I'm Stopping mostly
at universities

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.790
across the country, but it's
fitting to stop at Google

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.400
as well, since it is in a
way a center of learning.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.530
You can find more
about the book tour

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.170
and see if I'll be
at a campus near you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.920
at the book's website,
berkshirebeyondbuffet.com.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.520
I've been studying
Berkshire for 20 years

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.672
and began writing
about it in 1997,

00:02:07.672 --> 00:02:09.880
with the publication of the
essays of Warren Buffett.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.680
That grew out of a conference
I organized where I first

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.210
met Warren, Berkshire's chairman
and CEO, who participated

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.200
alongside his wife, Susan,
and Berkshire's vice

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.160
chairman Charlie Munger.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.360
Back then, Berkshire Hathaway
looked like a mutual fund,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.440
primarily owning stocks.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.240
And Warren Buffett was most
famous as a stock picker.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.310
In earlier times, 80%
of Berkshire's value

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.330
was in common stocks and only
20% in operational businesses.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.930
Today, the mix is
the other way around.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.680
80% of Berkshire's value is in
its 50 operating subsidiaries

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.905
and only 20% in common stocks.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.390
Berkshire is today America's
fifth largest corporation.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.290
Marking its fiftieth anniversary
under Warren's leadership

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.640
next year, it is a microcosm
of corporate America.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.150
And its management
principles are

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.960
as impressive as Buffett's
investment acumen,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.715
though they are far
less appreciated.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.390
And now that Buffett
is 54, however, people

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.680
wonder what will happen to
Berkshire when he's gone.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.630
Is there something so
special about Buffett

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.955
that his departure will
spell Berkshire's demise?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.810
Most people think that there is.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.510
"The New York Times" last
year portrayed Buffett

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.790
as having a, quote,
"irreplaceable magic touch."

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.870
"The Economist"
this year lamented

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.700
that Berkshire was
down to, quote,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.490
"playing out the last hand."

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.570
Such views are paradoxical.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.170
Buffett's goal has been to
build a lasting corporation.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.610
And yet, even fans like these
think the company cannot

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.700
survive without him.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.620
So I researched
this question and I

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.160
found the inverse to be true.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.060
That there's something so
special about Berkshire

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.220
that it can prosper even
without Warren Buffett.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.769
I conclude that Buffett's
greatest single achievement,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.270
more than vast fortune
and generous philanthropy,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.020
is creating an organization
larger than himself.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.150
True, Buffett may
epitomize Berkshire,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.420
but it is far from
a one-man show.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.590
First, there is a
deep managerial bench,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.075
dozens of outstanding executives
who helped build Berkshire.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.920
For my research, Buffett gave
permission for them to help me.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.460
And they did, many of them
through interviews, surveys,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.360
and some even commented
on the manuscript.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.732
A dozen are joining
me on the book tour.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.190
It's an impressive
group of people.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.430
A second group are
Berkshire's directors,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.600
many who also helped me, like
former Microsoft executive

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.590
Charlotte Guyman, Warren's
son, Howard, and especially

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.081
Tom Murphy, who built Capital
Cities ABC into a media

00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:17.580
powerhouse.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.930
Earlier this year at
Berkshire's annual meeting,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.430
I asked Warren who should
write the forward to the book.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.380
He instantly said Tom Murphy.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.840
I asked why.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.110
He said, Tom was his
role model as a manager.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.480
Warren said he'd
learned most of what

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.940
he knows about
management from Tom.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.270
These comments are
noteworthy because this book

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.240
is the first about Buffett
as a manager, not as just

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.530
an investor, and the
first about Berkshire

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.895
as a corporate entity, not just
a portfolio of investments.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.800
And Tom's foreword, which
was read to you a moment ago,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.080
captures an important
theme of the book

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.725
and I've just put the same quote
you just heard on the screen.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.140
"Most of what I've
learned about management,"

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.300
Warren said, "I
learned from Murph.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.940
I kick myself
because I should have

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.240
applied the lessons
much earlier."

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.980
Here's Tom's quote,
"From afar, it

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.620
looks like
Berkshire's businesses

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.140
are very different
from each other.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.200
But on close inspection, they're
united by cultural bonds."

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.680
This is the myopia that
commentators suffer from.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.340
They concentrate
and overemphasize

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.020
the diversity of the
businesses and underappreciate

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.810
and sometimes overlook
the cultural unity.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.690
Berkshire subsidiaries
engage in a wide range

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.210
of totally unrelated businesses,
insurance and paint, energy

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.660
and housing, transportation
and food, jewelry

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.900
and pig-feeding equipment.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.160
They vary in size from fewer
than 1,000 employees at many,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.205
like Ben Bridge Jeweler,
to more than 30,000

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.080
at Fruit of the Loom.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.800
Annual revenues run between
300 million and one billion

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.870
for most, and there are
eight whose revenues

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.330
are so large that
if stood alone,

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.810
they'd be Fortune 500 companies.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.580
Profit margins are all over
the place, stretching from 1%

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.060
at McLane, the logistics
supply chain manager,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.910
to 25% at BNSF Railway.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.230
Berkshire subsidiaries
were acquired at prices

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.910
all over the map, way less than
a billion for Justin boots,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.620
2 billion for Shaw carpets, 9
billion for the Marmom group,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.460
the conglomerate that Jay
and Robert Pritzker built.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.900
They were acquired
at varying multiples,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.690
from cheap bargains for
the maker of Garanimals

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.950
to princely premiums for
the likes of BH Energy.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.380
And Berkshire subsidiaries are
headquartered all over the map.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.900
Beneath that slide is a map of
the United States of America

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.670
that in this picture
are not showing up,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.870
but they are in Massachusetts,
North Carolina, Tennessee,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.300
California,
Washington, all over,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.164
more than half the
states of the country.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.640
This diversity can be
explained by the first sentence

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.190
of my book.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.850
Berkshire Hathaway
is an accident.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.070
It has never had
a business plan.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.710
It doesn't believe
in strategic plans.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.180
It is purely opportunistic,
buying companies

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.770
that fit its criteria
and gel with its culture.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.700
Berkshire has
disclosed what it seeks

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.110
in its acquisitions since 1986,
when it ran an ad in the "Wall

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.380
Street Journal"
stating its criteria.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.540
Those criteria
have never changed,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.040
except for size, which went from
5 million in annual earnings

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.890
back then to 75 million today.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.240
Proven profitability, good
unleveraged returns on equity,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.105
management in place, basic
businesses, and a fair price.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.750
Berkshire often sites
Berkshire culture

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:34.100
as part of what will enable
it to prosper without him,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.920
but he's never said
exactly what that culture

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.830
is or explained
where it comes from.

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:41.750
That's where I come in.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.170
By defining and illustrating
Berkshire culture,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.350
my book contends
that this culture

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.900
is Berkshire's most valuable and
durable competitive advantage,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.130
which will contribute to
its business longevity

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.605
long after the
Warren Buffett era.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.920
Intuitively, people don't
expect conglomerates,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.290
vast and diverse, to have
discernible corporate cultures,

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.630
but Berkshire has
a distinctive one,

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.425
based on a core set
of shared values.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.890
In my research, I
probed Berkshire's

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:25.800
fifty main subsidiaries,
seeking to identify

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.380
their corporate cultures,
looking at the practices

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.640
and beliefs that define
them, through legends, lore,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.025
and the trials of transitions.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.290
I then scrutinized
these profiles,

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.210
and as I did a pattern emerged.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:47.040
I saw recurring traits across
all of them, nine altogether,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.660
all being intangible traits
that the subsidiaries

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.740
turn into economic gain.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.800
In the book, by offering
individual snapshots

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.850
of these fifty companies,
organized around those nine

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.230
values, the book presents
a portrait of the whole.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.510
Let me highlight a
few of these traits.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.250
Berkshire subs
tend to be thrifty,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.640
some say frugal,
cheap, even tightwads.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.125
Geico is a great example.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.610
Its business model
is to be the low cost

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.300
supplier of car insurance,
a standardized product

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.030
that law requires people
to have and few people

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.980
wish to splurge on.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.380
Geico turns those conditions
into a competitive advantage.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.170
It doesn't pocket all the
savings from its thrift,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.040
but passes most on to customers.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.840
In fact, it caps it's
underwriting profit at 4%.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.830
If profits would
be more than that,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.190
it lowers prices, delivering
value to its customers.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.020
This, of course,
is not altruism.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:00.730
That model grows market share,
increases total premiums,

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.135
and enlarges aggregate profits.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.370
All Berkshire subsidiaries
embrace the golden rule.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.010
Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.840
Take Clayton Homes.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.710
It is a leading lender
to lower-income families

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.170
in the United States and also
manufactures the trailer homes

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:27.220
that many of that cohort buy.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.210
It always looks out
for its customers.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.440
Here's an example of
how Jim Clayton, who

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.545
founded the company,
treated his customers.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.450
He sat down with
them and determined

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.590
what their income was
and their resources,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.760
and then worked
backwards to build homes

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.250
and lend money to
meet their budgets.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.700
Integrity like this pays.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.600
Amid the financial
crisis of 2008,

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.600
Clayton's peers were
uncovered lending

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.580
to sketchy buyers who they lured
in with low teaser interest

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.750
rates.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.490
Those companies faltered
and many cratered

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.280
during the financial crisis.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.710
That enabled Clayton
to prosper, moving it

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.240
from fourth in its
industry to number one.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.270
Integrity is so
central at Berkshire,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.750
that managers even remotely
threatening it are soon let go.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.390
Whether David Sokol,
once considered

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.540
a probable successor
to Buffett, who

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.080
was alleged to have
engaged in insider trading,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.320
or successive managers at
Benjamin Moore, who prepared

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.310
to market paint through
big box retailers

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.070
in violation of a
commitment Berkshire

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.840
had made to its local
distributor network.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.950
Berkshire subs are earnest.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.575
They consider keeping a
promise to be sacrosanct.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.670
And they turn that moral
conviction into economic gain.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.620
Examples are Berkshire's other
two big insurance companies,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.410
National Indemnity,
NICO, and Gen Re.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.250
They insure large and unusual
risks, some spanning decades.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.080
These features render their
word in insurance policy

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.010
a precious asset.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.840
For instance earlier
this year, NICO

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.886
insured an offer by
Quicken to pay $1 billion

00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:31.190
to anyone correctly predicting
the Men's NCAA 64 Tournament

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.650
Bracket, the odds of
which are something

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.340
like 1 in 126 billion.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.070
If you pick it, Quicken
probably doesn't

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.490
have the billion dollars
to pay, but NICO does

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.540
and it will pay up.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.995
The NICO, Gen Re business
model differs from Geico's.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.610
They don't put the money in
the pockets of customers.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.820
They pocket the profit.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.130
They charge premiums for the
kind of special commitments

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.250
that these high-end
products entail.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.580
So Berkshire thus
generates value

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.960
from its high-end
businesses where

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.310
customers pay a premium
for earnestness.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.930
People prize autonomy
and complex businesses

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.030
gain value from
hands-off oversight.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.580
Berkshire is thoroughly
decentralized,

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.430
with subsidiary CEOs having
virtually unbridled discretion

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.490
over all operational
and strategic decisions.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.827
Autonomy starts at the
top and trickles down

00:15:35.827 --> 00:15:38.035
throughout the subsidiaries
and in most subsidiaries,

00:15:38.035 --> 00:15:40.490
it tends to trickle
down across that.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.580
A conspicuous example
is The Pampered Chef,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.400
which sells its kitchen
gadgetry through 70,000

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.125
independent distributors, all
of whom call their own shots.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.980
Every CEO I interviewed
for the book

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.065
emphasized the value of
autonomy at Berkshire.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.610
Jim Weber, the CEO of Brooks,
the running shoe company,

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.180
put it this way in my
interview with him.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.530
Quote, "I've never had so
much autonomy in my career

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.730
and never felt so accountable."

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:20.600
Tom Manenti, the CEO of MiTek,
the construction material firm,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.910
spoke of the trickle down
rationale in my interview

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.780
with him.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.735
Quote, "Berkshire and Buffett
give me total autonomy.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.980
Being treated that
way makes it easy

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:35.340
for me to treat our
managers the same way."

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.950
In chapter 16, I conclude
with this sentence, quote,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.110
"Berkshire's secret to
managing a large complicated

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.310
organization is to
manage parsimoniously,

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.930
as little as possible.''

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.985
And finally Buffett is well
known as a long-term investor.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.340
But a more profound point
about time at Berkshire

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.035
is that its horizon is forever.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.780
Unique among its arrivals
in the acquisition market,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.990
Berkshire has not sold a
subsidiary in 40 years.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.280
That sense of permanence
has great economic value,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.290
whether to family
businesses wanting a legacy

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.129
or entrepreneurs
wanting security.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.950
The most dramatic
are subsidiaries

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.390
I call corporate orphans,
those that were owned serially

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.030
by leveraged buyout
operators, private equity

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.985
firms, or bankruptcy trustees.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.530
The experience can make managers
ache for a permanent home.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.930
For example, the
recreational vehicle maker

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.080
now called Forest River was
owned by three different LBO

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.850
operators in a row
before being acquired

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.730
by its current CEO, Pete Liegl.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:05.260
It raised funds in yet another
LBO, borrowed very costly debt,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.894
the LBO operators micromanaged
Pete and the company

00:18:08.894 --> 00:18:10.060
soon sailed into bankruptcy.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.980
Pete bought most of the
assets out of bankruptcy,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.600
rebuilt the company,
positioned it as number one

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.110
in the industry, and then
sold it to Berkshire,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.040
where he continues to
expand, without debt,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.990
with total autonomy,
and a permanent home.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.085
So permanence is
Berkshire's bedrock.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.940
That is reason to believe
in Berkshire's future

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.970
after Warren Buffett is gone.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.240
Now, the Warren Buffett
era continues of course,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.550
and may continue for
another decade or two,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.360
as Warren is in
very good health.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.760
Still, whenever it ends, as
I write in the book's closing

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.750
passages, quote, "while it's
hard to imagine Berkshire

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:02.560
without Buffett, it seems
wiser to believe in Berkshire

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.000
beyond Buffett, an institution
that transcends the man

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.182
and will be his legacy."

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.890
I thank you very much
for your attention.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.397
I'd be delighted to have
questions from the audience.

00:19:13.397 --> 00:19:14.230
Thank you very much.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.400
AUDIENCE: I know that,
at least in the past,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.790
Warren Buffett
has kind of tended

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.991
to avoid tech companies in his
investments, kind of saying he

00:19:26.991 --> 00:19:29.490
doesn't understand the industry,
it's under a lot of change.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.040
Do you foresee that changing in
the Berkshire beyond Buffett?

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.330
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: It
might change a little.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.360
I mean, the lack
of understanding

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.140
is a relatively personal
quality that Buffett has.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.532
And so if his successor were
more tech savvy and able

00:19:47.532 --> 00:19:49.900
to understand it,
there's great possibility

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.440
that you would see some tech
companies within the Berkshire

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.200
family.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.690
The piece about
rapidity of change,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.620
though, is a question mark.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.040
Berkshire prefers
rudimentary businesses,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.080
those that have been
around a long time, that

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.735
change relatively little.

00:20:06.735 --> 00:20:09.380
And so if the successor
were to adhere

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.120
to that aspect of
the rationale, I

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.071
wouldn't expect to see a great
many come into the Berkshire

00:20:15.071 --> 00:20:15.570
fold.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.740
So we'll have to see.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.710
But certainly, the
first half, somewhat

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.410
of an idiosyncratic
position rather

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.630
than an institutional position.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.100
But the need for focusing
on rudimentary businesses,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.480
I think, will provide
a continuing filter.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.210
AUDIENCE: As you
were closing this,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.992
you mentioned there was that
person who did the homes

00:20:35.992 --> 00:20:36.700
and then sold it.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.270
It came out of LBO three
times, and then they

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.440
ended up selling it.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.300
Yeah, that one-- Forest River.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.560
So after he made a profit,
what was the benefit

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.678
of going to
Berkshire after that?

00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:52.622
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: Capital.

00:20:52.622 --> 00:20:54.080
In order to grow
this company, it's

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.480
a capital-intensive operation.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.020
It's a manufacturing operation.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.990
He's got plants in a variety of
states, distribution centers,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.490
and so on.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.870
And so in order to
grow, he needed capital.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.690
And his personal
experience with the LBO,

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.040
and the company's experience
with LBOs before him

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.210
showed that borrowing
large amounts of capital

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.980
can be dangerous.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.530
So he did not want to go the
LBO route to get capital.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.310
I left out that-- I tell
in the book-- he had also

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.150
taken the company
public at one point

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.320
to gain capital, which also
provided a bit of a bruising

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.080
experience.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.540
Short-term pressure to
deliver profits this quarter,

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.560
and this half year,
and so on, were

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.510
difficult to sustain in
the recreational vehicle

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.030
manufacturing space.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.160
So this LP, he had just been
bruised-- borrowing money,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.320
raising equity in the
public capital markets.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.810
So once he righted the ship,
he needed more capital.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.620
And Berkshire was a
perfect place for him.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.890
Because there's
plenty of capital,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.760
and as long as you're generating
good returns on capital,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.450
you're likely to
get plenty more.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.380
And he has done a terrific
job in doing that.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.270
In his press release, when he
announced that transaction,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.170
emphasized that this
company will no longer

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.066
be borrowing money.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:18.540
So it's all Berkshire
capital, and he's just

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.540
doing a phenomenal job.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.830
And he's just one example.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.390
There are seven what I
call corporate orphans

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.740
that I feature in that chapter.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.010
They pivot around that
same longing for a way

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.180
to generate capital
without the shackles

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.900
of either micromanagement
or short term-ism.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.410
Berkshire is one place.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.140
AUDIENCE: Recently, Berkshire
made some big investments

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.090
in BYD in China and
Posco in South Korea.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.290
I was wondering, on a
going-forward basis,

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.160
do you see more of that?

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.540
And since culture is such
a big part of the business,

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.780
how do they evaluate
the management

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.389
with such different
cultural situations?

00:22:58.389 --> 00:22:59.930
LARRY CUNNINGHAM:
Excellent question.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:00.440
Thanks.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.940
I would first draw a
distinction between common stock

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.070
investments like those two that
you mentioned, where Berkshire

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.340
buys a minority
interest and doesn't

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.890
have the full control
over those enterprises,

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.060
and on the other
hand, the subsidiaries

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.710
that it does fully
own and fully control.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.480
So the commitment of permanence
is to those companies

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.180
that it fully controls
and fully owns.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.080
So when it bought See's Candy,
or Forest River, or Geico,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.520
the commitment
is, we will always

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.020
own you and never sell you.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.910
You with me?

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.026
So those minority common
stock positions, Berkshire

00:23:36.026 --> 00:23:37.900
and Buffett would prefer
to own them forever,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.460
but there's no
commitment of that sort.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.382
So if they deteriorate
economically,

00:23:42.382 --> 00:23:44.340
culturally, or for other
reasons, they're sold.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.470
And that explains
the subsidiaries.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.730
All but one are American
companies based in America

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.525
with managerial
affinity to things

00:23:56.525 --> 00:23:58.900
Berkshire has been doing for
a long time and understands.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.520
The one exception is ISCAR,
short for Israeli Car Buy,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.840
which is based in Israel with
operations all over the world.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.710
And it's actually-- even
though it's a foreign company,

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.580
it has a lot in
common with Berkshire.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.240
It's a large conglomerate, a
network of different companies.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.950
But when they went
and bought that,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.940
it was a very slow
transaction for Berkshire.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.480
Because he, Buffett,
and his inner circle

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.220
had to learn about Israel,
management practice there,

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.740
tax issues.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.750
So it took a lot longer.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.330
So with that backdrop,
I don't expect

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.090
many immediate additional
acquisitions abroad.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.650
But I do predict in the book
that we will see that gradually

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.540
in the coming years.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.310
But I think, in other words,
that the Berkshire model

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.560
is scalable to the world.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.060
But I think it will take longer
to do that than it has taken

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.285
to spread across
the United States.

00:24:57.285 --> 00:24:58.310
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.620
One of my concerns
for Berkshire is

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:07.130
that what if the successor
engages in empire building?

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:13.510
So if they make some big,
major mistake in acquisition,

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:18.300
then Berkshire is going to
underperform the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.740
So what's your take on that?

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.530
LARRY CUNNINGHAM:
Yeah, I think so.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.430
I think the first thing to
appreciate about mistakes

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.240
is that Berkshire has made a
lot of them in its history.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.910
And the first thing that the
successor and his community

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.770
will need to remember
is that they're

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.430
going to make them again.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.760
You with me?

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.040
People should avoid-- I think
the one big risk for Berkshire

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.130
beyond Buffett is the nostalgia
trap, when people think, oh,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.640
Berkshire was so
wonderful before.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.430
Now there are
mistakes being made.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.760
So mistakes will be made.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.347
And I think people should
accept that the CEO will

00:25:50.347 --> 00:25:50.930
make mistakes.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.190
If the mistake
she or he makes is

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.290
a mistake of violating
traditional Berkshire culture,

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.981
undermining some of
these principles,

00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:02.230
then I think there would be
serious cause for concern.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.140
For example, if a
successor were to say,

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.182
we are not going to continue
to own Forest River.

00:26:09.182 --> 00:26:10.140
We've had enough of it.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.420
We're going to sell it.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.320
If they did that, that's
more than a mistake.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.320
That would be a breach, I
think, of Berkshire culture.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.260
And if that kind of
decision were made,

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.140
the CEO began selling
off subsidiaries,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.690
that would destroy Berkshire,
it would undermine, at least,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.030
a very important
fundamental principle.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.315
I don't think a
person will do that.

00:26:29.315 --> 00:26:30.440
There may be some pressure.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.100
Activist shareholders
might pressure a successor

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.330
to sell this company, that
company, or the other one

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.490
to get the cash rather than
having these companies sit

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.850
inside the broad conglomerate.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.240
I don't think the activist
shareholders will succeed

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.300
in that kind of
campaign, however,

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.120
because all the CEOs
of Berkshire companies

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.780
understand these
values, buy into them,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.946
and one of them who's leading
the company will sustain them.

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.570
Moreover, the board
of directors that I

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.540
refer to understand
these values,

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.950
appreciate their
importance, and will likely

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:02.510
try to enforce them.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.220
Indeed, the chairman
of the board

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.540
is very likely be
Warren's son Howard,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.620
whose job, Warren
has said, will be

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.050
to remind everyone, if
needed, of Berkshire culture.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.060
So there is some risk there.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.050
But I think the
plan that's in place

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.496
is the best reasonably possible
plan to protect against it.

00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:23.390
AUDIENCE: I have a
three-part question.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:29.500
Given that the success of
Berkshire going forward

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.380
is mostly the operational
companies and not

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.350
the investments, what do
you think the investment

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.890
portfolio plays a
role going forward,

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.200
specifically Ted and
Todd's role going forward?

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.490
How important will it be?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.480
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: OK.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.646
Shall I take that one first?

00:27:45.646 --> 00:27:46.490
That's great.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.270
I think it's true that in
terms of Berkshire overall,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.230
the investment portfolio is
now 20% of the overall value.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.930
And so within that
broad company,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.850
it's less important
than it's ever been.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.880
I should stress, it's
still $120 billion.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.477
So it's not like you
can just ignore it.

00:28:02.477 --> 00:28:03.310
It's a lot of money.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.910
Ted Weschler and Todd Combs
have been successful investors

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.500
on their own before
joining Berkshire

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.580
five or seven years ago.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.530
They have now continued to
show their investment prowess,

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.940
sometimes beating Warren
Buffett in those years.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.040
So I've got a lot of
confidence in those fellas,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.820
and obviously Warren
does and the board does.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.590
I think their job,
the hardest thing

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:31.140
they will have to deal
with is the anchor of size.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.490
It's very difficult with
that amount of money

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.210
to pick stocks and continue
to outperform the market.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.510
Moreover, Berkshire's
investment portfolio

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.910
is highly concentrated.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:51.010
Of that $120 billion odd, 70% of
it is in just seven companies--

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:59.320
American Express, Wells Fargo,
IBM, Coca Cola, Exxon Mobile.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.080
Just seven companies make
up 70% of the portfolio.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.670
Now, in the next
5, 10, or 15 years,

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.260
the economic characteristics
of one or more of those

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.140
may deteriorate.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.190
And it may be time to sell.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.080
Whoever has to make
that decision, that's

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.690
a huge challenge to decide,
OK, we're selling Coca Cola.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.690
That's going to be a very
hard decision to make.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.160
Moreover, having
made it, then they

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.885
have to figure out what to do
with $10, $15, or $20 billion

00:29:27.885 --> 00:29:30.080
in one fell swoop.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.860
It's very rare to find
acquisition opportunities

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.770
of that scale, as
Berkshire repeatedly shows.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.750
It's eager to find such
things, but they simply

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.950
don't come up very often.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.040
So Todd, Ted, or
whomever is running

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.580
that portfolio is going to have
a very hard job of deciding

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.750
what to do.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.330
Probably, it will
mean buying a larger

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.220
number of smaller stakes.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.550
In other words, making it look
more and more like the market.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.061
I think Todd and Ted,
they will do fine.

00:29:56.061 --> 00:29:58.310
But it's going to be a very
different job than the job

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.768
Warren has had,
and there are going

00:29:59.768 --> 00:30:01.135
to be some heavy challenges.

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:04.750
AUDIENCE: I think part of
the question is answered,

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:05.860
but I'll ask it anyway.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.680
How do you compare Ted and
Todd's performance so far

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.005
to, say, Warren Buffett's
investing prowess about 20,

00:30:15.005 --> 00:30:16.164
25 years ago?

00:30:16.164 --> 00:30:17.580
I think both of
them are managing,

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.230
what, $7 or $10
billion together?

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.070
I'm thinking if you went
back to '70s or '80s

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.770
when Warren was
managing that portfolio.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.850
How do you compare the two?

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.020
Do you have any insights
or additional thoughts?

00:30:33.352 --> 00:30:37.050
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: They
are experienced investors

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.240
with a good track record.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.290
At Berkshire,
they, I think, were

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.260
responsible for
selecting DirecTV,

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.610
which had a good run
and then a big payout,

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.740
and also for DaVita
Health, which

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.580
is developing kidney
dialysis equipment.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.940
And both of them
are very successful.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.730
So it's hard to compare,
are those like Coca Cola,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.580
or like Cap Cities ABC?

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.739
I don't know.

00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:05.030
It's different eras, it's
different types of businesses

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.530
and so on.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.010
But the track record is strong.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.210
There's a joke floating
around on Twitter this morning

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.622
about this person is the
Warren Buffett of Canada,

00:31:14.622 --> 00:31:16.580
and this person is the
Warren Buffett of China,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.705
and this person is the
Warren Buffett of Australia.

00:31:18.705 --> 00:31:22.280
And someone from MarketWatch
asked me, is it good to say,

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.160
you're the Warren
Buffett from this place,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.660
and that place, and
the other place?

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.640
And my response,
thanks to my wife,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.360
was there's only
one Warren Buffett.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.809
As good as Tad and Ted
are, they're not Warren,and

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:35.100
they're not going to be Warren.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.100
But I think they'll do
just fine for themselves.

00:31:37.709 --> 00:31:39.500
AUDIENCE: What do you
think about this idea

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.240
that software is
eating the world,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.770
and that basically,
a lot of businesses

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:50.570
that have been sort of immune to
technological change for a time

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.070
basically get more
and more software

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.710
that will determine their
eventual profit margin?

00:31:56.222 --> 00:31:57.930
When I look at the
list of the companies,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.090
they seem the ones that are a
little bit insulated, maybe,

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.590
right now.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.820
But down the road, do you
think that's going to change?

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.990
LARRY CUNNINGHAM:
Every competitor

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.720
faces risks of
technological change,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.280
and disruption, and
even obsolescence.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.780
That's been true
throughout history.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.363
And we probably are
living in a period

00:32:18.363 --> 00:32:20.740
of particularly rapid change.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.660
Even companies in
Berkshire's family face this.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.920
And See's Candies, for example,
is an excellent confectioner

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.740
with a terrific
product and brand name,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.740
but it's been kind of regional.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.710
And they have not been able to
expand it despite the internet.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.760
And they need to.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.100
And they are working on
that, but it's going slowly.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.330
The Pampered Chef to
which I referred earlier

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.350
sells its products
through these 70,000

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.470
independent distributors.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.230
Traditionally, these people
have parties at their homes

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.400
and invite friends and
neighbors to test out the stuff

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400
and use it.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.440
And it's a quaint, delightful,
wonderful business model

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.420
that was very
successful in the '90s,

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.990
but is less successful now.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.200
They need to figure
out how to navigate

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.050
the current environment.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.209
Berkshire has acquired
a lot of newspapers,

00:33:13.209 --> 00:33:14.750
just in the last
three or four years,

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.680
a business that is
rapidly changing.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.510
So many Berkshire companies
face this kind of challenge.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:25.490
What's special about Berkshire
is that it sticks with them

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:30.230
and attempts to help ride out
the onslaught, and adapt to it,

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.010
and change, and evolve,
rather than just sell it.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:36.390
So as long as other
members of the family

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.950
maintain their
competitive advantages

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.900
and generate capital to
support those that need it,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.635
the whole can be sustained.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.850
And the idea of keeping even
those that are struggling

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.720
is so fundamental to the
company's DNA and its success

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:59.270
that anybody who takes over the
CEO job will have to see that.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.440
AUDIENCE: So during
the financial crisis,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:10.600
AIG was destroyed just because
a small part of the company.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.199
It was the derivative
department.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.159
So do you see that
there might be

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:18.190
something like
that in Berkshire?

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.630
Some major mistake
that just destroys

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.870
all of the shareholder value?

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.870
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: Right.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:27.780
Yeah, that's right.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.409
It was the Financial
Products Division at AIG

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.730
that had expanded a portfolio
of credit default swaps

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.909
that turned out to be toxic.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:40.530
And Ben Bernanke, the Chairman
of the Federal Reserve

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.659
at the time,
described the company

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.179
as being an insurance company
with a hedge fund on top.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:49.920
That FP division had absorbed
enormous risks and became,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.670
really, a cancer that
threatened to metastasise

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.350
across the company
until the great surgeons

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.340
at the federal government
did serious surgery

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.460
and saved the victim
in a certain way.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.070
I wrote a book about that
with the former chairman

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.410
of the company
and attribute that

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:12.680
to a problem of internal
control with the company,

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.030
that that group should not
have been able to do that.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.320
There should have been
monitoring and oversight

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.010
of that group that had
simply disappeared.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.080
So it's a great and
important question.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.160
Every company needs
to have some mechanism

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.000
to identify potential
rogues in their midst

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.190
to eliminate that
kind of problem.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.920
And I do think
Berkshire has that.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.140
It's not a traditional
internal control structure

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.620
with lots of layers
of oversight,

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:46.920
and thick reporting protocols,
and second guessing its own

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.800
that you would see today at
AIG, or at IBM, or probably

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.220
even at Google.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.020
But instead, this
approach-- what

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.690
I call a trust-based approach
to corporate governance--

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.420
relies heavily on that
autonomy principle.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:06.320
So at Berkshire headquarters,
there is no direct mechanism

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.570
to monitor, let's say, the
Cyprus Insurance Company.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.180
What exactly are
they underwriting?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.360
Or even, for that
matter, Gen Re.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.540
Gen Re got into
considerable difficulty

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.670
shortly after Berkshire
acquired it in the late '90s

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:26.970
because it had underwritten
a concentrated level

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:31.020
of super catastrophic risk
of biological, chemical,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.520
and nuclear disaster.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.620
And after 9/11, it
faced insolvency.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.280
And if Berkshire hadn't acquired
it a couple years before,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.080
it would have gone under.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.360
Berkshire put into
place senior management

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.140
who vowed to correct
that problem,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.700
eliminate those kinds
of concentrated risk,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.020
and maintain a culture
in which that will not

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.950
be permitted to happen again.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:02.260
So all across Berkshire,
that kind of autonomy, trust

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.440
is baked into the company.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.430
A rogue can show up anywhere.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:13.040
But I think-- I am convinced
that the governance,

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.410
the control model at Berkshire,
this trust-based model,

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.360
does work at the company.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:23.790
So I have a very
low level of concern

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.200
that you would see
a financial products

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.970
division like AIG
had at Berkshire.

00:37:31.189 --> 00:37:33.230
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the importance of culture

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.425
in the companies that
Berkshire acquires.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:38.550
Does Berkshire
look for companies

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:41.930
that already bring the
same cultural values to it,

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.750
or do the subsidiaries
evolve to that same point?

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.210
And how does a large
company like Berkshire

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.885
preserve its culture?

00:37:50.885 --> 00:37:53.150
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: That's
an excellent question.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.690
My answer is that
it's iterative.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.210
When Berkshire scouts
for acquisitions,

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.170
or when acquisition proposals
are presented to it, primarily

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.680
to Warren, he has a sense
that the company needs

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.270
to be frugal, earnest,
entrepreneurial,

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.800
prepared for autonomy, and
interested in the long term.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.770
So it's a mental checklist
that he has that companies that

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.240
fit the Berkshire
mold will also have.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.820
Then when they join
the Berkshire family,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.350
those values get reinforced.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.930
And so the family is, in
that way, self-sustaining.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:34.550
Then that is sui
generis in the sense

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.485
of being almost automatic.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.920
Sure, people need to
buy into the principles

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.460
and need to reinforce
them through their words

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.172
and actions.

00:38:45.172 --> 00:38:46.755
But I think you see
that in abundance.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:55.710
But it could unravel if the
wrong leadership assumed

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.660
control and decided that these
values were not important

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.980
anymore, and began to
micromanage the CEOs,

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.300
to sell subsidiaries,
or to skate

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.060
close to the edge of integrity,
and so on, then the culture

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:12.910
could unwind.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.130
And you'd have simply
another conglomerate

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.180
like Litton Industries, or
Gulf and Western, or United

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.920
Technologies, or General
Electric, what have you.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.410
And what is special about
Berkshire would dissolve.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.710
AUDIENCE: You've written
about Ben Graham, the essays

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.600
of Warren Buffett, and
then AIG in this book.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.330
Through all your years of
interacting with everyone,

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:40.870
what would you say is one thing
you learned that you would like

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.220
to share with us about
investing, and then one thing

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.439
that you learned that could
apply to just life in general?

00:39:48.439 --> 00:39:50.480
LARRY CUNNINGHAM: I'll
take the second one first,

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.130
because it's easier.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:51.755
It's integrity.

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:56.570
Life in general-- just being
honest, being forthright,

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:02.430
keeping your word, treating
your promises as sacrosanct,

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.280
staying in the middle
of the playing field,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.250
to use an athletic
analogy, avoiding skating

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.150
on the edge of thin ice.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.450
I like Buffett's
admonition on this point

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:23.580
that he came up with in the
late 1980s Salomon Brothers bond

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.470
trading scandal.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.630
That was an investment banking
firm brought to its knees

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:33.430
by a few rogue traders who tried
to corner the US Treasury bond

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:39.210
market, and it threatened
the life of the firm.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.470
And in trying to rehabilitate
this institution, which

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:45.050
had been a venerable
banking house,

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:48.560
the board asked Warren, who had
bought stock in the company,

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.970
to become chairman.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.160
And he stepped into that
role with great turmoil.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.980
And the first thing he did was
clean out the top management

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.380
ranks and install three of
his own chosen executives

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.570
to be CEO, general
counsel, and CFO.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.700
And these were people
with exemplary reputations

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.360
for ethical business leadership.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:14.910
He then stood up and
told a press gathering,

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.600
and wrote a memo to
the workers, that

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.870
said, lose money for the firm,
and I will be understanding.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.625
Lose a shred of reputation for
the firm, and I'll be ruthless.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.280
I'm getting chills
just saying that.

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.071
Did you get chills?

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.820
And his test for that,
in case you needed it,

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.624
was in any action you're
about to take-- any insurance

00:41:41.624 --> 00:41:43.665
policy you're going to
underwrite, any bond trade

00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:46.690
you're going to do, any
leasing transaction, any sale

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:51.080
of a mobile home-- he said,
think about that decision,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.870
your activity, being
written up by a journalist

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:59.020
on the front page-- or now your
web page-- of your hometown

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.750
paper by a smart journalist.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.550
Would you do it knowing all
your friends and neighbors

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.220
know this is what you did?

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.620
That's a pretty good test.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.850
That's my answer to
your second question.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.810
Life lessons to me, lessons I'd
like to share with my children,

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.950
integrity is really number one.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.265
I like being thrifty,
and I like autonomy,

00:42:21.265 --> 00:42:22.370
and I like permanence.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.290
They're all very important.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.665
But if you had to
boil it down, I

00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:27.710
think integrity is number one.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.810
Investing lessons, I
admire the tradition

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.960
of value investing
begun by Ben Graham,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.840
sustained by and modified by
the likes of Phil Fisher, who

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.000
wrote the great book "Common
Stocks And Uncommon Profits,"

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.910
and by Charlie Munger, Warren's
partner since the '70s or '60s,

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.620
and Warren himself,
who emphasized

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.890
fundamental,
substantive analysis

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.110
of particular positions.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.205
It's hard homework.

00:42:56.205 --> 00:42:57.910
It's not easy to do.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.730
It requires research and effort.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.400
But I admire that tradition.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.970
So I guess the one thing I
learned from that is investing

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:13.380
is a significant undertaking.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.280
And if you're not
prepared for it, it's OK.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:20.150
But then the best thing to
do with your personal excess

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:26.280
capital is to buy an index fund,
like the ones run by Vanguard

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.960
or Fidelity, so that you don't
really have to do the work.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.400
You enjoy the market return.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.600
Good and bad overall,
long term probably good.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.780
But if you're going to
do tailored investing,

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.670
then I like the value
investing model,

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:42.240
fundamental [? substantive ?]
model in comparison, say,

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.860
with trying to track patterns
in performance over time,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.990
or trying to time the
market on a daily basis,

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.690
getting in and out
at the right times,

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:55.250
and other techniques
that don't appeal to me.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:00.290
So I've been a great devotee
of that Graham Fisher Buffett

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.694
Munger crowd.

00:44:01.694 --> 00:44:03.110
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.960
That was fascinating.
