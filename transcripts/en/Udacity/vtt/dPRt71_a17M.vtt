Did you know that nine out of ten
mathematicians say that learning ratios

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.350
is super important?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.520
In this topic, we're going to talk about
ratios, rates and unit conversions.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.750
And if you've ever used a term
like miles per gallon or

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.120
dollars per hour, you've used a rate.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.680
And if you've ever converted between
kilometers and miles or dollars and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.080
euros, you've used a unit conversion.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.510
This stuff shows of all the time and

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.810
maybe the most useful stuff
you learn in this class.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.760
So I hope you're as excited as I am.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.280
Let's get started
