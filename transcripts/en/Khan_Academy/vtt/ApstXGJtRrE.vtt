00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.670
- [Instructor] We are told
the proportional relationship

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.710
between the number of
hours a business operates

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.660
and its total cost of electricity is shown

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.030
in the following graph, all right.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.840
Which statements about the graph are true?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.580
Choose all answers that apply.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.130
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.680
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.590
And before I even look at the choices,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.670
let me analyze this a little bit.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.980
It is a proportional relationship.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.740
So we know that our total
cost, let me write it here.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.180
Our total cost

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.260
is going to be equal to some
constant of proportionality

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.520
times our number of hours.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.850
And we can even figure out

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.050
what that constant of
proportionality is going to be,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.260
because they give us this point A.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
We know that when our hours are four,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160
so when this is four right over here,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.627
our total cost is $120.

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:04.380
$120.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.720
So what times four is equal to 120?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.400
Well, we know that this k must be 30,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.480
'cause 30 times four is 120.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.810
So we can write that
proportional relationship

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.410
where our total cost is going to be equal

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.030
to our constant of proportionality, 30,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.430
times our number of hours.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.440
Number of hours.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.980
So let's see which of these choices,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.620
and it might be more than one,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.720
say this or describe what's going on here.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.670
So choice A, the y-coordinate of point A,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.510
so point A is at the point four comma 120,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.570
so the y-coordinate is the 120.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.570
That's the total cost

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.730
when you run your business for four hours.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.490
The y-coordinate of point
A represents the total cost

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.300
of electricity when the business
operates for four hours.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.860
Yes, that is exactly
or very close (laughs)

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.050
to what I just said, so I like this one.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.070
The total cost of electricity is $35

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.800
when operating the business for one hour.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.810
So let's go to one hour here.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.370
This is going to be the total cost.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.720
Now, you might say, hey, this
looks kinda close to $35,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.310
but that's why it was useful for us

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.690
to write this relationship
right over here,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.130
because what we see is that
our total cost is going

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.550
to be 30 times our number of hours.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.690
Our total cost here is actually
going to be 30, not 35.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.260
And it actually does look smack dab

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.960
in between 20 and 40 versus
a little bit closer to 40.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.580
So this one is not going to be true.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.060
And we're not gonna
select none of the above,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.230
'cause we actually did
select one of the above.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.063
And we're done.
