systems and good governance we really
need to think about education as part of

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730
need to think about education as part of
 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.080

what are some of the big impediment to
progress so I want to start off by

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300
progress so I want to start off by
 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.629
progress so I want to start off by
saying something about the progress that

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639
saying something about the progress that
 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.899

those types of indicators and of course
 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:12.079
those types of indicators and of course
those things are really important but

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:12.089
those things are really important but
 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.879

in back at the end of the 1990s and the

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:45.140
in back at the end of the 1990s and the
 

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.090
in back at the end of the 1990s and the
the start of 2000 we had something like

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:49.100
the start of 2000 we had something like
 

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.050
the start of 2000 we had something like
105 million kids who are out of school

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.060
105 million kids who are out of school
 

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.230
105 million kids who are out of school
the vast majority of those kids were in

southwest at South and West Asia and
sub-saharan Africa and what we've seen

sub-saharan Africa and what we've seen
 

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.890
sub-saharan Africa and what we've seen
in the decade since is a really steady

in the decade since is a really steady
 

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.660
in the decade since is a really steady
improvement so out of school numbers are

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:07.670
improvement so out of school numbers are
 

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.730
improvement so out of school numbers are
now down to about 72

now down to about 72
 

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.320
now down to about 72
that's a big step forward you can see

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:13.330
that's a big step forward you can see
 

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.200
that's a big step forward you can see
from that chart that the step forward

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.210
from that chart that the step forward
 

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.110
from that chart that the step forward
however has been very uneven and it's

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120
however has been very uneven and it's
 

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.450
however has been very uneven and it's
been uneven in two respects which is the

over that period and yet the

over that period and yet the
 

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.230
over that period and yet the
out-of-school numbers are coming down so

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240
out-of-school numbers are coming down so
 

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.750

that's a real testament to progress in

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760
that's a real testament to progress in
 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.470
that's a real testament to progress in
in sub-saharan Africa you can see also

00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480
in sub-saharan Africa you can see also
 

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.950
in sub-saharan Africa you can see also
that the progress is uneven over time we

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:02.960
that the progress is uneven over time we

the middle of this period and and and
that's continued now if you project this

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160
that's continued now if you project this
 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.260
that's continued now if you project this
forward to 2015 it gives you an idea of

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:32.270
forward to 2015 it gives you an idea of
 

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.950
forward to 2015 it gives you an idea of
where we might be if we carry on as we

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:35.960
where we might be if we carry on as we
 

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.070
where we might be if we carry on as we
are and this is what that projection

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.080
are and this is what that projection
 

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.540
are and this is what that projection
looked like you can see two things that

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:43.550
looked like you can see two things that
 

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.180
looked like you can see two things that
come out of that story the first is that

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.190
come out of that story the first is that
 

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.520
come out of that story the first is that
we're an awful long way from hitting the

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:48.530
we're an awful long way from hitting the
 

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.730
we're an awful long way from hitting the
target will we will still have over 50

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:51.740
target will we will still have over 50
 

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.920
target will we will still have over 50

school number will continue to rise
 

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.820
school number will continue to rise
steadily over time and that that's a

steadily over time and that that's a
 

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.890
steadily over time and that that's a
major concern because sub-saharan Africa

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:08.900
major concern because sub-saharan Africa
 

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.530

with the example of Nicaragua so if we

school later than they should or not
 

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.730

entering school at all but then if you

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740
entering school at all but then if you
 

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.800
entering school at all but then if you
track them through the system and you

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:12.810
track them through the system and you
 

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.240
track them through the system and you
ask the question well how many of those

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.250
ask the question well how many of those
 

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.130
ask the question well how many of those
kids actually get through to grade 5 the

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.140
kids actually get through to grade 5 the
 

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.350
kids actually get through to grade 5 the
survival rate to that grade is right

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360
survival rate to that grade is right
 

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.440
survival rate to that grade is right
down to thirty two percent that is to

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:24.450
down to thirty two percent that is to
 

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.380
down to thirty two percent that is to
say only one third of that Co hall are

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:27.390
say only one third of that Co hall are
 

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.900
say only one third of that Co hall are
actually getting into school and

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:28.910
actually getting into school and
 

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.970
actually getting into school and
progressing through school and of course

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980
progressing through school and of course
 

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.160
progressing through school and of course
getting into the last grade doesn't

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.170
getting into the last grade doesn't
 

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.420
getting into the last grade doesn't
necessarily mean you're going to get

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:35.430
necessarily mean you're going to get
 

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.940
necessarily mean you're going to get
through the last grade and it turns out

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:37.950
through the last grade and it turns out
 

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.280
through the last grade and it turns out
that only about one-quarter of children

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:40.290
that only about one-quarter of children
 

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.090
that only about one-quarter of children
get through the last grade so you can

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100
get through the last grade so you can
 

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.380
get through the last grade so you can
see from that example just how seriously

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.390
see from that example just how seriously
 

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.650
see from that example just how seriously
the problem of retention in school is as

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660
the problem of retention in school is as
 

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.190
the problem of retention in school is as
indicated by the high dropout rate and

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.200
indicated by the high dropout rate and
 

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.410
indicated by the high dropout rate and
in half of the countries of sub-saharan

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.420
in half of the countries of sub-saharan
 

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.580
in half of the countries of sub-saharan
Africa one-third or more of kids who go

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:01.590
Africa one-third or more of kids who go
 

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.550
Africa one-third or more of kids who go
into school drop out before completing

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:04.560
into school drop out before completing
 

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.199
into school drop out before completing
school so there's a twin challenge here

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:09.209
school so there's a twin challenge here
 

00:17:09.209 --> 00:17:11.810
school so there's a twin challenge here
with regard to access to school and that

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:11.820
with regard to access to school and that
 

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.730
with regard to access to school and that
challenge is first of all about getting

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740
challenge is first of all about getting
 

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.160
challenge is first of all about getting
kids who are out of school into the

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.170
kids who are out of school into the
 

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.290
kids who are out of school into the
school system the second challenge is

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.300
school system the second challenge is
 

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.939
school system the second challenge is
about ensuring that once they're in the

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:19.949
about ensuring that once they're in the
 

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:21.890
about ensuring that once they're in the
school system they stay in the system

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900
school system they stay in the system
 

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.740
school system they stay in the system
and they progress steadily through the

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:24.750
and they progress steadily through the
 

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.990
and they progress steadily through the
grades to have an opportunity of making

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000
grades to have an opportunity of making
 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.310
grades to have an opportunity of making
it through to secondary school I want to

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320
it through to secondary school I want to
 

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.800
it through to secondary school I want to
touch very briefly on some of the other

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:33.810
touch very briefly on some of the other
 

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.100
touch very briefly on some of the other
aspects of the education for all agenda

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.110
aspects of the education for all agenda
 

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.380
aspects of the education for all agenda
because I mean clearly education is not

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:39.390
because I mean clearly education is not
 

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.510
because I mean clearly education is not
just about what goes on in primary

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520
just about what goes on in primary
 

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.280
just about what goes on in primary
school there are two other goals 3 goals

these are both areas where we've seen
 

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.960
these are both areas where we've seen
progress but at the same time many

00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.970
progress but at the same time many
 

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.440

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:03.450
problems yeah so far I've been talking
 

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.710
problems yeah so far I've been talking
about primary school-aged children who

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720
about primary school-aged children who
 

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.930
about primary school-aged children who
don't make it through the system but if

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940
don't make it through the system but if
 

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.120
don't make it through the system but if
you look at the adolescent age group we

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.130
you look at the adolescent age group we
 

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.970
you look at the adolescent age group we
have just as many kids in the adolescent

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980
have just as many kids in the adolescent
 

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.120

in education tool the first thing we do
is to ask the question how many children

but the next question to ask of course

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620
but the next question to ask of course
 

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.710
but the next question to ask of course
well is who is most likely who faces the

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720
well is who is most likely who faces the
 

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.200
well is who is most likely who faces the
greatest risk in any society of getting

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.210

way of asking that is just to look at

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:21.990
way of asking that is just to look at
 

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.620
way of asking that is just to look at
what's happening to the poorest twenty
