00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.972
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Use what you know about absolute value and what we just covered to solve this

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:08.077
inequality. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Try your best. And if you're stuck, try watching the first couple

00:00:08.077 --> 00:00:12.036
seconds of the solution video. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Be sure to pause it once you think you have an

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:15.799
idea of what to do. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can write your answer in interval notation in the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.692
box. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Be sure to use parenthesis or brackets, or a union symbol if necessary.

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:20.233
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good luck.
