00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re gonna discuss…

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820
wait for it… THE MONGOLS.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.560
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols
in your head. Yes, that’s the picture: brutal,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.160
bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed
warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.039
meat directly off the bone, saying, "Bar bar
bar bar bar bar bar". In short, we imagine

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.410
the Mongol empire as stereotypically barbarian.
And that’s not entirely wrong.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.660
But if you’ve been reading recent world
history textbooks like we here at Crash Course

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.670
have, you might have a different view of the
Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.629
and success of their conquests — how they
conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.760
did in 400. How they controlled more than
11 million contiguous square miles. And you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.049
may even have read that the Mongols basically
created nations like Russia and even Korea.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.459
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols,
“smashed the feudal system” and created

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.329
international law. Renowned for their religious
tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.239
the first great free trade zone, like a crazy
medieval Eurasian NAFTA. And that’s not

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.559
entirely wrong either. Stupid truth, always
resisting simplicity.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:13.340
[theme music]

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.100
So remember herders? We talked about them
back in episode one as an alternative to hunting

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.040
and gathering or agriculture. Here are the
key things to remember:

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
1. Nomads aren’t Jack Kerouac: They don’t
just go on like random road trips. They migrate

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.820
according to climate conditions so they can
feed their flocks.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.560
2. Nomads don’t generally produce manufactured
goods which means they need to trade, so they

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.590
almost always live near settled people.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.760
And 3. Because they live in generally live
close to nature and in harsh conditions, pastoralists

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.790
tend to be tougher than diamond-plated differential
calculus. Like, think of the Huns, or the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.760
Xiongnu. Or the Mongols. Okay, Stan. That’s
enough. Back to me. Stan. I AM THE STAR OF

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.450
THIS SHOW NOT THE MONGOLS!!! Hi. Sorry about
that.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.440
Right, so one last thing: pastoral people
also tend to be more egalitarian, especially

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.530
where women are concerned. Paradoxically,
when there’s less to go around, humans tend

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.530
to share more, and when both men and women
must work for the social order to survive,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.440
there tends to be less patriarchal domination
of women. Although Mongol women rarely went

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.380
to war. I can’t tell your gender. I mean
you’ve got the pants, but then you also

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
have the floopity flop, so… That’s the
technical term, by the way. I’m a historian.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.040
If you had to choose a pastoral nomadic group
to come out of central Asia and dominate the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.639
world, you probably wouldn’t have chosen
the Mongols. Because for most of the history

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.049
we’ve been discussing, they just hung out
in the foothills bordering the Siberian forest,

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.389
mixing herding and hunting, quietly getting
really good at archery and riding horses.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.849
Also, the Mongols were much smaller than other
pastoral groups like the Tatars or the Uyghurs.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.329
And not to get like all Great Man History
on you or anything, but the reason the Mongols

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.840
came to dominate the world really started with one
guy, Genghis Khan. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.359
The story goes that Genghis or Chingus Khan
was born around 1162 with the name Temüjin

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.040
to a lowly clan. His father was poisoned to
death, leaving Temüjin under the control

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.989
of his older brothers, one of whom he soon
killed during an argument. By 19 he was married

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.529
to his first and most important wife, Börte,
who was later kidnapped. This was pretty common

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:01.409
among the Mongols, Temüjin’s mom had also
been kidnapped. In rescuing his wife, Temüjin

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.329
proved his military mettle and he soon became
a leader of his tribe, but uniting the Mongol

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.729
confederations required a civil war, which
he won, largely thanks to two innovations.

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.800
First, he promoted people based on merit rather
than family position, and second, he brought

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.900
lower classes of conquered people into his
own tribe while dispossessing the leaders

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.819
of the conquered clans. Thus he made the peasants
love him. The rich hated him — but they

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.099
didn’t matter anymore, because they were
no longer rich.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.079
With these two building block policies, Temüjin
was able to win the loyalty of more and more

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.409
people and in 1206 he was declared the Great
Khan, the leader of all the Mongols. How?

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.019
Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a
really cool way. A prospective ruler would

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.569
call a general council called a kurultai,
and anyone who supported his candidacy for

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.650
leadership would show up on their horses,
literally voting with their feet.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.290
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green! But horses
don’t have feet they have hooves.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.079
I hate you, Me From the Past. Also, NO INTERRUPTING
THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.419
After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went
on to conquer a lot of territory. By the time

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:07.579
he died in his sleep in 1227, his empire stretched
from the Mongol homeland in Mongolia all the

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.510
way to the Caspian Sea. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.370
So that’s a pretty good looking empire,
and sure a lot of it was pasture or mountains

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.230
or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot
of people, too. And in some ways with Genghis’

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.620
death, the empire was just getting started.
His son Ögedei Khan expanded the empire even

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.400
more. And Genghis’ grandson Möngke was
the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capitol

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.610
of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols.
And another of Genghis’ grandsons, Kublai

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.980
Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty in China
in 1279. And if the Mamluks hadn’t stopped

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.960
another of Genghis’ grandsons at the battle
of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.200
all of North Africa. Genghis Khan sure had
a lot of grandkids… It must be time for the open letter.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.480
An Open Letter To Genghis Khan’s Descendants.
But first, let’s check what’s in the secret

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.080
compartment today. Oh. A noisemaker and champagne
poppers? Stan, you know I suck at these. What's

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.120
all this for? Ohhh, it’s because it’s a BIRTHDAY PARTY!!
YAY. Happy birthday to Genghis Khan’s descendants.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.320
How do I know it’s your birthday, Genghis
Khan’s descendants? Because every day is

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.130
your birthday. Because right now on the planet
Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.910
of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is
the birthday of 43,000 of them. So, good news,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.730
Genghis Khan: Your empire might be gone, but
your progeny lives on. And on, and on, and

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.560
on. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.960
Best wishes, John Green

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.920
Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys
weren’t always working together, because

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.300
Genghis Khan failed to create a single political
unit out of his conquests. Instead, after

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.300
Genghis’ death, the Mongols were left with
four really important Empires called Khanates:

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.970
The Yuan Dynasty in China, the Il-Khanate
in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.500
Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde
in Russia.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.720
If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic
period, this is similar to what happened to

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.240
another good general who wasn’t much for
administration, Alexander the Great. Also,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.270
neither of them ever conquered India.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.940
The Mongols succeeded primarily because of
their military skill. Genghis Khan’s army,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.840
which never numbered more than 130,000 was
built on speed and archery. Just like this

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.650
guy. Mongol mounted archers were like super
fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.010
and knights they were up against.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.190
But wait, all the military history nerds are
saying, once people knew that the Mongols

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.210
were coming, why didn’t they just hole up
in castles and forts? It’s not like the

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.080
Mongols had flying horses. EXCEPT THEY DID. They
didn’t? Stan, why are you always making history boring?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.710
So the Mongols apparently didn’t have flying
horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.340
So even though they’d never seen a castle
before they started raiding, they became experts

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.520
at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners.
And they also adopted gunpowder, probably

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.330
introducing it to Europeans, and they even
built ships so they could attack Japan. That

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.460
might have worked, too except there happened
to be a typhoon.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.450
Also, people were terrified of the Mongols.
Often cities would surrender the moment the

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.220
Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter.
But of course, that only happened because

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.240
there were occasions when the Mongols, did,
you know, slaughter entire towns.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.350
So with all that background, let us return
to the question of Mongol awesomeness. First,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.000
five arguments for awesome.
1. The Mongols really did reinvigorate cross-Eurasian

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.840
trade. The Silk Road trading routes that had
existed for about 1000 years by the time the

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.210
Mongols made the scene had fallen into disuse,
but the Mongols valued trade because they

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.520
could tax it, and they did a great job of
keeping their empire safe. It was said that

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.420
a man could walk from one end of the Mongol
empire to the other with a gold plate on his

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.690
head without ever fearing being robbed.
2. The Mongols increased communication throughout

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.190
Eurasia by developing this pony express-like
system of way stations with horses and riders

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.960
that could quickly relay information. It was
called the yam system and also included these

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.990
amazing bronze passports, which facilitated
travel.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.860
3. Another thing that travelled along the
Mongol trade routes was cuisine. For example,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.850
it was because of the Mongols that rice became
a staple of the Persian diet. Which I mention

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.090
entirely because I happen to like Persian
food.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.020
4. The Mongols forcibly relocated people who
were useful to them, like artists and musicians

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.500
and, especially administrators. As you can
imagine, the Mongols weren't much for administrative

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.730
tasks like keeping records, so they found
people were good at that stuff and just moved

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.870
them around the empire. This created the kind
of cross-cultural pollination that world historians

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.460
these days get really excited about.
And 5. The Mongols were almost unprecedentedly

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.770
tolerant of different religions. They themselves
were shamanists, believing in nature spirits,

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.980
but since their religion was tied to the land
from which they came, they didn’t expect

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.000
new people to adopt it and they didn’t ask
them to. So you could find Muslims and Buddhists

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.820
and Christians and people of any other religion
you can think of prospering throughout the

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.700
Mongol empire. And it’s that kind of openness
that has led some historians to go back and

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.230
re-evaluate the Mongols, seeing them as kind
of a precursor to modernity.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.900
But there’s another side to the story that
we should not forget, so, here are five reasons

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.310
why the Mongols might not be so great.
1. Here is Genghis Khan’s definition of

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:42.710
happiness: “The greatest happiness is to
vanquish your enemies, to chase them before

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:48.000
you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those
dear to them bathed in tears, to clasp to

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.900
your bosom their wives and daughters." Off-topic,
but if that quote rings a bell, it might be

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.420
because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized
Genghis Khan in the movie Conan the Barbarian.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.960
2. Is an extension of one. The Mongols were
seriously brutal conquerors. I mean, not uniquely

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.310
brutal, but still: the Mongols destroyed entire
cities, and most historians estimate the numbers

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.670
they killed to be in the millions.
3. Their empire didn’t last. Within 80 years

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.620
they’d left China and been replaced by a
new dynasty, the Ming. And in Persia they

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.410
blended in so completely that by the 15th
century they were totally unrecognizable.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.390
I mean, they’d even taken up agriculture!
Agriculture, the last refuge for scoundrels

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.100
who want to devote their lives to working
instead of skoodilypooping.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.480
4. They also weren’t particularly interested
in artistic patronage or architecture. I mean,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.840
your palace may last forever, but my yurt
can go anywhere.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.020
5. The Mongols were probably responsible for
the Black Death. By opening up trade they

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.130
also opened up vectors for disease to travel,
in the case of the Plague via fleas infected

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.740
with Yersinia pestis. And at least according
to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.340
the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden
cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.080
While this primitive act of biological warfare
might have happened, it’s unlikely to be

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.450
what actually spread the plague. More likely
it was the fleas on the rats in the holds

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.610
of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe. But
that trade only existed because of the Mongols.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:08.900
All right Stan, one last time- cue the Mongol-tage.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.310
So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity,
and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.940
and senseless destruction. And what you think
about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.440
you: Do you value artistic output over religious
diversity? Is imperialism that doesn’t last

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.620
better or worse than imperialism that does?
And are certain kinds of warfare inherently

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.520
wrong? If you think those are easy questions
to answer, than I haven’t been doing my job.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.160
Regardless, I look forward to reading your answers in
comments. Thanks for watching and I’ll see you

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.660
