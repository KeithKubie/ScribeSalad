1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,150
[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,320
we've gone through the basics of
morphemes and covered a few word classes.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,620
Now we move on to a part of
speech known as the adjective.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,340
You're probably aware that
adjectives describe nouns,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,690
but you might not have considered
their function from a morphological

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:25,470
perspective.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,340
Sometimes they work more like nouns
and sometimes they're more like verbs.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,370
Let's start with some examples.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,530
In ancient Greek adjectives declined
exactly like nouns do. In fact,

10
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:41,370
they routinely take the same
endings for number, gender and case.

11
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,820
Since that's true, we
can see examples like

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,550
[inaudible] the just person or the
fair person versus [inaudible],

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,760
which would mean the just
woman or the fair woman.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,680
And in that case we have an opposition
between decos which is masculine,

15
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:03,270
singular and nominative as well.
And [inaudible], which is feminine,

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,530
singular and nominated.

17
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,450
In both situations we have an
adjective describing a noun,

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,400
but they're working like a
now declining like a noun.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,260
Now I'll draw a counter example
from Japanese. In Japanese,

20
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,650
many adjectives work a lot
more like verbs. In fact,

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,770
they're specifically what we
would call state of verbs,

22
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,220
which are verbs that indicate
a state instead of an action.

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,730
So a description like is happy
or is hot would indicate a state,

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,750
for example, a to means
is hot in Japanese.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,280
Those can act as true
adjectives in front of a now.

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
Or they can instead take the place of a
verb in languages that treat adjectives

27
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,490
more like nouns. Don't be surprised
to find them used as a noun.

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,760
Take the ancient Greek example
I gave you just a moment ago.

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,430
I can instead say [inaudible],

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,460
which means literally the just or the
fare in English that would translate to

31
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:05,010
the just one or the fair
one. And in that case,

32
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:09,900
we have decos working exactly like what
we would expect the noun to work like in

33
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:12,750
Greek. On the other hand, in Japanese,

34
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,040
the words I used in those sentences
work exactly as we would expect,

35
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,640
a verb to work and they're
conjugated like a Japanese Ferb.

36
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,630
There's a good deal more to be said
for adjectives beyond these basics,

37
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:27,810
but it's worth reviewing the lessons
on nouns and verbs to dig into their

38
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:32,490
properties and come around next time when
we meet the very versatile grammatical

39
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
particle

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:39,330
[inaudible].
