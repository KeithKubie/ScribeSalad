00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.577
To me, developing games

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.875
Is like breathing

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:08.471
The sun, the air, water, and games

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:10.666
The hunger I had when I was young, wanting to accomplish something

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.715
It’s a strong desire like breathing and life instincts

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.648
Developing games on my own sounds quite lonely

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.991
But that’s not true at all

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.662
Developing a game by myself allows me to

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.622
Work together with international composers or voice talents

00:00:24.622 --> 00:00:28.604
Then we can showcase our product to players from all over the world

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:30.524
Like the previous game I developed, which was

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:33.306
Installed 5 million times on Google Play

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.493
And received 16,000 reviews

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.848
I love electronic music

00:00:37.848 --> 00:00:39.635
And some geometric styles

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.520
After adding some mathematics and physics into the mix

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.484
Like “Magnetized”, for example

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:46.800
It has that retro style plus a bit of triptunes

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.502
Then you have “Beat Stomper”, which is a modern EDM

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:53.893
“Push &amp; Pop” is like returning to the 80s electronic music

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:56.462
With the addition of a 2.5D visual style

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:59.715
Even though all three titles might sound similar to each other

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:02.204
But actually, this is what’s most fun about developing games

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:03.902
You need to use limited resources

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:05.786
To explore unlimited possibilities

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:10.124
When I was young, my younger brother and I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.875
Loved to go play all types of arcade games on the streets

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.426
My favorite type of game was the spaceship shooting game

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.444
We’ve been searching for this type of exciting shooting games for a long time

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.426
Eventually, my two brothers and I decided to develop a game on our own

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:23.715
This is also why our workshop is called “Uwan”

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:26.026
At the beginning, I developed games by using the JAVA programming language

00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:28.293
At that time, there were no global platforms available

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:30.133
So I was only able to market my games domestically

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.493
Later on, we launched our very first mobile game

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.693
“Lightning Fighter 2”

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.280
The game was downloaded over a million times after launch

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.995
And through Google Play’s Store listing experiments

00:01:40.995 --> 00:01:45.413
The installation rate for “Lightning Fighter 2” was increased to 91% in Indonesia

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:46.542
Aside from “Lightning Fighter 2”

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:50.195
We also designed a strategic shooter called “Lightning Rangers”

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.786
A game like “Lightning Rangers” requires more server-related technologies

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:57.813
So we decided to use Google Cloud, which was a huge help in terms of game development

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:01.537
We also used Google Play Alpha Beta test features

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:05.884
To help us obtain numerical feedback from players before the product is launched

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.902
As well as to enhance the quality of our game

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.622
Actually, game development is to touch every player’s heart through hope

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.542
It is our biggest goal

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.742
The idea behind OPUS comes from exploration and stories

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:20.364
Every Saturday night, we hope players can

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:23.937
Experience the touching stories by exploring our games

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:27.697
It’s like having the experience of reading a great novel

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:31.528
With a back-end service such as the Google Game Services

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.715
We can update our games more quickly

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.275
In order to present the best parts of our games to everyone

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:40.604
Therefore, in terms of ARPU and conversion rate, our OPUS Earth Project

00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:44.684
Have increased by more than 200% in a very short amount of time

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:48.240
To someone like me, who is an independent game developer

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.324
It is a huge help
