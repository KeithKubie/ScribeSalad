00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.870
[music]

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.990
&gt;&gt; I can't really remember the last time I
had a chance to go into the backyard and just

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.290
run around.
&gt;&gt; School's just so much pressure that every

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.390
day I'd wake up dreading it..
&gt;&gt; I'm afraid that our children are going

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.699
to sue us for stealing their childhoods.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.210
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.600
&gt;&gt; I would spend six hours a night on my homework.
&gt;&gt; You have to get into the top schools.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.141
&gt;&gt; You have to take tests and do interviews.
&gt;&gt; It's gone way to the extreme.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:45.829
&gt;&gt; We're all caught up in it.
&gt;&gt; In America, if you don't earn a lot of

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.010
money, something went wrong.
&gt;&gt; The pressure comes from the colleges, from

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.020
the parents, from the government, but it has
to stop.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.130
&gt;&gt; You have to do well now so you can get
into a good college

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.820
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; Everyone expects us to be superheroes.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.730
&gt;&gt; You have a fear from the parents that my
kid needs to be able to get a job.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.110
&gt;&gt; How do you expect us to do well when you
can't even make mistakes?

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.540
&gt;&gt; You're dedicating your whole life to your
grades.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.770
&gt;&gt; You have to be smart, and you have to be
involved in the arts.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.860
&gt;&gt; I have soccer practice every day, plus
the homework on top of that.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.670
&gt;&gt; Produce, produce, produce.
&gt;&gt; It's impossible.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.610
&gt;&gt; I couldn't cope.
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.470
&gt;&gt; I've gone through bouts of depression just
because you feel so swamped.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.270
&gt;&gt; I almost, like, had emotional breakdown.
&gt;&gt; There have been six suicides in our school

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.270
district.
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.500
&gt;&gt; Our students are pressured to perform.
They're not necessarily pressured to learn

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.700
deeply and conceptually.
&gt;&gt; So what is that gonna mean when we have

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.210
a whole population of dentists and doctors
who've been trained from the script?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.820
&gt;&gt; Things that actually get our students to
think are pushed aside.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.100
&gt;&gt; These kids come to the table with this
creativity, and this love of learning. Let's

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.119
just not take it out of them
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.940
&gt;&gt; I think the United States really needs
to re-think how we do schooling. The economic

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.550
future of the country depends on our addressing
this.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.160
&gt;&gt; We need to re-define success for kids.
It's gotta be something we do together, all

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.240
of us as a society, almost as a movement.
&gt;&gt; Jobs need you to be a critical thinker.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.489
They need you to be a problem solver.
&gt;&gt; We need to really think, what does it take

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:29.780
to produce a happy, motivated, creative human
being?

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.590
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; [quiet]

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.180
&gt;&gt; [clapping]
Host: So I have grown children but they went

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.489
through the Palo Alto school system and I
certainly sympathize and identify with a lot

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.210
of this. We're fortunate enough today to have
the director of the film, Vicki Abeles with

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.006
us, who will I think be prepared to answer
questions that you might have on the content

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:06.079
of the film.
Vicki: I'm interested in getting your reactions,

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.299
anything that resonated with you, and then
I guess first thing we should just introduce

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.829
Jacqueline, who you saw briefly in the film,
and my daughter, Jamie, who looks a little

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:24.090
different than a couple years ago. It's amazing
how time flies. So comments, parents who any

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.029
of this resonated with, or as employers here
things that you're seeing in the workplace.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:35.209
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And use the mic. That's all I'm hear
to say.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.279
&gt;&gt; [laughing]
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm just gonna say that I went to

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:45.019
the Monta Vista High School that showed up
frequently in the movie and watching that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.650
was sort of like watching a snapshot of my
very unhappy, very terrible childhood from

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:01.060
about when I moved into the Alamo area in
second grade until I left. And I would say

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.540
that partially that has to do with the really
toxic social microcosm that exists in the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.340
very rich, very obnoxious East Bay, but a
lot of it has to do with a lot of the school

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.549
issues that were brought up in there and I,
I remember -- you know, like, I remember having

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.680
feelings about if I forgot -- the first week
of ninth grade, I forgot to do a piece of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.389
homework 'cause I wasn't used to having homework
over the weekend and I felt like I was a complete

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.560
failure and I went into the bathroom and cried
for like 15 minutes over a really stupid piece

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.581
of homework that really didn't teach me anything
and had no bearing on anything. But, I mean,

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:49.919
I still remember it. It was a traumatic event
and it, it, it still makes me feel stupid

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.449
in some ways that that was something that
was so frustrating to me. But yeah. I, I feel

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.690
like I could have been that girl that the
movie was dedicated to in a lot of ways because

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:08.310
I went through at least half of middle school
and all of high school with untreated clinical

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.430
depression because I didn't want to admit
that anything was wrong to anyone and it took

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.050
a complete mental breakdown of way too much
pressure during my first year at Stanford

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.280
because I didn't know how to manage real work,
I only knew how to manage busywork, and actually

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.550
having to produce anything of value was just
 -- I couldn't handle it. I couldn't handle

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.590
actually being around all these really capable,
really smart people. And life's been a lot

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.539
better since I got some treatment so I really
wish that we would message to young people

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.210
that if they're really experiencing these
feelings, they should get help.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.900
Vicki: Thank you for that.
&gt;&gt; That was really long. Sorry.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.360
Vicki: No. That was great and I think -- I
really appreciate that you were courageous

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.860
enough to share that this still impacts you,
even as adults, because I think that is what

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.889
we're seeing and it's why it's so important
that as adults, we start to safeguard the

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.169
health of our children and realize that these
kids are still growing and developing their

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.810
minds and their bodies, and it is a long time
to put the pressures that we're seeing, both

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.050
from our culture, as you correctly point out,
and from our education system. The one size

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.520
fits all approach is not working for so many
kids and so I would just encourage everybody

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.770
to be advocates for that, and a lot of the
depression and the what I call unintended

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.810
consequences that you saw in this film really
go unnoticed for a long time because kids

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.340
are very good at looking good and saying everything
is okay.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.759
&gt;&gt; So I have all kinds of things to say, but
I'll limit it to two. First is I think you

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:52.680
went -- you didn't quite go far enough in
actually encouraging kids to individually

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.650
act against -- if that's the word you wanna
use -- the teachers and the principals, and

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:06.430
the systems themselves -- including at the
extreme end, there's a beautiful book by a

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.430
woman named Grace Llewellyn, who you may have
heard of, somebody may have mentioned to you,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:21.189
on basically encouraging teenagers to drop
out of school and home school themselves.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:31.240
But, on a much more simplistic note, skip
class every once in a while. Just take a day

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.599
off and read a book that you're interested
in. I mean, these are the things that I did

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:46.150
all through high school and it -- most people
my age -- I'm class of '93 high school so,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:53.629
35, 40 -- most of the educated people had
those experiences. They just ignored class

00:07:53.629 --> 00:08:00.300
for a long weekend or took a trip and I don't
see that happening nearly as much anymore

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.749
and I think that parents should go ahead and
encourage that. And I also think that at,

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:13.919
at Google and at some of these places that
are set out to be sort of the ultimate destination,

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:21.550
I think it would help if we were to make a
point of that and if Stanford were to make

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:30.490
a point of that, and if whatever these things
are that parents and kids have in their brain

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:43.169
as their, the goal of all of this could somehow
explain that there's quite a few people in

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:52.279
this room and at this company who were not
straight A students and did not at least initially

00:08:52.279 --> 00:09:01.010
go to a Stanford or a Berkeley, or a Harvard,
and that people's paths are very meandering

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.800
and that should be encouraged.
Vicki: I absolutely agree with you. Let me

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.090
just ask you a question because I'm a little
bit older than you and so I agree, looking

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:14.390
back at my education what things were like
and we had a lot more freedom and time to

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.430
do things like just process what was going
on and have jobs outside of school. But I'm

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:25.760
curious with your new hires coming in to Google,
is it true that you are taking young people

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.440
who don't necessarily go to the name brand
schools and have the top GPAs and so forth?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.680
Because I know that a lot of Silicon Valley
has gotten that reputation that is actually

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.360
fueling some of what we are seeing. And I
just wanna say also that part of our message

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.630
is that we don't wanna blame one another and
I think parents are doing their best job they

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:50.059
can, educators are within a culture that expects
so much of our young people and as a parent

00:09:50.059 --> 00:09:55.450
I think no one wants to shortchange the opportunities
their kids may have down the road. So I just

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.630
wanna ask you that, and then I was gonna ask
Jacqueline to address the first part of your

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.750
response.
&gt;&gt; We have a lot of that information. I don't

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.490
 -- I haven't looked at it recently but -- I
mean, obviously there's going to be quite

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:17.449
a few people who are the mold as you'd wanna
say, but there's also quite a few people that

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:22.781
come very in nontraditional routes to what
they're doing and I think those are the people

00:10:22.781 --> 00:10:30.100
that kind of make life interesting here, and
I think that we should let that information

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.760
get out a little bit better.
Vicki: Right. We wanna encourage different

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.620
pathways. Absolutely. Thank you. I was just
gonna ask Jacqueline to address one of the

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.920
things we are doing as we go around the country
speaking to young people is we are creating

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.110
a way for them to add their voice, and we
are encouraging schools to include them – their

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.180
voice -- give them a lot more choice around
their education but I want Jacqueline just

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.130
to address why aren't students opting to cut
classes or to self-home school, as you raised.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.700
Jacqueline: You make a very, very valid point.
A lot of students during high school, middle

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.579
school, whatever it may be, would love to
skip class, would love to take a day off;

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:09.300
but in doing that, it takes a lot of preparation.
You don't just get to take that day off. You

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.190
have to contact your teachers, all seven,
eight of them, however many classes you're

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.190
taking and say, "I'm sick today. What am I
missing? What can I make up for tomorrow?

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:23.070
What's the homework from yesterday and today?"
And so on your day off you basically spend

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.020
the entire day doing what you would have done
at school and it just seems so much easier

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.019
to have just gone to school. I mean, taking
a day off and not having to do anything but

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:35.870
sit down and read that favorite book -- you
may be too tired of reading from school your

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.100
textbooks and whatever it may be that you
don't even wanna look at anything with words

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:46.649
on it anymore because you're so sick of reading
all of the time. You wanna sit down and look

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:51.870
at the birds outside or something else. You
wanna do something that's not what you're

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:58.370
stuck doing seven days a week, 365 days a
year. Because really, as a student in high

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.110
school especially, especially in the East
Bay, especially in these more competitive

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:10.510
areas, you don't necessarily get breaks off.
Whereas for work, you may get vacation where

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.770
you don't bring your work with you. But in
school, whether it's over Thanksgiving break,

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:20.171
you have a Thanksgiving break project, Christmas
break project. You have summer homework for

00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:25.329
AP classes before you even take them. You
never really have a full break and I didn't

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:30.000
even experience really a break until I got
to college and I had a break between semesters

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.639
where I didn't have any classes to prepare
for or anything. You don't have summer homework

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:39.830
before your classes in college like you do
with your AP classes. So yes, it would be

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.649
amazing to have those days off and just say,
"I'm just gonna cut class today and not go,"

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:49.750
but then in the back of your head that you
have all of that to make up and your teacher

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:57.730
is going -- you don't necessarily, you don't
have the freedom and liberty to do that because

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.780
you are -- if you do that, you're not necessarily
the best student anymore and you don't fit

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.290
that mold.
Vicki: Right. I think there's a lot of pressure

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:11.149
on girls to be perfect and then we do see,
I think, as you saw in the film with Sam and

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:15.100
Isaiah, that many of the boys -- and I don't
wanna generalize -- end up throwing up their

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.759
hands and checking out. So I think there's
just a lot of different coping strategies.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:25.300
I don't wanna speak for Jamie except to say
that when she did start to get sick and needed

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:30.779
to stay home from school, she got so far behind
from a few days off in seventh grade that

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:35.720
it became impossible to catch up and that's
a real shame. I think that we need to reflect

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.459
on our own lives as adults. We go home, we
can choose to do work after work or not, and

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:46.779
I think we're not giving our young people
a choice in the matter and we need to encourage

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:53.230
them to sleep, and to have balanced lives.
So thank you, Jacqueline. Yes?

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:59.269
&gt;&gt; My gut tells me that you have identified
a serious and increasingly prevalent problem,

00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:04.860
or set of problems, but, and, I'm gonna be
a little devil's advocate-y and I apologize.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:12.220
If you set out to make a movie about troubled
kids, you're never gonna have a problem finding

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.329
troubled kids to tell a story about. What
I'm wondering is, is it the case that this

00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:27.940
really is a large ongoing problem quantitatively,
or, or are really a lot of kids doing okay

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.470
and we just have to do something else for
the handful of kids who aren't okay?

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.060
Vicki: Thank you for asking that. That's a
very good point so let me just say I didn't

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.750
set out to make a film about troubled kids.
I set out to make a film about the state of

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:47.259
childhood and education in this country and
what we found is that the hardest part of

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:51.490
producing this film was deciding on which
stories to feature because we didn't find

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:57.020
any young people who the system was working
for, even as Bill and I spoke about outside

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.180
that even for the handful of kids that look
like they can do what Jacqueline was doing,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.019
they're still paying a price and I will say
that they're paying a price in terms of lost

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:14.100
sleep, health consequences now or in the future,
a very narrow mindset that we're losing opportunities

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.991
to develop innovative, creative thinkers,
and you heard so many experts in this film.

00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:24.000
These experts have been talking about these
issues for 20 years. I think what's new about

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.100
this film is we're connecting the dots. We're
connecting some of the leading thinkers in

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.459
education, in child development, in medicine,
and then importantly giving the students and

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:37.600
the teachers a voice and I think they're often
the last to be heard from in conversations

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.860
around education. So I would say that I think
that we have an epidemic here and as we go

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.680
and screen around the country, far beyond
the East Bay, even in the most unlikely places,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.000
small towns. We're hearing that these issues
are impacting every community and people are

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.060
feeling alone, and they're really wanting
to come together as adults in the community

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.320
and to protect their kids and figure out a
new way forward. And so that's one of the

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.889
reasons, actually, that we haven't released
the DVD amongst others, but we are very focused

00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:14.241
on bringing people together to talk about
these issues and form alliances with one another

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.540
and become advocates for change and I think
that we are stealing our kids' childhood and

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:25.329
we're also risking their future by continuing
down this very narrow path that really isn't

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:29.750
working for many kids, even the kids that
on the outside seem that it's working for.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.870
I would say there's still a price that they're
paying and that we're paying as a society.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:40.520
&gt;&gt; To just sort of address your comment, I
guess I would be called one of those kids

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.970
it wasn't working for. In high school -- I'm
sorry. I'm getting a little choked up. In

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:51.259
high school I pretty much got straight As
and high school wasn't that hard for me. But

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:56.630
my brother came behind me, three years after
me. And it was much harder for him because

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:03.070
it was just all these expectations of, "You're
gonna be just like your sister" and my brother

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:08.010
and I aren't the same person. He was much
better in sports. He was smart, just school

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:14.440
wasn't his focus. And, for me, I was a perfectionist.
High school wasn't the issue for me. It was

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.679
when I went to college -- I went to Stanford,
as my shirt says -- and I got my first C on

00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:28.260
just a test. It wasn't even a class. It wasn't
anything major. It was a test, and I lost

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:34.690
it. I called my mom in tears. I was devastated.
I had to get counseling. That, for me, is

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:39.830
when it became really, really hard because
in high school I never really failed, and

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.170
so when I came to college it was suddenly
like I'm failing and it seems like no one

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:50.590
else is. And I never really had the time I
think to actually be able to fail. So I mean,

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.590
maybe for a while, it looks like you're fine,
it looks like you're working, but eventually

00:17:54.590 --> 00:18:01.390
it does catch up to you and I wouldn't call,
call myself troubled but -- sorry but just

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:05.780
I wouldn't -- but, eventually, there is a
price to pay.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.780
Vicki: Right. And we want young people who
are willing to take risks, right? That's where

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.580
where all the great thinking comes from in
this country, all the innovation and creativity.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:20.030
It comes from taking risks and failing a whole
bunch of times and so we wanna raise young

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:27.309
people who are resilient and who aren't devastated
by a C in college, or an F in high school,

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:36.840
or by a poor review in the workplace.
&gt;&gt; Hi. This film resonated with me on a lot

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.919
of levels. I totally kind of had the same
experience in my own high school and college

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:48.400
experience but the part that really hit home
with me was from the teaching side of it.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:55.450
I just taught for two years in New Orleans
in a very low-performing school in a very

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:02.570
low income community. And what really resonates
with me is when you started going to No Child

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.590
Left Behind in the film and then going to
changing the ideologies for education because

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:13.460
what I found -- I taught first grade and I
was expected by my school, by my principal

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.770
and my school district at the first grade
level – 6 or 7 years old -- from the first

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.380
week of school, I was giving five tests a
week, paper tests, multiple choice, spelling,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:32.200
phonics, math, whatever, and giving them number
grades, not just satisfactory, unsatisfactory,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:42.570
but a 93 A, or a, a 60 F to six-year-olds.
And the reasoning behind it, because I questioned

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.120
it a lot because I just couldn't really wrap
my head around that because I think first

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.049
grade should be -- or the lower elementary
grades should be project-based, learning working

00:19:52.049 --> 00:19:57.640
in groups and creative, and I wasn't really
allowed -- I had very strict limitations on

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:03.800
doing that. The reasoning was always, "Well,
in third grade they're gonna start the iLEAP,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.150
which is the standardized test in Louisiana,
and in fourth grade is the LEAP, and LEAP

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.260
is high stakes. You don't go to fifth grade
if you don't pass the LEAP. So we need to

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:18.150
start them in kindergarten and first grade
taking paper standardized tests." So I have

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:24.159
obviously my own issues with No Child Left
Behind and I think just this push to place

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:26.710
so much emphasis on these tests is really
 --

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.960
Vicki: And I'm just curious, what impact did
you see on the young people? Because I mean

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.590
we are every year it seems testing these kids
at a younger age.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Vicki: And we are putting tremendous pressure

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:41.610
on them and taking things that smack of fun
outside of school and outside of their daily

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.490
lives.
&gt;&gt; Well, and the way that my experience is

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.330
very different from a lot of what was seen
in this film is that my schools -- my whole

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.900
school district was very low performing. As
you all know, Louisiana's now one of the lowest

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:01.450
states and my district was one of the lowest
districts in the state. So the kids, it really

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:07.400
 -- with them instead of pushing them to go
above and beyond with a lot of them, they

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.179
get so frustrated 'cause they are below level
a lot of the times and they can't, they can't

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:18.190
even wrap their head around it and these standardized
tests are just -- it's too much for them.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:23.840
So all our school talks about all year from
the second the kids walk into the school is

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.580
they say -- they teach the test. They say,
"Tthis is what you need to know." It's all

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.020
test, test, test. It's all the kids think
about. It's all this pressure on them and

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.040
most of them don't pass it. Very few -- I
mean, we -- when the LEAP scores come out

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.090
it's like at the end of May. It's like the
biggest day of the year and, I mean, there

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:44.350
were some small improvements in my school
but really when you look at the percentage

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.480
of kids that are actually passing, it's clearly
not working.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.940
Vicki: Right. And it's not working in the
long term and that's why we're seeing so many

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.000
young people who are dropping out of school
because after so many years of being told

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.791
you're a failure, you're not measuring up,
I think they give up on going to school and

00:21:58.791 --> 00:22:04.090
we need to make school relevant for all of
our kids, engaging. I think kids have a tremendous

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:08.630
amount inherently of intrinsic motivation
and our system is taking it out of all of

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.999
them, both inner city as well as suburban.
So ...

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:18.809
&gt;&gt; I come from a different time and a different
place but I could still connect to some of

00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:26.990
the issues that you show. So -- many Googlers
come from different countries and I'm sure

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.640
they'll say the schools elsewhere are also
stressful. It's stressful to be a kid, stressful

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.799
to be a teenager everywhere. What seems to
be different I think is the difference in

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:48.010
cultures, is the overall obsession with following
law and following rules is I think way too

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:54.870
much in the United States. And I think we
have to limit the law enforcement in the school

00:22:54.870 --> 00:23:03.360
and we should stop slapping kids for misbehavior,
slapping them for being late, this and that.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:11.950
I stopped doing my homework in eighth grade,
just flat out not doing it anymore and I thought,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:18.500
there will be a huge fallout but teachers
quietly let me do that without telling anyone

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:25.450
else because I was all right elsewhere, on
other academic achievements. And it did okay

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:33.299
at the end of the day. I think schools have
to be softer on the kids and don't let them

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:38.360
be or feel in a very strict confines.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.850
Vicki: Do you have anything to say?

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:47.169
Jacqueline: Yeah. I completely agree with
you on a couple of those issues. I think that

00:23:47.169 --> 00:23:52.159
it's important for -- every child, every student
learns at a different pace. I mean, there

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:59.170
shouldn't be set rules for them to say whether
their best may not be the best of the best

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.490
of the school and they should do what they
can to do their best, and they should find

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:10.460
a way to show that, whether that's through
whatever their passion or possibilities are,

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:17.740
whether they're artistic or really good at
math, or whatever it may be. But the way that

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:27.860
the schools and the way that our society forms
the ideas of what is excellent for students

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:33.470
is not perfect for every student. I mean,
you need to be able to show what you can do

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:39.370
in a different way and so if, if you're passionate
about one subject, and you don't need to do

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.950
the homework in that subject, and you wanna
have more time to learn about it on your own,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.600
then that should be the way that you should
learn about it rather than learning what's

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.070
gonna be on the test, studying, memorizing,
taking the test, forgetting it, and then moving

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.780
onto the next chapter because that's not -- that
takes away the love of learning. It's just

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.919
memorizing at that point.
Vicki: And I think what you're also saying

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:05.799
is to get rid of this whole carrot and stick
approach that we have on our schools which

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:11.510
only encourages compliance and if we're looking
to -- again, I keep going back to this. If

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.720
we wanna raise a generation of innovative,
creative problem solvers, we need to move

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.660
away from a one-size-fits-all approach that
is really just encouraging compliance. And

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.409
I would also say on the issue of homework
whether -- if you, as a parent, sit with their

00:25:26.409 --> 00:25:30.870
child and do it at night, we need to start
looking at how the time is being spent during

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.510
the school day and then remember that our
kids are already putting in seven or eight

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.789
hours during the day and they should be able
to come home -- there are lots of learning

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:43.169
opportunities that happen outside of school,
whether it's reading a book, playing in the

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:47.419
backyard, or having dinner with your family,
and getting a good night's sleep. And that

00:25:47.419 --> 00:25:52.169
holds true even for teenagers. They've done
some great studies at various universities

00:25:52.169 --> 00:25:56.690
and I wanna say it's a very small percentage,
probably under 3 percent of our adolescents,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.680
who are getting the nine and a half hours
of sleep a night that they're supposed to

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.850
be getting and that's contributing to all
kinds of health consequences as well as disengagement

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.080
with learning. Do you have something else?
&gt;&gt; I actually agree with Jacqueline where

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:17.640
the students have to be -- they should have
an opportunity to fail early and just say,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.809
"Ah, not gonna work for me." Because there's
nothing like a doctor who was dealing with

00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:29.120
the carrot and stick through the medical school
and then he sees you every morning and says,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.190
"Ah, another sick guy." I mean, he doesn't
want to do that. The only thing is it is for

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:40.159
him is the money. This is not kind of a doctor
I'd like to see.

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:45.280
Jacqueline: That's very true. I mean, we're
looking at the society nowadays that learns

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.559
from what's gonna be on the test can so when
doctors are performing surgeries, discovering

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:57.490
new treatments for different things and they
find something that's not out of textbook,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.929
they don't know what to do and, I mean, that's
not only in the medical field; it's in all

00:27:01.929 --> 00:27:07.850
other fields. I mean, we need to learn how
to fail and we need to learn how to pick ourselves

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.210
back up. Without doing that, we can't move
forward and be innovative.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:16.280
&gt;&gt;Host: Well, before moving on, I wanna wish
one of our guests the best of luck starting

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:22.430
high school next week. So I hope that goes
well. Do you have some words about that, some

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:23.510
thoughts?
Jamie: Umm ...

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:31.000
&gt;&gt;Host: Having been involved in this film?
Jamie: Nothing really with the film. I'm excited

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.110
I guess but I'm not really that nervous.
&gt;&gt; Host: Good. That's good. Well, on that

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.710
note, we wanna thank you very much for coming.
Vicki: Thank you for having us and I just

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:47.740
wanna ask all of you to spread the word. Join
us on Facebook, Tweet about us. We are really

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.980
relying -- aside from the great film that
you saw here tonight, which was a great team

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.309
effort, and also couldn't have been done without
the courage of young people like Jacqueline

00:27:56.309 --> 00:28:01.890
and Jamie -- we are relying on a grass roots
effort to get this film out nationwide as

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.010
well as globally and we probably have requests
right now from 25 different countries. So

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.880
this is, in my opinion, more of a cultural
issue than an education system issue and if

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.929
we can shift the mindset and the philosophy
of what makes for a good childhood, what kind

00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:23.590
of people are we hoping to grow during those
years -- birth through late adolescence -- I

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:27.580
think that we can really make a big impact;
and I think it's going to take all of us talking

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.600
to one another, talking to the educators,
talking to our employers, and including all

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.870
of the stake holders in this conversation.
So please join us on Facebook, on our web

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:42.820
site if you have any thoughts, feel free to
give us a call. Thank you so much for giving

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.639
up your afternoon to be here.

00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:45.110
