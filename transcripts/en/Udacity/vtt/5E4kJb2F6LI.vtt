00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.469
Now that you have all this installed
your instance is ready to be used as

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.390
a node in the hoodoo cluster.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.480
You can easily save it and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.300
launch multiple copies by
creating an amazon machine image.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.820
Usually just called image.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.610
When you use this image to launch
an instance it will already have

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.360
all the software installed.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.610
&gt;From the dashboard go
to the instances list.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.720
Select the instance, then actions,
image, create image.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
Give it a name something like
a dupe node then save it.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.800
Click AMI in the sidebar.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.840
After a few minutes you should
see the image raster here.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.410
If you come back to start up another
cluster you can launch this image and

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.279
you'll have nodes with Java
hoodoo already installed.

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.249
