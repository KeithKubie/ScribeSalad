00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.140
Now, we're going to use a simple
reduction to show that this language B,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
consisting of the descriptions of
Turing machines that accept something

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.280
is undecidable.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.630
Our strategy is to reduce
the diagonal language to it.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.600
In other words,
we'll argue that deciding B

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.050
is at least as hard as deciding
the diagonal language.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.110
Since we can't decide the diagonal
language, we can't decide B either.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.530
Here's one of many possible reductions.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.309
The reduction is a computable function
whose input is the description of

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.649
a Turing machine M.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.760
And it's going to build another
machine N in this python-like syntax.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.940
First, we write down
the description of a Turing machine

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.320
by defining this nested function.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170
Then, we return that function.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.580
An important point is
that the reduction,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.690
R, never actually runs the machine N.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.890
It just writes the program for it.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.770
Note here, that in this example,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.170
N totally ignores the actual
input given to it.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.410
It just runs M on it's own description.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.150
And does whatever that computation does.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.710
Hence, and it's either going to be
a machine that accepts nothing,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.240
if M doesn't accept its own description,
either by looping or rejecting.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.060
Or if M does accept its own description,
then N is going to accept everything.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.210
In the one case,
the language of N will be the empty set.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.370
And in the other case,
it will be sigma star.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.880
A decider for this language B, would
be able to tell the difference, and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.740
therefore tell us whether M
accepted its own description.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.190
Therefore, if B had a decider we would
be able to decide the diagonal language,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.790
which is impossible.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520
So B cannot be decidable.
