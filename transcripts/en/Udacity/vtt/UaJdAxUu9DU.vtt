00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.120
If we open up the Gif class in
the Objective-C project, we can see that

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.950
the Gif class inherits from NSObject and
conforms to the and NSCoding protocol.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.820
We're going to need to add both
of those to our swift gif class.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.910
Remember that in order to be visible
to Objective-C APIs, a swift class

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.718
must inherit from an NSObject and
that's true of the NSCoding protocol.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.090
If we open up the gif.m file, we can
see that the two required methods for

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.590
the and
NSCoding protocol are implemented here.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.090
The methods initWithCoder and
encodeWithCoder.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.200
Naturally, we'll need to implement these
methods in the swift version as well.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.980
You're going to rewrite the method
initWithCoder, just like you see here,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.500
calling decode object for key for
each property to an unarchive a gif.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.510
And you're going to rewrite the method
encodeWithCoder just like you see here.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.300
Calling encodeObject forKey which
takes the object to be archived and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.750
the key as parameters.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.129
So to start off with,
here we are back in our gif.swift file.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.860
And we're going to add NSObject and
NSCoding.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.200
And of course the NSCoding
protocol requires two methods.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.860
init with coder, and encodeWithCoder.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.800
So, unarchiving is going to
look something like this and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.240
archiving is going to
look something like this.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.010
And I'll let you guys take it from here.
