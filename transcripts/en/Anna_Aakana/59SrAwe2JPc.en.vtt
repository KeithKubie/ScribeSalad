00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.700
Ah, see?  Troy's got my back.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.060
Bullshit, he's just afraid to take sides.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.820
No, I'm not.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.020
You should be.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.540
I'd own your ass in a fight.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.980
But why would I fight you?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.820
Yeah, that would be like the most boring fight ever.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.300
Abby would knock you out in two seconds.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.580
(Together) Oh!  Bam!

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.820
I think I see it, actually.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm not sure what--Ow!

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.480
I'm going to toughen you up boy!

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.980
OW!

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.220
Dude, what the Hell?  Stop!  Stop stop, please!

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.380
Oh, guys!  Here it is!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.900
Fuck yes!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.660
Come on, we saw this the other day.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.060
Super cool.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.120
What?  Are you scared?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.380
No, we just...we've never been down this...this path.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.000
Aw, it's going to be okay buddy.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.740
Come on, you can do it.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.000
You guys always say it's fine.  There's not even a trail marker.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.520
You've got to own up to this growth spurt that you had.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340
How much further?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.960
It's just over that hill.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.440
Maybe two hills.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.340
Three.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.860
No.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.460
What?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.420
No dude, I'm done.  This is a dumb idea.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940
Dude, stop being such a pussy.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.900
We're just having fun.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.760
We are miles from everything.  We have no cellphone reception.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.940
If one of us gets hurt, we're done.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.280
We have no way to get back.  Do you understand that?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.780
Okay.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.100
We would be stranded.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.300
(Abby) *screams*

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.000
Abby!?  Abby!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.280
Hah!  Just kidding!

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.320
Hahaha!

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.300
See?  That's what I'm talking about.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.960
You face is so cute when you get scared.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.800
That stops.  No that stop right now.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.400
Yes sir.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.900
Okay.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.340
I'm sorry.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.940
Okay!  That was the last one.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.200
That was the last one, I promise.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.620
Yes, promise.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.360
Here we go, come on.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.300
Okay, okay!  No more.  And you'll come and it will be amazing.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.660
Keep it moving boy!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.400
Left!  Left!  Left, right left!

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800
Know what this is?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.500
It's a Fairy Ring.  It's a place of great sacred power.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.120
That's right.  Ancient Black Magic and shit.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.940
Shut up, I'm telling the story.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380
Four hundred years ago, children who wandered into these woods

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.320
either came out crazy or didn't come back at all.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.020
Those who did come out said that they'd seen

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.800
five beautiful witches.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.720
They tried to lure them into the center of the ring for a sacrifice.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.000
Five suspicious townswomen were tried and hung

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.160
but it was no use.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.240
Any children that came near these woods *claps* would vanish.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.880
They say if you listen closely,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.680
you can still hear the sound of the witches laughing.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.200
And if you do, you'll never come out alive.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
*sounds of witches laughing*

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.260
*chuckling*

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.540
Oh my goodness!  It doesn't get better than this.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.320
That face!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.380
So priceless!

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.380
So good.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.960
Come on witches!  Lets go!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.580
Oh, witches!

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.240
Bring it on!

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.420
Oh, maybe we should make a sacrifice.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.320
Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't want to insult the witches.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.320
No way.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.280
No no no.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.600
Where are you going?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.080
I don't want to do this.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.240
I don't want to--

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.320
*Witches laughing*

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.680
Hey guys, this is a bad prank.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.540
I mean, we are way too old for pranks.  This is stupid.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.760
Did your sister's friends do this?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.260
No!

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.920
Then who the fuck are these people?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.420
I don't know!

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.100
Are you fucking kidding me?  You dragged me down here!

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.740
This is--

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.220
*Witches laughing*

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.460
*Witches laughing*
