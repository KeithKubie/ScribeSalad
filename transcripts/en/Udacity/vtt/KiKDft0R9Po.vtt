00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So how do you calculate speed?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hopefully, your boat is going forwards to the water with some velocity we'll call v.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, actually anything use to calculate your speed at sea is called a log and why is it called that.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, the reason it's called a log is because what mariners used to do

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was throw an actual log over the back of the boat.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They would let the log float as the boat continue forward and is it did this, they plant some rope.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Tied in this rope were some knots and by counting the number of knots, they can refer the boat speed.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is where the term knots comes from in reference to a ship's speed.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now you maybe saying this is a ridiculous way to measure speed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
How accurate could this whole procedure be anyways--well, you're right.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is now the best way of measuring speed, but it was somewhat functional at the time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So what do you think are the problems with this method.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Is it a problem that the line could stretch, that it's hard to accurately measure time

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or what about currents, may be there's some lateral currents in the water behind the boat.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that you think apply.
