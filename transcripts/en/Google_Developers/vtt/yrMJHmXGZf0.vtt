KATHY PHAM: Hello!

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.930
Thank you for hanging
out after lunch

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.090
and listening to me tell
you a little bit more

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.600
about the United
States Digital Service.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.070
It is incredibly
exciting for me.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.550
And I felt so much
happiness in it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.620
today just to be back
here at home at Google

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.510
and to share the
story with you all.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.896
So before I jump
into all the work

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.479
that we're doing at
the federal level,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.080
I'll tell you a little
bit about myself.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.260
Who am I?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170
I am lover of data.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.725
I studied computer
science at Georgia Tech.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:45.954
I also founded the
Atlanta chapter of Unite

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:47.370
for Sight, while
I was in college,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.130
when we were looking to
eradicate blindness--

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.340
or preventable blindness--
around the world-- mainly

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.900
cataracts.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.170
I went to this thing
called the Imagine Cup.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.570
Those of you who are far
more familiar with Microsoft

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.170
know that it is an
international competition,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.090
similar like the World Cup,
but instead of for soccer,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.840
it's for tech nerds who want
to solve social problems.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.990
And our team brought home
first place for the US.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.740
So I have this weave
of public service

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.560
throughout my life and career.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.060
And there's a photo
of Google Health

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.518
up there because it wasn't
until I joined the Google Health

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:21.910
team that I realized
I can do something

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.410
with my career in technology
and health care as my day job.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.960
I had no idea that even existed.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.940
And I included a
photo of me surfing

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.861
just because it's something that
I just also really, really love

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:36.360
doing.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.026
And my husband, who's
here in the front,

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:40.620
was the one who taught
me how to do so.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.090
But also, in addition
to that, I am

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.670
what I call a hospital
hustling, cancer fighting,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.320
patient advocate for my mom
who has beat leukemia twice.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.110
And we spent many
countless days and hours--

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.310
she's actually right here.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.268
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.310
So thank you to Women Techmakers
for inviting my family out.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.759
And I just have to say,
talking to a roomful of women

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.622
is very, very exciting,
but having your mom

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.121
in the front row
is extremely scary.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.540
And so with all of
that-- with these things

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.220
I have found in my life--
whether I chose them

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.870
like computer science,
and public service,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.040
and entering these
crazy competitions,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.360
or having cancer just
fall into our lap,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.900
and having to figure out
how to deal with that-- I'll

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.730
talk about how that
led me to this place,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.862
where I somehow found
myself as the First Lady's

00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:41.570
guest of the State of
the Union Address--

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.870
an event that I got to
share with my brother, who

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.540
is a captain of
the Marine Corps--

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.430
and also work on something
that is now known

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.900
as the startup of this man, the
President of the United States,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050
the United States
Digital Service.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.740
And while there, I got to do
some pretty exciting things.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.340
I got to focus on a
very national level,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.140
looking into issues
that deal with STEM.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.030
This is something
called SOSTEM, which

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.830
is like the State of
the Union Address,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.340
but instead is the State
of Science, Technology,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.740
Engineering and Math.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.370
And there was a panel last
year that I contributed to,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.280
which was pretty exciting.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.460
And I have to give
a shout out to Megan

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.160
here, since some
of you may know,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.360
she kicked off Women
Techmakers-- incredible woman,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.690
is now the CTO of
the United States.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.500
But Women Techmakers
wouldn't be what

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.880
it is today without
people like Stephanie

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.720
[? Lin ?] and
Natalie, who's around,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.540
who have built this thing
into what it is today.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.118
So thank you to them
for having us here.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.290
So what am I doing?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.600
We are trying to build a
more awesome government

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.930
for the people, by
the people, today,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.950
now, with groups like the
Presidential Innovation

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.020
Fellows, 18F, the United States
Digital Service, agencies

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.320
across the federal government,
and the White House.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.800
So this is the group
that I am a part of.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.260
And a little bit about how
I got involved with this.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.690
I was just minding my
own business at Google,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.500
doing analytics
internally for Google.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.610
And I got this call from
Mikey at the White House,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.910
who was just kind of starting
up the US Digital Service.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.790
We were at eight or
10 people at the time.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.440
And he basically said,
so we need someone

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.970
who knows health care and data.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.020
Sounds like you might
know a few things.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.380
Go come serve your country.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.339
Come to the White House, and
help out for three months

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:36.380
because Google has a
sabbatical program that lets

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.250
you leave for three months.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.710
Turns out I came
for three months.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.850
My first day there, I
remember sitting in a room

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.850
with three of the most
incredible women I've ever

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.360
met or worked with and
thought, I can't go back.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.360
Google is an amazing
place, but I can't go back.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.110
This is my new home.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.080
So I took a
three-month sabbatical

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.170
and stayed on with
the federal government

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.800
working on what is deemed
Obama's stealth startup, which

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.700
is basically a tech startup
inside the White House.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.880
And I like to think of
it as the president's

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.080
kind of like our CEO.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.870
The venture capitalists are
all the taxpayers-- all of you.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.770
People are already paying
us for these services.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.620
There's no reason
why they should suck.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.130
And we need to make them better.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.300
So that's why all these
amazing people in this photo

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.800
here are there in the
federal government--

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.650
some of the brightest
people I've ever met.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.850
And I'll tell you more
about them going forward.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.170
And I love this photo because
the president is sometimes

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.080
called the coder in chief.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.710
He really did-- someone made
a side comment of, oh, he

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.622
probably didn't
really write any code.

00:05:42.622 --> 00:05:44.330
And Megan stepped in
and was like, no, he

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.060
wrote a couple lines of Python.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.990
So that was pretty exciting.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.120
How often does that happen?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.630
And we love this.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.280
So I'll tell you
more about what we're

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.370
doing at the federal level.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.530
And I'll go through a
couple of the projects

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.620
and give shout outs to a
couple of my colleagues

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.600
because they're
pretty incredible.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.330
Some of you may have heard about
the healthcare.gov debacle.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.060
Back in 2013, it was all
over CNN, all over Fox News,

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.750
all over all the news sources.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.410
It was down.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.500
Nobody could get access.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.360
I remember in tech
circles, there

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.000
were talks of, why didn't they
just hire some of the best

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.320
technologists-- people
who've built the internet,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.130
people who built
the best services

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.670
throughout the country?

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.290
And why did they hire
these crazy contractors?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.350
It's because the federal
government spends,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.220
I think, $80 billion
in contracts,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.810
and 94% of those projects
are behind schedule.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.730
And 40% never even
see the light of day.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.000
It's just the state
of how we do things.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.320
So healthcare.gov
was a part of that.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.430
And a couple of people
across industry,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.120
including some Googlers,
people like Mina Hsiang,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.542
Mikey Dickerson, Matthew
Weaver, were like, I'm just

00:06:58.542 --> 00:06:59.250
going to go help.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.590
I'm going to go volunteer.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.610
I know how to keep
google.com up,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.482
so maybe I can keep
this website up.

00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:06.690
And at that time, if you
look up this talk, I kid you

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.320
not-- the way this team figured
out if healthcare.gov was up,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.520
is they turned on the
news, or they literally

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.700
went to healthcare.gov.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.890
So for those of you who
have built products,

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.100
there were no analytics,
no way of tracking,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.780
and the different teams
are not held accountable.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.780
So we just brought
in things that

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.870
are best practices, are
normal here and in tech,

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.050
and turned that around.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.700
And that team turned that
around so it's stable.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.560
And millions of people were
able to get health care.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.360
Over 100 million people who
were previously denied care

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.180
because of preexisting
conditions, that

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.970
were like you randomly get
cancer or some kind of disease,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.150
now have access to care.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.250
So that team was
pretty incredible.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.530
Something else, an area
that I worked on-- Veterans.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.145
Some of you may have
heard in the news

00:07:52.145 --> 00:07:57.770
that some Vets wait two years,
a year and a half to get care.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.970
Part of that is just a policy,
human resources problem.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.420
Part of that is tech.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.810
People come and submit
claims, and they just

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.370
don't get processed.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.110
One example is this thing.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.230
This took about 10 years
for contractors to build.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.310
So the reason this exists--
it's for spinal cord injury

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.810
patients.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.996
They have special motor
records and different kinds

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:25.370
of things that
are just different

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.820
than any other patient.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.380
So they had to have
a special system.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.090
So they hire contractors
to build this thing.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.190
It came with a
133-page user manual.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.610
Think of the last
time you've ever

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.901
had to even open a user manual.

00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:41.400
You don't open one and figure
out how to use Google Maps.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.740
How to use Gmail.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.050
You don't open one to figure
out how to send an e-mail

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.040
or make a filter.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.950
But that was the
state of technology.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.500
So within a few months,
our team built something

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.170
in Postgres and Rails.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.270
And one database.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.700
Before, this was 24
different instances.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.020
So if you ever asked anyone,
how many spinal cord injury

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.650
patients are there, you'd
get a different answer

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.410
across the board.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.450
So there was no real
source of truth.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.004
So this is a very
small, small project

00:09:09.004 --> 00:09:10.420
that just showed
the power of what

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.380
you can do when you add
the patient and the user

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.450
to what you're building.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.040
Immigration.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.850
Some of you may
have had experience

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.960
trying to get a family
member into the US

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.070
or know people who
got married, and they

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.090
have these stories of waiting
months or years to get

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.559
their spouse into the US.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.350
So some of that is
because it takes a while

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.630
to interview, et cetera.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.700
But some of that is because
you have this massive mound

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.240
of paperwork to fill out.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.830
And it's really
confusing, especially

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.250
if English maybe isn't
your first language.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.347
So before, there was
something like this.

00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:46.430
You had to go through the
website, figure out what

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.010
form you might need.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.010
Is it an immediate relative?

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.650
Is it a third cousin?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.840
Is it a spouse, et cetera?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
It was really confusing.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.990
That became this.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.260
This team was led by
Vivian Graubard, who's

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.280
a technologist, an awesome
policy guru, who led this team

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.890
to turn that around
and make something

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.180
a little more user-friendly.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.510
It means that something
like this-- a form you

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.720
had to fill out on
paper and mail in--

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.570
became something
like this, online,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.900
that is much, much more
user-friendly and much more

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.880
familiar to many people today.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.310
I love this slide.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.400
Vivian included this in her
Grace Hopper-- her talk.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.750
And somebody had found
this on the Metro

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.619
and gave it to her in DC.

00:10:30.619 --> 00:10:33.160
So apparently picking up pieces
of paper in the Metro station

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.940
can be helpful.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.640
What this is, is a list
of forms this person

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.880
had to fill out to get a
family member into the US.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.510
And the $25,000
number at the bottom

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.310
is basically the
poverty line in the US.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.810
So it's the amount
of money you have

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.714
to prove that you have in
order to support a family

00:10:50.714 --> 00:10:52.130
member coming so
they don't become

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.880
a dependent of
the United States.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.220
So it means that this
person had this number

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.360
at the top of their
mind, whatever

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.130
that might mean as a whole.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.840
But overall, it's a really
crazy, confusing process.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.770
Most people don't
go around and say,

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.730
I worked with USCIS
or immigration.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.210
It was the best experience ever.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.970
And I just recommend
it to everyone.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.220
And that would be awesome
if we got to that.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.820
It's not impossible, right?

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.950
We could make some
of these experiences

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.670
just as amazing as ordering
a car on your phone

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.760
or getting food delivered
to your house in 15 minutes.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.500
So that's why we're here.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.800
Education.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.140
Many of you in this room
probably went to college.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.220
And you may remember how hard
it was to just figure out

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.340
what schools to apply to.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.200
If you just search
for best colleges,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.900
you get this whole list,
ranging from "Business Insider,"

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.490
"Forbes," "Times"-- many,
many third party sites that

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.400
have totally arbitrary
ranking systems on how

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.790
they rank a college.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.920
And that's what
students rely on.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.557
The government has the
data, just in the past,

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:55.640
it hasn't really released.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.700
It hasn't totally made it open.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.770
So this was a team led
by Lisa Gelobter, who

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.690
did little things like helped
launch Hulu and executive

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.420
at BET, who is now part of the
federal government building

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.500
digital services.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.450
Sarah Allen, who, if you've
ever used the internet,

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.200
have probably touched her
software because she founded

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.100
Flash and After Effects.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.890
They came to work on
projects like this

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.060
because they in
their heart believe

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.020
the fastest way to
the middle class

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.780
is with a college education, and
they wanted to empower students

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.540
with better
decision-making tools.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.920
This won't solve all of
our education problems

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.380
by any means, but at
least it's a first step

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.560
to let you know how much
universities actually

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.440
cost, real data on
graduation rates,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.957
and real data on the salary that
people make after attending,

00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:47.790
versus anything that
you might see out there

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.290
from a third party.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.270
But what's most
powerful about this

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.820
is that it completely
opened up all the data,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.370
and there's an API
behind this website.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.880
What that means
is that any of you

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.079
can go and visualize that data
in any way you want and help

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:04.120
really make a difference.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.190
It means nonprofits,
counselors, news sources

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.470
can go and pull this data
and have real, reliable data

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.170
to display to people.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.350
That's pretty powerful.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.400
That leads me into open data.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.110
Just this idea of making
our government more

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.120
transparent for the people.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.400
Cori Zarek, who is
a brilliant lawyer,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.050
works on this in the Office of
Science, Technology, and Policy

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.050
with Megan Smith.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.250
66 countries around the
world have collaborated

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.950
to work together to make sure
that all their governments make

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.800
their data open to
all of its people.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.618
What that means is there
are sites like data.gov.

00:13:44.618 --> 00:13:46.984
It's 160,000 sets of data.

00:13:46.984 --> 00:13:48.400
If you're a data
wonk like me, you

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.740
can go, pull any
of those sets down,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.380
and do whatever cool
visualizations you want,

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.240
ranging from business,
agriculture, education, energy,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.140
police data, et
cetera, and come up

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.931
with really interesting
things about what's

00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:01.990
going on in this country.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.790
Or we have this thing called
the Digital Analytics Dashboard,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.820
where you can see how
citizens are interacting

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.230
with all of our websites today.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.800
What's even cooler about this
is that because everything was

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.341
also developed in the open, you
can grab the code from GitHub

00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.290
today.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.780
The city of Philadelphia has
their own Digital Analytics

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.740
Dashboard, and the
country of Mexico

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.560
is coming up with
their own data.gov.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.290
It's pretty cool, and
we can collaborate

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.920
around the world that day
just through open code.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.700
It's like techies
uniting around the world.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.090
It's pretty awesome.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.710
So last thing I'll
talk about is the thing

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.560
that is the absolute closest
and dearest to my heart.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.830
Two things.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.250
Number one, the Precision
Medicine Initiative.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.050
The president announced
this last year

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.770
at the State of
the Union Address.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.410
And the team of very
talented people,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.170
like DJ Patil, Mina Hsiang,
and Claudia Williams

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.680
have been working together
to make this a reality.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.600
So what's precision medicine?

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.800
It means that today, if you're
an 80-pound, 55-year-old Asian

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.700
woman or a 200-pound
Caucasian male,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.670
and you came into
Stanford or any hospital

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.100
with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, both of you

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.770
may get vincristine.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.270
And the doctor
might say something

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.800
like, quote, "cross fingers
it might work this time"

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.560
and not know why
it doesn't work.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.170
And not know why it works
for only a small part

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.240
of the population.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.629
And you look at the two
people, and immediately think,

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:30.920
well, they're obviously just
two different human beings

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.720
with totally
different backgrounds.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.270
And we don't have the data
to-- or we have the data,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.990
but we don't have it compiled in
a way where we can analyze them

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.430
to figure out how two totally
different people will react

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.790
to the exact same
kind of treatment.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.530
So we're looking to
do that, combining

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.140
genomics and background
data of people

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.056
to give better health
care to all people.

00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:54.180
And then some of you may
have heard about something

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.330
called the Cancer Moonshot.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.920
This is something that Vice
President Joe Biden feels

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.046
extremely passionate about.

00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:02.628
It's something that several of
us here in the White House also

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.420
feel very passionate about.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.060
And I particularly love this
name for multiple reasons.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.050
One, I was a Googler,
and we always

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.100
used this to refer
to all the projects

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.400
that were kind of out there.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.200
And then also, it kind
of came full circle

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.930
because the original
moonshot was our literal shot

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.262
to the moon, where
we went to the moon.

00:16:22.262 --> 00:16:23.970
And some of these
things seem impossible.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.525
It seems like it
might have not been

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:26.650
possible to go to the moon.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.510
It seemed like having
hot air balloons give

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.850
Wi-Fi was impossible.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.320
Self-driving cars.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.210
And the thought of curing
cancer is something

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.450
that's thrown around a lot.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.620
And sometimes that also
doesn't seem possible,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.090
but we just believe
that we can do it.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.270
So those are two of
the health initiatives

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.630
that just really, really
excite me that the White

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.140
House has its fingers in today.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.560
So what that means is whether
you are in design, or product,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.090
or policy, or engineering,
if your passion is education,

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.920
STEM, immigration, or
you just like solving

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.400
really crazy, giant, big,
tech problems that are really,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.359
really, really hard with folks
who have the best intentions

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.035
but never really knew much
about user-centric design,

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:14.560
or shipping products, or
doing these number of things

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.480
that you may be used to
just in your industries,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.260
there's so much room for
you to come help build

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.740
a more awesome government for
all the people, by all of us,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.690
today at the local level,
at the federal level.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.190
You can go work at any
city or state government.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.840
Come to the federal
level at USDS,

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.090
18F, Presidential
Innovation Fellows,

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.580
work for Code for America,
where they are literally

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.170
coding for America, and help us
be a more awesome government.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.490
And you can find out more at
whitehouse.gov/usds or reach

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.730
out to me and, we can
chat more after this.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.836
Thank you.

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:54.752
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:03.257
So please, there are
mics around the room

00:18:03.257 --> 00:18:04.340
if you all have questions.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.740
And we have about, I think,
eight minutes for questions.

00:18:18.026 --> 00:18:20.400
I think what I'll do is, I'll
call-- I was told that it's

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.691
best to call on the mic colors.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.050
The yellow mic.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.500
Thank you.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.458
Wonderful presentation.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.220
So USDS is wonderful.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.010
18F is wonderful.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.250
These organizations
are wonderful.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.050
What about having
other small companies

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.270
from Silicon Valley
who maybe are not

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.646
part of your
organization helping

00:18:45.646 --> 00:18:47.061
to collaborate on
these projects--

00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.560
is there a way for
them to do that?

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.290
KATHY PHAM: Yes.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.160
So we're doing two things.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.630
We have a whole
contracting team looking

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.257
into just looking
for ways to make it

00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:58.590
so that it's easier for smaller
companies to contribute.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.381
There actually was
a bug bounty that

00:19:00.381 --> 00:19:02.130
was announced by the
Department of Defense

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:06.040
recently to invite people
to come and hack the DoD.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.760
There are countless things like
that there we're building up.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.490
There are ways to contribute
to any of the open source

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.060
projects, whether it's the
College Scorecard, data.gov,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.400
Digital Analytics Dashboard.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.734
You can find it
on the 18F GitHub.

00:19:18.734 --> 00:19:20.900
There are plenty of projects
that you can contribute

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.090
on your own time without
actually moving to DC

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.835
or becoming a federal employee.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.640
Yes.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for your very inspiring speech.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.600
I have a somewhat political
question, I guess.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.080
With elections
coming up, how do you

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.370
see whoever is going to be
elected as the new president

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.210
supporting this undertaking?

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.570
KATHY PHAM: So we get this
question every single time.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.356
And totally valid
question, something

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:54.480
we talk about all the time.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.140
We've built our group
out into three tiers.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.000
We have USDS at the White
House, which is where I sit.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.110
We have the 18F
group, which is part

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.770
of what is called GS-- General
Service Administration.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.970
So it's a whole different
agency, different funding

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:08.640
model.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.940
It doesn't matter if
the president changes.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.710
That group is
forever still there.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.690
And then something cool
else that we also did.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.850
Let me go back a slide.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.499
If you look in the corner
there on the bottom right,

00:20:20.499 --> 00:20:22.040
we've built out
digital service teams

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.180
within different agencies.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.160
So we have a team within the VA.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.650
We're building out a team within
Health and Human Services.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.880
So when they're in
the agencies, when

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.890
the administration
changes, nothing

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.150
is going-- they'll
still be around.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.140
So the only question is, we
have the funding for USDS

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.440
at the White House, and
there'll be leadership change

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.759
at the top, but
for the most part,

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.300
it will just be the
leadership churn.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.390
And we'll just see what
happens with the groups-- we've

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.889
built it out in such a way that
the groups should be intact.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.215
There's someone behind you.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.920
AUDIENCE: My question is
also a little bit political.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.976
It's not about Trump.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.190
I was wondering,
like someone like me

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.690
who came from the
Middle East-- it took me

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.870
two years to get a work permit.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.030
I was denied a tax
number because I'm

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.350
from a country
that doesn't exist,

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.620
which is called Palestine.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.660
I was wondering, how do you
encourage people like me to get

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.230
excited about these projects?

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.550
It sounds inspiring.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.500
It sounds amazing.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.540
But it's really hard for me to
think that it's my government

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.840
when I'm treated this way.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.190
My question is, how do
you get people excited

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.696
who are from different
countries and are here?

00:21:43.696 --> 00:21:45.820
KATHY PHAM: Well, first,
we like to think ourselves

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.594
as-- we might work on a project
that might seem sometimes

00:21:48.594 --> 00:21:51.010
political, but we're just not
a political group ourselves.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.870
We just like to solve
hard tech problems.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.670
And in the case of folks
who maybe immigrated here,

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.160
or who maybe just had a really,
really rough time figuring out

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.070
how to navigate our government,
we need your opinions.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.640
We need people who understand,
why did it take you two years?

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.820
And why was it so hard?

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.336
And what does it mean to
be an unrecognized country?

00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:13.210
And have that as part
of the user experience,

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.030
whether you're just contributing
via your thoughts and opinions

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.240
or coming to help
and turn that around,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.720
to help us figure out how to
actually build for all people.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.190
It might just be that
no one in that room--

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.689
similar to when
Google made a phone,

00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:26.070
and it didn't take into
account left-handed people.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.340
No one in the room
knew that use case,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.044
and so we can't
design for people

00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:31.960
when we don't have all
the people in the room.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.501
So that's something else that
actually Megan focuses on a lot

00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:35.920
as well.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.814
So for those who,
like in your case,

00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:39.480
you can maybe come
and help and actually

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.710
change that around
and make it better

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.950
for everyone else like you.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.090
Yes.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.340
AUDIENCE: So the White House
did a demo day in 2015.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.965
So can you talk a
little bit about what

00:22:53.965 --> 00:22:56.570
are the plans for
the demo day in 2016,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.910
and what's the spirit
behind it, and overall,

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.480
what other initiatives you
have for entrepreneurs?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.920
KATHY PHAM: Yeah.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.660
The demo day was hosted by the
Office of Science, Technology,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.160
and Policy.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.680
So I don't know
what their plans are

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.390
this year for the
results of the demo day.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.340
We are constantly hosting
mapathons, and hackathons,

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.420
and different events like
that for entrepreneurs

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.000
to get involved.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.750
And we actually need
lots of entrepreneurs

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.587
in groups like 18F and
USDS to drive forward

00:23:24.587 --> 00:23:26.545
some of the initiatives
that we want to launch.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.670
AUDIENCE: In what
ways was working

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.200
for the White House different
from working at Google?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.030
Do you-- like, was
there more red tape?

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.660
Do you miss the free food?

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.260
KATHY PHAM: Yeah.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.950
So many ways.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:44.960
But then also not.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.830
So I feel like the amazing
people themselves within USDS

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.060
and 18F are the same.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.030
All the people that
Google has-- the passion,

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.254
the drive to use the best tech
to improve people's lives,

00:23:57.254 --> 00:23:58.670
wanted to change
the world, wanted

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.870
to work on big things--
all of that's the same.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.906
Launching products within
an agency is very hard.

00:24:06.906 --> 00:24:08.530
It's just the reality
of things, partly

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.340
because things have
been built the same way

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.590
for many, many years.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.550
Partly because we also pay
contractors multimillion

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.987
dollars to launch things.

00:24:16.987 --> 00:24:18.820
Sometimes turning things
around and changing

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.520
people's minds can be difficult.
But the people that I work with

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.430
are by far the
most amazing people

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.220
I've ever worked
with in my life.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.230
I actually don't
miss the free food.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.980
I'd thought I might.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.520
But I don't miss the free food.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.480
And I think the
ability to just work

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.930
on something that is-- it's
probably the highest, greatest

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.030
impact thing I've ever done.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:44.020
And partly because people are
already paying us, and the fact

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.622
that we're not delivering,
is not OK for any of us.

00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:51.330
Whereas, when you work
for a corporation,

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.880
we have to build something
that people will want to buy.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.250
Whereas for us, everyone--
if you're paying taxes,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.030
you're already paying us, so
we'd better deliver things

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.980
that actually work.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:06.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.430
I work at a DoD data
center down in Seaside.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.750
And one of the problems
that we encounter

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.090
daily-- the developers
encounter daily--

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.690
is the software being
behind the times.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.780
So do you know of
any initiatives

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:30.400
to bring the government up to
speed in technology or anything

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.294
like that?

00:25:31.294 --> 00:25:31.960
KATHY PHAM: Yes.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.200
There are definitely
initiatives to get

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.489
different parts of-- so
the government is built out

00:25:36.489 --> 00:25:38.530
in multiple agencies-- I
think 25 or so agencies.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.779
And you can think of each
one of as essentially having

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:41.440
its own CEO.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.710
It's like a different country.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.810
So I know different
agencies do it differently.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.970
Like 18F is on Google
Docs and Google Apps,

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.290
and they have
Google Spreadsheets.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.380
And then other groups are
still on Outlook and Lync

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.430
and different things.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.820
Chris Lynch is the new
digital service lead

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.987
at the Department of Defense.

00:25:58.987 --> 00:26:00.570
You should definitely
sync up with him

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.000
and see if you can mesh your
amazing minds together and come

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.370
up with other software that
would be better for the DoD.

00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:14.410
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious--
since the [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.060
conference we've been talking
about, diversity and inclusion.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.050
How is that at USDS?

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:20.950
How is the diversity?

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.394
How is the inclusion?

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:24.310
KATHY PHAM: Thank you
for asking that question

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.890
because I love this question.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.230
When we were building
USDS, something

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.850
that we were very
cognizant of was

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:32.810
that we all came
from tech companies

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.940
where the numbers
are pretty bad.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.310
So if anything, at
the federal level,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.330
we can try and at
least be an example.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.677
We're 50% woman total, which
doesn't-- and then you're like,

00:26:42.677 --> 00:26:44.260
well, what about the
breakdown, right?

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.090
Because it could be anything.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:47.700
The last count
that we had, we're

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.300
35% female engineers, which is
better than the current numbers

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.350
in tech.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.160
So that's pretty
exciting for us.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.662
We have folks who've
recruited and hired--

00:26:59.662 --> 00:27:01.120
and we're hiring
managers, and have

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.286
done all this at Google,
and LinkedIn, and Facebook,

00:27:03.286 --> 00:27:04.020
and Twitter.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.160
And we know some
of our pitfalls.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.410
We're definitely not perfect.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.680
There were arguments
in the early days,

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.250
like any startup,
of you guys can't

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.875
do that, or else
you're going to end up

00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:15.750
with 5% women or 5% minorities.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.602
I wish I had the numbers of
all the demographic breakdowns

00:27:18.602 --> 00:27:19.560
off the top of my head.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.804
I don't right now.

00:27:20.804 --> 00:27:22.595
We might [INAUDIBLE]
maybe-- well actually,

00:27:22.595 --> 00:27:26.880
I won't say anything
about that, but-- If you

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.720
were at Grace Hopper, or if
you just look at the topics

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.080
that I presented, it was a
pretty diverse group of women

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.330
that were presenting as well.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.080
So we're extremely
cognizant of it.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.435
We're very, very cognizant
at every single level-- when

00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:43.320
we source, when we hire,
and we try and make

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.860
a very conscious effort to
make it a very diverse group

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.935
because we're building
for the American people.

00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:49.310
So we should at
least try and get

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.428
most of what America looks like.

00:27:54.469 --> 00:27:55.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.960
Thank you for the
inspiring speech.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.970
I have one question.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.440
So the one issue that I
struggle with every year

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.350
is when I have to do my taxes.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.000
And I was just
wondering if you--

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.770
I don't know if it falls
within the purview-- but do you

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.242
have any initiatives going
on in that direction?

00:28:11.242 --> 00:28:11.950
KATHY PHAM: Yeah.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:16.010
We did a little bit of
advising over in the IRS space,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.267
but there is no project
that we talk about publicly.

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.850
But yes, many of us also came
in the government and were like,

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.641
we have a really hard
time doing our taxes,

00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:25.130
so let's figure
out some of this.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.550
But there are initiatives, like
when you apply for a FASFA--

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.940
if you apply for a FASFA for
the Department of Education,

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.024
there's no reason why your
IRS data shouldn't also

00:28:34.024 --> 00:28:35.773
automatically link to
your education data,

00:28:35.773 --> 00:28:37.340
because it's all
the same government.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.190
So there are things like
that have been worked on.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.560
And I am out of time.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.060
Thank you.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.610
[APPLAUSE]
