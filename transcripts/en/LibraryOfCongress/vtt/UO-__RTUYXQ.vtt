00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.530
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Hello
I'm John Fenn

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.830
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.520
And I'm here with Huda
Asfour and Kamyar Arsani

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.100
and they're going to be playing

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.770
in our archive challenge
showcase here in 2018.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.520
So I want to welcome you guys.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.820
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Thank you.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.120
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Asani: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.420
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Yeah, of course.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.720
And I wanted to start
with maybe asking each

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.020
about your individual
backgrounds in music

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.320
and then we'll get

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.620
to the collaboration what
we're going to hear tonight.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.920
So Huda, we'll start with you.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: I
started playing music

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.680
at sort of a young age.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.780
My first formal training
was trying

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.860
to learn piano at
the age of seven.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.490
Things didn't go
very well there.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.760
I tried to play a number

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.750
of instruments including the
keyboard, guitar, and other sort

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.430
of trying different
instrumentation.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.670
And so at the age of 13
I in school I started

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.960
to take formal music lessons

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.950
and became fascinated
with the [inaudible].

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.550
That same summer I took a
trip and had a family reunion

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.490
where I met my grand father
who played the [inaudible]

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.480
and was fascinated by the
oud, and was fascinated

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.900
by the ability to create such a
communal experience for people.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.250
And my family, the friends,
the neighbors, people just kind

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.370
of came together around
his singing and his playing

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.730
and came back to Tunisia at
the time where I was living,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.280
fascinated by this
instrument and that's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.580
where the journey started.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.760
I started playing the oud then
and then state in the concept

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.850
to Gaza and then
later in Ramallah.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.260
While also playing the qanun,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.990
which is a slightly
different instrument,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.940
zither like instrument, and
sort of like my real training

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.250
as a musician composer
and delving in more

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.890
into the traditional classical
Arabic theory of music came

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.660
in later with [inaudible]
in the West Bank

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.550
in Ramallah in Palestine.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.020
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So your
grandfather was your first

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.760
exposure to the oud or had
you encountered it before

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.060
but not really seen that?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.010
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: The oud is
a very popular instrument.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.280
I think it was my first
close encounter with someone

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190
who really played
the instrument.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.010
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And it sounds like
seeing that community gather

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.310
around there was
something that --

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.610
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: It
was the community,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.910
because I had seen
many oud players

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.700
at the time until that time.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.580
So the oud itself wasn't new.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.970
I was very, very much exposed
to many schools of oud,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.690
but it was really truly
the communal experience

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.570
that really touched
me, kind of forced me

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.650
to look more into
this instrument.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.770
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And so is that
your primary instrument now?

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.250
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Now it's my
primary instrument although I'm

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.640
focusing again more on the
qanun in the last few months.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.580
So I would love to bring

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.500
that instrument back
into my life more.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.840
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: But the
piano is done, right?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.280
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: The
piano [laughing].

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.960
No more piano.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.970
&gt;&gt;John Fenn: And what about you?

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.600
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: I
started my music --

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.120
well, I think I found
the passion

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.560
for music seeing
my dad using half

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.550
of his paycheck to buy tapes.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.490
After end of each paycheck he
would go any buy these tapes.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.000
He would bring them
home, explain them to me,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.980
as a child I don't understand
anything but he would explain,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.140
"Yeah, this tape Deep Purple
put it out on this year and I'm

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.440
in love with them man.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.740
We got to listen together."

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.690
And I think just
the idea of looking

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.230
for new sounds was taught to
me by my dad at a young age.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.760
And my mom introduced me
to the instrument of daf,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.540
the Persian frame drum.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.520
And Master Bijan Kamkar, I was
lucky enough to be able to go

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.410
to his class and he was --
we call him the father of daf

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.240
because he was the very
first person to bring the daf

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.850
out of the only Sufi gatherings
and actually bring it on the TV

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.750
and as a band and perform it.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.050
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: OK.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.350
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: So
learned it from him

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.750
and I think it was his
progressive mindset when it came

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.020
to writing music that is
folklore and traditional,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.070
yet having your own
interpretation of it some sort

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.520
so that you can make
it more understandable

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.230
for the new audience.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.310
So I think I took that idea from
him as well and went at the age

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.210
of 7, so until 7 to 10 years
old I practiced daf with him

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.770
and then I learned the
instrument kamanche,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.590
which is the Iranian
bow instrument.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.890
It's pretty much like violin

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.700
but you put it vertical
and downward.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.870
And I learned that for a
few years with [inaudible].

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.890
But that was my piano.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.210
That didn't go that well.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.150
But the daf became more and
more something that I thought

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.030
to myself I should focus on
it because there was so much

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.770
to know about it as an
instrument that I was told,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.400
it's 8,500 years old, I wanted
to know if it's that young,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.800
that old, is there more to it?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.100
Is there less to it?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.400
What's happening here?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.580
And I was lucky enough to
play the frame drum, the daf,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.050
in the caves in Khamosha and
Kyrgyzstan a field of Sufi's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.350
and the gatherings of that.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.710
So that gave me the inspiration
to go a little deeper

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.800
into just the idea and the
concept to have and the music.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.000
And then that opened the whole
can of worms of all the rhythms

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.250
and every amazing thing that
happens in the neighborhood

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.110
of my country Iran and
neighbors and everything.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.040
So I started learning the
Afghani rhythms, Pakistanian,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.690
and now with the project
that we have Huda,

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.210
I'm still learning day

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.400
by day every time we get
together there's ne things.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.750
And so that's my music
background and when I came

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.090
to the United States about ten
years ago I just taught myself

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.700
drums and ukulele and guitar
just to have fun with it

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.350
but then it turned into an album
called, "No Freedom" and then

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.040
so yeah, just trying everyday
take a different learning

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.340
of things.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.640
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So what brought
about your collaboration?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.480
How did you guys
come together as --

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.300
because you both have
other musical endeavors?

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.840
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Jim
Thompson is responsible

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.200
&gt;&gt; He is, he is the
wizard responsible.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.510
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And how long have
you been playing together also?

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.810
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Two yeas now.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.110
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: OK.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.000
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: So I had been
in the city for since 2005,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.190
left for three years
to North Carolina

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.030
and when I came back
Kamyar was sort of --

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.660
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: I
was starting yeah --

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.090
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: It was in the
city and one day I met Jim

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.100
and I think I had a gig with my
quartet at Rosa and he told me

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.880
that there's a drum --
there's a Iranian drum player

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.330
that I should meet.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.810
So we met --

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.170
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: We met the
night after I think and then --

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.240
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: And I think we
played like two hours of music.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.310
It was our first encounter so
it was very clear that we come

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.150
from very similar thinking
about traditional music,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:19.160
also very similar deliberate
desire to create more

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.210
of a contemporary feel to
this traditional music,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.060
so I think we both know the role
so well so it's easy for both

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.360
of us to break them also.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.610
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So think that
was kind of the catharsis

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.880
of that caused this
project to begin.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.180
And do these two instruments,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.620
do they appear together
commonly in?

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.570
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: I mean
it's not very uncommon

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.560
but traditionally the
daf is more played

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.600
with louder instruments
than [inaudible],

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.240
[inaudible] is not
traditionally a loud instrument.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.540
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: They're
smaller frame drums

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.260
that pair better with
loud and stuff at times,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.380
but then with that because both
mentalities are pushing forwards

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.970
and that idea of -- I don't know
we call it the punk attitude

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.410
but it's more of a just
taking what you know

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.710
and actually risk your time
with it and explore more with it

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.630
and I think we have more
faster rhythms and more

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.320
like louder ideology when it
comes to that so it's nice

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.680
because we take all the ideas
and we shape them into something

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.010
where it can be understandable

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.050
for younger generation
also it can be something

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.320
where you can close
your eyes and you know,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.320
just travel somewhere else.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.610
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Istonically
though the drum usually couples

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.990
with either string instruments
like the kamanche or in bazook,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.480
which is a very -- like
very metallic in sort

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.540
of high frequency instruments.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.710
We dabbled a little
bit with a kanoon also.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.350
I mean it's always in the mix.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.650
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: OK.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.950
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: We're hoping
that the kamanche will make it

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.160
into the studio as
well at some point.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.160
So it's expandable also.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.620
It's not necessarily
[inaudible].

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.610
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: I mean one
thing that I've noticed

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.360
in hearing you two perform
together is this maybe part

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.980
of the punk attitude but you
take advantage of the dynamics

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.160
of both instruments and are
really sort of engaged way,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.490
but the daf, you know it can
be a very loud instrument.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.870
It can also be a very
subtle quiet instrument.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.170
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: Right.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.470
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: That's
very true.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.510
And but I think because we
both sort of a little bit of --

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.230
it is a punk attitude I
think at the end of the day.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.510
For me it's more
influenced by [inaudible].

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:39.490
I've always really loved the
ceremonies, the intensity

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.030
of that music, the
trans feel that comes

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:48.100
with repetitive cycles
and odd rhythms and sort

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.380
of complex odd rhythms as well.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:59.270
So I was -- this is sort of
a kind of a passion for me

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.050
to delve into a rhythmic
richness of the [inaudible].

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.290
And so when we met I think it
just became very obvious very

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.430
quickly that this is
something that we have

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.970
in common in terms of --

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.300
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: OK, so what about
bringing that punk attitude

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.600
into the archive, right?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.030
Because we invited
you to come in

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.350
and do some research
in our collections.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.810
So what did you find?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.110
What surprised you?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.450
How are you turning
that stuff you listened

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.990
to in our collections into
what you'll perform tonight?

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.480
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: I found the
experience to be interesting

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.200
and sometimes a bit
painful I have to say.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.520
Not only from a technical
perspective,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.380
what all the challenges that
come with archive research,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.290
which I think is a
common experience

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.620
to whoever would delve
into these archives.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:55.310
I think what was most
difficult for me as an immigrant

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.670
in the country given
the political atmosphere

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.890
to understand to the core really
how these archives also are a

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.090
presentation of how we
are seen in the society,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.900
in the American society.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.310
And I think that was the
part that was a bit sensitive

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.340
and a little bit
difficult at times

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.600
because the archives are
very minimalist samples

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.980
of the culture that
you know, and for this

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.280
to become the presentation
of the culture

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.040
in the national archives,
for us,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.010
was a bit of it's a
very limited image

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.980
of who we are, you
know, as people.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.930
Because we were looking at not
only the Persian repertoire,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.680
the Arab repertoire, I
was mostly interested

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.900
in the Levantine region.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.340
And we found very limited
North African archives.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:59.940
So some Moroccan archives were
more elaborate in terms of sort

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.500
of more accessible also
versus for example like one

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.160
of the old Arabic, I think some

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.050
of the North African region
had very, very old archives

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.860
that were part of
Indonesia trips.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.260
So you know, like it was
just like a passing --

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.980
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Kind of
a sampling of stuff.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.880
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Sampling --
Sampling of a passing of Beirut

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.360
that the scholar
was going through.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.990
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: In some of the
collections you were looking

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.980
at they were made in the '50s.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.280
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Yeah.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.580
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: Yeah, right.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.880
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Which even
I think speaks to kind

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.180
of how people were collecting

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.480
at a time it wasn't
necessarily comprehensive.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.150
It was, "OK, we're here
let's do some recordings.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.450
We're here."

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.750
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Right, but it's
also interesting because most

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.350
of the archives are
focused on the folk like --

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.880
you know, obviously we are
in the American folk archive

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.760
but it is a very sort of
snippet in a way stuck in a time

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.000
that doesn't necessarily present
the contemporarily of the times

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.460
that it was recorded then.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.540
Right, so you're
in the '40s, '50s.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.760
It's a very charged and very
dynamic political environment.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.770
The whole division is going

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.980
through political
transformation,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.290
then what you get of it is only

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.120
that very traditional
old folk sense

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.730
of what this culture is about.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.650
I don't know if this
kind of makes sense.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.300
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: No it does, but
do you see your guys approach

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.470
to the archives like
as an opportunity to be

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.770
in dialogue with that.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.910
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: Yeah, I
want to add to that exactly

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.460
to just add to what
Huda is saying,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.380
I think that's why this
challenge became more

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.430
interesting for us instead
of just be more challenging.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.620
It was more of a OK,
let's dig deeper.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.920
Let's find out what's going on.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.030
And I think a part of that
problem is it's a part

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.090
of the responsibility of the
artists to come in and bring

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.340
that awareness and I think
it's great that you guys have

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.880
that chance and give it to
artists who come in and listen

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.440
to archive and let you know what
you have and what you don't have

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.060
and what needs to be
done better with them.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.030
And I think that's why
we thought to ourselves,

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.930
all right there is
something here.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.610
And I think that
at the end of it

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.200
when I saw other live
concerts from previous artists,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.660
there were times where I asked
myself the question of at

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.720
that time it might have
been a good idea to mention

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.890
that you are playing the
[inaudible] of Iranian music,

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.640
but it's nothing to do with
necessarily when you listen

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.370
on the archive, it's what
you have from your repertoire

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.860
that you play all the time.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.630
And I think for Huda it was
important not to do that

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.690
and take something from
what you guys have and have

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.370
that conversation with you.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.130
So I think that was a fun
part of the challenge.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.710
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Yeah, I like
that idea of there sort

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.200
of being a dialogue,
being a challenge,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.740
and being an opportunity
to sort of help interpret.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.040
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Yeah.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.340
&gt;&gt;Kamyar Arsani: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.160
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: You know, two
audiences, two musicians.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.930
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: And put it
into perspective, right?

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.430
Because it is such a limited
collection, because it's

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.630
such a sort of a very
narrow light spot

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.440
on a certain dimension

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.280
of the culture I think
it's very important

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.580
to interpret it as such.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.250
That's not a presentation
of the culture.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.550
It's not --

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.850
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Not of a whole --

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.150
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: It's not.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.440
It's a very narrow view
of what this division has

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.110
to offer in a way.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.410
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Well,
I'm looking forward

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.030
to what you do with it tonight.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.260
And so I want to thank you for
sitting through this interview.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.560
&gt;&gt; Huda Asfour: Thank
you so much.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.860
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani:
Thank you so much.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.160
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Thank
you for coming in

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.460
and doing the research.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.760
&gt;&gt; Kamyar Arsani: Honor to
be here thank you so much.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.060
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Excellent,
thank you.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.270
