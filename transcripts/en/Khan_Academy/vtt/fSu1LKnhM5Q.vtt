00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.150
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:10.000
I want to prove that segment
AC is perpendicular to segment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
DB based on the
information that we

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.300
have in this diagram over here.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.850
That this side has the
same length as that side,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.040
this side has the same
length as that side.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.940
And I'll give you a hint,
we're going to use one or more

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.130
of our congruence postulates.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.850
I'll just stick with calling
them postulates from now on.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.770
And so the ones that
we know-- so let me

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.220
draw a little line here.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.460
This is kind of our tool kit.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.750
We have the side
side side postulate,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930
if the three sides
are congruent,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.900
then the two triangles
are congruent.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.960
We have side angle side, two
sides and the angle in between

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.780
are congruent, then the two
triangles are congruent.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.590
We have ASA, two angles
with a side in between.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.660
And then we have AAS, two
angles and then a side.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.660
So any of these things
we've established-- these

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.490
are our postulates--
we're going to assume

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.300
that they imply congruency.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.781
And I'm also going to do this
as what we call a two column

00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:03.280
proof.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.459
And you don't have to do
something as a two column

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.958
proof, but this is
what you normally

00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.600
see in a normal
introductory geometry class.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.820
So I thought I would
expose you to it.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.267
It's a pretty basic idea is
that you make a statement,

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:18.600
and you just have to give the
reason for your statement.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.516
Which is what we've been
doing with any proof,

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:23.459
but we haven't always put
it in a very structured way.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.000
So I'm just going
to do it like this.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.480
I'll have two columns like that.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.500
And I'll have a
statement, and then I

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.590
will give the reason
for the statement.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.360
And so the strategy that
I'm going to try to do

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.310
is it looks like,
right off the bat,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.120
it seems like I can
prove the triangle CDA

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.890
is congruent to triangle
CBA based on side side side.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.672
And that's a pretty
good starting point

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:54.130
because once I can
base congruency,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.322
then I can start to
have angles be the same.

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:57.780
And the reason why
I can do that is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.640
because this side is
the same as that side,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.497
this side the same as that side,
and they both share that side.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.580
But I don't want to just
do it verbally this time,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.990
I want to write it out properly
early in this two column proof.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.260
So we have CD, we had
the length of segment CD

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.425
is equal to the length of CB.

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:18.660
CD is equal to CB,
and that is given.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.310
So these two characters
have the same length.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.280
We also know that DA,
the length of segment DA,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.600
is the same as the
length of segment BA.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.000
So DA is equal to BA, that's
also given in the diagram.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.790
And then we also know
that CA is equal to CA,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.870
I guess we could say.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.930
So CA is equal to itself.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.460
And it's obviously
in both triangles.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.465
So this is also given, or
it's obvious from the diagram.

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:58.570
It's a bit obvious.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.100
Both triangles share that side.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.850
So we have two triangles.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.680
Their corresponding sides
have the same length,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.890
and so we know that
they're congruent.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.970
So we know that triangle CDA
is congruent to triangle CBA.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.530
And we know that by the
side side side postulate

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.267
and the statements
given up here.

00:03:27.267 --> 00:03:28.850
Actually, let me
number our statements

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.730
just so we can refer back
to this 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.790
And so side side side
postulate and 1, 2, and 3--

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.160
statements 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.460
So statements 1, 2, and 3 and
the side side postulate let

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.320
us know that these two
triangles are congruent.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.130
And then if these are congruent,
then we know, for example,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.860
we know that all of their
corresponding angles

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.550
are equivalent.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.630
So for example,
this angle is going

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.310
to be equal to that angle.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.226
So let's make that
statement right over there.

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:04.040
We know that angle
DCE-- so this is

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.460
going to be statement 5-- we
know that angle DCE, that's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.870
this angle right over here, is
going to have the same measure,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.440
we could even say
they're congruent.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.120
I'll say the
measure of angle DCE

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.980
is going to be equal to
the measure of angle BCE.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.500
And this comes straight out
of statement 4, congruency,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.330
I could put it in parentheses.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.187
Congruency of those triangles.

00:04:33.187 --> 00:04:34.770
This implies straight,
because they're

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.530
both part of this
larger triangle,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.420
they are the
corresponding angles,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.414
so they're going to have
the exact same measure.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.830
Now it seems like we could do
something pretty interesting

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.520
with these two smaller
triangles at the top left

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.350
and the top right of this,
looks like, a kite like figure.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.300
Because we have a side,
two corresponding sides

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.490
are congruent, two corresponding
angles are congruent,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.490
and they have a side in common.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.760
They have this side in
common right over here.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.700
So let's first just
establish that they

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.230
have this side in
common right over here.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.910
So I'll just write statement 6.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.760
We have CE, the measure or
the length of that line,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.800
is equal to itself.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.840
Once again, this
is just obvious.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.750
It's the same.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.780
Obvious from diagram
it's the same line.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.510
Obvious from diagram.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.760
But now we can use
that information.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.620
So we don't have three sides,
we haven't proven to ourselves

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.350
that this side is the
same as this side,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.610
that DE has the
same length as EB.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.810
But we do have a side, an
angle between the sides,

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.370
and then another side.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.430
And so this looks pretty
interesting for our side angle

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.900
side postulate.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.180
And so we can say, by the
side angle side postulate,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:06:04.630
we can say that triangle DCE
is congruent to triangle BCE.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.254
And when I write the
labels for the triangles,

00:06:07.254 --> 00:06:08.920
I'm making sure that
I'm kind of putting

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.170
the corresponding point.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.700
So I started at D, then
went to C, then to E.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.250
So the corresponding
I guess angle,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.960
or the corresponding point
or vertex I could say,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.900
for this triangle
right over here,

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.704
is B. So if I start with D, I
start with B. C in the middle

00:06:23.704 --> 00:06:26.120
is the corresponding vertex
for either of these triangles,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.000
so I put it in the middle.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.333
And then they both go to E.
And that's just to make sure

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:32.230
that we are specifying
what's corresponding to what.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.900
And we know this, we know this
is true, by side angle side.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.280
And the information
we got from-- so we

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.180
got this side is established
that these two sides are

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.270
congruent was from statement 1.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.730
Then that these angles are
congruent is from statement 5

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.930
right over here.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.330
And then statement 6
gave us the other side.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.217
Statement 6, just like that.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.300
And if we know that these
triangles are congruent,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.920
that means that all of
their corresponding angles

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.060
are congruent.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.980
So we know, for example, that
this angle right over here

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.330
is going to be congruent
to that angle over there.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.850
So let's write that down.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.680
So we know, statement number
8, the measure of angle,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.578
let's call that DEC, is equal
to the measure of angle BEC.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.450
And this comes straight
from statement 7.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.830
Once again, they're congruent.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.690
Congruency.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.220
And then we also know--
we'll make statement 9.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.870
We also know that the measure
of angle DEC-- or maybe we

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.660
should just write it this way.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:52.324
Angle DEC and angle
BEC are supplementary.

00:07:52.324 --> 00:07:53.740
They are supplementary,
and that's

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.865
kind of-- you can just look
at that from inspection

00:07:55.865 --> 00:07:58.130
but I'll write a decent--
are supplementary.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.280
Supplementary, which
means they add up,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.010
their measures add
up, to 180 degrees.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.060
And we know that because
they are adjacent

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.500
and outer sides
form straight angle.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.650
And then, the next step-- if we
know that these two angles are

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.610
equal to each other,
and if we know

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.250
that they are
complementary-- our next step

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.790
means that we could
actually deduce

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.990
that they must be 90 degrees.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.419
So 10, measure of
angle DEC equals

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:44.205
measure of angle BEC,
which equals 90 degrees.

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:46.830
And then for the reason it might
be a little bit more involved,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.140
we could put these two
statements together.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.810
So it would be
statements 8 and 9.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.550
And then statements 8
and 9 mean that DEC,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.670
so I could write this, measure
of angle DEC plus measure

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.740
of angle-- actually,
let me just,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.490
since I don't want to do
too many steps all at once,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.910
let me just take it
little bit by little bit.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.560
So let me just do
it all like this.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:20.550
So let me say measure of angle
DEC plus measure of angle BEC

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.100
is equal to 180.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.040
And this comes
straight from point 9,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.930
that they are supplementary.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.810
And then we could
say statement--

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.040
I'm taking up a lot of
space now-- statement 11,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.140
we could say
measure of angle DEC

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:41.180
plus measure of angle DEC
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.390
And we know that
from statement 9.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.930
We know that from statement
9 and statement 8.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.430
We essentially just
took statement 9

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.870
and substituted that
BEC, the measure of BEC,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.100
is the same as the
measure of DEC.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.900
And so then, if we
want statement 12,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.150
we could say
measure of angle DEC

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.900
is equal to 90, which is equal
to the measure of angle BEC.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.570
And then, this comes once again
straight out of point number

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.821
11 and 8.

00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:17.320
And what you could see, I'm
kind of taking a little bit more

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.820
time, going a little bit more
granular through the steps.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.050
In some of the other proofs
I would've just said,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.260
oh, obviously this
implies this or that.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.200
And then we're done.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.377
Because if these
are 90 degrees-- so

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.710
let me write the last statement.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.480
So statement 13, which is
what we wanted to prove.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.980
We wanted to prove that
AC is perpendicular to DB.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.890
So AC is perpendicular
to, what was it?

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.530
AC is perpendicular
to segment DB,

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.100
and it comes straight
out of point 12.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.760
And we're done.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.410
We've done a two
column proof, and we

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.220
have proven that this line
segment right over here

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.740
is perpendicular to that line
segment right over there.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.540
We did it with SSS,
with the SSS postulate,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.590
and the side angle
side postulate.
