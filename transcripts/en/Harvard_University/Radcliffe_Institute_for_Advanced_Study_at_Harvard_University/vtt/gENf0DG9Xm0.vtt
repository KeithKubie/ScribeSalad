00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.140
- Well, thank you very much.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.930
And thank you for this
extremely kind introduction.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.060
It was probably the
nicest introduction

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.490
I've ever got for any talk.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.860
And I'm also extremely
privileged to be

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.650
a hero among all these
unbelievable Fellows,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.270
and I'm very, very
flattered to be having been

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.020
selected as a Radcliffe Fellow.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.780
When I found out that
I got this fellowship,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.800
I was actually somewhere in
rural Vietnam about a year ago,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
on a public bus with
spotty internet.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.930
And I got this
email, and it didn't

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.610
open for about seven minutes.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.039
And when it finally opened,
I started to scream,

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.080
and all these Vietnamese
people on the public bus

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.370
looked at me like, these
foreigners are so weird.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.060
So anyway, it's been
great to be here,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.480
and I hope I can share with
you a little bit of what

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.380
I do this afternoon.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.560
So thank you very much
for being here today.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.760
I want to also think Professor
Gelles for setting up

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.840
my topic last week in
last week's lecture,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.380
where he actually showed
you this picture, which

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.750
becomes very handy to me today.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.000
Because he already gave
you an introduction

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.270
into genetics and
transcription and translation

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.500
and what happens, very
basically, with our DNA as it

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.410
is transcribed into
RNA and translated

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.080
into the proteins
that make us alive

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.350
and makes our body
function, such as hormones

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.530
and other proteins.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.410
Professor Gelles also
showed you this picture,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.090
and as he was
explaining, his work--

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.730
and the work he does with
RNA, and telling you--

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.120
and RNA polymerase, and telling
you that all the mechanisms

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.010
that I showed you before work
in all different cell types

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.600
the same--

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.480
set me up for my journey today.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.250
I want to go down
a different path.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.530
I want to ask the
questions, what

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.400
makes these cells
different given

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.430
that they do have all
the same DNA and all

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.150
the same transcription and
translation of processes?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.660
How come, then,
they are different?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.610
And they all arise, of
course, from the same stem

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.520
cells with the same
genetic information.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.150
And remember, each one of
us, as we are sitting here,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
is a former stem cell.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.430
So the answer to the question
why we have different cells--

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.350
one is a muscle cell,
and one is a blood cell,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.120
and one is a kidney cell--

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.310
is that while every cell
has the same potential due

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.690
to their genetics-- potential
in expression and forming

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.370
proteins--

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.000
every cell activates
different genes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.030
So your DNA is basically
little compartments

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.560
which are the genes that
then can be translated

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.630
into different proteins.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
And not every cell
reads the entire genome.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.350
In fact, no cell reads
the entire genome.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.020
Every cell decides
which of the genes

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.370
are necessary to produce
the cell, the protein, that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.940
makes the cell the cell and
its particular function.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.120
Now, I'm interested
in the mechanism

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.590
that makes this possible.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.740
And that is basically
epigenetics.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.720
So what is epigenetics?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.510
Epigenetics is a mechanism that
shuts on and off these genes

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.430
in the different cell types.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.780
And epigenetics uses
three different mechanisms

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.190
to do this.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.270
One is DNA methylation, which
is possibly the best known

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.080
epigenetic mechanism, which
is essentially just adding

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.820
something-- an adduct--

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.080
onto the DNA.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.650
And that also explains the
name "epigenetics," "epi-"

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.100
meaning above, on
top of, the DNA--

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.710
an additional layer
of information

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.810
on the DNA that tells the DNA
whether it's active or passive.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.580
And in addition to this
DNA methylation-- which

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.019
is basically adding methylation
groups to certain parts

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.390
of the DNA, depending
on whether you

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.240
want to silence it by
adding a methyl group,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.610
or activating it by not
adding this blockade.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.790
In addition, there's also
the chromatin structure

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.540
of your DNA, which
basically means--

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.050
you all know that the DNA is
an incredibly long molecule,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.870
but it has to fit into this
unbelievably tiny cell.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.260
So it's curled up.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.270
And this curling up,
if it's really dense,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.770
this messenger RNA Professor
Gelles told you about last week

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:01.030
cannot get there and do the
transcription and then go

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.520
on to do the translation
and the protein.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.120
So depending on how
it's curled up--

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.880
we call this the
chromatin structure--

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.910
it is possible to read
these genes or not.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.260
And then also, curling them
around the histone molecules

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.070
in your cell also
allows, potentially,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.950
whether these genes are
going to be read or not.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.550
The third mechanism
was only later

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.160
added to the understanding
of epigenetics,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.300
and that is microRNAs.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.360
MicroRNAs also
contribute to being

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.510
able to read this
information on the DNA.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.130
So what the microRNA does
is, it potentially binds

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.740
to messenger RNA and therefore
blocks the translation process,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.790
so the protein is not created.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.240
So we have DNA methylation,
chromatin and histone

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.060
modification, and
microRNAs as to the three

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.450
fundamental functions
in epigenetics.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.120
By far the best studied
is DNA methylation,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.310
and most of what I'm
going to talk about today

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.470
is about DNA methylation.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.740
DNA methylation is the
most stable mechanism.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.400
First of all, it is more
like the long-term mechanism,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.570
whereas the chromatin structure
can change very quickly

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.570
and the microRNAs can too.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.940
The other thing is that it
is just easier to study,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.460
because it is stable
in samples that we all

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.550
have in our refrigerators
or freezers.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.220
So that's why a
lot more insights

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.010
have been accomplished in the
context of DNA methylation.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.900
And this is just a simple graph
on how DNA methylation works.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.240
So if you have methylation,
which is signified here

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.050
by these solid lollipops, in
certain regions of your DNA,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.300
then the gene
expression is repressed,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.180
and your gene is not
expressed and not translated

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.600
into a protein.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.350
But if you don't have
this methylation,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.350
if your DNA area
is unmethylated,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.120
then you have
expression, and the gene

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.560
is basically used in that cell.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.710
So now we have genetics
and epigenetics.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.460
So how do they relate?

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.810
So we have the
genetics, the DNA,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.460
and for those of you
who have done 23andMe,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.240
you get a result
about your genetics,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.520
but there's very little
you can do about it.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.250
You have your genes,
and that's it.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.810
Epigenetics is
much more dynamic.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.790
It does enable the
genetics to be used

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.760
or to be silenced
with the mechanisms

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.440
that I just told you about.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.560
So epigenetics is
something much more dynamic

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.370
and also opens up new
opportunities for us

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.170
for disease prevention,
as I'm going to allude to,

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.410
and also how we deal as a result
and response of the environment

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.160
we are exposed to.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.620
Let me give you a few
examples to illustrate

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.930
the importance of epigenetics.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.190
Butterfly development-- three
different developmental stages,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.690
same genome, different
what we call phenotype.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.240
It looks different.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.630
And this is enabled
by epigenetics.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.750
Another example from
the animal world,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.420
the so-called jumping ant.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.870
Just like the bees, they
have a queen and worker ants.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.409
The queen is large,
only reproduces,

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.760
and has low brain function.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.580
Don't need much brain
for reproduction.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.220
Whereas the worker
ants have to be smart,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.410
because they keep the
whole thing going,

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.080
maintaining the colony,
but they do not reproduce.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.260
Now, what happens
when the queen bee--

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.470
the queen ant, that is-- dies?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.940
So if the queen dies, the
workers fight for the throne.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:06.720
And the winner
upregulates some genes--

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.510
in particular,
telomerase and SIRT1,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.620
which are longevity
genes, because the queen

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.760
has about 10 times the
lifespan of the worker ants.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.530
Now, what does that tell you?

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.115
All these ants have the same
genome, but they're able to up-

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:30.360
or downregulate some of their
genes depending on their needs.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.660
And so a worker can
become queen just

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.210
by upregulating some genes--

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.220
and also downregulating,
again, brain

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.200
function, upregulating
reproductive function.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.530
So these are some of the
wonders of the animal world--

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.720
all epigenetic phenomena.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.540
And finally, the well-known
queen bee from the honey bees.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.320
Also here, we have queen
bee and worker bees,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.510
but here it's a
little bit different,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.980
because it depends on the diet
now, which is very interesting.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.480
They all have the same genome,
again, but in the larva stage,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.950
it depends what food you get.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.710
Do you get the royal
jelly or the worker jelly?

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.740
And if you get the royal
jelly, you become a queen,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.370
but if you get the worker
jelly, you become a worker.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.530
Again, the queen-- bigger,
much longer lifespan,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.400
only reproduces, not
much brain function.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.770
Very similar to the ants.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:35.920
All of this due to the
effect of the diet.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.220
And a very different
example now.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.290
You may have noticed
that it's become pretty

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.110
quiet in the area of cloning.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.610
You know, there
was a lot of talk

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.740
about cloning some
time ago, and Dolly

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.950
the sheep was a little clone.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.340
And then Dolly didn't make it,
because Dolly died prematurely.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.990
So not much has happened
since in cloning,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.100
due to the fact that the
cloning researchers realized

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.100
that there was one thing that
they couldn't accomplish.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.740
While they could
faithfully copy the genome,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.020
they were unable to
copy the epigenome.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.150
It is due to the failure to
faithfully copy the epigenome

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.750
that we cannot clone--

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.290
at least so far.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.740
So epigenetics has moved
much into the public eye,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.850
as you can see here.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.520
"Why Your DNA
Isn't Your Destiny.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.950
The new science of
epigenetics reveals

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.120
how the choices you make
can change your genes--

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.320
and those of your kids."

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.810
And I will come back
to that in a minute.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:48.080
But it has become sort of
a more common interest area

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.240
to think about epigenetics
and not only about genetics.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.440
Now, why is that?

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.410
Because we are,
with our epigenome,

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.200
responding to the environment.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.580
What we eat can potentially
influence our epigenome--

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.230
the histone modification, the
DNA methylation, the microRNAs.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.690
And that is in fundamental
difference to genetics.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.080
Genetics doesn't change-- unless
you have a mutation, which

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.760
happens very rarely.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.620
Epigenetics changes as a result
of the environment we live in--

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.700
not only what we eat,
but many other things.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.050
Whether you smoke is one of
the most potential challenges

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.460
to your epigenome.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.110
Smokers have a substantially
altered epigenome.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.830
Other things, whether
it's exercise,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:48.890
taking drugs, social
interactions, air pollution,

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.740
viruses, or the microbiome--

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.930
all of those are
influencing our epi genome.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.830
Why is that so important?

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:05.930
Because an aberrant epigenome
predispose you to disease.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.630
And many diseases
have been associated

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.310
with a malfunctioning
epigenome--

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.940
most well known
and best studied,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.000
cancer, but it is
becoming apparent

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.180
that many other
diseases are associated

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.330
with a malfunctioning epigenome.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.090
So given that we
have this plasticity

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.630
to adjust our epigenome
to the environment,

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:36.800
and given that the epigenome
is associated with disease

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.770
probability, I think
it is very important

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:44.540
to understand the epigenome
as well as we could.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.500
Now let's go back to the basics.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.530
To understand
epigenetics, we have

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.900
to understand how it works.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.650
And I just went to the internet,
and I put in "epigenetics,"

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.080
and I looked up the first
definition that came up.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.130
And this is what came up.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.510
"The term epigenetics refers
to the heritable change

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.870
in gene expression
that does not involve

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.240
changes in the
underlying DNA sequence."

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.790
Now, the word "heritable"
here is extremely important

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.960
because it has led to
a lot of confusion.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.120
This definition is not correct.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.150
It's not incorrect, but it's so
imprecise that it is confusing.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.330
So the definition should
say, "the mitotically

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.200
heritable variation."

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.060
And "mitotically"
means cell division.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.280
So what I'm trying to
say is that epigenetics,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.460
when it is connected
with the word "heritable"

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.010
means from one cell to
the next in your body.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.250
The muscle cell wants
to stay a muscle cell.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.080
And as the cells and
the muscle cells divide,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.460
the epigenome stays the same.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.280
It is faithfully produced
within the muscle cell,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.300
because the muscle
cell does not want

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.580
to become the kidney cells.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.080
Of course, the stem
cell researchers

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.955
want the muscle cell to
become a kidney cell,

00:15:10.955 --> 00:15:12.580
but that's a different topic.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.620
For your body to
function properly,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.020
your muscle cell has to
stay the muscle cell.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.240
And that's where the word
"heritable" is justified.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.070
But carry that outside,
lose the word "mitotic"--

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.420
people think of "heritable"
from one generation to the next,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.190
mother to the child.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.280
And that is what I
am interested in.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.220
Is that actually
the case, that we

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.300
are inheriting an
aberrant epigenome that

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.000
resulted from us smoking
to our children, or not?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.130
When I said to some
people I was going

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.580
to give the talk "Is Epigenetics
Heritable," they said to me,

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.450
what's the question?

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.470
Of course it is-- isn't it?

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.640
That is because people think
of "heritable," from one

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.270
generation to the next.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.440
So the current field
of epigenetics,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.060
within and outside,
is completely confused

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.680
by this word, because it is
never used, or rarely used,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.269
precisely.

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:16.560
Whenever I go to a conference
and people use this word,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.100
I get up and I say,
"mitotically, yes?"

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.230
Because people forget
to insert this word.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.930
Now, when is our epigenome set?

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:33.030
Our epigenome is determined very
early on, which makes sense,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.840
because the muscle cell needs to
know early that it is a muscle

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.060
cell, and the kidney
cell needs to know early

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.070
that it is a kidney cell.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:47.400
So the epigenetic code
is set in the embryo,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.860
around the stage
of the blastocyst.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.320
Now you are sort of a
little advanced stem cell.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.320
But these cells that are
undifferentiated, meaning they

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.290
don't know their destiny
and their function yet--

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.280
they need to learn what
they are going to be.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.220
At that time, the genome
kicks in, is developed.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:07.940
Makes sense.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.940
So in utero.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.050
Now, interestingly-- so
what you see on this graph

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.310
is actually the male
and the female germline.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.000
So you inherit one gene from
Dad and one gene from Mom.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.980
The blue one is the
one you get from Dad,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.030
and the red one is the one
you get from your mother.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.800
And here you have
low methylation

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.940
and high methylation.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.970
As you can see here, in
this embryonic stage,

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.320
your initially
unmethylated genes--

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.290
some of them will
become methylated.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.560
And depending on what
the cell is going to be,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.760
the certain parts of the DNA
will be methylated or not.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.450
Now, what's interesting is
what happens before this.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.880
So here, the male
and female germline

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.510
come together during the
fertilization process.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.280
But in the actual sperm cell
and oocyte, as you can see here,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.200
there is what we call a round
of re- and demethylation.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.700
So what that means is,
your entire methylation is

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.530
completely wiped out.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.290
Then you establish another
round of methylation.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:30.150
And after fertilization,
bing, another complete wipeout

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.030
of the DNA methylation.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.810
So Mother Nature makes
you go through two

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:41.840
cycles of completely wiping
out your epigenetic memory.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.750
There must be a reason for that.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:50.930
Double insurance by evolution
that you're not inheriting

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:57.750
epigenetics information
from Mom or Pop.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:03.360
That's how I would interpret
what's going on here.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.510
Why otherwise would there
be a double wipeout?

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.340
So evolution, as
I see it, does not

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.930
plan for transgenerational
inheritance of the epigenome.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.250
So you would not suffer from
the fact that mom has smoked

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.310
or grandma has smoked, but
the record is set straight

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.540
and you have a new start.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:33.390
So if it is there, if
transgenerational inheritance

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.170
of the epigenetic
information happens,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.820
it would require that the
epigenetic information is not

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.070
completely wiped out.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.210
So incomplete erasure of
these epigenetic marks--

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.220
that would be required for
transgenerational inheritance

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.790
off the epigenome
if it then exists.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.356
So if it does exist, the other
question is, is it permissive?

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:02.730
So is it sort of
planned for that

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.650
not everything is wiped out?

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.180
Or is it an error?

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.860
Is it a mistake?

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.640
That's big questions.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.190
And I'm not claiming
to have the answers,

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.790
but I'm going to show you
some other data that we have.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.680
This is actually a
very famous experiment.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:29.460
So this is an experiment that
caused a lot of news articles.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.240
So we have what we
call an agouti mouse.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.400
That's a certain
subtype of mouse.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.700
And you can see that the agouti
mouse has a light coat color,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.460
and it's a fat mouse.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.860
So depending on what you feed
this mouse during pregnancy--

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.180
so mother being pregnant--

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.810
the mother may have different
distribution of offspring.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:04.330
So this is two potential
examples of offspring.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.840
If you feed the mother
during pregnancy a diet that

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.060
is very rich in methyl donors--

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.150
and you may remember DNA
methylation, the methyl groups

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.890
going on the DNA--

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.010
so you must have these methyl
groups to go on the DNA.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.930
And they come from somewhere.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:25.930
And diet-- in particular,
folic acid, methionine,

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.950
cytosine-- they provide these
methyl groups with your diet.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.710
Now, if you have lots of
them, you can use them,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.140
and they can go in your DNA.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.360
So this mother was fed a
lot of these methyl donors,

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:47.290
and then she had offspring that
had very few representatives

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:53.500
of the fat agouti trait
with a light fur color,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.850
whereas more offspring
with brown color.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.080
If she was fed a regular
diet low in methyl donors,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.470
she had more of the
agouti offspring.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.390
So what happened here?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.970
Well lots of methyl
groups, like the mother

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.340
that has lots of the
brown agouti offspring,

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.210
silences the agouti gene.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.940
Methylation, silencing.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.610
Agouti, yellow,
cannot be expressed.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.710
Now, hypomethylation, meaning
no blockage of the agouti,

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.680
agouti's expressed--
more of the yellow ones.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.550
So here is the
distribution of the two.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.010
So this was a
revolutionary experiment,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.290
because it showed
it does matter what

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.590
the mother eats for the
phenotype of the offspring.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.610
Plus, it was shown it's
actually epigenetic.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.360
It's a methylation effect.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.410
Now, my question
to you is, now, is

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.860
this transgenerational
inheritance

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.770
of epigenetics or not?

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.010
Yes or no?

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.695
Is it?

00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:07.195
Is it not?

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.180
Well, I would say no.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.390
What it is is simply
intrauterine exposure.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:26.840
These mice were,
in utero, exposed

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.650
to whatever the mother eats.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.690
And as a result, it changed
the genome of the offspring.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.750
We don't know anything about
the epigenome of the mother.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.390
It changed the epigenome
of the offspring.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.670
I mean, I'm not saying it is not
completely impossible that it

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.270
is transgenerational
inheritance,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:53.360
but my primary guess it's a
simple intrauterine exposure

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.070
to diet of the
mother that changed

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.770
the epigenome of the child.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:03.200
And there's probably no
inheritance going on here.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.530
So the induced
DNA methylation is

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.040
a result of the maternal diet.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.070
OK, let's talk about
some other examples--

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.790
identical twins.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:20.500
Epidemiologists love
identical twins to study--

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:27.440
in particular, those who
are discordant for disease

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.970
later in life.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.910
Why, if the two have identical
genome, why does one of them

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.540
develop cancer
and the other not?

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.450
Very interesting to
study identical twins,

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.510
because genetics cannot
be the explanation.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.920
Now, can it be epigenetics?

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.350
Well, I think it could
be a variety of things.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.290
First of all, it
starts in utero.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:59.300
Oftentimes, identical twins have
very different birth weight,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.300
because they have
very different room.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.260
So one has better room to grow,
the other one's very small.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.690
So already, in utero, the
conditions are different.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.960
And birth weight is
a very good predictor

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.830
of chronic disease risk
60, 70 years later.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.750
So that's one thing.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.440
The other thing is, all
these lifestyle factors that

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.380
happen between birth and
adulthood, of course,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.730
could contribute.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.250
And if these twins
are reared apart,

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.250
they're even more different.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:39.140
Nevertheless, it is important
to note that identical twins,

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.170
as they are born, they
have a very similar

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.130
epigenetic profile.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:50.270
But as they grow older, this
epigenetic profile grows apart.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.550
So they develop further
and further apart

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.380
in their epigenetic
profile, so there

00:25:54.380 --> 00:26:00.620
could be some epigenetic
mechanism in this disease

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.900
discordance of the
identical twins.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.560
Again, is that
transgenerational inheritance?

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.390
Probably not.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.850
There is a whole
field of research

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.110
that's called developmental
origins of health and disease

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:24.550
and that basically talks about
the intrauterine reprogramming

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.980
of propensity to disease.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.520
So what you have here is,
during a critical period

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.510
of development, you have
a transient environmental

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.830
stimulus.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.300
And a very good example of
this is much-studied famines.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.630
There are natural
and less natural

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.960
famines that occur
throughout the world

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.050
and that have led
to malnutrition

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.050
of the mother, which is
a transient environmental

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.340
stimulus.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.610
But the offspring has
been shown to have

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:01.750
permanent long-term damage,
ranging from obesity

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.190
to psychiatric diseases
and other chronic diseases.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.160
Again, people have
talked about, what

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.650
are the mechanisms
for these findings?

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.020
And we are still
talking about this,

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.520
because we still
haven't understood

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.320
what the mechanisms are.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.230
One prime candidate
is epigenetics.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.830
And it could very
well be epigenetics,

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:29.210
but it may not be, again,
transgenerational inheritance,

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.720
but simply intrauterine
exposures that

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.320
may have changed the
epigenetics of the offspring.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.870
So I think we really
have to differentiate

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:41.480
between the
intrauterine exposure

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.940
versus the transgenerational
inheritance,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.670
and there is unbelievable
confusion about that

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.800
in the scientific community.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.050
So I'm going to show
you three scenarios.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.860
One scenario is, you have
an intrauterine exposure

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.060
to a stressor, due to whatever
happens to you in utero--

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.690
behavior of the mother
or something else--

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.730
that leads, via mechanisms
that we don't understand well,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.280
to a particular
phenotype or disease.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.020
The other scenario is that
the same exposure indeed

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.870
does lead to an
epigenetic modification,

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:22.490
like in the agouti mouse, that
then changes the phenotype,

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.610
like the light fur color.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.430
Now, what I'm interested
in figuring out

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.090
is the transgenerational
inheritance.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.990
That would start with an
epigenetic modification that

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:44.160
would then be inherited to
the next or next-after-next

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.270
generation and then cause
a difference in phenotype.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.610
And this epigenetic
modification is probably

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.890
the result of some
exposure that we undergo.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.350
So these are different
scenarios that we

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.830
have to distinguish between,
but they are completely confused

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.020
in the scientific literature.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.020
OK, which scenario of the three
I just showed you is this?

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.140
Grandmother smokes,
obesity in the grandchild.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.480
We find this in
epidemiologic studies.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.160
Is this transgenerational
inheritance, necessarily?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.790
Well, remember, I
added a generation now.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.340
It's not mom, it's grandma.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.700
I added a generation.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.430
I'm sorry?

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.730
- Grandma lives at home.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:31.340
- Yes, yes.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.420
OK.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.740
I should have been more concrete
in saying grandmother smokes

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.525
during pregnancy with daughter,
and granddaughter has obesity.

00:29:40.525 --> 00:29:45.140
- But also, the eggs that the
child's going to come out of

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.460
were all developed while--

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.920
- You got it.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.500
Thank you.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.530
What happens is,
grandmother smokes,

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.930
so that's the first generation.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.910
Second generation is the fetus.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.600
But the fetus already carries
the reproductive cells

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.560
for the grandchild.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:09.130
So you already damage
the reproductive cells

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.500
for the third generation.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.400
So even with three
generations, we cannot prove

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.890
transgenerational inheritance,
because it can still be

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:22.700
intrauterine exposure.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.150
So this is only true
for females, though.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.920
For male germline,
we really only need

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.110
two generations,
because as you know,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.840
sperm's produced
nearly all the time.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.840
OK

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:44.560
So intrauterine exposure
along the female germline

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.310
can reach three generations,
for the male germline

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.810
can reach two.

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:55.270
To prove transgenerational
inheritance,

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.410
you would need four generations
along the female germline

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.530
and three along
the male germline.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.340
And don't get me wrong--

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.680
I'm not saying this could not
be transgenerational inheritance

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.850
along this line.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.380
I'm just saying to prove
that it is, you need this.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.450
This is very hard to get.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:21.730
When you do this in
humans, it would certainly

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.070
exceed the lifetime
of one researcher.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:31.180
So to do a study like this is
very difficult to do in humans.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.590
You can do it,
potentially, in mice.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.800
OK, so the question
comes back to,

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.300
is there incomplete
erasure of the epigenome?

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.290
I looked a little bit
into the literature.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.040
I'm just going to give you
three quick examples from what's

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.240
published in the literature.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.990
You can already see
"transgenerational" is

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.500
in the headline
here of this paper.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.020
"Epigenetic information
can be inherited

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.170
through the mammalian
germline and represents

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.720
a plausible
transgenerational carrier

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.090
of environmental information."

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.960
So they are out to prove the
transgenerational inheritance

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.490
of epigenetics.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.150
What do they do?

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.170
Well, they exposed the
paternal animal here

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.750
to a low-protein
diet, and then they

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.390
found, in the next generation
that there was a difference

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.020
in DNA methylation.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.350
Is there anything
transgenerational?

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.920
Not in the sense we
just established it.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.980
There's absolutely no proof for
transgenerational inheritance.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.680
It's pure intrauterine exposure.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.650
Yet these authors
conclude, "these results,

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.010
in conjunction with recent
human epidemiological data,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.670
indicate that parental diet can
affect cholesterol and lipid

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.960
metabolism in offspring,
and define a model system

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.570
to study environmental
reprogramming

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.340
of the heritable epigenome."

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.570
There is no heritable
epigenome here.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.160
Nothing whatsoever.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.810
Next paper.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.800
This paper caused
a lot of attention.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.940
So what the investigators
here did is, they used--

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.650
basically, they used a model
of associating a certain smell

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.040
with trauma, and looked
whether also they

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.780
could find this in
the next generation.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.870
So if they exposed the next
generation to the same smell,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.900
did they express fear?

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.460
So they did these experiments.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.390
In F1, they exposed,
basically, the sperm.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.940
They did an IVF conception.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.990
But they did absolutely
no epigenetic experiments

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.490
whatsoever in this paper.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.030
But they concluded that these
transgenerational effects are

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.810
inherited via parental gametes.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.820
"Our findings
provide a framework

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.866
for addressing how environmental
information may be inherited

00:34:02.866 --> 00:34:07.320
transgenerationally at
behavioral, neuroanatomical,

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.980
and epigenetic levels."

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.920
They did absolutely
no epigenetics.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.889
So this happens all the time.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.110
And there is just
a third example

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.000
where they did exactly
the same thing.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.570
"Epigenetic germline
inheritance" is in the title.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:23.830
They did an experiment.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.840
There was no
epigenetics done at all,

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.480
yet "epigenetics"
is in the title.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.050
At this point, I got so annoyed,
I wrote a letter to the editor.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.270
After all, this is
Nature Genetics,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.610
which is, like, the paper
everybody wants to publish in.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:41.980
And I say, like, what
is it with you editors?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.270
And they say, we
are not interested.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.120
Basically, you
publish your paper

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.145
better if it has "epigenetics"
in the title, as we know.

00:34:54.145 --> 00:34:56.020
This is how you get your
grants, your tenure,

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.310
and your papers published.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.010
OK.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.570
So far so good.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.420
We haven't found anything
that is transgenerationally

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.480
inherited.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.320
Now, I'm going to give
you the one example where

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.790
I'm convinced that there is
transgenerational inheritance,

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.280
which is genomic imprinting.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.120
Let me introduce you
to genomic imprinting.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.010
We have some interesting
subgroup of genes--

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.150
very few-- that do not
follow the normal pattern.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.960
Normally, you get Mom's
allele, Pop's allele,

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.710
and you express them both
or you silence them both.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.540
They both do the same thing.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:45.360
Now, the imprinted genes
are a little different,

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.870
because only one
allele is expressed--

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:52.290
either the father's
or the mother's.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.530
The best known
imprinted gene is IGF2.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.580
IGF2 is the most important
intrauterine growth gene.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.370
It is very important for
the growth of the fetus--

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.490
makes the fetus big or not.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.190
What's important about
these imprinted genes

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.330
is that they are
faithfully always expressed

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.000
from the same allele.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.230
So IGF2, for example,
is only expressed

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.830
from the paternal chromosome,
from the paternal allele--

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.730
never from the mother's.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.630
And that is generation after
generation after generation

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.090
after generation.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.150
And you can ask--

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.970
and this is another
picture showing you

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.950
more of the mechanisms.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:45.730
You may ask, why do we
have genomic imprinting?

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.710
Well, there is the
Haig hypothesis.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:50.440
And I'm very honored that
Professor Haig actually

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.060
came himself.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.770
If I had a hypothesis
named after me,

00:36:54.770 --> 00:37:00.400
I would probably rest and
enjoy, but he's so prolific

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.860
that he prints out
his papers for me

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.160
and he writes a new
paper every day.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:05.910
It's unbelievable.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.070
Anyway, so Professor
Haig came up

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:14.110
with the following reason for
why genomic imprinting exists,

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.830
and I'm very impressed
by the theory

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.370
that he came up with, because I
think it makes a lot of sense.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:27.040
Remember, intrauterine growth--
and many of the imprinted genes

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.640
are actually responsible
for intrauterine growth.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.880
That means growth,
good for the baby,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.250
good for the
survival of the baby.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:43.140
The father, of course, has one
sole interest in reproduction--

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.061
passing on his genome.

00:37:47.061 --> 00:37:48.560
The father doesn't
know whether he's

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.720
going to get another
chance, so he's

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:57.480
going to put all his eggs in one
basket and make that baby big.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.870
OK

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:03.910
The mother, of course,
knows she can have as many

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.047
as she wants anytime--
just go around the corner,

00:38:06.047 --> 00:38:06.880
you get another one.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.110
Right?

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:14.210
So she probably has 18 others
at home to take care of.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.830
So she needs to balance
the survival of that one

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:23.210
child versus her own survival,
to take care of the 18 others.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:27.020
And she can have
another 18 if she wants.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.660
So they have
different interests,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.870
so there is a conflict--
all of this very elegantly

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.830
explained by Professor
Haig in his work.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.110
There is this conflict,
where the mother has

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.450
a very different
interest than the father

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.470
in this evolutionary conflict.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:45.470
The father doesn't really
care about the mother.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:47.960
The father cares
about the genome.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.189
He doesn't care whether
the mother dies.

00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:51.230
So the bigger the better.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.390
So the mother shuts
off the growth genes,

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:54.890
the father shuts them on.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.590
And that is true for all these
intrauterine growth genes.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.980
The father shuts them
all on-- not only IGF2,

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.910
but there are others--

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:05.600
whereas the mother
shuts them all off.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.790
And that's the imprinted genes.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.620
But what's
fascinating-- of course,

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.500
fascinating in terms of an
evolutionary hypothesis--

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.828
what's fascinating besides
"why do we have this"

00:39:18.828 --> 00:39:26.670
is that this parent of origin,
the mother shutting them off,

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.180
the father turning them on for
many of these imprinted genes--

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.430
not all, but many--

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.110
is faithfully passed from
one to the next generation

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.710
and maintained.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.430
So this is the
one example that I

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:44.450
would accept as
transgenerational inheritance

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.120
of epigenetic information.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.100
We do not well understand
how it works, though.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.620
And that's something that
I'm extremely interested in.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.510
And Professor Haig has
some thoughts on this.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.470
I had some thoughts.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.350
We discussed this the other day.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.170
But I think the jury's
not out how this works.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:07.820
So there must be something--

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.850
some mechanisms-- that
obviously makes this possible.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.600
And to come back to
our graph, the one

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.840
thing I did not explain to you
previously is the black line.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.300
The black line are
the imprinted genes.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.750
And what you can see here
is that imprinting only

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.810
has one cycle of
demethylation, and it's

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.620
not it's not wiped out
again after fertilization.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.760
That already means something
in the context of evolution

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.000
in that the imprinted
genes seem to escape

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.260
some of this de- and
remethylation cycle.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:46.920
So in conclusion, we have
intrauterine exposures

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.510
that can affect our
phenotype many decades later.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.360
These intrauterine
exposures can impact

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.360
on the epigenome of the fetus.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.480
Whether epigenetics is one
of the mechanisms underlying

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.210
these intrauterine exposures
and how they relate

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.260
to phenotype or disease later in
life remains to be established.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.190
But we need to distinguish
between epigenetic changes

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.520
as a consequence of
intrauterine exposures

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.620
and transgenerational
inheritance

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.150
of epigenetic marks, which is
something totally different.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.200
So on the transgenerational
epigenetic inheritance,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.230
I think there is insufficient
evidence from human studies

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.600
to suggest that
there is such thing,

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.190
except for the imprinting.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.070
But on all the other
examples that I've shown you,

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.440
I'm not saying it's not there.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.380
I'm saying we don't
have evidence.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.770
The data from animal
studies is very limited.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.010
Most of the studies are
interpreted incorrectly,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:52.950
because there is confusion about
in much of the terminology.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:58.950
And to prove it, we need four
generations down the female

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:05.040
and three generations down the
male line, which is very, very

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.270
hard to do in humans.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.150
And even in animals,
it seems nobody

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.730
seems to bother to
do this, but still

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.000
claim that they have
transgenerational inheritance.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.530
So the exception is the
parent-of-origin mechanism

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:23.220
of imprinting, which
I would completely

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.040
subscribe to as
transgenerational inheritance

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.720
of epigenetic information.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.320
But we do not well understand
how this actually works.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.450
There must be some
memory that always

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.750
tells the paternal
allele to be turned on

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.240
and the maternal
allele to be shut off.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.950
So once we understand
that better,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.980
maybe we also understand
the entire transgenerational

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.440
inheritance better.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:51.930
So for the future, I think
we need to understand better

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.560
the evolution of imprinting
and epigenetics-- and that is,

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.590
of course, much of what
Professor Haig also deals

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.960
with--

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.260
design the perfect human and
animal studies to actually show

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.040
transgenerational epigenetic
inheritance; consolidate

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.000
the existing evidence better;
and also, for some of the other

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.510
marks that I have not
talked about today,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.720
they, of course, also
play into this question.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.210
Now, finally, what if
epigenetics is inherited?

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.990
We are probably
at the worst stage

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.560
of our evolutionary development.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.990
So if all the bad traits
that we have been managed

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.490
to include our lifestyle,
et cetera-- if all of this

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:47.140
is leaving marks in the
epigenome, which is then

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.070
transmitted to the
next generation--

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.170
is that actually a good idea?

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.330
And where is this
going to lead us?

00:43:55.330 --> 00:44:01.420
Well, maybe not everything
is in the epigenome.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:10.980
And I always tell people
that while epigenetics

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.790
is very fashionable
to do and to research,

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.530
the answer is not always
in the epigenetics.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:22.490
But it is oftentimes used as
an explanation when we don't

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.870
understand what's going on.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.680
So I hope I was able to give
you a little introduction

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.560
into the world of
epigenetics and why I'm here

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.790
and what I'm interested in.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.590
And I thank you
for your attention.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.540
