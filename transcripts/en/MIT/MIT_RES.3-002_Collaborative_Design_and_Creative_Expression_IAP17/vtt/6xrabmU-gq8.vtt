00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:16.728
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
So we also tried

00:00:16.728 --> 00:00:18.930
to learn how to use processing.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.963
It's pretty bare-bones,
but I guess--

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:26.241
so essentially, we have a
little widget and punch.

00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:26.740
Oh.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.610
So the set size right
now is set to eight.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.740
Originally, we wanted to be
able to remotely control it.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.094
So that's one count, and I'll
do two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:41.760
GUEST SPEAKER 2: You
can see that you've

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.805
set set size to eight.

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:46.409
So it'll stop when it's
eight, and then it'll recount.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.950
We also have this thing that we
labeled "Temple" because it's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.720
related to our game.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.700
But it actually correlates
with how fast you're punching.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.950
So if we smooth this
out, this is actually

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.638
telling you how fast you're
punching for each one.

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.090
Yeah-- and then this to average.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Average
set speed is pretty much

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.010
the eight different
punches that you

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.890
have divided by the
total amount of time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.360
to do those eight punches.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.264
So I can do my next set and be
like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:17.240
And then we'll be on
set two or set three.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.480
So it's pretty basic
right now, but there's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.050
a lot of different features
that we could add with the gyro

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.370
if we had more time.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.090
And if you have two hands,
then they could communicate.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.444
Maybe we can show the game.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:32.360
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.193
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.060
So we have to
actually upload that.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.690
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So
some other thing--

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
GUEST SPEAKER 1: This is
"Smoke on the Water," the song

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.070
that you're supposed to play.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.552
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So it plays
the song for you first.

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:47.680
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And now
it'll say, your turn.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.629
And that's just the first part,
which is like, bum, bum, bum.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.320
So it'll be like, mm, mm, mm.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.987
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:56.986
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Got it.

00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:57.490
Yeah.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.070
So yeah, it said, "Good job."

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.566
And then now it's the second
part, so you punch that beat.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.398
GUEST SPEAKER 1: But
it's hard to hear.

00:02:04.398 --> 00:02:06.170
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.670
OK.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.110
Yeah, you got it.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.789
And then it goes on
to the next part.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.770
And then basically, you cycle
through the different parts.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.644
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I think
that's the part when it breaks.

00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:17.861
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So ideally,
if we could actually

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:19.902
play the music on something
better than a buzzer,

00:02:19.902 --> 00:02:21.746
I think it'd be a lot better.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:24.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.304 --> 00:02:25.220
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.249
But it was definitely
a really nice project

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.290
to learn how to use a
bunch of different sensors.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.790
We also had a
heart rate monitor,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.490
which was able to
get beats per minute,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.160
but it was pretty inaccurate.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.830
But it was nice to
learn to set it up.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.527
We had an RFID sensor.

00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:40.860
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah, the LEDs.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.235
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
And we have LEDs

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:46.816
that depending on how hard you
punch, a certain amount of them

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:47.460
got lit up.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.480
We just took them out, and
it was a free, fluid project

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.120
in terms of a good
beginner learning project.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.947
But yeah, I think this is a
good example of a wearable

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.030
and how you can embed a
bunch of different sensors

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.884
to get different features.

00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:02.800
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.150
[APPLAUSE]
