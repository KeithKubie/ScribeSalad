WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.390
Sentence.
So if he doesn't get elected,

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:07.980
do you think he goes and starts a podcast TV network he took?
Totally could.
Yeah.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.440
He totally could probably be better for him,
honestly.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.300
That's what he thought he was going to do.
I think before he got elected,

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.370
I think he was having high level meetings with people in the media space to

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.280
start something like that.
Well,
once NBC fired them,

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.030
NBC fired and while he was running because of stuff that he said about Mexico

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.860
and the throw rapist,
like someone's doing the raping,
right?
Too late talk.

9
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.660
This is so fucking crazy out of control for a person running for president and

10
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:34.260
NBC is like,
that's it.
We're getting rid of you.

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.780
And then they put Arnold in his place and that was a disaster.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.990
Do you remember that people forgot Arnold hosted the apprentice.
You're fired.

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.530
Yeah.
That was,
oh,
that was horrible.
It was terrible.
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.520
Trump was shitting on them.
They did.

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.060
They just scrapped the show after that.
Yeah,
of course.
Here's a question.

16
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.480
Does he go back to the apprentice after?
Well,

17
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.880
if NBC presidency,
I think he's too toxic now.

18
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:00.240
I think some way to toxin toxic.

19
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.720
Maybe you could come up with something like that for Fox.

20
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.420
Oh Fox is in this scoop him up.
That's what's great about Fox.
They'll play ball.

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.990
I'll play ball.
They're not going to leave money on the table.

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.450
You know what though?
They did want Megan Kelly back to like,

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.410
well she did a thing.
I'd used to do the show red eye on Fox News,

24
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.390
which was comics would just try to be funny.

25
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.100
They aired it at like 3:00 AM east coast time and I saw her the week she was

26
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.460
doing that and she was in like the dressing room and she knew she shouldn't have

27
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.020
left.
She can feel it.

28
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.620
She had already made the decision but you could kind of see it in her face that

29
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:36.030
I think she knew that she was going to try to be this daytime TV queen and like

30
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.380
let's bake cupcakes.
You know,

31
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
I just spent four years on Fox News talking about sanity and white,

32
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
but now let's bake cupcakes cause I'm,
I'm America's sweetheart.

33
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.110
That's never going to work.
Well,
it's weird when you publicly change your image,

34
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.290
it's insane.
Publicly changing your image.

35
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.130
Shoot her shirts or skirts got longer.
Oh yeah,
she covered her neck or yeah.

36
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.270
You know,
there's no more cleavage.
Every show was about sexual assault.

37
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.800
She was telling me every single show is about sexual assault.

38
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.030
I think she was trying to ingratiate herself in with the people that hated her,

39
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.900
which was like the New York media types,
the people that did not like her.

40
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.690
And then she was like [inaudible] even just about sexual assault.

41
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:17.520
Like one of them was a lady who fuck Matt Lauer and she knew she was fucking him

42
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.230
and she was talking about a lot of Shit fucked him.

43
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.210
Well I didn't know any better.
I was 25

44
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.440
25 if fuck the guy,
you fuck what happened?
It's bad here.
Right?

45
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.270
Well he shouldn't have fucked it cause he was married.
Okay.
After that,

46
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
what happened?
What's going on?
Nothing.
You just fucked him.
Who he was.
What?

47
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860
Why is this a segment of a show?
Is it because it's scandalous?

48
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.940
Did an interview with her.
Yeah.
Great.
Yeah,
it was,
you know,
and she was saying,

49
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.240
you know,
I was young and I was impressionable,
which sure,

50
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.630
of course you're funny to see them all put nails in each other's coffins.

51
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.900
Isn't that great?
Media is like this blood feud.

52
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.150
There's only a few families that control all of this information.

53
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:57.660
They all hate each other.
That's why succession is such a great show.
Well,

54
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.260
I think with Megan it was like that.

55
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:02.460
She had been sexually harassed while she was at Fox News.
Oh,

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.100
he's going after I was at your house.
Yeah.
So she was going after,

57
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.560
and I think bill O'Reilly too.
I think there was some,

58
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.240
some insinuation 38 million.
So it's like,
what did he do?

59
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.080
I think it was 32 32 or 38

60
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.470
and my grants,
my grandfather still has a bill O'Reilly patriots welcome doormat.

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.470
Wow.
You know,
it's a good Matt.
I mean,

62
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.410
imagine that's a giant amount of money.

63
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.130
It's the amount of money where what he did should be.
I mean,

64
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.380
it seems like it's an,
it could be a Netflix documentary.
Let's got to be,

65
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.200
it's like horrific.
Like he offered her 37 million.
She's like,
no,

66
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.000
keep going.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right,
right.

67
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.030
I'm going to need more after what you did to me is a $32 million offense.

68
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.720
We'll do,
what's that one recording the left on some assistance.

69
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:57.110
Pantry in that chorus.
That woman?
Yeah.
Loofa sponge or something.

70
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.590
I mean that's his,
that's what he was trying to do.

71
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.630
That's how creepy old guy move.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
With a sponge.
10 interesting.

72
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.160
He tried to have his ex wife.

73
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:08.860
He tried to have his ex wife excommunicated from the church.

74
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.840
What grade did he,
oh,
he tried.
I mean know that why?
Well,

75
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:17.460
cause he wanted her to go to hell.
A church.
Catholic church.

76
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.470
What kind of donation you have to make to get your ex wife sent to hell?

77
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.920
Probably 32 million.
He's got it.
But he wanted her ex communicated.

78
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.090
That's type of guy.
He is.
But the crazy thing is,
even after all this,

79
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.520
the guys still had a number one book in The New York Times bestseller seller.

80
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.440
People dig in.
They still,
those old fuckers,
they just give in.
They dig in,

81
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.560
they don't care.
They like them.
They might know who he is.
Folksy.

82
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.020
He's liked by your uncle.
He's a good man.

83
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.060
He's spent spend $40 million for some woman.
He tortured.
The tide goes in,

84
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:49.420
the tide goes out.
I'm with God.
I'm with God.

85
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.990
That what he was doing that that fucking Todd goes in,
the tide goes out.

86
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.080
You can't explain it.
When I was like,
wow,
you went to Harvard,

87
00:04:56.081 --> 00:05:00.850
you fucking piece of shit.
Yeah.
Well you could explain that those guys are,

88
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.220
they were religion like a fuck.
It's fashionable to wear it.

89
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.100
They wear it.
They know.
Sure Trump doesn't.

90
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.720
He gets out and he goes,
I'm a Christian.
I may not be the best Christian,

91
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.320
but I'm a Christian.
Leadership caught enough.
It's good enough.

92
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.830
You know and you're like not the best Christian.

93
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
You're a thrice married guy who owns gambling and a Miss Universe pageant.

94
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.350
You're a biblical fit.

95
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:33.490
That's like a biblical figure that would be like a Roman king that everybody was

96
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.940
warned about.
Like in terms of like,
I mean,

97
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.770
I want him to shave his head.
What do you think that will do?
I just freedom.

98
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.890
I think it'd be funny if you shaved it like somebody had a cancer issue when he

99
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:48.490
just shaved it with them to be a good guy.
Well,
it doesn't look good.

100
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.190
That's what's confusing to me.
Like when I realized that as a style,

101
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.410
when my hair wasn't looking good,

102
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.360
[inaudible] rid of it was impossible to look good.

103
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:57.710
It was falling out to the point where like,
this is a mess.

104
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.650
Then I went and buzzed it.
But he,
uh,

105
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.560
I just remember you like this to my generation.
Always remembers.

106
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.670
You liked the gist of Harold [inaudible].
Yeah.
It's nice.
I've been,

107
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.290
I've been like this for a long time.
Yeah.
I'm solid.
Eight plus years bald.

108
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.660
How do you want Trump to just go?
Hmm.

109
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.240
I think you'd be better off.
It'd be easier.
Like he's not good looking.

110
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.790
Like he know that he would,

111
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.300
that would complete his transformation into a super villain,
I guess.

112
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:30.080
Like a Lex Luthor type go.
Yeah.
But just like,
I just,

113
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.100
it's gotta be so much work to put that hair together.

114
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.440
I think someone does it from,
but even then,

115
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:38.390
you've got to talk to them whether putting it together.

116
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.150
I bet you he doesn't talk to them.
Everything he does just tweets angry.

117
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.320
I bet you he's not concerned with the human relations with his staff.
No.

118
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.530
Let's just get that vibe and get that vibe.
I get that.
Five,

119
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.230
the person who's in charge of the hair just does the hair.

120
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.750
I hope he retired when he retires or when he's done.

121
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.430
I hope he goes right into podcasting.
Would you have them on right now?
Yes.
Yeah,

122
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:03.140
of course.
You have to.
You have to.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
For sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why not?

123
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.940
Why wouldn't he come on?
Uh,

124
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.990
[inaudible] he's busy and I had some jokes about him.

125
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.350
He's petty.
He hates comedy.
He does not like to be made fun of.

126
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.840
He doesn't like to be made fun of.
Yeah.
