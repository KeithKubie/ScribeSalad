00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.940
ANDRES: Good afternoon, and
welcome to our session--

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.440
Building a Business around
the Google Places API.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.290
My name is Andres, and I am with
the Google Maps developer

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.570
relations team.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.850
MARCELO: And I'm Marcelo with
the Places API team.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.410
ANDRES: So our session today is
broken up into two parts.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.660
In the first part, we're going
to do a conceptual overview.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.590
We're going to quickly walk
through the features of the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.680
Places API, and then we're also
going to talk about the

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.340
vision that we have for how
developers can build a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.090
business around the
Places API.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.430
And in the second part of the
session, we're actually going

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.510
to talk about the practical use
of features of the Places

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.470
API in building an application
that demonstrates how to build

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.720
a business.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.930
When Marcelo and I first began
to discuss the idea for this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.170
session, we knew that surfing
was going to be a natural fit.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.620
Marcelo and I are both surfers,
we've talked about

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.390
the use cases around
location based

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.840
applications and surfing.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.960
And so we quickly discovered
that this session would be a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.440
great opportunity to showcase
a surfing application.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.870
So we'll touch on this a little
bit later on, but keep

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.300
in mind that the theme for our
entire session is surfing.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.770
All right, so let's talk about
the Google Places API.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.900
As I mentioned, I'm going to
do a quick overview of the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.000
Places API--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.430
pretty much make sure that we're
all on the same page,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.800
and this is also for the benefit
of those folks out

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.880
there who may not be familiar
with the API.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.800
The API is accessible
in two ways.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.660
One, as a JavaScript library
that's part of the Google Maps

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.980
JavaScript API, and the other
way is as an HTTP-based web

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.320
service that accepts GET
and POST requests.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.080
Now both of these elements of
the API share some common

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.650
features and we'll touch on
these as we walk through the

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.890
application that we designed,
but I also want to touch on a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.940
couple of things that we
announced earlier today, and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.890
these are some features that
developers have been asking

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.480
for quite a bit.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.490
The first is the incorporation
of reviews, so you can now get

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.960
the top five reviews that are
associated with any given

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.510
place through the API, and this
is applicable to both the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.250
Library and the Web Service.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.000
We've also included paging, so
that you can now get results

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.220
in sets of 20, up to
a total of 60.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.810
And, lastly, we've included text
search, so this is more

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.400
of a natural type of a search
where you can use, for

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.150
example, "near" as a modifier,
so you can search for "pizza"

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.460
in New York City, or "coffee" in
Mountain View, California--

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460
those types of searches.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.330
And again, we'll come back to
that a little bit later on in

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.410
the session.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.580
It's also worth noting that the
Web Service also provides

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.740
some additional capabilities.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.510
We provide Place Reports, so
this is the ability to add or

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.060
delete a place, and this is
places that are specific to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.440
your application.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.960
You can do the same
with events.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.490
And, lastly, we offer a check-in
feature, which really

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.910
is more of a bump.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.380
It increases the signal, and
gives more prominence to the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.050
places where your users are
checking in, so these are all

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.300
relative to your application.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.600
The next thing I want to touch
on is the data that's

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.280
accessible as part of the
Google Places API.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.790
Now, we've touched
on this before.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.390
We have a lot of places that are
accessible as part of the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.630
places API.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.490
How many places?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.230
80 plus million places.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.900
We have global coverage,
it's quite significant.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.500
Marcelo, I snuck this photo in
here for your benefit, you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.326
want to tell folks
where this is?

00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:01.340
MARCELO: Oh yeah, it is a little
bit familiar to me.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.080
That's the beach of Ipanema,
in Rio, where I'm from.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.870
It's beautiful.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.700
ANDRES: Yeah.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.180
I was there about a month ago
for two days, but I made sure

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.830
that on one of those days I
went for a run, and got to

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.870
know some of the places
around there as well.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.829
So we've got places like
Ipanema, you can actually

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.300
access all different types
of places using the API.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.275
And this is great, so you can go
to a place, you can search

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:30.940
by proximity, you can see what's
around you, but in

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.670
addition to providing sort of
this base information, We also

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.530
have some extended details that
are associated with the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.800
places in our API, and this is
kind of what boils down to

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.270
providing intelligence
to your users.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.550
So we have things like
structured address

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.070
information, we have things
like ratings, I mentioned

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.310
reviews, we also have the
contact information, and much

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.880
more information about
all these places.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.870
So we have global coverage,
different types of places--

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.440
I think it's over 100 different
types of places,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.780
right, Marcelo?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.370
And extended details for
all these places.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.530
When I was preparing for this
session I figured it'd be good

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.340
to put together a demo, and so
I just sort of off the top of

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.810
my head started thinking about
different types of places that

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.320
I could search for
around the world.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.340
So the first place that I
searched for, of course, was

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.180
Rio de Janeiro.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.540
MARCELO: Thank you.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.040
ANDRES: Marcelo keeps raving
about how good the food is

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.585
back in Brazil and--

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:33.920
MARCELO: It is.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.310
ANDRES: --I have to agree, now
that I've been in Rio, that

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.812
that is the case.

00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:43.020
I spent a significant amount of
time in Portland, Oregon,

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.170
back in the day, as it were,
and so I figured I'd search

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.490
for bookstores because I
know there's a lot of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.940
bookstores in Portland.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.390
And I would be remiss if I
didn't mention Powell's City

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.620
of Books, which is a bookstore
that takes up about an entire

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.120
city block-- it's three
stories high.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.590
If you ever make it
to Portland, this

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.170
is a must see place.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.950
Gas stations in Tokyo,
you can see some

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.280
geographic patterns here.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.670
Of course there's not going to
be any gas stations in the

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.990
southern part, in Chiyoda,
in that precinct.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.470
I looked for schools in Bangkok,
and, lastly, I looked

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.180
for hotels in Cairo.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.260
I think you guys get
the idea, right?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.380
We have a lot of places around
the world, it's very

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.490
easy to find them.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.800
Next, I'm going to demo--

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.900
and this is a live demo, so at
the risk of doing a live

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.890
demo-- but I want to talk about
the autocomplete feature

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.210
and just how really neat
this feature can be.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.870
What we've done here is we've
provided just an input field

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.920
here, and we also have your
typical online address form

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.340
where all of the fields are
broken out into different

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.150
input boxes.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.100
By the way, who out there has
not ever entered address

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.610
information into a web page--
to an online form like this.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.970
All right.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.150
Who out there enjoyed it?

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.900
OK.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.900
All right, so it dawned
on me this morning--

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.520
as I was coming up to San
Francisco because I live down

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.120
in Mountain View-- it dawned
on me this morning that I

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.150
should really look up the
address for Moscone Center.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.000
I know the landmark--

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.880
I've been here many times-- but
it actually dawned on me I

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.030
don't know the address, so let's
search for the address.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.680
It's 580 Howard Street.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.590
And this is a predictive type
of a search, right?

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.580
So it's going to try
to guess what it is

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.350
that I'm looking for.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.350
So as I type in characters
you'll see that, OK, it's

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.840
thinking I'm looking for maybe
5800 Techni Center in Austin.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.150
Sounds like a cool place, but
that's not really what I'm

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.130
looking for.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.400
And as I advance, you'll see
that after seven characters

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.490
it's already sort of predicted
and found the place that I'm

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.840
looking for.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.170
And once I select that, I can
use the JavaScript library and

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.290
pre-populate those fields.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.560
So I mean, this is a really
neat feature, I think your

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.860
users will thank you time
and time again.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.930
And you're giving them,
essentially, access to all

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.185
these millions of places in
just a few keystrokes.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.720
But that's not really
it, right?

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.590
I mean, we need to talk a little
bit more about our

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.970
vision, right, Marcelo?

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.420
MARCELO: Yeah, that's correct.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.676
And it is a pleasure to be here
today to talk about the

00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:23.230
Places API, but since I first
learned-- let me introduce

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.780
myself again, before that.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.070
My name is Marcelo, and I'm
the lead engineer for the

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.020
Places API team in Sydney.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.180
And I want to tell you since I
first learned I would be here

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.030
at Google I/O to talk about
the Places API, I've been

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.020
looking forward to the
opportunity to talk about the

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.450
long term vision that our team
has for the product.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.530
It all starts with the
realization that technology is

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.030
really reshaping people's
behavior--

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.200
the way we shop, the way we
work, the way we communicate

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.790
with each other.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.660
And that's, of course, old
news when it comes to the

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.220
online aspects of our lives,
but also increasingly we're

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.740
seeing technology, especially
mobile, having an impact on

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.430
how we interact with the
physical world around us--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.140
in the way we learn about new
places, the way we discover

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.380
our surroundings, and also how
we make decisions about where

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.300
to go, and even about how to
spend our time and money.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.110
And we see that as an
opportunity to have a huge

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.250
impact for the good on people's
lives and to make

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.690
that at a real large scale.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.770
And that's our goal with the
Places API, but, of course,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.270
the challenge of realizing this
vision is much greater

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.290
than just Google, and that's
where developers

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.300
come into the picture.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.280
We know that it's going to take
a great amount of effort

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.240
and innovation, entrepreneurship
from both

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.920
small and big players to make
this vision come true.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.650
But we also know that this
kind of large scale

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.360
distributed efforts, they
usually tend to revolve around

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.110
ecosystems, and that's what the
Places API is all about.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:06.490
The Places API is about creating
the conditions and

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.320
the incentives for such
an ecosystem to

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.070
flourish and prosper.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.620
The API is a first step towards
enabling an ecosystem

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.130
of location based services
and applications.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.930
So that's our vision, right?

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.200
And based on this vision,
I want to touch on--

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.130
thank you--

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.400
I want to touch on four basic
principles that not only guide

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.280
our thinking when we designed
the Places API, but also

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.410
possibly relate it to creating
interesting location based

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.560
applications--

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.230
an application that'll make the
life of your users better.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.490
And that's how you want your
app to described if you're

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.350
trying to build a business
out of it.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.780
So the first principle is
a very fundamental one--

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.500
the specialists do it better.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.190
We believe that an app that is
highly specialized has a

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.920
better chance at meeting its
users expectations and needs

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.100
when compared to an app that
is a generic app--

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.560
one that tries to be everything
to everyone.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.870
The more specialized an app
is, the better it can

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.740
understand its user and its use
case, and the more insight

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.750
it can have on the data
that it's serving.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.170
And as I said, it's a very
fundamental principle and it

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.880
permeates this entire session.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.640
So principle number two--

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.570
the base data is not enough.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.950
And when I say this, I'm
actually trying to say the

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.400
Places API is not enough,
and I'll give you

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.090
two reasons for that.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.250
First, the Places API data is
generic by nature, by design,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.730
because it has to work for every
type of application that

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.700
you guys came up with.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.840
And the second reason--

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.100
and you have to keep that in
mind at all times-- is

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.450
whatever data your app is
getting out of the Places API

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.080
is easily accessible to
competing products.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.460
So if all your app's doing is
getting data out of the Places

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.517
API and passing it to your
users, you're not really

00:12:07.517 --> 00:12:10.360
differentiating your app
in terms of data in any

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.620
meaningful way.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.380
You're not really giving your
user a reason to stick to your

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.750
application instead of using
a competing product.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.630
So that's why you have to go
beyond the base data, you have

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.700
to try to differentiate
your application.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.620
And that takes us to principle
number three--

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.620
finding is greater
than searching.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.910
Always keep in mind, searching
is standing between your user

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.100
and what the task is trying
to accomplish.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.850
Search has a cost in terms
of the time and effort--

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.400
[? productive ?] effort-- for
your user, so you've got to

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.810
design your app in a way that
you're minimizing the time

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.120
that your user spends
searching.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.600
And in addition to paying close
attention to your UI and

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.670
automating as much as you can,
you also have to have a deep

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.850
understanding of your user's
intentions, a deep

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.660
understanding of your use case,
and a deep understanding

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.450
of the data-- of the
specialized data--

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.380
your app is serving.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.500
And that bring us back to,
again, principle number one--

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.480
the more specialized your
application is, the easier

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.670
time it's going to have to have
that kind of insight.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.420
And now before I go into
principle number four, let me

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.390
step back and look at the idea
of the ecosystem again.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:38.205
First, you have Google, who is
collecting and indexing all

00:13:38.205 --> 00:13:41.440
sorts of local data and making
the data easily available

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.280
through the Places API.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.240
Next, you have you--

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.250
developers--

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.620
creating great local apps that
consume data out of the Places

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:54.080
API, but also augmented with
your own specialized data that

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.380
you, also, yourself collect.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.520
Next, you've got users who use
those apps to go out in the

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.360
real world, explore, discover
new places, but also make

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.940
decisions, especially
purchase decisions.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.900
Who is missing from
this picture?

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.800
AUDIENCE: Merchants.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.870
MARCELO: Exactly.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.060
You, sir, are paying
attention.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.890
Merchants.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.560
Merchants are missing from this
picture, and that takes

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.350
us to principle number four--

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.650
merchants are a key part of the
ecosystem, and, again, I'm

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.110
going to give you two reasons.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:36.320
First merchants are a great
source of specialized data.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.320
They are the ultimate
specialists on their line of

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:44.980
business, and also on the
community their operating in,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.520
so they should be part of your
data crowdsourcing mix.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.500
The second reason is what is
it merchants want the most?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.690
Customers, exactly.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.620
So they want customers so they
can sell their products and

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.750
services, but who are
those customers?

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.760
Users.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.890
Very good.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.860
I mean, it's pretty
obvious, right?

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.560
Users, customers--

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.040
their customers are the users
of your application, so if

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.340
you're running a highly
specialized application,

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.860
they're going to be a really
good match between the

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.740
merchants and the users, so your
app will be sitting at a

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.060
really interesting spot between
merchants that are

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.910
trying to sell and consumers who
may be willing to buy if

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.710
well informed and
incentivized.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.040
And that's the reason why you
have to try to engage

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.440
merchants into your service,
that's the reason why

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.050
merchants are a key part
of the ecosystem.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.450
All right, so those are
the principles.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.230
Right, so now Andres and I are
going to go through the steps

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.810
of actually using those
principles and using the

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:59.340
Places API to try to build
an actual location based

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.090
application.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.150
Are you ready, man?

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.290
ANDRES: I'm ready.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.010
I'm ready.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:10.260
So as Marcelo mentioned--

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.760
or as I mentioned, I
guess, as well--

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.220
we're really keen on building
and designing a surfing

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.590
application that accommodates
all of these things, and with

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.280
that I think we should
gear up, right?

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.760
We should really take it
to the next level--

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.280
MARCELO: Let's do it.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.910
ANDRES: --and gear up for
building our application.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.160
MARCELO: I've been waiting
for this moment.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.970
ANDRES: I mean, you can't really
say you're going to

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.133
design a surf app if
you're not going

00:16:35.133 --> 00:16:36.383
to look like a surfer.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.300
MARCELO: You look good, man.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.310
ANDRES: All right.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.160
By the way, I wanted the
red shirt, but Marcelo

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.345
said he wanted it.

00:16:46.345 --> 00:16:48.390
MARCELO: So just before we go
into the key requirements, I

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.650
want to tell you why we've
chosen to build a surf app.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.860
So the reason number one-- we
wanted to build a specialized

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.660
app, right?

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.040
Lead by example.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.270
And although I wouldn't call
ourselves specialists in surf,

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.079
we're both surfers and we're
really at least a little bit

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.060
knowledgeable and really
passionate about the subject.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.099
The second reason is I wanted
to do something that is

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.450
outside of what you usually
think when you think of

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.750
location based applications.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.960
I didn't want to stick with
suggesting restaurants or

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.440
hotels, and I think surfing is
probably out of the comfort

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.540
zone for most people
here in this room.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.680
And, lastly, I wanted
to have fun.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.840
ANDRES: You did want
to have fun.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.210
And I will say, though, when I
put together my 100 plus page

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.550
requirements document--

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.325
and I think it included a lot of
features you quickly shot--

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:40.810
MARCELO: Well, we only
have twenty minutes.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:41.640
--a lot of them down.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.380
ANDRES: Yeah, I guess
so, I guess so.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.420
All right, so let's talk about
the key requirements, Marcelo.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.910
MARCELO: All right, so
requirement number one--

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.930
I want to allow my users to
find nearby surf shops--

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.420
sorry, surf spots--

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.850
I mean, that's the basic
functionality--

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.360
ANDRES: That's a no-brainer
for surfers.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:56.660
We need that.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.450
MARCELO: --for any location
based service, right?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.210
But that's not enough.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.230
Just knowing where the surf
spots are is not enough.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.410
As a surfer, I also want to know
what the surface looks

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:08.080
like right now, and in
the near future.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.630
So the second key requirement is
the ability to provide surf

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.575
reports and forecasts.

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:14.190
ANDRES: Of course.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.390
We don't want to head out there
if we know the surf spot

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.860
but we don't know what it's
going to be like, I mean it

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.500
could be a flat day.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.810
MARCELO: I mean, it does cost
money because you have to pay

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.130
for the gas, at least.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.920
But just the basic requirements
are not enough.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.300
Those will be enough for me to
go to a friend of mine, a

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.570
surfer, and show his app, I
wouldn't be embarrassed.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.220
But I want more than that, I
want to surprise my user, I

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.980
want to delight them, I want
them to actually be talking

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.040
about the application to
their friends, right?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.480
Because that's the best type
of marketing tool you can

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.530
have, so I want some magic.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.796
ANDRES: Where do you put it?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:50.550
MARCELO: I want some magic.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.090
ANDRES: During our design
meetings you want some magic.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.750
MARCELO: Are you happy
with that?

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.580
ANDRES: Almost.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.780
Almost, Marcelo.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.880
See, you always get to talk
about the fun stuff, but then

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.710
I have to bring things
back to reality--

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.740
MARCELO: [? You're my weed, ?]
man.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.070
ANDRES: --We need the profit,
we need to pay the bills at

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.010
the end of the day.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.490
MARCELO: Fair enough.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:11.200
ANDRES: We especially need to
build up that war chest for

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.270
that surf safari that we're
going to go on after we--

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.230
MARCELO: I'm sold.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.590
ANDRES: --After we finish
building this application.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.960
So profit is an important
part of it, as well.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.120
MARCELO: So right, how do you
make money out of this

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.600
application?

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.700
OK, so the first task is how do
you list nearby surf spots

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.850
using the Places API.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.460
So what I'm doing here
is I'm calling the

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.650
nearby search endpoint.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.710
And all I'm doing-- it's
really simple to

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.560
use, as you can see--

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.380
I'm providing a location, and
which happens to be in my home

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.370
turf, back in Sydney, and a
radius of two kilometers.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.500
And when I execute that search,
bang, I get back a

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.950
bunch of places.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.880
Can you see any surf spot there
on that results, Andres?

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.980
ANDRES: None of the surf spots
that you and I have hit any

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.820
time that I've been in Sydney.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.380
MARCELO: Yeah, so there's no
surf spots there, and the

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.530
reason is really simple--

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.210
Google doesn't index
surf spots.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.810
And Jeff is here, maybe he can
work on indexing surf spots in

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.310
the future, they'll be really
useful for surfers all over.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.500
So yeah, Google doesn't index
surf spots, so how do I solve

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.800
this problem?

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.700
So there was where specialized
knowledge comes in, I know the

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.150
area really well, so I can
list those sports myself.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.650
So what I have here is a list of
all the surf spots just in

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.660
the Dee Why area.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.510
Just a name and the location.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.860
So I'm going to use the data,
and I'm going to fit it into

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.440
the Places API using
another endpoint

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.830
that's at a place endpoint.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.350
So I just go,
maps/api/place/add, it's a

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.690
POST request, I'm parsing
the CSV file over there.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.170
Setting up the request, we
just place the surf spot

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.980
location and the
name, and bang.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.110
ANDRES: But Marcelo-- and I
need to interrupt you real

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.730
quick just to point
something out.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.520
I mean, this is a representative
sample of code,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.020
right, for the Python script
that we wrote to get

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.050
the data out there.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.330
But what I want to mention is,
it actually wasn't that much

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.700
more code, I think it was
less than 20 lines of

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.100
code that we wrote.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.840
When we were sitting down we
were sort of surprised, we

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.890
were kind of like, I mean,
I think we kind of

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.870
wanted to code more.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.950
MARCELO: The Places API is
really simple to use, really

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.630
simple to learn, and that can
actually always be a challenge

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.720
for us to come up with
an interesting

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.510
presentation about it.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.540
ANDRES: All right,
so what next?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.585
MARCELO: So now I'm going to
redo my place search, and now

00:21:39.585 --> 00:21:43.120
the only thing I'm adding is the
types=other there so that

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.860
the only thing I'm going
to get back is the

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.240
surf spot that I added.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.700
ANDRES: Right, and that's
because, as you mentioned

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.850
before, we don't have a place
type called surf spot.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.160
MARCELO: Unfortunately,
we don't have a surf--

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.950
ANDRES: At least not yet.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.896
MARCELO: Yeah, not yet.

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:57.820
ANDRES: All right, so here are
the surf spots we added.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.170
MARCELO: Yeah, can you
recognize them?

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.500
ANDRES: I do, I recognize almost
all of them, and I want

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.190
to point out that there is this
one surf spot, and let me

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.950
highlight it actually.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.180
That place here, and--

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.730
MARCELO: It is quite
far away, isn't it?

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.620
ANDRES: Every time that I've
been to the Sydney office, and

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.990
Marcelo and I have gone surfing,
he's actually never

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.910
mentioned this surf spot.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.560
You want to tell folks
what you told me?

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.160
MARCELO: Oh man, you don't
want to go there.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.790
ANDRES: Yeah, you want to tell
folks what you told me?

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.670
MARCELO: That's called
Bombie and it's a

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.770
big rider surf spot.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.330
You've got to step up your
game, man, before I

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.560
can take you there.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.330
Honestly, I don't want to see
you crying like a baby.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.770
ANDRES: Just for the record,
last time I was not crying, I

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.200
was just whining, and
I think there's a

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.650
big difference there.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.160
So just keep that in mind.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.400
All right, what next?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.330
MARCELO: OK, so now we've listed
the surf spots, what we

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.180
want to do is actually also
provide the surfing

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.670
conditions.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.070
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use a US government

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:03.330
website that provides current
and forecast data about

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.290
weather and ocean
data, as well.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.790
So I have my service set up like
this, I have a cron job

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.790
that goes regularly and fetches
that data, the most

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:20.300
recent run from the US website,
matches the data

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.250
against the surf spots I have
on my database, and uploads

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.280
the result into the Places API
so that the next time a user

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:33.450
does a search you're going to
get back the wave forecast for

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.000
that specific surf spot,
attach it to the data.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.770
And this is how I--

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.530
so what I'm doing here,
actually, is I'm using the

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.600
event endpoint in a very
creative way because it wasn't

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:53.340
really designed for this type
of use, but, I mean, you can

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:59.093
use it however you want, and I
hope my PM's not here, oh he's

00:23:59.093 --> 00:23:59.960
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.360
All right, so what I'm doing
here is I'm attaching an event

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.450
to the surf spot, but instead
of describing the event in a

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:12.020
summary, I'm using the summary
to attach the wave data--

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.730
the surf ratings--

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:19.760
for now and the next few hours
for that surf spot.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.190
And when I do my search again,
for each surf spot I'm going

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.890
to get the event attached with
the data there, so I can

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.030
easily display it on
my application.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.290
ANDRES: OK, so we've got the
beginnings of a pretty good

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.320
app here, right?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.350
And we've incorporated some
of the principles that we

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.570
discussed before, this is a
highly specialized app, right?

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.700
It's a surfing app by surfers,
for surfers.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.860
Actually, we need
to brand that.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.410
But the other thing is we've
gone beyond the base data,

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.750
we've added our surf spots, and
in addition to that, we've

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.770
also added some value to the
user by providing some

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.870
additional context, and that's
essentially the surf forecast

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:06.300
and conditions.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.820
MARCELO: So we can tick off
two principles so far--

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.520
specialized, and go beyond
the base data.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.170
ANDRES: Yeah, so if we take a
look at our surf spots now, we

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.440
get a pretty good indication of
whether we should head to

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.880
the four star surf spot or not,
I mean, that's kind of a

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.630
no-brainer.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.310
But that's not really
enough, right?

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.420
MARCELO: No.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.980
ANDRES: This is a nice app, it's
compelling, I'd probably

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.410
use it, but we need
to go beyond that.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.181
This is where the magic
that you were

00:25:32.181 --> 00:25:32.990
talking about comes in.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.820
MARCELO: So now I want to
surprise my user, I want to

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.700
delight him.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.050
I want to get him really engaged
with the application,

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.500
I want him to return to my app
on a daily basis because I

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.090
want to turn this into a
business, so I want this

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.350
relationship to be a long term
relationship with my user.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.730
So I want to get to know him
better, I want to get to

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.040
understand him, understand
his preferences.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.000
So what I'm going to do here,
I'm going to offer the option

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.530
for him to check in and out of
the surf spots, so before you

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.710
go into a surf session, you
check in, when you come back,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.540
you check out.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.810
It's not really hard, I actually
check my phone every

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.790
time I go for a surf, and when
I'm back I want to know what

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.860
time it is because
I've got to work.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.350
And so I think that's something
that users--

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.690
that surfers-- would actually
get to use.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.020
And in return of the check in
and out, I'm going to offer

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.190
him something.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.725
What I'm going to offer him is
some analytics about his

00:26:26.725 --> 00:26:29.400
surfing practice.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.030
Maybe I can show him what are
the surf spots that he hits

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.190
the most, or I can show him
the average length of a

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.730
surfing session.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.910
And I'm pretty sure this will
be compelling for most

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.790
surfers, I would definitely
use it.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.640
Would you?

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.650
ANDRES: I definitely would and,
again, I need to point

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.560
out that you did want
to call these

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.870
analytics something, Marcelo.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.840
You want to tell everybody what
you wanted to call them?

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.310
MARCELO: I would like to
call it Surfalytics.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.800
ANDRES: Surfalytics, folks.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.050
You heard it here first.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.800
So we're gathering a lot of data
for the user, and that's

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.790
really beneficial for the user,
but what if we take it

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.650
one step farther and we start
taking that data at aggregate,

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.840
and now using it to provide some
additional information to

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.970
our other users.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.740
So one of the things that
surfers hate the most are

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.500
crowded surf spots, so if we
know that folks are checking

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.190
in, we could allow folks to kind
of get a sense for how

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.510
crowded a particular
surf spot is.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.950
So, for example,
Dee Why Point.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.990
Marcelo, if there were 17 people
that checked in in the

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.893
last hour to Dee Why Point--

00:27:31.893 --> 00:27:34.840
MARCELO: No, you don't want
to go to Dee Why Point.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.790
It's a point break that can
take 10 people at most.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.020
So I'll definitely use that
feature, I could see myself

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.010
using that future to
decide where to go.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.100
ANDRES: Cool.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.570
MARCELO: But now that I
know my user, right?

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.620
I want to go beyond there, I
really want to surprise him.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.400
So I know where he's going for
surf, I know the time that

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.960
he's going for surf, and I know
the kind of surfing that

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.410
he likes-- is he a big rider?

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.970
Does he like middle sized waves,
or tiny little waves

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.750
like my friend here, Andres,
different people like

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.450
different kinds of waves.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.120
So what I want to do is I want
to pop-up a notification on

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.180
his phone saying, hey, there's
a good surf session coming up

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.430
in the next couple days, maybe
you want to prepare yourself.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.860
And if he clicks through the
notification, he'll get a

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.590
notification landing page where
he can see what the

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.510
prediction conditions are.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.340
ANDRES: In this case,
they are epic.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.290
That's right.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.230
MARCELO: Conditions are epic.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.340
And set up an alarm, or
set up a reminder--

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.080
plan himself--

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.350
or he can just say, you
know what, I won't be

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.375
able to make it.

00:28:43.375 --> 00:28:45.180
ANDRES: I'm going to be up late
tonight coding, and I'm

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.020
probably going to be too tired
to go surfing tomorrow.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:54.300
MARCELO: So I can
see the campaign

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.890
right here, Sweet Surf--

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:02.010
don't ever lose a epic swell
again, or something like it.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:02.976
ANDRES: Yeah.

00:29:02.976 --> 00:29:05.910
Well, I think we're moving in
the right direction here, but,

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.990
again, coming back.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.050
We've covered all the fun stuff,
Marcelo, but we have to

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.530
come back to the things
that I talked about--

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.550
paying the bills.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.400
So we need to--

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.250
MARCELO: You're like
an anchor, man,

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.370
you're like an anchor.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.750
ANDRES: We need to incorporate
commerce into our application,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.470
and we really want to
do it in two ways.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.760
The first way is our users are
consumers, and they're

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.680
interested in goods and
services, as Marcelo

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.890
mentioned, so we want to use
the Places API to show them

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.030
goods and services that
they're interested in.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.350
So what are surfers
interested in?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.370
Surf shops, probably surf
schools, right?

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:50.320
So we could easily use the
Places API and the standard

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.310
search functionality, and two
of the key features here.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.320
The ability to filter by
keyword, and the ability to

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.520
rank by distance.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.570
Now we've been referring to this
amongst ourselves as a

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.470
commodity search.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.330
So if a surfer is searching for
something, say like surf

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.510
wax, they don't really care
which shop they're going to go

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.860
to, they just want to find the
nearest surf shop so that they

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.920
can get the wax, wax their
board, and get

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.450
on about going surfing.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.880
So here's a demo that shows a
search which uses the default

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.740
results, these are the top
five results ranked by

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.350
prominence.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.960
And what we can do is if we rank
them by distance, we see

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.730
that the radius shortens, and
we actually see that places

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:43.070
are a lot closer to the
origin of our search.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.400
Subsequently then--

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.440
and now we're talking about
the base data, right?

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.370
Subsequently then, we can
present something

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.620
like this to our user.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.440
Now imagine that--

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.820
as is often the case--

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.870
if you've been out there and
you've been really pushing

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:05.140
yourself, like I do, and you've
been riding some pretty

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.360
big waves, sometimes your board
gets dinged and you want

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.710
to get a repair.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.600
So enter the merchants.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.660
There's nothing stopping us from
giving merchants access

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.980
to our application and allowing
them to use the

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:26.050
events feature to add time based
incentives, in this case

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.970
offers, for their target
audience, for surfers.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.050
So now if I do the same
type of search--

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.750
this commodity search--

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.250
there's a differentiator there,
and there's something

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.180
that's probably going to drive
me, and I can see that, hey,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.590
if I just drive a little bit
farther I'm going to drop off

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.890
my surfboard, and I'm going
to get a discount on the

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.030
surfboard that I'm going to rent
to go out there and hit

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.910
the 20 foot waves that
I typically surf.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.880
All right, so I think
we've brought it all

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.060
together now, right?

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.560
We've incorporated a lot of
the key features, we've

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.590
touched on all of the principles
that you were

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.200
talking about, I actually
snuck something

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.150
else in here though.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.010
So today we announced the
support for reviews in the

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.810
Places API, and so there's
another type of search that we

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.520
can enable for our users as
well, which is more of a

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.700
qualitative type of
a search, right?

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.500
So if I'm looking for a surf
school, I'm less concerned

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.360
about how close it is and
more concerned about

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.660
the quality of it.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.880
So I can provide search results
based on the Places

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.160
API that look more like this
where a user can see how a

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.280
particular surf school
is rated.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.010
And then they can actually dig
in a little bit deeper, and

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.820
see what people are saying
about that surf school.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.820
Is it the type of surf school
that they want to take their

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.990
family to, for example.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.490
MARCELO: You've got to keep in
mind there is always a trade

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:57.480
off between the time your user
is allowing to invest in

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.710
searching, and the cost of
making a wrong decision.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:05.470
So the higher the cost of making
a wrong decision, the

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.820
more time he will invest
in doing a search.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.580
If he's searching for a surf
school, he wants, not the

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.390
cheapest, he wants the best
experience, so the cost of

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.410
making a mistake in choosing a
surf school is high, so he'll

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.160
spend more time doing
that search.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.450
The cost of making a mistake
when choosing a surf shop to

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.620
buy wax is none, so he will
just do what we called a

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.870
commodity search.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.560
ANDRES: All right, so we've
talked quite a bit about our

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.315
sample app, Sweet Surf, and
this is really not the end

00:33:40.315 --> 00:33:43.250
though, I think this is
just the beginning.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.410
Something that Marcelo touched
on at the beginning is that we

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.670
envision an ecosystem off
location based apps.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.170
So we are providing a platform,
but we're really

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:56.010
counting on all of you all to
take it to the next level, to

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.090
take that step and start
building applications that

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.780
connect users with merchants,
that allow merchants to

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.890
provide that quality engagement,
that quality

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.400
commodity, as you put it.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.780
MARCELO: Yeah, absolutely, and
also we just started with API.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.967
It's going to go a lot further
in terms of functionality, and

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:15.994
in terms of the data, and
in terms of the quality.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.830
So with that I'd like to thank
you guys for attending on

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.110
behalf of the Places API team,
and we're going to open the

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.215
mics for questions.

00:34:29.215 --> 00:34:39.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.280
ANDRES: Do we have the number
of check-ins for

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.525
a particular place?

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:56.940
MARCELO: We do have, but
we don't expose that to

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.700
applications.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.490
So the idea of the check-in
is it's only--

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:05.520
you're providing a signal of how
relevant that place is to

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.320
your users, and we use
that signal when

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.230
we're ranking results.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.490
So currently we don't
provide any

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.360
information back about check-ins.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:15.775
Currently.

00:35:15.775 --> 00:35:17.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.730
MARCELO: No.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:23.800
And one of the reasons
is privacy concerns.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.720
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.300
I have a couple of questions.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.120
The Places API-- is it still
bound to the same licensing

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.880
scheme as the Maps API
for commercial

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.975
applications, calls?

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.400
MARCELO: So we have
our PM here, Thor.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.780
ANDRES: Yeah, we're going
to call our PM up here.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.090
Put him in the hot spot.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.274
Just kidding.

00:35:54.274 --> 00:35:55.266
THOR: Can I borrow your mic?

00:35:55.266 --> 00:35:56.516
ANDRES: Of course.

00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:00.722
THOR: We're going to
get personal now.

00:36:00.722 --> 00:36:01.972
ANDRES: That's right.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.720
MARCELO: We are very
close, Gene.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.730
THOR: Increasingly
so, it seems.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.625
ANDRES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:10.555
THOR: OK, perfect.

00:36:10.555 --> 00:36:11.020
OK.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.270
ANDRES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.620
THOR: Thank you, OK.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.740
So the Places API is considered
part of the Maps

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.445
API family, so it is subject to
the existing Maps API Terms

00:36:24.445 --> 00:36:25.400
of Service.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.760
There are a few small
differences that are peculiar

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.810
to the Places API.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:34.800
For example, most of the Maps
APIs there is a requirement

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.720
that you must use the service
in conjunction with a Google

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.820
Map, the Places API you can
actually use it without a

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.910
Google Map as long there is an
alternative which is a small

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.145
Powered by Google logo
that you use instead.

00:36:47.145 --> 00:36:49.190
Although what you can't
do is use it with

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.920
other provider's maps.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.810
So we've seen a lot of mobile
location based apps that don't

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.366
need a map, they just need to
show people places nearby to

00:36:56.366 --> 00:37:00.340
let them check in, and, in
that case, that's fine.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.210
However, also another small
difference is that in the web

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.910
based Maps API, you're not
permitted to use the free Maps

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:15.920
API in a full-fee application,
one that you sell for money.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.550
A caveat to that in the Maps
API Terms of Service that's

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.870
often overlooked is that that
does not apply to mobile apps

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.670
sold through online app stores,
such as Google Play or

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.150
the iTunes app store.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.490
So many of these location based
apps that use the Places

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.920
API fall into that category.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.980
But beyond that, with the
restrictions that we have

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:41.050
regarding things like use in
private applications, those

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.673
kinds of restrictions
do still apply.

00:37:42.673 --> 00:37:43.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.170
And the second question I have
really deals with your

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.360
implementation of
the surf app.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.410
You all had a small number of
points, so you could deal with

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:58.210
it in a way that's much easier
than dealing with a large set

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:00.240
of data, so let's say I'm
looking at all the restaurants

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.920
in the US, what immutable piece
of data comes back from

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.890
the Places API can I use to
bridge that to data in my

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.990
custom database?

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:13.480
MARCELO: So for every request,
every result you get back from

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.820
the Places API you've got an ID
and that ID is constant for

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.965
that place, for the life
of that place.

00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:22.340
But that's what you have
to use to map it

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.480
back to your database.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.396
AUDIENCE: On the Maps API, will
there be functionality or

00:38:30.396 --> 00:38:33.090
at least a flag for us to
determine whether or not a

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.830
business has been claim
by the owner?

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.665
THOR: There is not that
functionality right now, but

00:38:40.665 --> 00:38:44.620
it is something that we are
interested in looking into,

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.300
and also in helping you
understand whether the owner

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.190
of a business is also a user
of your application.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.250
AUDIENCE: Can you say that
last part, I'm sorry.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.170
THOR: Something else that we're
investigating is the

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.540
possibility of helping you
understand whether the owner

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.355
of a business is also a user
of your application.

00:39:00.355 --> 00:39:03.934
AUDIENCE: OK, cool, thank you.

00:39:03.934 --> 00:39:05.430
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
could speak a little bit

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.100
about the concept of hierarchy
of places, do you guys have a

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.760
concept of hierarchy and what
are you doing around that?

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.220
MARCELO: You mean a hierarchy
of types?

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.050
AUDIENCE: Specifically, Moscone
might have multiple

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.850
conference rooms inside
of it, for example.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:20.510
MARCELO: No, the Places
API currently has

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.900
no notion of hierarchy.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.000
We do have-- that's one of the
reasons why we added events.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.600
I mean, it's not the same thing,
but you could add--

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.070
in the case of Moscone,
you could add a room

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.740
as an event, right?

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.660
You would have a time to leave,
but it would work for

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.380
the case, for instance,
of a conference.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.630
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.320
MARCELO: So if we have no--

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.450
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.460
AUDIENCE: I'm just experimenting
with it, and I

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.740
just did a search for "cafe"
as well as your

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.320
classifications, and I was
hoping that the icon would be

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.187
a picture of a cup, and it
always comes back a fork and

00:40:04.187 --> 00:40:07.290
spoon, and I'm just wondering
if that's because--

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.010
MARCELO: When was that test
that you run, just now?

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.426
Because we just fixed
that bug yesterday.

00:40:13.426 --> 00:40:13.922
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:13.922 --> 00:40:15.172
Thank you.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.960
THOR: I should stress that's
entirely coincidental, we

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:29.130
don't just leave all the bugs
until the day before I/O.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.000
ANDRES: Great

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.690
THOR: I'll just mention that
we do also have a fireside

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.830
chat our last session tomorrow,
so if you have

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.870
broader questions about the Maps
APIs generally, including

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.460
the Places API and any of
the other features or

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.400
announcements we've made over
the course of today and

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.810
tomorrow, and that's a great
opportunity to spend an hour

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.060
grilling us mercilessly.

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:48.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.450
ANDRES: Thank you.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.700
MARCELO: Thank you.
