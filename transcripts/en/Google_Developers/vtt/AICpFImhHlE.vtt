[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.787 --> 00:00:02.620
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.150
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.960
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.940
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.230
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.820
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.220
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.400
and why they do it.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.605
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.730
Welcome to this episode of
"Coffee with a Googler".

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.650
Today, I'm speaking with MacDuff
from the Google Translate team.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.460
And we're going
to be learning all

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.450
about some of the
cool things that are

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.690
available in Google Translate.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.398
And it's one of my
favorite technologies,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.850
because I'm a big
"Star Trek" fan,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.930
and it's one of the
things that brings

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.280
like the universal
communicator from "Star Trek"

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.390
much closer to reality.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.970
So welcome.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.974
[LAUGHING]

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:41.640
MACDUFF HUGHES: Thanks,
Good to be here.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.780
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So welcome, MacDuff.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.460
And tell us all about
machine translation.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.310
What's it all about?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.018
MACDUFF HUGHES: Well,
machine translation

00:00:47.018 --> 00:00:49.120
is using computers
to solve problems

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.030
of understanding and
communication across languages.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.120
It's based on this technology
called statistical machine

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.950
translation, because
most of how it works

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.610
is based on finding very
large numbers of examples

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.230
of translations, mostly
on the World Wide Web,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.177
and using statistics to
see how various words

00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:10.760
and groups of words and phrases
tend to be translated from one

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.387
language to another so that
it can make reasonable guesses

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:15.220
about how to translate
a sentence it's never

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.900
seen before.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.220
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.630
So it's not a straight, like,
look-up table of this word

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.870
is this, this word is this.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.940
MACDUFF HUGHES: No.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.440
No.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.510
It has a lot of statistics
about possible translations

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.404
and some pretty advanced
algorithms to pick the best one

00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:28.820
and how to combine them to
make something natural sounding

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.730
in the resulting language.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.100
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.007
So sometimes a phrase
might be translated

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.090
one way in one document
and translated another way

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.570
in another document.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.403
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:01:35.403 --> 00:01:38.620
For common phrases, we'll have
many candidate translations

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.797
for a language.

00:01:39.797 --> 00:01:42.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, what kind
of volume do you get in this?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.547
How big is Google Translate?

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:44.963
MACDUFF HUGHES:
Well, we translate

00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:46.620
about a billion
characters a day,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.210
about 100 million words or
so for around 100 million,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.970
upwards of that, users per day.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.730
OK.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.160
So, now, there's
a lot of languages

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.880
it must support to get
that kind of volume.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.360
MACDUFF HUGHES: Well,
the volume doesn't really

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.370
come from a lot of languages.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.420
A small number of languages
account for most of the volume.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.320
Got it.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.600
MACDUFF HUGHES: But we do
support a lot of languages.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.720
We've worked very hard to make
sure we support even languages

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.039
with relatively low usage.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.190
So we've made a big push
over the last few years

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.910
to get up to 90
languages supported.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: 90, wow.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.910
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: So what are
the some of the less common

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.320
languages that are supported?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.370
Do you have a favorite?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.330
MACDUFF HUGHES: Do
I have a favorite?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.965
Well, my personal
favorite is Welsh,

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:24.840
which I learned a little
bit a few years ago.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.679
LAURENCE MORONEY:
[SPEAKING WELSH]

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.845
We're going to need translation
for that underneath.

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:32.210
MACDUFF HUGHES:
[SPEAKING WELSH] Yeah.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.350
I started taking some courses
a couple years ago, learned it.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.620
So we do support
that in Translate--

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.620
have for several years.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.536
It doesn't get a tremendous
amount of traffic,

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:42.690
but one thing you learn
working on translation

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.100
is people are very proud
of their languages.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.977
It's a very important
cultural thing

00:02:46.977 --> 00:02:49.060
to see their language
represented on the internet,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.790
to have tools
available to use it.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.689
And especially for
minority languages,

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.230
languages that are
threatened, people

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.400
feel very strongly about them.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
Welsh is a great example.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.790
I lived in Wales
for three years.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.880
And the pride that
they take-- And it's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.210
a beautiful language, too.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.294
The pride they take in it.

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:03.960
So one of the things
as well that you do

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.450
is like an OCR translation,
so you can hold up a camera

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.360
and read text?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.650
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.820
This is something we
launched earlier this year,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.340
was instant camera translation.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.280
So you can just open Translate
and open your camera,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.560
and point it at text, and
it translates it instantly

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.144
on the screen.

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:18.685
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Right So for Welsh,

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:19.810
for road signs in Cardiff?

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.620
MACDUFF HUGHES: We
don't do Welsh yet.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.330
We launched early this year
with support for English

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.840
to and from six languages--
French, Spanish,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.592
Italian, German,
Russian, and Portuguese.

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:30.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.230
MACDUFF HUGHES: But
just the other day, we

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.854
launched support for
downloadable packs

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:35.210
for an additional 20 languages.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.810
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.130
Nice.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.629
Cool.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.950
So I look forward to
having a play with that.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.036
Now, one of the things
with machine translation

00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:42.410
is that it's not
always accurate.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.920
MACDUFF HUGHES: It is
not always accurate.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.336
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I'm sure there's

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:48.210
some funny things that can go
wrong, lost in translation.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.085
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yeah.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.840
There are a lot of funny things.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.600
Latin produces a lot
of hilarious examples,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.720
because it's used in
funny ways on the web,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.740
not the way people
normally talk.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.621
People put Latin quotations
around in strange places.

00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.120
Or there is this thing called
lorem ipsum text that printers

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.530
use to fill out webpages.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.060
There was a conspiracy
theory going around round

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.590
the internet earlier this
year that there were coded

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.820
messages in our translations.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Hidden in lorem ipsum?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.930
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.430
Yes.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.519
There were.

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.060
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Any web developers,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.709
you probably have
seen lorem ipsum

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.589
when you put a text block
on your pages, that's

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.880
the text that they auto-populate
so you can see layout.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.713
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:25.370
Yes.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.279
Some of the more
straightforward funny examples

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.070
are when you get the
sense of a word wrong.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.403
A lot of words in languages
have many possible meanings.

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:35.205
But one favorite that
we've seen is bed bugs.

00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:36.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.040
MACDUFF HUGHES: The word "bugs,"
in a number of languages,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.331
it's gotten translated into
the word for software bugs.

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:41.460
So bug, software defects.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.960
LAURENCE MORONEY: So there's a
software problem with my bed.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.510
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.410
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.981
MACDUFF HUGHES: Or it
can get a little edgy

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:50.259
with "Are you free
today" if the word free

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.800
gets translated into
the word meaning

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.792
no cost, no price, no money.

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.500
You gotta be careful
who you say that to.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.840
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.340
You free?

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.010
No, no.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.600
MACDUFF HUGHES: I'm
free today, yes.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: There's
one that I personally love.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.180
And it was this girl on YouTube,
and she will take songs--

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.850
MACDUFF HUGHES: Oh, I
know where you're going.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.210
Yeah.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.450
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right?

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.740
And she will translate the
song into one language,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.989
and then into another, and
then into another, and then

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:13.990
into another, and come
in a roundabout way

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.310
through about 20 languages
back into English.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.890
And then-- she's
a great singer--

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.230
and she will sing
the translation.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.060
Have you seen it?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.075
MACDUFF HUGHES: Those
things are hilarious.

00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:22.575
Yeah.

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:25.760
I think they really
show how much is always

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.930
lost in translation.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.959
It gets lost even faster
with machine translation.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.000
But it's very interesting,
because so many things

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
are hard to express, especially
song lyrics and poetry.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.560
Even professional
translators really

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.420
struggle to get those translated
into an understandable way.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.920
LAURENCE MORONEY:
But what struck me

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.919
as remarkable was that
even though it was wrong,

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.350
that you got the gist of it.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.880
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it went
through all these languages.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.735
And I think there was one
like "Bohemian Rhapsody."

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:50.740
And the opening line
of "Bohemian Rhapsody"

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.800
came out as, like, "Mother,
I shot a guy," or something

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.250
like that, after going through
20 different translations.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.420
And it was really cool.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.628
MACDUFF HUGHES: Well, that's
what's amazing about it,

00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:02.330
is even though we do make
big mistakes in translation.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.240
And a lot of times, you might
translate a webpage or a news

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.070
story.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.770
Maybe not one
sentence is translated

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.780
absolutely perfectly.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.270
But over the course of
a long enough document,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.860
you can get a sense
of what it's about.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.500
And the difference between
seeing a wall of something

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.270
you don't understand
at all and knowing

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.750
the general topic
of an article can

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.000
be a big difference to people.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.958
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.360
And that's one of the things
that the statistical base

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.870
translation helps you get right.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.350
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.160
MACDUFF HUGHES: That's
the best thing for it,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.862
is getting the gist
of an of an article.

00:06:28.862 --> 00:06:29.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.710
Now, one thing I'd also noticed
that you've been working on

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.100
recently is bringing people
who are expert speakers

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.730
of the language into the fold.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.030
So giving people the
ability to feed back

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.377
into the statistical base
translation that says,

00:06:42.377 --> 00:06:42.960
you know what?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.570
In my language we don't
really say it like this.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.760
We say it like this.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.970
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.803
So you're talking about
Translate Community.

00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:49.660
So that's something we
introduced last year.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.420
The great thing about
that is you said expert.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.378
But you don't really even
have to be an expert.

00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:56.210
Anyone who is reasonably
competent in two languages

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.300
and wants to improve
the translation

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.970
can go to Translate
Community and help.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.830
This was something
that surprised us,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.510
because people are just
volunteering to help

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.810
make our product better.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.057
But I mentioned earlier
how passionate people

00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:13.140
are about their languages,
and especially minority

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.090
languages or things that are
underrepresented in the world.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.340
And for years, people
were saying either,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.220
Google, why don't you
support my language?

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.386
Or, why aren't you better
at supporting my language?

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:25.870
And for years, we
had to say, well,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.328
there's just not enough data
out on the web for us to train

00:07:28.328 --> 00:07:29.460
our models on.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.790
But eventually we just
tried asking people, hey,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.080
will you come and help?

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.564
And there was a
lot of enthusiasm,

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:37.730
especially from these
minority language communities.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.973
That's kind of exciting, though.

00:07:39.973 --> 00:07:41.490
It's like getting
people involved.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.420
MACDUFF HUGHES: It
really is exciting.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.795
We're trying to make it more
fun and engaging for people,

00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:48.500
and let them use it as a way
to connect with each other,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.979
and to feel some satisfaction
in what they're doing.

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:53.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it becomes
less about just pure machine

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000
translation, and
people are getting

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.826
involved in the translation
as well, which is really neat.

00:07:57.826 --> 00:07:58.950
Keeping the language alive.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.825
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yeah.

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:02.030
So increasingly, for
very common queries

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.142
and casual and
conversational queries,

00:08:04.142 --> 00:08:05.850
it becomes more and
more likely that when

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.714
you ask for a translation,
the translation

00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:09.130
you see from Google
Translate will

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.755
have been provided by members of
the Translate Community, which

00:08:11.755 --> 00:08:12.547
is very satisfying.

00:08:12.547 --> 00:08:13.505
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:08:13.505 --> 00:08:14.090
Very cool.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.332
So now, one of the things,
you've just recently

00:08:16.332 --> 00:08:17.540
brought out a new app, right?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.170
Or there was an
update to the app?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.336
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes, we did.

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:21.500
We just updated the mobile apps.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.020
Like I mentioned, it
adds 20 new languages

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.660
to the instant camera mode.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.785
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:29.290
MACDUFF HUGHES: And we've
also made the speech

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.600
and conversation translation
much faster than it

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.897
was in the previous release.

00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:34.730
So the big feature from
the previous release

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.840
was you could set
up a conversation,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.090
and two people could speak,
and it would automatically

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.206
detect which language
people are speaking in,

00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:42.289
and switch back and forth.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.060
So that's happening
much faster now.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.810
So you don't need as
fast a network for it

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.704
to work responsively.

00:08:47.704 --> 00:08:49.120
We also improved
the accessibility

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.500
of the app for visually
impaired users.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.560
So this launched just the other
day on Android and iOS space.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.310
Very exciting.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'll have
to download and have a play.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.440
MACDUFF HUGHES: Please do.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now,
if I'm a developer,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.759
and I want to start building
translation into my apps,

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:03.162
or using translation in my
apps, how do I get started?

00:09:03.162 --> 00:09:05.120
MACDUFF HUGHES: We have
a Google Translate API.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.231
MACDUFF HUGHES: It's
on the cloud platform,

00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:13.090
cloud.google.com And yes,
we charge by the character

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.120
for the translation.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.180
And we support all 90 languages.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.100
And we have a big developer
community developing

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.130
applications with that.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.254
LAURENCE MORONEY: So if
I'm a cloud developer using

00:09:23.254 --> 00:09:25.940
the cloud.google.com console,
the developers' console,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.850
I'll see translator
there as an option?

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.021
MACDUFF HUGHES: Yes.

00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.080
Yes.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.205
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.500
So thank you so much, MacDuff.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.370
That was really awesome.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.911
And it's great to catch up and
learn about some of the things

00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:36.704
and find somebody else who
speaks a few words of Welsh.

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:37.620
MACDUFF HUGHES: Great.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
thank you, everybody,

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.640
for watching this episode
of "Coffee with a Googler."

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.389
I hope you learned as
much as I did today.

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:45.220
It was, to me,
really interesting

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.840
to learn about the
great things that

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.048
are happening in Translate,
and the great things that

00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:51.246
are happening when the
community gets involved.

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:54.320
And as MacDuff said, go on to
the Cloud Developers' Console,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.284
and you'll be able to
get access to the APIs

00:09:56.284 --> 00:09:58.450
if you want to build
translation into your own apps.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.100
Or you could download
the new translation app

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.600
and play with some of the new
languages that we spoke about.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.820
So again, thanks, everybody.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.920
And be sure to tune to
the Google Developers'

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.200
Channel for more great videos.
