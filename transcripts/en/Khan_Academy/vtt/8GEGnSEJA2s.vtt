00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:04.488
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that f of x is equal to

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:09.262
x plus 7 to the third power, minus one.

00:00:09.262 --> 00:00:12.177
And let's say that g of x

00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:15.307
g of x is equal to

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:19.879
the cube root of x plus one

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.340
the cube root of x plus one, minus seven.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
Now, what I wanna do now is evaluate

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.910
f of g of x

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.819
I wanna evaluate f of g of x

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:39.226
and I also wanna evaluate g of f of x

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.415
g of f of x, and see what I get

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:48.222
I encourage you, like always,
pause the video and try it out

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:50.816
Let's first evaluate f of g of x.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:54.032
That means, g of x, this
expression is going to be our input

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:56.889
So, everywhere we see an x
in the definition for f of x,

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.506
we would replace it with all of g of x

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:03.094
so, f of g of x is going to be equal to

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:04.797
so it's going to be equal to,

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.207
well I see an x right over there

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.162
so I'll write all of g of x there

00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:12.453
so that's the cube root of

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:15.253
x plus one

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:19.620
minus seven, and then I have plus seven

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.587
plus seven to the third power, minus one

00:01:24.587 --> 00:01:29.305
notice, whenever I saw the x,
since I'm taking f of g of x,

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:31.662
I replace it with what g of x is,

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:35.284
so, that is, the cube root
of x plus one minus seven.

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:37.350
Alright, I'll see if we can simplify this.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.544
Well, we have a minus seven plus seven

00:01:39.544 --> 00:01:41.170
so that simplifies nicely.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.339
So, this just becomes, this is equal to,

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:46.145
I can do a neutral color now,

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:47.705
this is equal to

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:51.707
the cube root of x plus one

00:01:51.707 --> 00:01:56.142
to the third power, minus one.

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.858
Well, if I take the
cube root of x plus one

00:01:57.858 --> 00:01:59.475
and then I raise it to the third power,

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.861
well, that's just gonna
give me x plus one.

00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:04.265
So, this part

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.685
this part just simplifies to x plus one,

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.080
and then I subtract one,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.538
so it all simplified out
to just being equal to x.

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:16.662
So we're just left with an x.

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:19.797
So, f of g of x is just x.

00:02:19.797 --> 00:02:23.477
So now, let's try what g of f of x is.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:26.635
So, g of f of x is going to be equal to,

00:02:26.635 --> 00:02:28.039
I'll do it right over here,

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.361
this is going to be equal to

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.983
the cube root of

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:35.457
actually, let me write it out,

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:38.128
wherever I see an x, I
can write f of x instead,

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:40.223
I didn't do it that last
time, I went directly

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:42.042
and replaced with the definition of f of x

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:43.489
but just to make it clear what I'm doing

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.083
everywhere I'm seeing an x,
I replace it with an f of x.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:51.725
So, the cube root of f of x plus one,

00:02:51.725 --> 00:02:53.755
minus seven.

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:57.335
Well, that's going to be
equal to the cube root of

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.701
cube root of f of x,

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:03.051
which is all of this business over here

00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:07.956
so that is x plus seven
to the third power,

00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:12.377
minus one, and then we add one

00:03:12.377 --> 00:03:16.436
and we add one, and then
we subtract the seven

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:19.538
lucky for us, subtracting
one and adding one,

00:03:19.538 --> 00:03:20.590
those cancel out.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.461
Next, we're gonna take the

00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.514
cube root of x plus
seven to the third power.

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:27.068
Well, the cube root of x
plus seven to the third power

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:29.148
is just going to be x plus seven

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:30.628
so, this is going to be

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:32.787
x plus seven,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:35.945
for all of this business
simplifies to x plus seven,

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:39.021
and then we do subtract seven

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:42.248
and these two cancel out,
or they negate each other

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.444
and we are just left with x.

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:46.296
So, we see something very interesting.

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:49.105
f of g of x is just x

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:51.264
and g of f of x is x.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.967
So, in this case, if we start with an x

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:59.298
if we start with an x, we
input it into the function g

00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:01.918
and we get g of x

00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:04.128
we get g of x

00:04:04.128 --> 00:04:07.085
and then we input that
into the function f,

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:09.970
then we input that into the function f,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.441
f of g of x gets us back to x.

00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:15.844
It gets us back to x.

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.701
So we kind of did a round-trip.

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.585
And the same thing is happening over here.

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:22.867
If I put x into f of x...

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.542
I'm sorry, if I put x into the function f,

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:31.175
and I get f of x, the output is f of x,

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:35.494
and then I input that into
g, into the function g

00:04:35.494 --> 00:04:38.220
into the function g, once
again I do this round-trip

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.743
and I get back to x.

00:04:39.743 --> 00:04:43.275
Another way to think about it,

00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:47.298
these are both composite functions,

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:49.098
one way to think about it is,

00:04:49.098 --> 00:04:51.350
if these are the set
of all possible inputs

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.591
into either of these composite functions,

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.110
and then, these are the outputs,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.627
so you're starting with an x,

00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:01.450
I'll do this case first,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.830
so, g is a mapping,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.571
let me write down,

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.675
so, g is going to be a mapping

00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:11.185
from x to g of x

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.594
so, this is what g is doing

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:18.180
so, the function g maps
from x to some value, g of x

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.905
and then if you'd apply f to
this value right over here

00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:27.208
if you apply f to this value, the g of x,

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:30.128
you get all the way back to x.

00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:33.552
So, that is f of g of x.

00:05:33.552 --> 00:05:35.254
And vice versa.

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:39.631
If you start with x
and apply f of x first,

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.896
so, if you start with f,
if you apply f of x first,

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:44.252
let me do that,

00:05:44.252 --> 00:05:47.488
so, if you apply f of x first,
you see you get to this value

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:51.643
so, that is f of x, so
you applied the function f

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.460
when you apply the function g to that,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.727
you apply the function
g to that, you get back.

00:05:57.727 --> 00:06:02.405
So this g of f of x,

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:06.393
I should say, or g of f,

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:10.665
we're applying the function
g to the value f of x

00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:14.212
and so, since we get a
round-trip either way, we know

00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:17.912
that the functions g and f
are inverses of each other

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.598
in fact, we can write that

00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:25.251
f of x is equal to the inverse of g of x,

00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:29.096
inverse of g of x, and vice versa,

00:06:29.096 --> 00:06:33.645
g of x is equal to the inverse of f of x

00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:37.326
inverse of f of x.

00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:38.976
Hope you enjoyed that.
