00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:04.337
Mrs. Greenfield
alerted the entire world

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.105
by way of the social media web

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.907
that she'd be meeting
some girlfriends

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.476
for '90s trivia night
at this local bar.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.845 align:start position:0%
Hey there, do you guys mind
if I join your team?

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.747
I'm sorry. It's just kind of
a girl power kind of night.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.848 align:start position:0%
Can you scooch over
just a little bit there?

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:63% position:38%
It's just us ladies.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.484 align:start position:0%
Mind giving a little bit
of room there?

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:20.153 align:start position:0%
You know, you'd probably
be more comfortable

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.655
if you kept scooching over just
elbow room-wise--good, okay.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.490
(Forrest)
Although this predatory behavior

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.325
felt wrong on many levels,

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:29.295
I knew I had to continue,
for the good of humanity.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.264 align:start position:0%
I've been brushing up
on the '90s.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.367 align:start position:0%
I know all about, you know,
<i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> and<i> Webster.</i>

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.502 align:end position:100%
I think that was the--
that's the '80s.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:38.271 align:start position:0%
Nancy Reagan's
"Just say no" thing,

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.639 align:start position:0%
reading up on that
last night.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start size:75% position:25%
That's the '80s as well.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:41.841 align:start position:0%
And the various people

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.143 align:start position:0%
that got involved,
you know, with that.

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.645
In the movie<i> Office Space,</i>

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.514
what item did Peter pull
from the rubble?

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.249
- Yes.
- Red scissors.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.185
- No. Anybody else?
- Red stapler.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.719
Yes, red stapler.

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.188 align:start position:0%
What's the difference?
It's the same thing.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.756
Um, one's staples,
one's a scissor.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.257 align:start position:0%
Can we get half credit
for that?

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.592
- No, you don't. No.
- You got the--

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.027
She--
Well, you got the color right.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.029
- You got the color right.
- It's fine.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.130
(Forrest)
I paid a lot of special
attention to Mrs. Greenfield.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
Yes.
How did you know that?

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.633 align:start size:47% position:53%
I watched a ton
of<i> Soul Train.</i>

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.335 align:start position:0%
That is amazing.

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.237
(Forrest)
And thanks to alcohol
and flattery,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.140
I was making
surprisingly good progress.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.375
Wow, that's great, so you've got
now just the two cats.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.377
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.179
(Forrest)
As the night wore on
and her friends left the bar,

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:23.249
sex with Mrs. Greenfield
seemed more and more likely.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.218 align:start position:0%
So what's your story,
mystery man...

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.352 align:start size:50% position:50%
Hmm, oh, well...

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.820 align:start position:0%
With you in the middle
of nowhere?

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.922 align:end position:100%
Oh, I live in Hollywood,
California, actually.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.091
(Forrest)
My knowledge that
Mrs. Greenfield had minored

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.060
in drama
was a valuable asset.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:38.030 align:start size:78% position:22%
Has anybody ever told you
that you should actress?

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:39.832 align:start position:0%
You mean be a, like,
be an actress?

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start size:63% position:38%
Be an actress, yeah.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.435 align:start position:0%
Well, I am one.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:43.936
- I do teach, but, like...
- Okay.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.705 align:start position:0%
I also actress.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.073 align:start size:44% position:56%
Do you really?

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.708 align:start size:53% position:47%
I think I should
switch to waters.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.076
- I'm gonna switch to water.
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.310 align:start position:0%
No, you don't, sir.

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna buy you
a pitcher.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.148
- What? A pitcher?
- Yes. Here we go.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.850
(Forrest)
As our evening progressed,
I saw that Mrs. Greenfield

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:02.221
was a dreamer being held back by
a distant and uncaring spouse,

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.190
and that moved me greatly.

00:02:04.223 --> 00:02:05.791 align:start position:0%
Just pull it off.

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:08.261
(Forrest)
That night,
I had truly glorious sex

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.929
with Mrs. Greenfield.

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.597
Though I do not know
what she's like in a classroom,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.066
in bed,
she is a gifted teacher,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.701
revealing to me
sexual positions

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.371
that have broadened my horizons
and expanded my mind.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.940
It was amazing.

00:02:20.973 --> 00:02:23.576 line:91%
My review might
have ended here

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.411
but for
a surprising development.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.113 size:84% position:42%
Sounds like a fun activity.

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.215 align:start position:0%
Mrs. Greenfield?

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.450
- Oh, hi, Stephen.
- Oh.

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:32.752
This is Stephen.

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.420 align:start size:34% position:66%
Yes. Hello.

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.289
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Oh.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.957 align:start size:59% position:41%
Well, I don't know,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.760 align:end position:100%
uh, who you are
or w-what you could ever mean

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.728
- by that or anything else.
- Okay.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.263
- So yeah.
- It was good to run into you.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:45.665
- We'll see you later.
- Very good. Okay.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.267 align:start position:0%
Hey, I meant your teacher,
not my teacher.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.169 align:start size:72% position:28%
I don't have a teacher.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.071 align:end position:100%
I'm a grown-up, so I couldn't
have done that, okay?

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.740 align:start position:0%
Yeah, screw you.
And your show sucks.

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.509
Come on.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.010
- Do not engage with him.
- What?

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.478
(Mrs. Greenfield)
He is off.

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:02.415
(Forrest)
No, he's just a nice young man.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
Well, an awkward ending
to a very enjoyable experience.

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:09.088 align:start position:0%
Stephen, I'm sorry.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.824 size:81% position:41%
It couldn't have been easy
watching me make beautiful

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:14.857 align:start position:0%
and athletic love
to the woman of your dreams.
