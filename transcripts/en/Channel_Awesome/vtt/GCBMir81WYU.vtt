00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.060
NC: I gotta tell you, my work's not always easy.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.240
I mean, granted this is the greatest job in the world, but whenever somebody asks you, "What did you do at your job today?"

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.480
and you had to answer "I watched Care Bears The Movie." I die a little inside.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.780
Yeah, I die a little. How can anyone say that with any shred of dignity? How can anyone speak that with any pride?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.940
You can't. Roll it.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.600
[Singing] Carol King: Care-a-lot is a place we all can go

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.990
NC: Yes, the Care Bears were pretty big in their day: disgustingly cute,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.180
disgustingly nice, and disgustingly marketable. How could any child not get wrapped up in their disgustingness?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.380
So when this movie came out

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.400
children roared with applause and parents cringed in fear knowing that they would have to sit through this technicolor vomit.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.040
Is it as bad as it looks? Well there's only one way to find ou. Let's take a look at

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.000
*sigh* Care Bears The Movie.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.180
So, we start off with probably the whitest orphanage ever seen on film as our narrator named Mr. Cherrywood comes in.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.460
Mr. Cherrywood: Now off to sleep to dream of clowns and circuses, acrobats and jugglers.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.120
NC: He's played by Mickey Rooney, former biggest star in the world, but now doing, well, Care Bears.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820
He decides to tell the children a story before they go to sleep.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.440
Mr. Cherrywood: This is the story of two young children named Kim and Jason and how they were helped by a group of very special friends

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.440
the Care Bears.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.280
NC: *shudders* I don't like the face he made there.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340
Mr. Cherrywood: The Care Bears.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.360
NC: *shudders* It's the kind of face that says "I touched half of these children, and I'm okay with that."

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.760
Mr. Cherrywood: The Care Bears live in a magic place called... Care-a-lot.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.360
NC: So, as the credits roll we get our opening song called Care-a-lot sung by Carol King. Isn't that sad?

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.540
and is it me or does she sound totally uninterested in singing this?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.020
[Singing] Care-a-lot is a place you'd like to be

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.500
riding on a cloud. Care-a-lot: It's a rainbow fantasy

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.640
for laughing out loud.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.860
NC *imitating singer*: Care-a-lot is paying for my new car

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.560
So might as well do it.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.680
[normal] On top of that this song is just shit. I mean listen to these lyrics:

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.940
"Care-a-lot, carousels playing music in your mind,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.919
for dancing and singing. Sometimes you feel so glad, sometimes you feel blue, trust your feelings

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.030
it's not bad. Feelings are just you."

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.079
What does that even mean? "Feelings are just you," Oh that's good to know. I thought was Hershel the feeling fairy.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.680
What are they talking about?

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.060
By the way, it's probably my perverted mind

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.180
but what does it look like these two are doing? This bear looks way too happy about what this bear is doing.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.820
I think that car is just a cover. So our story begins when they spot two children who, you guessed it, stopped caring.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.320
obvious statement is obvious

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.760
Friend Bear: Hi! I'm Friend Bear and this is Secret Bear. We're Care Bears.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.720
Jason: What do you want?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.360
Friend Bear: Only to be your friends.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.680
NC: Actually, I always wondered what counted as "caring."

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.760
I mean, if I'm ordering a pizza with a friend is it like:

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.620
NC 1: Hey, what kind of toppings you want?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.640
NC 2: Oh, I don't care. No! No! Wait I didn't mean that--[sparkly noise] Ugh...

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.820
Offscreen Care Bear: Hi, we're the Care Bears and everybody has to care about something--

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.480
[Gunshots] [Screaming]

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.340
Friend Bear: Everyone needs friends Jason, even you and Kim.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.700
Kim: We're not your friends.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.940
Jason: How do you know our names?

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.540
NC: Really? That's your biggest question right now. I mean granted that's a legit query,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.580
but that should be, like question number five.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.060
Friend Bear: We know a lot of things about you. Kim reads a lot of books and wants to be a nurse when she grows up and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.980
Jason you want to be a jet pilot.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.440
Jason: Yeah, how did you know that?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.640
Friend Bear: Friends are supposed to know about each other's hopes and dreams.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.140
memes

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.200
NC: Friends, stalkers, it's all good!

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.580
So, while they try to comfort the two kids, their main leader, named Tenderheart, goes to check on another kid named Nicolas.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.080
that is just poor

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.580
 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.080
Mr. Cherrywood: Nicolas was a magician's helper. He had never had a friend in his life.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.440
Magician: Hey, close the door!

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.880
Nicolas: Woah! Woah!

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.740
KACRASH!!!

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.760
NC Imitating Magician: Ohh, this is why you've never had a friend in your life.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.860
Nicolas: I didn't mean it.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.360
Magician: I bought that trunk thinking maybe there's some junk in it that I can use in my magic act.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.700
Now half of it's broken!

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.540
NC imitating magician: Don't make me tell your parents who may, or may not exist, and I may, or may not be keeping you from!

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.700
NC: but Nicolas comes across a secret magic book.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.580
The Spirit: Nicolas... I am a spirit Nicolas

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.220
Umm...Bullshit!!

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.220
your friend.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.740
NC: Unfortunately, it's a book that seems to possess unnatural evil powers.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.080
The Spirit: This is your chance to show that you are a greater magician than he.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.280
They love him for his magic. They'll love you for yours.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.800
PERVERT!!!

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.540
Bruce Campbell: It was never meant for the world of the living.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.780
NC: While that's going on, though the Care Bears are working on their latest invention: a teleporter.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.300
because SCIENCE!!!

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.669
Yes, apparently there's groundbreaking scientific technology in Care-a-lot as long as the buttons look like Lucky Charms marshmallows.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.940
But it accidentally beams the two children up when it wasn't supposed to.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.120
Jason: Where are we?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.520
Care Bears: We're the Care Bears!

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.160
Kim and Jason: ...more friends?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.480
NC: *laughs* I like these kids. They have all the right reactions.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.089
So, while they trying to get the teleporter to work they show the kids around Care-a-lot via a god-awful song. sequence

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.669
Singer: Nobody cares like a bear.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.930
NC: But fuck that shit. I want to see that evil book again.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.640
The Spirit: He'll be in a deep sleep only long enough for you to take over his magic show.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.380
Nicolas:  But, but,  I couldn't!

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.560
The Spirit: Yes, you can. You must.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.980
NC: So this genuinely creepy character that appears is simply known as "The Spirit."

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.019
and while, not flat-out scary there is something very threatening about her. Maybe it's her voice.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.920
Maybe it's the fact that there's just a face in a book, but there's something that's just a little unsettling.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.700
The Spirit: There are dozens of children out there waiting to see your magic.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.020
NC: in fact. I don't want to watch her anymore. I'm going to fast forward past her parts.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.900
[Spirit growls]

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.820
WHAT THE WHAT!?!?!

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.100
NC: Dah! Okay! Okay! I love your scenes! I love your scenes!

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.600
JESUS!!!

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.460
[Spirit laughs]

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.780
NC: I haven't seen a book so in touch with evils since Twilight.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.940
Tenderheart: Nicholas stop! This isn't the way to make friends

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.060
The Spirit: Where was he when you needed him?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.260
Tenderheart: What matters--

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.820
NC: *laughs* I just love Nicholas' face here. As if to say:

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.360
"Wow, I really didn't think I was gonna see this today; a talking bear speaking with an evil face in a book.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.000
Thank God It's at least Friday."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.380
Tenderheart: Woah!

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.620
NC: So she locks Tenderheart in a cage and convinces Nicholas to start his own magic show.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.040
Tenderheart: Magic isn't the answer Nicholas. Your feelings can help you find the true answer.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.180
NC: Yes, just listen to the magic talking bear.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.880
because ANYONE would take a giant talking teddy bear seriously...

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.640
So Tenderheart breaks his way out as Nicholas' magic show doesn't go as well as he planned.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.880
Nicolas: Make them stop laughing.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.100
The Spirit: Only you can do that.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.600
Nicolas: Zimma, zot, Coz-orkney!

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.100
and a Bibbity Bobbity Boo

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.100
[Thunderclap]

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.240
NC: Oh no. Now he's turned them into Youtube commenters.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.060
The Spirit: This is only the beginning.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.900
NC: So, Nicholas and his evil book start turning everybody in the world into jerks. Because of this Care-a-lot starts to crumble.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.400
(apparently)

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.260
Funshine Bear: The Caring Meter dropped two whole points!

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
[Gasps]

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.700
NC: We're reaching Jersey levels.  Jersey levels!

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.499
So Kim and Jason decide to join the Care Bears in their mission to stop The Spirit.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.770
Tenderheart: Hold on to this for me Jason. Don't lose it. It's very important.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.889
NC: Then why don't you hold on to it?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.280
Well, anyway, they try teleporting them to Earth, but the earthquake destroys the teleporter in the process.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.960
Grumpy Bear: They never made it to Earth.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.080
Other Care Bear: What do you mean? Where are they?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.580
lost in space?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.100
Grumpy Bear: They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.880
NC: Yeah, um what exactly is the cosmology for Care-a-lot anyway?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.480
I thought was in the clouds. Now it's in a different dimension? I mean where are they expected to end up?

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.980
Grumpy Bear: They're lost somewhere between here and Earth.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.440
Meanwhile in no where...

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.820
NC: So, they decided to take a river down to Earth-- That's right. There's a river in the clouds now. ---in the hope that this will

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.139
somehow cross dimensions. I don't know here's how they explain it:

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:53.100
Mr. Cherrywood: No one in Care-a-lot had ever followed the river. They had no idea whether it would lead them to Kim, Jason, the Missing Care Bears or to nowhere at all.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:02.700
NC imitating child: Mr. Cherrywood there seems to be a lot of holes in your story. Why would they never follow a river in the sky? They just never questioned why it was there?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.240
And for that matter if they never followed it why would they have a giant sailboat on standby?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.220
NC as Mr. Cherrywood: Quiet or I'll smack you with my ring hand.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.120
NC: So Jason, Kim, and the other two care bears are trapped in between worlds.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.200
Which I guess is filled with lost cereal mascots.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.360
Braveheart: Everyone in the Forest of Feelings knows of Playfulheart Monkey and Braveheart.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.280
Only for $12.49,look for them in your nearest Walmart....

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.600
[William Wallace Screams]

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.220
NC: I know. I know but how could I not put that?

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.020
So even though they're lost in the Forest of Feelings, the people of Earth are deteriorating, and Care-a-lot is falling apart that

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.620
doesn't stop our heroes from having a song number.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:47.960
Jason: *singing* Do you have a house made all out of wood for keeping you dry when it's raining?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.780
NC: Wow, that's pretty bad kid. I mean, not William Hung bad, but ...

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.540
William Hung: She-bangs! She-bangs!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.760
NC: but bad.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.820
Playfulheart: Look! I see a bee on Friend Bear's nose! Stop!

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.540
really?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.640
Kim: Stay perfectly still.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.680
Friend Bear: Oooh.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.840
NC: Um, that was totally necessary. What, was the movie like 20 seconds too short so you had to add a bee scene?

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.360
The song is pointless enough already. You don't need any more padding.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.100
Meanwhile, Nicolas and The Spirit continued to turn all the people of the world into rotten A-holes.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.160
The Spirit: These two small children still care.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.720
Nicolas:  But they were to fall under my spell.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.880
The Spirit: Ah, but those sweet, cuddly

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.260
little bears shield them from your spells with their love and caring.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:40.040
NC: What is up with this woman's voice? Is someone just eating her out while she's saying her lines?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.709
NC as Spirit: Those cute cuddly little bears--ah! Oh. Oh yes they care so much--mmm! I know a happy ending

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.080
The Spirit: You must finish it. Say it.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.600
Nicolas: Zip! Zap! Zot!

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600
WHAT THE F&amp;CK IS THAT THING!?!

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.100
[Nicolas Screams]

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.720
NC: Oh, great you unleashed Hell. The apocalypse is finally begun, and Satan is going to rule the Earth. Good job.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.400
The Spirit: Now, go!

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.400
NC: So that purple fart goes to find the others. That's the care bear ship comes across more friends that they can make good toys out of.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.060
NC: Only $9.95! Hassle, scream and yell at your parents until they finally break down and buy you one. it's more important than breathing.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.080
find them at your nearest Target

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.160
They also come across a pink elephant and

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.160
guessing the amount of booze you've probably had throughout this picture. I'm guessing you're coming across a few as well.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
[Elephant trumpet]

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.920
Things aren't so hot with Kim and Jason as the purple smoke possesses the only tree that happens to have an evil face.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.520
Kim: Aahhh! Woah!

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.280
Braveheart: Charge!

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.920
NC as William Wallace: They may take our lives, but they'll never take our marketability!

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.120
YOU FAILED MISERABLY!!!

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.180
NC: Wow. Fail.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.600
but luckily Speedy Gonhoppers comes along to save the day.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.120
Speedy: Arriva! Arriva!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.160
NC: So the new bunny friend joins them on their adventure, but unfortunately the purple smoke takes on another form.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.720
FAIL!!!!!!!

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.300
NC: You know you're really bad at that. Just think of your brave doesn't mean you're capable.

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:21.653
Friend Bear: Our only hope is a care bear stare. I just hope it works.

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:23.653
Secret Bear: There's only two of us...

00:12:23.653 --> 00:12:26.920
Friend Bear: Care Bear Stare!

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.280
Aykroyd: Start bringing him down. Start bringing him down. You got him. Don't cross the streams!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.920
Friend Bear: The two of us aren't enough.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.700
CHOMP THE RAINBOW,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.880
NC as the Bears: TASTE THE RAINBOW MOTHERFUCKER!

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.560
All: Yay!

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.800
NC: Pff- well fuck caring. The answer to this problem was violence; wonderful, caring, violence.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.480
[Braveheart roars]

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:57.400
So they gather all the other animals of the forest because there weren't enough fucking toys to sell as they find their way out of the

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.360
forest and back to Earth. How lucky the river just so happens to pass space and time.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.960
Tenderheart: Do you still have the key that I gave you?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.280
Jason: Sure do!

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.520
Tenderheart: If we lose that key Jason we can never win!

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.440
NC: That's why I'm entrusting it to a small boy I barely know.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.080
How does this make sense again?

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.640
So, Nicholas casts his spell to turn Kim and Jason into heartless jerks

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.880
but he needs them to be close in order for the spell to work.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.680
Tenderheart: Nicolas. Nicola-

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.480
Nicolas: You're too late! Too late!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.120
NC as Lugosi: I have officially become a vampire! Not one of those sparkling ones though. They totally suck ass.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.000
The Care Bears try to stop him, but the evil of the book is just way too strong.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.520
Share Bear: The spirit's power is too strong.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.760
Love-a-lot Bear: Look!

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.180
Cozyheart: Nicolas!

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.500

Nicolas: Were are they?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.640
NC: This kid could totally give the emperor from Star Wars a run for his money.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.520
Emperor's voice: No, young Skywalker you will die.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.440

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.240

[Assorted animal sounds]

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:23.600
NC: Okay guys that's really not helping. I mean, maybe get a- I don't know, a gun or some kind of a blunt instrument or uhh...

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.600
He's turning into Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.040
Judge Doom: When I killed your brother I talked just like this!

NC: That was a brick. That was literally a brick.

00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:55.569
Jason: We care about you. We used to be like you.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.840
We thought nobody cared.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.559
Kim:  but we were wrong.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.280
Now we want to be your friends Nicholas.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.720
NC: Okay, You know the drill. The kids start saying that they care about Nicholas which gives him the will to care and thus he stops using the book.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.080
Tenderheart: Jason! The Key!

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.880

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.690
What did they just want to make the little boy feel important?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.160
All: Hooray!

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.920
NC: So Care-a-lot is saved. The two kids get adopted. And Nicholas finally perfects his magic.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.129
TheCare Bears also welcome two new animal friends to be Care Bear...

[music] In the Care Bear family

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:59.800
NC: And it turns out all the children in the orphanage fell asleep. No doubt bored senseless of Mr. Cherrywood's story.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.040
Mr. Cherrywood: Now they'll never know what eventually became of Nicholas.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.080
I guess all they need to know is that he too lived happily ever after.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.400
Happier than I ever thought I could be.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:20.440
NC as Tenderheart: Good story, but he missed the part about the sodomy and the ties to the JFK assassination, but I guess that stuff wasn't very important.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.840
kkkAnd also that these subtitles have been self aware the whole time...

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:31.560
NC: So that's the Care Bears movie. How does it hold up?  Well, yeah, it's stupid, but to be fair it's for little kids

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.919
It's kind of hard to beat up on something intended from really young children.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.099
It's not good, but there's not really anything bad in it for kids.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.219
It's relatively harmless. So if you're ages one to, I don't know, one you'll probably enjoy it okay.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.040
But there's still one thing that really bothers me. Why was the book so evil?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.920
I mean, what was her motivation all this time? It doesn't make an exact --

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.120
The Spirit: Critic. Open the book Critic.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.400
You wanted to know what my motivation was?

NC: Yeah. Yeah, I do.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.720
The Spirit: It was to make the people of the world stop caring.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.120
NC: I knew that, but why do you want that to begin with?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.440
The Spirit: I don't know I don't care.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.680
NC: Oh, I see because you don't care nobody else cares. So you go around--

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.680
The Spirit: Yeah it's kind of a Catch-22

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.080
NC: Piss off

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.680
