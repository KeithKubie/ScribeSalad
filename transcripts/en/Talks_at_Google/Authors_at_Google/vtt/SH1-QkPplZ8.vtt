00:00:05.646 --> 00:00:06.770
CHRISTINE: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.330
Thank you for coming.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.380
I would like to introduce
Patricia McConnell.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.400
She is a zoologist and
certified animal behaviorist.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.100
And she has written several
really excellent books

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.920
on understanding
your dog's behavior.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.389
Her classic is for
sale in the back.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.180
Unfortunately, I screwed
up the book order.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.024
And she has a brand new
book that has just come out.

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:29.440
You guys should
all go and pick up

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.630
the classic, because it is
like the definitive guide

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.460
on understanding
your dog's behavior.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.920
And then you should
read that, and then you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.060
should go and pick up her new
book, "The Education of Will",

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.409
which is also available
from Posman Books, who

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.450
does the books for these.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.420
But she'll be signing
those at the end.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.490
And so yeah,
Patricia-- thank you.

00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:56.360
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
Thank you, Christine.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.570
Thanks for coming.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.290
Thanks, Posman Books and
Nick for bringing some books.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.510
We'll talk about
different books.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.800
Hello.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.090
Glad to see you.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.150
So the word is all
over the country

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.520
that Google is like a big
dog-lover group, which

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.470
is so cool.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.900
The fact that you have
dog-treat stations--

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.120
I have to tell you,
I'm just blown away.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.220
That's just like the
coolest business practice

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.860
I can imagine.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.530
I would imagine most of
everybody here loves dogs.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.840
Probably wouldn't
be here, right?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.990
So Here's the thing, though.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.700
Just because you love
dogs doesn't always

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.730
mean you understand them,
which makes a lot of sense,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.200
because I really, really love
lots of people in my life--

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.520
like, let me ask you this.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
Do you always understand
your partner, your husband,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
your wife, your
mother, your child?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.660
Maybe not.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.250
Perhaps not always.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.010
So love doesn't always
equal understanding.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.160
So what I'm going to talk
about in the beginning

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.110
is a little bit about tweaking--

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.150
I'm guessing because you
guys love dogs so much

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.430
and this is such a dog
culture, that you're really

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.170
pretty good at reading dogs.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.520
So I want to give the
advanced-level talk

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.740
on reading really
subtle signs of dogs

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.460
and knowing how your behavior
can have a profound influence

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.210
on their behavior.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.084
That's a lot of what I
talk about in the book

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:27.570
"The Other End of
the Leash", which

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.110
is talking about humans as
primates and dogs as canines,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.290
and comparing our behavior,
which often gets along really,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.890
really well, because
we both love to play.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.220
But dogs hate to be hugged.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.920
And primates hug all the time.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.720
So I'm actually going to
start by showing you a video.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.430
It's an advertisement.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.370
And so what I want you
to pay attention to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.500
is how the tiniest,
tiniest movement can

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.140
convey a huge, huge message.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.790
All right?

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.465
So this is communication
between humans.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:05.131
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:07.140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:22.220
By the way, research
and psychology

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.820
showed she is actually
actively flirting with him--

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.795
touching the hair,
looking over, more hair--

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.460
maybe not quite to
that extent, though.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.280
Keep watching.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.820
There.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.125
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:08.360
Did You see the double-take?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.500
How long did that last?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.060
It's like a third
of a second, right?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.950
But it conveyed a great
deal of information.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.040
So I'm going to show
you another video--

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.100
this time between dogs.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.770
And there's a tremendous amount
of communication going on

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.930
between these two dogs.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.580
This is from the internet.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.030
This is from Eastern Europe.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.500
These are two mastiffs standing
over a spilled pile of kibble.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.220
And I will tell you
right off the bat

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.610
so that you're not stressed--

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.690
there is no horrible injury.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.090
There is actually no fight here.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.220
Yes, it's OK.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.590
Don't need a trigger warning.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.800
Not necessary for dogs.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.270
I actually show a lot of videos.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.436
A lot of my work has been
with aggression with dogs.

00:04:54.436 --> 00:04:58.480
And I've shown a lot of videos
in which people were a wreck.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.220
And I learned I have
to tell them, it's OK.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.470
Nobody is going to get bitten.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.520
So here's your job.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.590
I show this video all the time
to professional dog trainers.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.240
And here's the question I
ask them, and I'll ask you.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.990
When do you know which dog
is going to get the food?

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.380
One of the dogs gets the
kibble without a fight.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.650
And I want you to call
out when you first

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.854
see a sign that you think you
can predict which dog is going

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:26.520
to get the food.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.650
That was a very
clear cue, wasn't it?

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.796
Bet you missed it.

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:54.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.850
Yep, somebody else saw it.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.960
Watch the head of the
dog in the forehand.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.350
Watch the head turned to
the right ever-- there.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.620
That's it.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.781
And watch what happens
with the dog in the back.

00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:10.280
Oh.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.130
I can maybe move forward one
inch and see what happens.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.250
And what happens is the
other dog sits down.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.799
So they've already had an
elaborate conversation.

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.590
Don't feel bad if you
missed the head turn.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.170
I didn't see it until I watched
it the second or third time.

00:06:32.997 --> 00:06:35.080
So I'm going to keep playing
it, just because it's

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.870
really fun and interesting.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.320
And it's a wonderful example
that quote "dominance"

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.260
or something very
different-- force--

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.840
those are not the
same thing at all.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.774
Force does not always
get you what you want.

00:06:51.774 --> 00:06:55.390
Do you to see the dog
in the background?

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.520
Do you see-- not
looking directly

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.070
at the other dog,
a lot of blinking.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.270
See the blinky eyes?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.102
Blinky, blinky, blinky-eyed--
a lot of appeasement behavior.

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:07.060
It's like when you order
something off the menu

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.040
and go like, I'm so
sorry, but could I

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.610
have the sweet-potato fries
instead of the regular fries?

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.170
This is appeasement behavior.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.680
But it's also a really
smart, strategic dog,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.720
because I'm just doing
one thing at a time

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.890
to see what the result is.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.260
And you're getting to--

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.000
I'm just going to lie down.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.890
I just happened to lie down.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.390
Oh, look.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.120
There's-- This is right.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.050
I just-- my nose
fell onto the ground.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.180
Cool, right?

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.890
So we can also communicate
interspecifically.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.430
We can communicate between
people and between dogs.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.370
However, we're not
always accurate.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.152
Sometimes, we get confused.

00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:58.360
I talk in "The Other End of
the Leash" about the fact

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.220
that we interpret
some things one way.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.270
Dogs interpret them another.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.270
I'm not actually going
to talk about hugs today,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.340
but that's a perfect example.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.520
Primates of almost all
species, especially apes,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.460
of which we are-- as you well
know, of which we are one--

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.390
are huggers.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.770
We hug for a variety of reasons.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.960
We hug to express love.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.270
We hug to express solace.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.590
We hug to give comfort.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.120
A hug to a dog is a threat.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.260
You ever see dogs
hug in a dog park?

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.760
No.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.380
When one dog puts an arm over
the shoulders of another dog,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.470
it's an offensive move.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.090
It's not aggressive,
necessarily.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.850
But it's a controlling,
offensive move that means,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.600
I'm on offense, you're on
defense, and I'm in charge.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.870
So how many people get bitten
when they hug their dog?

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.770
I can't tell you.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.140
I have so many clients who
got bitten because they hugged

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.460
a dog that they didn't know.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.110
And the dog took it as a threat.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.380
And the person thought they were
expressing love and comfort.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.380
So we need interpret
these things correctly.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.860
And it turns out some of us
are-- not surprisingly-- better

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.360
than others at it.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.160
This is the work
of Michelle Wan.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.400
Michelle Wan got her
PhD based on a research

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.780
project in which she videoed--

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.570
I think there were
12 videos of dogs--

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.540
little short videos
that people have sent in

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.880
of dogs behaving
in different ways.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.350
And then she asked people--

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.120
thousands of them.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.020
She did online.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.120
She has thousands and
thousands of people

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.760
to tell her to rank how
stressed this dog is.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.840
Is the dog frightened?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.830
Is the dog happy?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.770
Basically, rate the
emotional state of the dog

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.390
you're looking at.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.390
So I'm going to ask you.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.000
Before I tell you, I'm going
to ask you to rate this one.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.370
So what would you
say about this dog?

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.150
Yes.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.480
And the first thing I
would ask, is it hot?

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.880
Is it hot outside?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.590
But stressed-- absolutely.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.690
And here's what
turned out to be--

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.140
I guess, not shocking--

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.372
apparently shocking
to some, but still

00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:17.580
a really, really interesting.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.600
She rated people
based on how much

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.250
experience they had with dogs.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.460
Are you a PhD-certified
applied animal behaviorist?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.510
That would be me.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.000
Are you someone who
has never had a dog?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.400
Are you someone who's
had a dog all your life

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.130
but just one dog at a time?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.200
And not surprisingly, the
more experience people had,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.880
the more likely they were to
say, this dog, for example,

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.050
was stressed.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.590
Lots and lots and lots of people
who had dogs and loved them

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.820
that didn't have a lot
of experience with them

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.120
said this dog is
happy and friendly.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.550
And there's something that--

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:02.530
[DOG BARKING NOISES]
I love dog talk.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.090
So I want you to
watch something.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.230
Did you pay attention to the
hindquarters of this dog?

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.750
Look at its hindquarters.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.767
Something's wrong
physically with that dog.

00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:14.350
So one of the things
I would have said

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.800
is, I want to take this dog to
a sports-medicine physiologist,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.650
because he's not putting
any weight on his back end,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.710
especially his back right.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.210
There's just so much we
can see if we get really,

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:31.400
really good at paying
really careful attention.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.130
So let's start with
facial expressions,

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.680
because we are
primates after all.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.944
And facial expressions are
incredibly important to us.

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:41.110
And it turns out they're
are important to dogs, too.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.180
Dogs are highly social.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.270
Social animals tend
to have very plastic,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.700
labile faces that are
emotionally expressive.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.440
So compare a dog's face and
all the different expressions

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.280
you can see on a dog's
face with a panda bear.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.230
Panda bears are adorable.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.700
I mean, they're incredibly cute.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.170
And they're just vicious
as hell, basically.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.520
That's not fair to say to them.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.740
But they're asocial.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.540
They're solitary animals.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.200
They don't need to
express emotions

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.310
or what they're about
to do in their face.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.520
And you can just look
across the board.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.985
Who loves horses here?

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:21.820
Do we have horse lovers?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.060
Horses are highly social.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.780
But they don't have an
elaborate social system

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.469
as dogs and primates do.

00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:29.260
And I think part of
the reason we get along

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.460
with dogs so well is their faces
are so plastic and expressive.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.770
And as we'll find out,
many of their expressions

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.510
are very similar to ours.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.880
So if you compare--

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.610
one of my other books is
"For the Love of a Dog--

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:50.260
Understanding Emotions in
People and Your Best Friend".

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.480
I knew that there was
a lot of similarity

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.950
between expressions of people
and expressions on dogs' faces.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.500
But honestly, I had no idea how
much until I wrote that book.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.850
I was blown away.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.350
If you analyze it down to the
level of individual muscles,

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.140
literally, the same
muscles get moved

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.170
when dogs are happy,
when dogs are fearful,

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.820
when dogs are angry.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.010
So on the left,
you can see fear.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.830
And by the way, the
photos of the people

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.810
are from Dr. Paul Ekman.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:23.800
He's a psychologist.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.440
He went around the world
studying expressions

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.140
of emotions in a
range of cultures

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.220
and basically found that
people look happy, or sad,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.080
or frightened, no
matter what culture they

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.640
are, whether they
are a New Guinean

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.690
If preindustrial
hunter-gatherer society.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.630
They look happy when they're
happy in the same way

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.060
that we look happy
when we're happy.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.160
By the way, when it
came out in the--

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.270
oh man, what was it?

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.150
I think it was maybe
the '40s and '50.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.130
It was really controversial.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.160
It was when Margaret Mead
came out and was talking

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.650
about the importance
of culture and how

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.470
so much was enculturated
and so little was genetic.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.304
And that was sort of a hot
belief perspective at the time.

00:14:09.304 --> 00:14:10.720
And Ekman came out
and said, yeah,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.800
but expressions are
actually universal.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.630
He got trashed.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.340
I mean, somebody poured
water on his head

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.320
at a scientific conference.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.950
I'm serious.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.939
If you think science
is like this--

00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:21.980
I don't need to tell you.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.480
I mean, really.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.330
People can get very agitated.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.770
So it turned out
Ekman was right.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.170
Margaret Mead was wrong.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.590
But if you compare, it not just
within people across the world.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.520
It's also within species,
because frightened dogs--

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.860
do you see the
corners of the mouth?

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.469
Frightened dogs pull the
corners of their mouth back.

00:14:43.469 --> 00:14:45.260
The commissure is the
corner of your mouth.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.330
So it's a retracted commissure.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.790
And when we're frightened,
we do the same thing.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.790
The eyes also-- the preorbital
muscles around the eye

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.590
do the same thing.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.760
Happy, relaxed faces on people
and dogs are very similar--

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.300
relaxed muscles, sort of
open-faced, and very often,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.080
an open mouth.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.996
And I'm going to talk
about mouse in a minute,

00:15:04.996 --> 00:15:07.970
because that's one of the ways
to keep from getting bitten

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.900
by a dog you don't know.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.742
Anger-- now this is
more controversial.

00:15:12.742 --> 00:15:15.200
I actually gave a talk at the
National Institute of Health.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.696
And I was talking
about this work

00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:19.820
and making the comparisons.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.160
And I said, the faces
of a dog when it's angry

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.120
is similar to the face of a
person when they're angry.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:31.640
And after my talk, a
battery behaviorist actually

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.440
stood up-- literally, and
ironically, shaking with anger,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.920
and said, how dare you
talk about anger in dogs.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.770
That's an anthropomorphic
attribution

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.090
that has no basis in fact.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.530
And you're going to-- and
then she sort of launched.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:52.400
And I've never been quite
that attacked publicly.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.060
And so when I sat down,
one of the leaders

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.460
in the field of anthrozoology,
James Serpell said, what

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.060
the hell did you do to her?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.610
But what I did to
her was I suggested

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.140
that the paragons of love--

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.140
you know, the dogs who give us
non-judgmental positive regard

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.500
and constant unconditional
love could actually get angry.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.020
Well the fact of the matter
is, if a mammal can be fearful,

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.480
they can get angry, because
those two things are paired

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.170
together in the amygdala.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.350
And the flip side
of fear is anger.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.750
And as we all know--

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:32.120
ask anybody in the military,
ask any police officer,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.890
who is most dangerous?

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.090
It's a frightened person.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.020
Frightened people can
become angry people.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.740
And they can get
really dangerous.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.190
And when people
are really angry,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.180
they make the mouth and the
face of that woman on the top.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.960
And dogs-- I'm not
saying they have

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.196
the exact same emotional
internal state.

00:16:57.196 --> 00:16:58.070
Of course they don't.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.194
I mean, I don't have the
exact same emotional state

00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:01.640
of any of you out there.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.250
But is the glass half empty
and a glass half full?

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.440
And what I will tell you
is that a dog with a face

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.190
like that dog on the bottom,
that is a dog on offense.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.339
And that is a dog
willing to do something.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.606
Anger is an emotion
that provides energy.

00:17:15.606 --> 00:17:16.730
That's what anger is about.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.970
Anger is about
providing energy to help

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.200
you fight for your life, to
fight for your baby's life.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.754
And when you get
really angry, you

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.170
know how you want
to do something?

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.810
And when you get smarter,
you're like, just calm down.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.850
Just take a breath.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.220
So this is a dog who
has a valuable resource

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.440
right under his
paws, and somebody

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.100
is about to take it away.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.540
That is not a dog I would
reach my hand towards and take

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.670
something away, because
it's telling me,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.990
I am full of energy.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.000
And I'm on offense.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.400
And I'm willing to use it.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.640
So eyes-- what's more important
in human communication

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.710
than eyes?

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.580
Eyes are really,
really important.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.520
As we all know, in our species--

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.420
and you all know--
with dogs, eye contact

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.180
can be really friendly,
especially really soft

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.930
and squinty looks,
or threatening.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.440
People talk about hard-eye.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.800
Hard-eye is a round,
fixed eye on a dog.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.170
It's really hard to
get a photograph of,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.400
because it doesn't last long.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.434
And if you get too close,
you're going to get bitten.

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.600
I actually looked for years.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.390
People said, watch for
the dog, because I'm

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.610
specialize in aggression.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:29.990
So my mentors were
like, watch for when

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.060
the dog's eyes go hard.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.366
And I kept looking for it.

00:18:33.366 --> 00:18:34.490
I was like, I don't see it.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.090
I don't see it.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.550
I don't know what
they're talking about.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.790
I asked them to describe it.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.260
And they were
like, I don't know.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.820
I don't know what it is.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.910
I think what it is, is there are
different levels of nystagmus,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.980
which is your eyeballs
actually moving back and forth.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.650
It's a way of
triangulating the world.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.930
It gives your brain
lots of information.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.960
So visually, right now, just
watching me or the screen,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.090
your eyeballs are actually
going back and forth

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.770
the tiniest little
bit to triangulate,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.690
to give you information about
depth perception and location.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.350
During certain potentially
frightening or dangerous

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.260
encounters, what
happens is that stops.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.775
You get information
from the brain.

00:19:14.775 --> 00:19:17.640
It signals your
neurophysiological system.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.040
And everything
stops for a second.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.260
And I finally saw it on a dog.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.790
She was visiting the farm.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.242
She grabbed a dead bird.

00:19:25.242 --> 00:19:26.700
I went to take it
out of her mouth.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.150
And the coolest thing
was that my body saw it

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.370
before I consciously
registered it.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.780
So I went to reach towards her.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.840
And I literally felt
this gut warning system.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.710
It was like a-ooga, a-ooga.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.980
Dive, dive.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.510
Literally, what I felt
was chill in my body.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.634
And then I was like, cool.

00:19:49.634 --> 00:19:50.300
That's hard-eye.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.410
I saw hard-eye.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.330
I finally saw it.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.210
So basically, usually, it's not
just the eye that goes still.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.680
It's the whole body
that goes still.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.580
Anytime I'm working
with a dog I don't know,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.640
I am watching for a loose
body versus a still body.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.180
And one of the mistakes
people sometimes make,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.380
relatively often, is
they will sort of--

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.110
we're told when we're
kids, be a tree.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.610
So they'll go like this.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.840
And dogs are like, oh, shit.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.510
They are so dangerous,
because they're

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.950
totally stiff and still.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.720
And that's what dogs do when
they're fearful and believe

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.420
that they're in danger.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.375
So the dog on the
bottom right, that's

00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.150
a dog actually in a shelter.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.370
This is a dog that
would literally

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.020
scare me to death if I was on
the other end of the leash,

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.205
because the whole body is tense.

00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:44.580
It's looking directly into
the eyes of the person holding

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.450
the leash.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.640
And it's a hard, direct stare.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.370
That dog is basically
saying, make my day.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:51.960
Just move.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.480
Just give me a reason.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.960
So that's when you start--

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.247
you go really
loose, and you sing.

00:21:00.247 --> 00:21:01.830
And then you try and
distract the dog.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.080
And you say, hey, you
want to go on a walk?

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.820
If you're dealing
with a dog that you're

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.340
worried about, if you say,
you want to go on a walk,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.610
you want your ball, you
want to treat or something--

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.880
I can't tell you how
many dogs I've flipped.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.915
You know, there's this
German shepherd like,

00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:18.460
[VICIOUS BARKING NOISES]
outside somebody's door,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.370
because they forgot
to take the dog who

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.245
bites people-- when they
come to visit-- they

00:21:22.245 --> 00:21:23.550
forgot to take the dog inside.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.830
When I came out and
I got out of my car,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.237
there's this huge dog going
[VICIOUS BARKKING NOISES]

00:21:29.237 --> 00:21:31.320
And so I don't know how
many times I've been like,

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.460
you want to play ball?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.930
And they're like,
yeah, I do, yeah.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.720
Distraction is really good.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.760
The direct stare is
a really big deal.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.940
And this is why a lot
of kids get bitten,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.210
because they get right in the
face of a dog, and they lean--

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.060
will he bite me?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.990
I don't know if he's
[INAUDIBLE] They lean.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.280
And they loom and they lean.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.997
And they look directly into
the face of somebody else.

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:58.080
And it's funny, because
we should understand this,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.020
because if you were walking
down the street and somebody you

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.120
didn't know walked
up to you, you know,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.870
and just walk
straight up to you.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:12.780
And we're like,
[BABY TALK],, right?

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.650
I'd friggin' kill him.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.860
But we do that to dogs all the
time, and we think it's good.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.980
Here are two individuals of
different species who get that.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.260
Watch how hard they work
to not look at each other.

00:22:31.938 --> 00:22:33.846
Yep, nope.

00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:35.190
Nope.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.690
Nope.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.481
Don't see anything.

00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.150
Yep, nope.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.150
Nope.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.150
Yep, nope.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.650
Nope.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.950
Yep.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.898
Nope.

00:22:44.898 --> 00:22:45.872
Ah!

00:22:45.872 --> 00:22:48.310
Yep.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.475
Now I can look.

00:22:51.475 --> 00:22:53.410
I love that video.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.650
So be really careful
of direct contact.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.560
I meet a lot of
dogs sideways, and I

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.262
lean backwards a little bit.

00:23:01.262 --> 00:23:03.470
Because we're going to talk
about looming in a minute

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.540
and how important that is.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.060
So still on eyes--

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.500
I call this the anti-Botox
dog trainer trick--

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.120
is squinty eyes in
both humans and dogs

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.000
usually means relaxed and happy.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.794
So I literally will meet dogs
going like, hi, how are you?

00:23:23.794 --> 00:23:24.650
Hi!

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.750
So the more wrinkles
you can get, the better.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:28.610
This is good.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.300
Wrinkles are good.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.970
I have wrinkles.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.170
Again, rounded eyes, aroused.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.050
And so this dog on the
left, that's a sled dog.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.030
I was at the sled dog race.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.240
And the dog's chained.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.800
So any dog who's
trapped is going

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.700
to be more potentially
on, sort of, defensive--

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.030
potential defensive aggression.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.380
Also, see the pupils.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.710
Holy, moly.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.990
Widely dilated
pupils which often

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.750
means arousal or fear,
or constricted pupils,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.910
means that dog's
about to attack you.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.180
This dog, however, is looking
directly into the sun.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.584
And it was snowing
really bright.

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:12.000
So this dog's eyes
are just trying

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.610
to protect his brain from
being brought out, basically.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:18.210
So you do need to
look at context.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:18.960
Whale eye.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.810
This is something trainers
talk about all the time.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.100
So you meet a dog you've
never met, or your own dog.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.880
And somebody comes
up to your dog.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.870
And your dog turns its
head a little bit away,

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.970
so here's who I'm greeting.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:38.820
And then-- and then
turns the eyes back.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.430
So you see a lot of
white of the eye.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.019
I call it the horror movie
thing, where you're watching,

00:24:43.019 --> 00:24:44.310
and you're like, I can't watch.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.500
And then you can't not watch,
because if you're not watching,

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.810
you may be killed by
the whatever, you know,

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.130
the monster thing.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.470
But it's like so scary, so
you turn your head away.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.220
But then you look.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.340
So you get this white of the
eye and the side of the eye.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.530
It's a classic example of
a dog who's uncomfortable.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.950
So this is a poor little
Rottie in a shelter, who

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.840
somebody went up to and said,
you know, woosy, woosy, do

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.420
you want to come home with me?

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.530
And the Rottweiler was
like, I'm terrified of you.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.109
I'm not going to leave.

00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:16.150
I'm going to turn my head
away, but I'm not going

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.898
to take my eyes off of you.

00:25:18.898 --> 00:25:21.160
This is my favorite
whale eye picture.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.930
This was brought to me
when I was doing a seminar

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.620
about the other end of the
leash kind of stuff, primate

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.170
versus canid, hugging.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.810
So look how happy that kid is.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.100
Squinty, happy eyes, open mouth.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.520
Oh, so happy.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.840
Look how happy the dog is.

00:25:41.412 --> 00:25:42.120
It's the hugging.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.280
The dog is being hugged.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.000
Scary.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.810
So the mouth is also
really important.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:52.400
I showed you pictures of
this forward commissure.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.880
And so a forward commissure
doesn't necessarily

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.030
mean the dog is angry.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.970
But it means it's on offense.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.895
On defense-- when
you see dogs playing,

00:26:01.895 --> 00:26:04.520
for example, you'll see one with
the corners of the mouth back,

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.420
and you'll see one with the
corners of the mouth forward.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.930
It's not an area of the body
people tend to pay attention to

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.329
on the dogs very much.

00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:11.120
But start watching.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.560
Because it's very cool.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.070
So the wolves on the right--

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.620
one is in a higher
status situation.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.600
See the commissure
is slightly forward.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.055
Dog in the back is doing
a little tongue flick.

00:26:22.055 --> 00:26:23.430
That little tongue
flick is often

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:28.207
the sign of either appeasement
or low level anxiety.

00:26:28.207 --> 00:26:30.290
So you go to a vet clinic,
you'll see tongues just

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.570
flapping everywhere.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.300
Just tongue flick, tongue flick.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.600
Horses do it too, by the way.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.660
And it turns out
that so do people.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.394
So that's another
thing to watch for.

00:26:40.394 --> 00:26:41.810
When you're meeting
with somebody,

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.740
you see them do this
a lot, they're nervous

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.030
or they're anxious.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.200
Or their lips are really
dry, or I don't know.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.690
I have an overactive tongue.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.240
So this is the
classic scary dog.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.417
This dog is terrified.

00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:59.750
And we know it's terrified
because the commissure-- look

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.690
at the commissure.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.600
That is a fear grimace
as big as you can make.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.350
That dog's really terrified.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.050
And you see the
muscles over the eyes.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.270
See how they're contracted.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:17.760
The eyebrow-like area is like
pushed medially and down,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.610
in the classic "I'm
worried" position.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.930
It's the same thing that
people do with their faces.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.200
So what we're looking for--

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.800
if you want to know if your
dog is relaxed and happy,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.910
you're looking for neutral eyes,
relaxed muscles, and especially

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.500
that open mouth.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.000
I can't tell you
how many clients I

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.970
get come to my office, and
they'd say, here's Barney.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:42.150
And I'd say, I'm just going
to let Barney just walk around

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.637
the office and sniff the carpet.

00:27:43.637 --> 00:27:44.970
Barney's looking pretty nervous.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.410
His mouth is, like, glued shut,
and he looks pretty tense.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.390
And every action
is sort of stiff.

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.030
I'm just going to not
pay attention to him.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:54.970
And I will wait.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.240
And I actually have in my
notes, every client I see,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.540
how long it took the
dog to open his mouth.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:05.080
It's a wonderful, wonderful
way to pay attention to a dog.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.450
So let's talk
tails for a minute.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.460
Just watch this video, and just
watch how much is going on.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:28.450
So you can see, tails are moving
in a whole variety of ways.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.594
So I think of dog's
tails as another--

00:28:32.594 --> 00:28:34.510
I'm going to play it
again, a couple of times,

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:38.440
actually-- as another
equivalent of the human mouth.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.660
So it's like a smile.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.830
So we can smile in a
whole variety of ways.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.840
So there's like. oh, hi!

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.350
So thank you for coming.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.210
So glad to see--

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.830
there's a true
smile that affects--

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.100
it's called a Duchenne smile.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.030
It affects the muscles
around the eye.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.670
So watch for people's
eyes to get crinkly.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.330
Because if they don't, then
there's that social smile.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.160
They're so like, right.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.600
Right.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.530
Oh, what an interesting sweater.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.900
There is that smile.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.080
So dogs can do the same
things with their tails.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.370
Dogs can move their tails in a
myriad of ways, some of which

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.560
you are looking for a big, wide,
sweeping, relaxed tail, where

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.970
all the muscles are relaxed.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.340
Tail is sweeping back and forth.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.260
That's a relaxed dog.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:39.120
But I have had, literally, over
100 clients who said to me,

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.880
his tail was wagging, and
so we thought he was fine.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.880
And so that's why
I went to pet him.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.250
Or that's why I let
my friends pet him.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.860
Wagging tails are no
more a sign of happiness

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.930
than all versions of smiles
are signs of happiness.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:59.280
The kind of a stiff body,
base of the tail not moving,

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.900
and just top of the tail moving,
we think what that means--

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.630
we're not sure, but
the research suggests

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.340
that's a dog who is basically
encouraging decreasing

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.680
the distance between it
and another individual,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.205
but not necessarily
for good purposes.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:26.370
So there's also some
research about the direction

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.860
of tail movement
makes a difference.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.180
Let's just watch one dog now.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.120
Pay attention to the little
black and white terrier cross.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.750
Watch that dog's tail.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.920
So see it's mostly
moving to one side.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.540
Now it's freer and bigger.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.640
And now it went
over to the right.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.180
See that?

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.370
So it turns out--

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.180
it turns out there's research
that tells us, perhaps,

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.290
what this means.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.650
And I have to tell
you, I watched

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.530
relax sweeps versus stiff wags.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.900
But I never paid
attention to which way

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.620
a dog's tail was wagging
until this research came out.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.110
So this Italian
researcher, Quaranta,

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:19.720
did this really great work
in which, basically, they

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:27.490
quantified the sweep, the
magnitude, and the direction

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.102
of a tail wag.

00:31:29.102 --> 00:31:31.560
They had a device overhead,
and so they watched it straight

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.090
down from a bird's eye view.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.890
They quantified it, depending
on what was approaching the dog.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.800
Was it an owner?

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.911
Was it a dog that the
dog had never met?

00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:43.410
And so, basically, what they
found was illustrated perfectly

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.760
by that Terrier.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.442
So there was a right side bias
towards the owner or something

00:31:48.442 --> 00:31:49.650
the dog was comfortable with.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.130
Just like you saw
with the Terrier who

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.240
was meeting that really
sweet, soppy little

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.940
Golden who was in that
super appeasing position

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.440
with its tail flattened.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.420
[DOG TALK] says hi.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.750
And I'm glad to see you.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.646
And as soon as he was
greeted by that dog,

00:32:06.646 --> 00:32:07.770
the tail went to the right.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.670
When it was being
greeted by that Husky,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.760
that I would suggest, given
the tail posture and the way

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.480
the Husky came up, the Terrier
was a little intimidated by,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.620
it went to the left side.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.350
So go home and start
watching your dog's tail.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.670
And I'll tell you it's awful.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.880
Because for a couple of days,
you're going to be like,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.480
I don't know.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.377
Is it going-- which way?

00:32:29.377 --> 00:32:31.210
And then once I was
walking down the stairs,

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.490
and my dog's tail kept
going to the left.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.484
I was like, oh, no, my
dog doesn't love me.

00:32:37.484 --> 00:32:39.900
But I was walking down-- he's
at the bottom of the stairs,

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.310
and I'm walking down the stairs.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.774
This was Willy.

00:32:42.774 --> 00:32:44.190
And then when I
got to the stairs,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.280
it switched to the other side.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.860
So pay a lot of attention.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.140
Because I think we
have a lot to learn.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.930
Obviously, we have
a lot to learn.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.630
It's really fun stuff.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:59.020
So looming, I referenced
this a little bit earlier.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.020
Looming over dogs is the
perfect way to get bitten.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.660
And I would guess, honestly--
and I'm making this number

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.300
up completely, because nobody
has done the research--

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.360
but I would almost
guarantee you it

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.630
causes 50% of the
bites in this country.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:16.210
Because one, little kids
don't know not to do it.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.700
The most common
demographic of a dog bite

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.630
is a five to seven-year-old boy.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.690
Are we surprised?

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.110
No.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.966
And kids don't know.

00:33:27.966 --> 00:33:29.340
You know, they
really don't know.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.930
They run up, and they want to
hug, and they want to loom,

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.870
and they want to do that hi
ya thing, right in faces.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.120
But even if nobody is
reaching out to peck,

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.380
look at the physics of this.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.140
I mean, it's really--
or the geometry.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.760
It's really, really simple.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.580
When dogs are
confronting others--

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.530
and some would call
this a dominant posture.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.260
We can talk about the D
word later, if there's time.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.190
It's very controversial.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.850
It's been misinterpreted and
misused just relentlessly.

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.620
But so one dog is in
an offensive position.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.820
Another dog is in a
defensive position.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.220
They loom.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.150
And I actually had--

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.670
I had somebody, I think
it was on my blog--

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.375
who wrote, I have a
dog who never bites.

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:14.250
There was this case
where the dog never, ever

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.659
bites another dog.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.830
But at a dog park, he
sort of knocks dogs over,

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:21.000
and then stands over them,
and then won't let them up.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.800
Is that aggression?

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.600
I'm like, yeah.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.820
Yeah.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.020
That's called really
serious bullying behavior.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.690
I mean, little
dogs on the bottom,

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.409
they can be terrified by that.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.540
I mean, it's just jerks.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.360
So if you have a dog who
does that, then teach them--

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.139
it's not that hard-- just
teach them to be called away

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:44.437
when we ask them.

00:34:44.437 --> 00:34:45.770
So it would be like, that'll do.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.752
Here, here.

00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:48.210
So if you have a
dog like that, you

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.899
need to be sure that you have
enough obedience on that dog,

00:34:50.899 --> 00:34:53.190
enough training on the dog,
you can just call him away.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.630
Because it's really rude.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.060
But also, when
you meet a dog you

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.100
don't know, be really thoughtful
about this versus this.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.590
Because one of the cool things
about my field in zoology

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.180
was ethology, which
is a lot about-- well,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.760
it's about behavior
in the field.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.790
But I specialize
in communication.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.530
And one of the
things we all know

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.290
is that a tiny
shift-- so I'm going

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.860
to lean one way or the other,
like a half an inch, OK?

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.850
So tell me which way.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:24.900
Am I leaning forward
or backwards?

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.849
So that was like, I
couldn't move less.

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:29.640
I don't know how much
I moved, but it's not

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.070
possible to move less.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:32.700
And you saw it.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.370
You all saw it, right?

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.910
That's a tiny bit forward.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.580
Dogs are brilliant
at reading this.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.240
So when I meet dogs who
are defensively aggressive,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.640
the first thing I do
is I stand sideways--

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.500
because I don't want
to loom, right--

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.190
I stand sideways, and I put
my weight on my back leg.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.710
Because that's a
huge cue to them.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.550
They got it.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:00.687
I'm already saying, I'm
not going after you.

00:36:00.687 --> 00:36:01.270
I'm back here.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.590
We're good.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.860
I'm the Mastiff who's
going to get the food.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.740
But I'm like, I'm good.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:14.560
Versus the other dog who's like,
[GROWLING] who got nothing.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.440
Because again, force doesn't
always get you what you want.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.870
This is an ancient, old video.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:24.370
So I apologize for the quality.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.670
But this is my Lassie,
long since gone.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:32.020
Bless her adorable, sweet,
ice cream, little heart.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.110
Lassie was just
learning to work sheep.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.700
And she's at a friend's farm.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.780
This is Beth Miller.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.110
And she's working sheep
who have baby lambs.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:48.010
Sheep are not-- people
think sheep are defenseless,

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.050
frightened, docile.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:50.800
Yeah, they're not.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.050
They have heads like anvils.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:56.800
And they can, like, smash
you into the ground.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.410
And they usually don't
choose to do that.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.970
But the mothers who
have babies, who

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.950
are being faced with a
predator, a canid, who

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:08.890
could eat their babies,
they can be very defensive.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.540
So watch Lassie.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.070
And watch where her
center of gravity is.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.020
And watch the effect
that it has on the sheep.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.186
And then we're going to
compare it with another dog.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.780
So these are sheep with lambs
in a corner, which is like sheep

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.230
herding graduate school.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.260
basically.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.810
So see the blackface
just challenged her?

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.372
And Lassie was like, oh, shit.

00:37:36.372 --> 00:37:37.455
I'm going to go over here.

00:37:39.825 --> 00:37:41.200
So Beth is doing
the right thing.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.360
She's protecting the dog.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.080
I've had to do this
with my current dog.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.954
You basically have to
teach-- they don't know

00:37:45.954 --> 00:37:47.950
they have teeth in their mouth.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:52.060
Life's not fair So I'm
actually going to fast forward

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:52.960
to the opposite.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.570
So Lassie became a
great herding dog.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.550
So this is an older dog
who is the opposite.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.810
And watch the direction
of his energy.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.330
And watch the
reaction of the sheep.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.242
So this is a very
confident older dog

00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:08.450
who's being asked to walk up.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.460
So each step predicts that
he's going to move forward

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.510
the next time, right?

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.774
She puts her-- it's
a little try here,

00:38:19.774 --> 00:38:21.190
so she just went
a little forward.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.810
And the dog was like, um, yeah,
that's going to get me closer.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.641
And now he does a really wise
thing, which you might think

00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:29.140
is weak.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.540
But it's actually
strategic and really smart.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.240
He's going to get
attacked, or threatened.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.220
And he's going to lie
down, which is brilliant.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.340
Because it's like, I don't want
to get in a fight with you.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.044
We're good.

00:38:40.044 --> 00:38:40.960
Did you see the stomp?

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.220
Did you see the
blackface stomper?

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.000
She just turned.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.970
So he just-- it's
like, yeah, we're good.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.430
But I'm not backing up an inch.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.120
I'm going to lie down to
take the pressure off of you.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.730
But I'm not backing up an
inch, not a half an inch,

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.450
not a quarter of an inch.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:00.250
I'm just here, and you're
going to leave the corner.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.720
Yes, you are.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.130
We're good, girls.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.920
And there we go.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.990
So isn't that a great example?

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:12.267
So pay a lot of attention,
when you're meeting

00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:13.350
a dog, where your body is.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.250
Because believe me, your dog
is paying a lot of attention.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.530
Here's another not
particularly great video.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.890
This is just, actually, me
teaching two dogs to stay,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.030
using a combination of
positive reinforcement.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.600
They've never heard
this command before.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.070
I would never normally throw a
treat behind me to test them.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.800
Normally, I would just
be giving them treats.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.242
See, she shook off a little bit.

00:39:36.242 --> 00:39:37.450
That was just, what happened.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.880
I'm a little nervous here.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.720
So this is Diesel.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.700
So he's never been taught stay.

00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:47.180
And again, I would normally
never go that fast.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.750
So I body blocked him,
just using my body.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.450
Never touched him.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.572
And then I give him treats
for being where I wanted him.

00:39:54.572 --> 00:39:55.780
And I'm going to do it again.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.160
This is only the second time
this dog has ever been told,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.660
stay.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.360
And watch my face.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.485
It's like, holy god,
this stuff works.

00:40:05.485 --> 00:40:08.340
How cool is that?

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.690
So one of the things--

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.270
I don't have time to talk
about sound very much.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.420
That was what my PhD
was actually on, sound.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.700
And basically reminds
us that short, rapidly

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.760
repeated notes, like
bup, bup, bup, bup,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:26.850
encourage dogs, speed dogs up,
and good dog, stay, lie down,

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.890
soothes and slows them.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.010
But after that, after spending
all these years studying sound,

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.080
I started training classes.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.170
And I discovered that honestly,
the dogs were preferentially

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.910
paying attention
to visual signals.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:43.910
And so that's the biggest thing
you could learn from today.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.849
Your dog is always watching you.

00:40:45.849 --> 00:40:47.390
All this stuff comes
out of our mouth

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.500
because we're
primates and humans.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.390
They're watching you.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.512
And that overrides
what you have to say.

00:40:52.512 --> 00:40:53.720
There's a little study I did.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.180
We taught dogs to sit and
stay to a visual signal,

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.000
and simultaneously, an acoustic
signal, and then tested

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.620
them one by one.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.230
So the five Border Collie
puppies all did better.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.530
They had five possible correct
answers, five out of five

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.380
visual, puppy one
through four, acoustic--

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.540
not so good, right?

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.317
These are the Beagles.

00:41:13.317 --> 00:41:15.650
This is my "that will teach
you to call your beagle when

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.980
running in the woods" data set.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.830
So they were all taught to
sit to a sound and an action.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.560
And none of them paid
attention to the sound, at all,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.180
whatsoever.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:35.210
So one of the things to think
about is that every signal--

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.550
if you think about
it ethologically,

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.060
from my background as a
biologist-- every cue,

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.070
every movement,
every signal, has

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:47.600
a message from the
sender to the receiver.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.830
But what the receiver
gets is the meaning.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.900
So when we analyze
cues and signals,

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.830
like movements, like
leaning forward,

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.870
are we always asking
ourselves, is it an expression

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.280
in the internal state?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.410
Is it a predictor
of future behavior?

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.570
Or is it an attempt
to influence another?

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.660
And what I want to focus
on at the end of my talk

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.680
is the internal state.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.164
These are, of
course, all combined.

00:42:12.164 --> 00:42:13.580
Internal state
will often tell you

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.550
what the animal is about
to do, and often is

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.940
an attempt to influence
the behavior of another.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.281
But I want to focus on the
internal state of emotions

00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:23.780
right now.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.580
Because emotions in
animals are actually

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.950
still very controversial.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:33.050
This is a email I got after
one of my books came out.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.180
"Tell Patricia she's a
naive sentimental fool

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.350
for believing dogs love us.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.730
What total bullshit.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.600
Dogs don't love us.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.247
It's modified
groveling pack behavior

00:42:40.247 --> 00:42:41.330
due to selective breeding.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.470
Dogs are lobotomized wolves."

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.990
I would argue that our
relationship with each other

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.000
is actually modified
groveling pack behavior.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.060
Because we're all doing
it to meet our own needs.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.420
I love my husband.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.110
I'm happy to do
groveling modified pack

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.940
behavior to keep him happy.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.440
Because he's a wonderful man.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.660
And I love him, and
I like being married.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:07.270
So yeah, we're all doing that.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:08.920
And it doesn't mean that--

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.260
it doesn't mean that
dogs don't have emotions.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.920
So here's a very quick video
of a somewhat controversial

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.830
emotion, which is jealousy.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.740
Some people think
dogs can be jealous.

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.120
Some people think only
humans can be jealous.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.514
It's a secondary, more
complicated emotion.

00:43:24.514 --> 00:43:25.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.010
- So that's the
experiment we did.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.960
Recently, we video
taped these new monkeys

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.970
who had never done this task,
thinking that maybe they

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.261
would have a stronger reaction.

00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:33.820
And that turned out to be right.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.115
The one on the left is the
monkey who gets cucumber.

00:43:36.115 --> 00:43:39.110
The one on the right is
the one who gets grapes.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.440
The one who gets cucumber,
note that the first piece

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.030
of cucumber is perfectly fine.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.612
The first piece he eats.

00:43:45.612 --> 00:43:47.320
Then he sees the other
one getting grape,

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.410
and you will see what happens.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.900
So she gives a rock to us.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.340
That's the task.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.215
And we give her a piece of
cucumber, and she eats it.

00:43:55.215 --> 00:43:58.680
The other one needs
to give a rock to us.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.775
And that's what she does.

00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:03.096
And she gets a grape.

00:44:03.096 --> 00:44:04.440
And she eats it.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.300
The other one sees that.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.320
She gives a rock to us.

PATRICIA MCCONNELL: if
that's not jealousy,

00:44:43.361 --> 00:44:45.534
I don't know what is.

00:44:45.534 --> 00:44:47.450
I think it's a very
simple emotion, basically.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.790
I think of course
dogs can be jealous,

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.230
it's just sort of angry
because they're not

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:52.021
getting something
somebody else is getting.

00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:54.900
How cognitively complicated
do you have to be.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.220
However, there's another
emotion that is often,

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.350
I think, misattributed
to dogs often,

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.890
which is guilt. You came home.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.630
Your dog ripped up the pillow.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.200
And your dog is like, right?

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.280
And he looks guilty.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.190
I know he knows he shouldn't do
that because he looks guilty.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.770
Here's a summary by my
colleague Julie Hecht,

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.390
who did work with
Alexander Horowitz

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:23.929

you hear-- this dog went viral.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.090
is expression we haven't
had to talk about.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.900
It's appeasement.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.010
It looks like smiling.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.700
It's cuter than hell.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.880
But it's appeasement.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:48.680
It's not guilt. Dog was
on "Good Morning America,"

PATRICIA MCCONNELL: There it is.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.630
That is appeasement.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.500
It is not guilt. Am I saying
dogs can never be guilty?

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.910
I'm not saying they
can't, but it's very rare.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.800
And mostly what we're
seeing is appeasement.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.470
And it's really different, and
we need to pay attention to it.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.962
So if you're into
dog cognition--

00:46:54.962 --> 00:46:56.420
I won't spend too
much time on it--

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.970
but there's a phenomenal amount
of research going on about

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.310
canine cognition and the mind.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.070
Gregory Berns taught
dogs, using nothing

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.890
but positive reinforcement,
to lay absolutely motionless

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.160
in an MRI machine.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.180
How cool is that?

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.430
And so they're doing MRI
brain studies on dogs.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:16.300
And all kinds of really
wonderful stuff is coming up.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.770
One of the things that we need
to understand more about--

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:21.520
and I'm going to end talking
about-- a uncomfortable

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.130
emotion, the emotion of fear.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:29.770
Honestly, every behaviorist that
I know agrees that at least 90%

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.340
of the serious
behavioral problems,

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.550
especially aggression,
that people have with dogs

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.530
relates to fear.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.820
People are very bad at reading
fear on the face of a dog.

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.530
I can't tell you how
many times people

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.130
have misread a fearful
face as a happy face,

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.640
or just not seen more
subtle signs of it.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.100
Dogs are tiny.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.800
We're big.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.790
We have all the power.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:53.620
Dogs are often very fearful.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.870
This little puppy,
this is Will, was

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.700
on the cover of
the book that's not

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.410
here, "The Education of Will."

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.800

So this is Willy.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.690
Is a little puppy,
absolutely adorable.

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.610
And he's a wonderful dog.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.140
Jim and I live on a farm.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.470
He's a working sheep dog.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:15.460
He loves to play
with other dogs.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:21.610
He's just a great, wonderful
dog, except when he's not.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:25.630
And, actually, this slide
makes me unbelievably happy.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:29.000
Because this was just
taken last summer.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.700
And he's giving what I call
"snake face" to a hound cross

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.790
who's visiting as
an adolescent male,

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:38.060
just being a typical,
sorry, adolescent male.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.880
Just doing goofy, silly
things, and sort of

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.080
jumping on top of Willy.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.740
And Willy was communicating,
don't do that anymore.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.280
And this is not a very nice
face on the face of William.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.800
However, I am thrilled
with this photograph.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.470
Because when Willy was a
year old, or two years old,

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.390
or even two and
1/2, this would have

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.880
resulted in a horrific attack.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.560
I never would have
let this happen.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.630
Willy came to me as
a puppy, as if he'd

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.830
come back from three
tours in Afghanistan.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.780
And it turned out that,
unbeknownst to me,

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.000
I thought I'd healed
from all these traumas.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.980
"The Education of Will"
is about dogs and people

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.830
facing and healing from trauma.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.800
And it turned out that
I thought I was good.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.820
And then Willy came.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.460
And he was super sound reactive,
and really problematic,

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.520
and super aggressive,
in all these contexts.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.230
And he ended up setting me back.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.460
Set me quite a ways back.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.460
And I finally figured out
that in order to heal him,

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.020
I had to heal me.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.450
So dogs like these,
these are scared dogs.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.090
Now, I'm not saying
they won't bite you.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.774
They might, if you
do the wrong thing.

00:49:43.774 --> 00:49:45.440
Of course, you have
to protect yourself.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.430
But fear, again, is a
very, very powerful emotion

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.430
and can take over the
behavior of a lot of dogs.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:54.920
Dogs don't need--
oh, this, by the way,

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.510
that slide I started with?

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.620
See the whale eye now?

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:01.100
This dog is telling you,
please go away from me.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.360
I'm afraid of you.

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:05.540
Not quite as big a signal,
but still a very clear signal.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.470
There's a very clear whale eye.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:11.690
So fear is a really
primal, primal emotion.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.210
And it's shared
between all mammals.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:17.560
You all know about the
amygdala, holds the key.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.532
And fear out of balance
can create trauma.

00:50:20.532 --> 00:50:22.990
If you want to talk to me about
it later, or any questions,

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.620
I'm happy to talk about it.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.350
Basically, I'd been traumatized.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.110
I was raped.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.830
I was sexually molested earlier.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:32.590
And a man fell from
the sky five stories,

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:36.430
and landed there, and died at
my feet, when I was about 17.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.530
And it changes your brain.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:39.670
And I thought I was good.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:40.960
I thought I was healed.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.330
And then Willy came, and he
was super sound reactive.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:44.440
And he set me back.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.960
So all my PTSD
symptoms came back.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.820
So that's what "The
Education of Will" is about.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:51.820
Willy is good now.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.540
He's 10.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.920
He's really good.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.560
I would never bring him
here to meet your dogs.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.990
But if he was outside and
saw your dog on the street,

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.980
he'd be like, hi, are you a dog?

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.480
I'm a dog.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.469
He was incredibly
dog, dog aggressive.

00:51:03.469 --> 00:51:04.260
He'd be like, good.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.070
Hi, how are you?

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.240
I am really good too.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.720
I went through periods where
I didn't sleep for months.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.410
I couldn't go into
a dark building.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:18.960
And so I write about that
in "The Education of Will."

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.580
I promise you it's
a happy story.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.650
But it does talk
about trauma, and how

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:26.860
dogs can be traumatized too, and
how they don't need dominance.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.270
Don't buy into
any of this alpha,

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.650
you have to dominate your dog to
get your dog to listen to you.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.280
There's no science behind that.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.420
People just made that up.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.120
And it felt good.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.430
I think dogs need a sense
of safety and security.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.300
So you need to be a
benevolent kind of a leader.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.130
But leader is a word
that's actually been

00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:50.010
compromised in some senses too.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:53.900
So what dogs need is to
feel safe, and secure,

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.590
and like they can trust you.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:59.820
And they can trust you to
read their communication,

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:04.450
and they can trust that you will
communicate clearly with them.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:05.280
So thank you.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:08.710
It's really fun to be here to
talk to all these dog lovers.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.900

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.430

dog peeing on the carpet.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.010
You can pretty much ask me
anything about behavior.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.585
And if I don't know,
I'll say, I don't know.

00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:36.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:36.960
This is amazing.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.460
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Thank you.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.294
AUDIENCE: I have a beautiful
one-year-old 100-pound Berner.

00:52:40.294 --> 00:52:42.710
And as you can imagine, she's
a pretty big, fluffy target.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:44.660
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: A
Bernese Mountain Dog.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.076
AUDIENCE: The
streets of New York.

00:52:46.076 --> 00:52:49.000
And I know management is the
first Kiefer dog behavior.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.324
But try as you might,
people pat her butt.

00:52:51.324 --> 00:52:52.490
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Oh, yes.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:53.255
Loom and reach.

00:52:53.255 --> 00:52:54.460
AUDIENCE: So just curious--

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.440
one, like for the times when you
can't manage those situations,

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.440
what's the best way to either
educate, and then just make

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.980
sure she's not scared, or
just salvage a situation that

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.397
happens, probably,
10 times a day.

00:53:05.397 --> 00:53:06.896
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
So you're asking

00:53:06.896 --> 00:53:08.200
me to influence human behavior.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.080
AUDIENCE: Well, or how can I?

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.710
I've got to do this.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.720
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Aren't
you guys good at this?

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.560
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
had talked about [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.160
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: It's hard.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:16.659
It is.

00:53:16.659 --> 00:53:17.660
I really sympathize.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.285
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:18.285 --> 00:53:21.380
Or just talking more about
appropriate greetings

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.050
for strangers on the street,
which is like a common New York

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:24.800
City dog owner.

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.370
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Right.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.869
Yeah.

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:26.800
No, great question.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.480
It's really fun.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480
I mean, Jim and I
live in the country,

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.910
outside of Black
Earth, Wisconsin.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:34.710
Now, I work and teach
in Madison, Wisconsin,

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:37.275
which is the capital,
the capital of the state,

00:53:37.275 --> 00:53:38.277
a beautiful urban place.

00:53:38.277 --> 00:53:40.610
But nonetheless, we live on
a farm So it's so fun for me

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.026
to walk around New York and
think about, like, oh, my god,

00:53:43.026 --> 00:53:45.844
my dogs would be freaking
out if they were here.

00:53:45.844 --> 00:53:46.760
So a couple of things.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.880
And one, I'll just answer
the most extreme, sort

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.330
of, extreme intensity
of the level.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.860
I have had clients who
literally taught their dog

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.560
to wear a muzzle, not
because the dog needed it,

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.512
because people don't pet
dogs with muzzles on.

00:54:00.512 --> 00:54:02.720
Which is amazing, because
when they have a muzzle on,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.579
they're safe, theoretically.

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:06.620
You'd have to be careful.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.230
Don't ever use a cloth muzzle.

00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:12.320
You always want to use a big
basket muzzle if you do that.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.270
But I literally have
had clients do that,

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.610
to literally protect their dog.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.310
Another thing you can do
is always teach your dog

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:21.230
to sit in back of you.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.120
I do a lot of body
walking to people, lots.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.700
So I'd work with
a lot of dogs who

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.949
are fear aggressive
to unfamiliar people.

00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:30.740
And when we're doing
conditioning programs,

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.630
I literally-- the dog
was always back here,

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.870
and I was always really quick
to body block the person.

00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:39.530
And sometimes you have
to be somewhat assertive,

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:42.950
especially with dog lovers.

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.410
And this is just
speaking as a zoologist.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:48.260
I will tell you that,
in general, women

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.140
will ignore you and reach
towards to pet the dog,

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:54.910
and say, oh, no, no,
no, dogs love me.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:58.160
I have a way with dogs.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.490
And guys are more
like, I'm not afraid.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.060
It's like, it's not about you.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.942
It's about the dog.

00:55:06.942 --> 00:55:10.080
So if I lived in New
York, then I literally

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.954
would teach my dog--

00:55:11.954 --> 00:55:12.870
this would be the cue.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.520
And I wouldn't be a cue for me.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.170
I would start with a cue for me.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.030
So it would be like, back.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.570
And I would teach a dog, if I
see somebody about to do this,

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:22.290
it would be-- so
your dog steps back

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.250
and is a little bit behind you,
so you can always protect them.

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.680
But turn it into an auto cue.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.920
So turn it into the reach
towards, is I'm going back

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.690
and I'm sitting down.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:34.410
Wouldn't be hard.

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.640
Really wouldn't be hard.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.760
So that's one thing to do.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.840
And another thing to do is from
a level of, oh, I'm so sorry.

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.975
He's recovering from rabies.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.460
One thing I've done a lot--

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:51.130
this is only if you have time--

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:54.707
is I've said, you need time, and
you need to be far enough away.

00:55:54.707 --> 00:55:56.290
So I don't know how
much it would work

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:57.520
on the streets of New York.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.349
It's like, oh, you
look like a dog lover.

00:55:59.349 --> 00:56:00.640
I know you're going to help me.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.130
I know you know not to come up
and just reach towards the dog

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:03.670
right away.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.294
Because you look like
a real dog lover.

00:56:05.294 --> 00:56:07.300
And nobody is willing
to say, like, I was

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.420
about to reach toward your dog.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.799
So does that help?

00:56:11.799 --> 00:56:13.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's super helpful.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.574
It's like, when they do ask--

00:56:14.574 --> 00:56:16.240
like, the people that
do the right thing

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.710
is the best way for,
like, greetings.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:19.720
Just like a hand out, and
letting the dog decide.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.470
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
Yes, side of the face.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:23.830
So one thing you
can do is always

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:25.660
good to give people
something to do.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.744
So you can say, oh, I would
love it if you pet my dog.

00:56:29.744 --> 00:56:31.660
But, you know, here's
what I'd love you to do.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.743
Would you take this treat?

00:56:32.743 --> 00:56:35.800
Put a treat in their hand,
and then you illustrate

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.850
and say, give him
a treat like that.

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:43.010
And so if you do it, half of
them will do what you say.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:46.270
The other half will just do it
totally wrong and then you--

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.260
AUDIENCE: We'll start
with the get started.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.700
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Good
So you have one too.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.324
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:53.060
So I have a six-year-old
Dachshund, and he's a rescue.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.860
He's like Will--
I'd say, definitely

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.450
traumatized, like, very
dog aggressive, except when

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:00.470
I'm at the dog park.

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:03.260
He's not that bad.

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.820
On a leash, though, terrible.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.110
Like, very aggressive.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:06.800
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Classic.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.850
I've gone through
training with him.

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:14.000
So he has a good foundation
of, I'd say, like, sit, stay,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.180
go to bed, you know.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:16.774
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Good.

00:57:16.774 --> 00:57:18.440
AUDIENCE: But as far
as, you know, still

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.720
being dog aggressive and even
with strangers, very aggressive

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.940
with strangers.

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.269
What are some--

00:57:24.269 --> 00:57:25.310
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Yeah.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.060
Oh, I hear you.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.670
First of all, yay for you,
for rescuing that pup.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.329
So here's the best
thing I would do.

00:57:33.329 --> 00:57:35.120
And I'll give you the
really short version.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.911
The longer version is
in a booklet I wrote,

00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:38.750
called "Feisty Fido."

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.410
So basically, you're
going to combine

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.590
operant conditioning,
Skinner's four

00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:44.900
quadrants of positive
reinforcement,

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.980
plus classical conditioning.

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.397
So the classical
conditioning part

00:57:48.397 --> 00:57:50.688
is that your Doxey is going
to learn-- what's his name?

00:57:50.688 --> 00:57:51.220
Her?

00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:51.810
AUDIENCE: Chaco.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:52.893
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Chaco.

00:57:52.893 --> 00:57:55.250
So Chaco is going to
learn that each movement

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:58.790
towards him-- and so remember
to break it up into tiny steps.

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:00.230
So say-- oh, I wish he was here.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.230
So say Chaco's there with you.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:03.967
So I'm your friend.

00:58:03.967 --> 00:58:06.050
And I'm one of your friends
who does what you say.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.450
So you eliminate half of them.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:10.670
Because we're people.

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:12.920
So you would ask your friend
to walk forward one step,

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.660
and then stop.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.420
And as he walks forward, you're
going to give Chaco a treat.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:18.545
And you might even--

00:58:18.545 --> 00:58:23.210
I like to put an operant
conditioning cue on it too.

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.310
So before he sees the
person, you might say,

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:27.470
Chaco, look at me.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.760
Or look at the person.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.414
Like, who is that?

00:58:30.414 --> 00:58:31.580
I actually taught Will that.

00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.360
It's like, who's that?

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.940
So he looks at the person.

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.680
Click.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.690
You can just say, good.

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.440
You don't have to have
a clicker with you.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.391
But mark that behavior.

00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:41.640
And then you give him a treat.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.181
So first, you're going to teach
him an incompatible response.

00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:46.520
So if he's looking
at you, he's not

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.810
going to be going
after somebody else.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.750
But at the same time,
as you work on that,

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.430
as people get
closer, they're going

00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.110
to be the ones
throwing the treat.

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.420
So it's step, throw.

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.220
Step, throw.

00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.050
And so he's being
classically conditioned

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.930
in a Pavlovian way, of,
like, person, chicken.

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:04.220
Person, chicken.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.530
I am no longer afraid of person.

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:08.780
But you have to
go really slowly.

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.400
And what happens
is it's really easy

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.290
to do the first steps right,
and then go too far too fast.

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.500
And then all of a sudden,
your dog just bit somebody.

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:18.470
So do it way slower and longer
than you think you need to.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:20.210
And you'll never be done.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:23.100
But just you can manage it, and
he'll get better and better.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:23.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.540
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: So yeah.

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:24.920
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.880
Thank you for being here.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:26.810
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
Oh, thanks for coming.

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:27.110
AUDIENCE: A couple of questions.

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.122
I also have a rescue and
a lot of fear aggression.

00:59:30.122 --> 00:59:32.330
It's getting better, now
that living in New York City

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:33.780
and having a lot more
exposure to people.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.405
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
Yeah, good for you.

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:38.120
AUDIENCE: But as a
result of anxiety,

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.830
she would never
pee in the house,

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:42.140
no matter how long I stay
and keep her in the house,

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.110
eight hours should be fine.

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:45.326
When I leave the house--

00:59:45.326 --> 00:59:47.450
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Oh,
she has separation anxiety.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:48.575
AUDIENCE: --she will do it.

00:59:48.575 --> 00:59:52.760
And I don't know how to explain
to her, how to help her not be

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.720
afraid that I'm gone.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.110
I will be back.

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:55.950
So that's one.

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:58.550
And then secondly,
what is your point

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:00.665
of view on e-collar,
electronic collars?

01:00:00.665 --> 01:00:01.790
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Oh, OK.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:02.960
Two questions.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.220
I'll answer the second one
first because that's quicker.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.359
I hate them.

01:00:08.359 --> 01:00:08.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.399
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: I really,
really dislike them intensely.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.950
In 28 years or something,
I've used them twice,

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:22.130
for dogs who were killing
livestock, and who's--

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.620
the owners of whose
livestock had a gun,

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.130
and were going to shoot the
dog if it happened once again.

01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.620
So that's the only situation
I've ever used them in.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:38.540
So back to your
separation anxiety.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.290
There's, again,
the longer version

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:45.740
is a book that I wrote
called "I'll Be Home Soon."

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.254
But the short version is--

01:00:47.254 --> 01:00:48.920
first of all, be sure
that's what it is.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.503
Because some dogs
are like she's gone.

01:00:50.503 --> 01:00:52.250
I can pee now.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.620
But if that's what
it is, then you

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.030
need to start conditioning that.

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.640
So basically, figure
out the trigger.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.340
So can you tell a time your
dog starts to get nervous?

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.190
When you're getting your
keys, getting your coat,

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:06.200
going in the bathroom
and brushing your hair.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.620
Is there any sign she's getting
nervous as you're leaving?

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.560
AUDIENCE: I think so.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.890
She's watching me every
move, following me.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.410
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Yeah, OK.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.140
So watch her really carefully.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.570
Start to see when she
shifts her behavior.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:22.040
And you'll see it.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.256
She'll start to
follow you around.

01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:25.880
And figure out what
is it you're doing,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.710
and use that as
your first trigger.

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:29.840
So you're going
to condition her.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.160
Say these are my keys.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.289
So I'm going to pick
up my keys, and I'm

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.580
going to throw a treat for her.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.080
And then I'm going
to put them down.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.080
And I'm going to do that
like 10 times in a row.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.580
And maybe part of the day, I'll
just pick up the keys and go

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.210
sit on the couch and
watch television.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:44.480
So you deload the keys.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.560
And then you go--

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.630
you do that for each step.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.480
Keys, coat-- every dog
has a different set

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.900
of triggers-- walking to the
door, touching the door handle,

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.580
opening the door two inches.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.100
You really do do this in
tiny little increments.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.000
And eventually, you go
outside for a second.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.550
And then you go outside for 10
seconds, then 30 seconds, then

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.420
five minutes.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.226
The end goes way faster
than the beginning.

01:02:08.226 --> 01:02:10.100
Meanwhile, when you
really have to leave her,

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.160
find a different
place, whether it's

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.630
one room, a crate, or a
daycare, or something else.

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.350
So you can separate
those environments.

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.180
So that's the quick answer.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:23.510
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: And I
can hang around a little bit

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.710
afterwards if you have more.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:25.730
But I know there's--

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.050
so hopefully, that
helps a little bit.

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:27.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:27.590
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Yeah.

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:28.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

01:02:28.850 --> 01:02:29.808
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Hi!

01:02:29.808 --> 01:02:31.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.370
So the other day, I
was playing piano.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.195
And my dog started howling.

01:02:38.195 --> 01:02:40.149
And he's never done that before.

01:02:40.149 --> 01:02:41.940
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
You hit the right note.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.580
AUDIENCE: I was playing piano.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.090
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: So his
dog howls when he plays piano.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:49.140
I love it.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.580
Nobody quite understands it.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.800
But howling is contagious.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.350
Howling is a social function.

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.990
We think it's sort of
like singing in church.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.420
It's a way of bonding
animals together.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.900
So you're just hitting exactly
the right note, that somehow

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.690
is a salient trigger for a dog.

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:07.440
Basically, your dog
thinks you're howling.

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.510
So you can either--

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:18.800
I would put it on cue, and then
do a video and put it online.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.300
So I think one more, and then
I know some of you have to go.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.720
But I can hang around, and sign
books, and answer questions.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.350
Yeah.

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:25.950
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.500
So I have an eight-month-old
Goldendoodle in the city.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.620
And we've had him
for four months.

01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.499
And he's scared of a lot of
things, but getting better.

01:03:34.499 --> 01:03:36.040
It's definitely
getting a lot better,

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.470
like over the time
we've had him.

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:40.685
But he's still like super
terrified of skateboards,

01:03:40.685 --> 01:03:41.590
especially.

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:43.050
And there's a
couple other things.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:44.549
But it's like
definitely skateboard.

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:46.502
PATRICIA MCCONNELL:
The worst, yeah.

01:03:46.502 --> 01:03:48.210
AUDIENCE: And I'm just
curious about what

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:51.180
I should do in the
moment that happens,

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.820
and he wants to just
freak out and run home.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:55.764
And my instinct is to
bend down and hug him.

01:03:55.764 --> 01:03:57.430
And I'm learning maybe
that's not right.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.830
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Maybe not.

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.950
Yeah, right.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:02.666
I'll torture you
while you're scared.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:04.290
But you're a primate,
and you love him,

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.380
and you're trying to
provide solace, right?

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.290
First of all, skateboards,
this is, like, ubiquitous.

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:12.390
I cannot tell you how
many dogs freak out.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.640
And I think it's partly
because of the vibrations

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.260
and the low level noise.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:16.867
It's a growl.

01:04:16.867 --> 01:04:18.450
That's why dogs are
afraid of thunder.

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:19.915
The world is growling.

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:25.740
So this low-- it just
scares so many dogs.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.880
So you can't control
it, necessarily.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.100
When it happens, as
soon as you see one,

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.110
you need to be, like,
on constant alert, which

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.670
I'm sure you are already.

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:37.410
So as soon as you
see one, you're

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:39.785
going to move away as far as
you can, whatever that is.

01:04:39.785 --> 01:04:41.410
And then you're going
to ask for a sit.

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.630
Good boy.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:43.155
Good boy.

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:45.030
And then you're going
to give lots of treats.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:45.920
Good boy.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.120
And if he looks at
your face, good boy.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.720
I would teach a watch or look
at me, and do that separately.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.030
So get that down,
where it's easy,

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.596
and it's not too scary for
him, and then go somewhere

01:04:56.596 --> 01:04:58.470
where you know you-- do
you have places where

01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:59.844
you know they're going to be?

01:04:59.844 --> 01:05:00.760
AUDIENCE: Skateboards?

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.080
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: Yes.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:01.620
AUDIENCE: Central Park.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.994
I mean, they're
kind of sporadic.

01:05:02.994 --> 01:05:05.100
PATRICIA MCCONNELL: So
some predictability.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.090
So stay as far away as you
can, and say, do you see it?

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:09.160
Where is the skateboard?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.660
Where's the skate--
name your fears.

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.840
It helps with dogs too.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.340
Where is the skateboard?

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.159
Where is it?

01:05:15.159 --> 01:05:15.950
Where is the thing?

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:17.180
Where is the thing?

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.660
And if he looks,
it's like, good.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.050
Treat.

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.716
And then you're going
to back away, also

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.350
to reinforce him,
because you're going

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.590
to increase the distance
between him and that.

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:26.670
So that's what I'd do.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:30.060
If you're blindsided, you
don't have time for anything,

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.427
I would just walk away.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.010
Don't hug him.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:32.760
Don't pick him up.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.890
Just walk away.

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.700
Get as far away
from it as you can.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.310
And then work your way
up to getting closer.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:39.330
OK, thank you all.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:41.470
It was really fun to be here.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.200
I love your dog culture.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.850
Thanks, Christine,
for asking me.

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:46.750
And thank you, Alec.
