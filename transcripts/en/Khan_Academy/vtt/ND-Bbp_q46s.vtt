00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.090
We're all used to the
traditional operators

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.810
like addition and subtraction
and multiplication

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.600
and division.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.350
And we've seen there's multiple
ways to represent this.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.490
But what we're going to do in
this video is a little fun.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.690
We're actually going to
define our own operators.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.370
And what's neat
about this is it kind

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.051
of shows how broad
mathematics can be.

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:22.300
And on a more practical
sense, it's actually something

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.234
that you might see on
some standardized tests.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.650
And the reason why
they do that is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.040
so that you can appreciate
that these aren't

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.730
the only operators out there--
plus exponentiation and all

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.380
those-- that in
mathematics, you can

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.370
define a whole new
set of operators.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.680
So let's just do that.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.160
So let me just
define x diamond y.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.720
And I'm going to define
that as 5x minus y.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.970
So you could view this as
defining it a function.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.660
But we're defining
it using an operator.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.540
So if I have x diamond
y, by definition,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.880
we have defined this operator.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.480
That means that's going
to be equal to 5x minus y.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.720
So given that definition,
what would 7 diamond 11 be?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.240
Well, you just go
to the definition.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.950
7 diamond 11.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.600
Instead of an x we have a 7.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.990
So it's going to be 5 times 7.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.040
So let me do it 5 times 7
minus, and instead of a y,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.510
we have an 11.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.450
So one way to think about
it is, in our definition,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.690
every place you saw an x,
you could replace with a 7,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.210
every place you saw a y,
you replace with an 11.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.030
So you have minus 11 over here.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.700
Let me make the number--
So this is the 7.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.100
This 7 is this 7.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.840
And this 11 is this
11 right over here.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.230
And then we just evaluate that.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.500
So 5 times 7 is 35.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.870
So this is equal to 35 minus
11, which is equal to 24.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.190
So 7 diamond 11 is equal to 24.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.610
We can define other things.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.920
We can define something crazy
like, let me define a-- well,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.535
I mentioned a star, let me
use a star-- a star-- let

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:15.240
me write it this way-- a star b.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.200
Let's say that that
is the same thing

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.120
as-- I don't know--
a over a plus b.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.490
And so same idea.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.000
What would 5 star 6 be?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.662
Well, you go back
to the definition.

00:02:34.662 --> 00:02:36.620
By definition, every
place where you see the a,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.110
you would now replace with a 5.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.090
Every time you saw the b, you
would now replace with a 6.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.720
So this is going to be equal
to 5 over 5 plus 6. a plus b.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.440
a is 5, b is 6 over 5 plus 6.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.436
So this would be 5/11.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.430
And then you can compound them.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.430
And we haven't defined
any order of operations

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
for these particular operations
that we've just defined.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760
So we're going to be
careful to use parentheses

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.420
when we put some
of these together,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.000
but you can do something
like, something interesting,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.430
like negative 1
diamond 0 star 5.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.530
And once again, we just
focus on parentheses,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.030
because that's the
only thing that's

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.446
telling us what
to start on first.

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:29.060
Because we haven't
figured out, we

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.246
haven't defined whether diamond
takes precedence over star,

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.120
or star takes precedence
over diamond the way

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.530
that we have that saying that,
hey, you do multiplication

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.370
before you do addition.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.161
We haven't defined it
for those operations,

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.250
but that's what the
parentheses helps us do.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.540
So we want to evaluate
these parentheses first.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.170
0 star 5 that is 0-- because
you could view this 0

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.120
as the a and the 5 as the b--so
it's going to be 0 over 0 plus

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.480
5, which is just going to be 0.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.160
So this over here, 0
or 5 just goes to 0.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.430
So this whole
expression simplifies

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.490
to negative 1 diamond--
this diamond right

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.480
over here-- diamond 0.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.360
And now we go to the definition
of the diamond operator.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.390
Well, that's five times the
first number in our operator,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.700
or the first term that
we're giving the operator.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.580
I guess you could
think of it that way.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.090
So 5 times that.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.690
So it'll be 5 times negative
1, x is negative 1 minus y.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.700
Well, y here is the 0.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.720
Minus 0.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.430
So 5 times negative
1 is negative 5.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.870
And you will see--
and the idea here

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.460
is just to make you feel
comfortable defining

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.460
new operators like this.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.919
And not being daunted if all
of a sudden you see a diamond,

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.626
and they're defining
the diamond for you.

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:51.560
And you're like, wait,
I never saw a diamond.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.300
They're actually defining it
for you, so you shouldn't say,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.190
I never saw a diamond.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.481
You should say, well, they've
defined a diamond for me.

00:04:56.481 --> 00:04:58.270
This is how I use that operator.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.670
And sometimes you'll
see even wackier things.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.130
You'll see things like this.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.420
Let me draw.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.050
So they'll define.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.429
I don't know if you would even
consider this an operator.

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.720
But you'll see something like
this, that by definition,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.700
if someone writes
a symbol like this,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.430
and they put-- a, b, c-- let me
write it this way-- a, b, c, d.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.074
They'll say this is
the same thing as ad

00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:29.040
minus b, all of that over c.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.230
And once again, this
is just a definition.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.120
They have this
weird symbolic way

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.420
of representing these
variables in all this.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.820
But they're defining how do you
evaluate this crazy expression.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.750
And so, if someone
were to give you,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.830
were to say, evaluate
this diamond.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.720
Let me evaluate the diamond.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.030
So evaluate the diamond
where, in my little sections

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.350
of the diamond, I have a
negative 1, a 5, a 3, and a 2.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.070
We would just use
the definition of how

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.702
to evaluate this diamond.

00:06:01.702 --> 00:06:03.160
And we'd say, OK,
every time we see

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.010
an a, that is going
to be negative 1.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.330
So we have a negative 1 times d.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.880
Well, d is whatever
is in the bottom right

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.080
section of this
diameter or this kite.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.109
So d is going to be 2.

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:16.150
Let me write it this way.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.970
This is a.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.330
This is b.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.820
This is c.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.700
And this is d.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.970
So it's going to be negative
1 times 2 minus b-- well b

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.240
is 5-- minus 5, all of
that over c, which is 3.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.320
So this is going to be
equal to negative 2 minus 5.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.090
So that is negative 7 over 3.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.580
And you could go
crazy like this.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.163
And it might be a
fun thing, actually,

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:44.400
if you have some spare time.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.750
Define your own operators
and see how creative

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.870
you can get with
those operators.
