00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.112
So if genes played little to no role at all, and environment played a large

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:10.800
role. What kind of pattern would we expect to see in the data or the results?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.364
Strong similarity in personality between all different degrees of relatives

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.728
regardless of where they were brought up. Strong similarity in personality only

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.932
in genetically close relatives reared together. Strong similarity in

00:00:22.932 --> 00:00:24.666
personality only in genetically close relatives reared apart. Strong similarity

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:31.430
in personality only in people reared together. Choose the ones that you think

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.273
would apply to this situation.
