ado let's jump into some of the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
ado let's jump into some of the
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.189
ado let's jump into some of the
processes behind the redesigns right so

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
processes behind the redesigns right so
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.819
processes behind the redesigns right so
let's get started so Google Play you're

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
let's get started so Google Play you're
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340
let's get started so Google Play you're
probably familiar with it but just as a

quick introduction Google Play is the
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.020
quick introduction Google Play is the
media offering from google it basically

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
media offering from google it basically
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719
media offering from google it basically
covers all your content from games to

the place where you get your content is
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880

we're going to be talking about the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
we're going to be talking about the
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940
we're going to be talking about the
redesign particularly there are three

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
redesign particularly there are three
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740
redesign particularly there are three
keywords that are going to go across the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
keywords that are going to go across the
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.570
keywords that are going to go across the
presentation is how we design it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
presentation is how we design it
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300
presentation is how we design it
responsive how we made it responsive

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
responsive how we made it responsive
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.640
responsive how we made it responsive
modular and emotional at the same time

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650
modular and emotional at the same time
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.560
modular and emotional at the same time
so we had three goals in mind when we

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
so we had three goals in mind when we
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.130
so we had three goals in mind when we
redesign the Google Play suit suite of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
redesign the Google Play suit suite of
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260
redesign the Google Play suit suite of
applications one was to create

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
applications one was to create
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.350
applications one was to create
consistency across play to populate

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
consistency across play to populate
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999
consistency across play to populate
content dynamically and to create

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
content dynamically and to create
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.580
content dynamically and to create
efficient layout on web and device so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
efficient layout on web and device so
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.569
efficient layout on web and device so
creating consistency basically if you

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
creating consistency basically if you
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.190
creating consistency basically if you
have been using google play in the past

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
have been using google play in the past
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410
have been using google play in the past
you would have seen that we had a lot of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
you would have seen that we had a lot of
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300
you would have seen that we had a lot of
different ways to represent content and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
different ways to represent content and
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.179
different ways to represent content and
we thought that we sort of needed to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
we thought that we sort of needed to
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850
we thought that we sort of needed to
make it uniform in order to create an

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
make it uniform in order to create an
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.389
make it uniform in order to create an
experience that felt familiar to people

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399
 
 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.949
 
but we're content dynamically means that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
but we're content dynamically means that
 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.130
but we're content dynamically means that
while we had ways to display content in

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140
while we had ways to display content in
 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.680
while we had ways to display content in
a dynamic way across devices and web

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
a dynamic way across devices and web
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.660
a dynamic way across devices and web
there were certain types of content

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
there were certain types of content
 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.149
there were certain types of content
particularly collections that couldn't

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159
particularly collections that couldn't
 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.280
particularly collections that couldn't
be displayed dynamically for example you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
be displayed dynamically for example you
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.960
be displayed dynamically for example you
will remember those tiles they were

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
will remember those tiles they were
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.640
will remember those tiles they were
promoting different collections of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
promoting different collections of
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.580
promoting different collections of
content those tiles had to be manually

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
content those tiles had to be manually
 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.940
content those tiles had to be manually
drone generated exported in JPEGs and so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
drone generated exported in JPEGs and so
 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.710
drone generated exported in JPEGs and so
we couldn't either propose content based

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
we couldn't either propose content based
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.449
we couldn't either propose content based
on your preferences collection based on

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459
on your preferences collection based on
 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.890
on your preferences collection based on
your preferences because we had to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900
your preferences because we had to
 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.410
your preferences because we had to
produce those Styles beforehand and also

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
produce those Styles beforehand and also
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.650
produce those Styles beforehand and also
it was a very labor-intensive process

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660
 
 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.180
 
when we talk about efficiently out it's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190
when we talk about efficiently out it's
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.949
when we talk about efficiently out it's
not about the layout being efficient but

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959
not about the layout being efficient but
 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.619
not about the layout being efficient but
is rather make our work more efficient

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629
is rather make our work more efficient
 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.839
is rather make our work more efficient
so we had to design for a lot of

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849
so we had to design for a lot of
 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.580
so we had to design for a lot of
different screens and platforms

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
different screens and platforms
 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.569
different screens and platforms
including the web and we just wanted to

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579
including the web and we just wanted to
 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.720
including the web and we just wanted to
have a system so that designers could

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730
have a system so that designers could
 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.710
have a system so that designers could
define and design their their the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
define and design their their the
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.659
define and design their their the
layouts once and apply them to all

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669
layouts once and apply them to all
 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.430
layouts once and apply them to all
platforms so we could focus more on the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
platforms so we could focus more on the
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.289
platforms so we could focus more on the
new features and the cool stuff rather

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299
new features and the cool stuff rather
 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.180
new features and the cool stuff rather
than translating the same thing over and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190
than translating the same thing over and
 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.460
than translating the same thing over and
over again so let's jump into the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470
over again so let's jump into the
 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.900
over again so let's jump into the
solution and the design principles that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
solution and the design principles that
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.319
solution and the design principles that
took us through this journey so

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329
took us through this journey so
 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.869
took us through this journey so
everything starts with cards the

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879
everything starts with cards the
 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.030
everything starts with cards the
interesting thing about cards is that it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040
interesting thing about cards is that it
 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.180
interesting thing about cards is that it
is this atomic element that defines an

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190
is this atomic element that defines an
 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.150
is this atomic element that defines an
entity that defines an object and in

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160
entity that defines an object and in
 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.250
entity that defines an object and in
survived and designing for rather than

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
survived and designing for rather than
 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.839
survived and designing for rather than
designing greens which is a sort of

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849
designing greens which is a sort of
 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.789
designing greens which is a sort of
outside in approach where you have

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799
outside in approach where you have
 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.559
outside in approach where you have
grades when you put stuff in it with

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569
grades when you put stuff in it with
 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.289
grades when you put stuff in it with
herbal cards being this atomic element

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
herbal cards being this atomic element
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.839
herbal cards being this atomic element
that create spaces from the inside out

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849
that create spaces from the inside out
 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.539
that create spaces from the inside out
so multiple cards shows up on your

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549
so multiple cards shows up on your
 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.270
so multiple cards shows up on your
layouts and define the content that you

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280
layouts and define the content that you
 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.680
layouts and define the content that you
see let me get into some examples

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690
see let me get into some examples
 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.220
see let me get into some examples
so a card is great because like I said

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
so a card is great because like I said
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.870
so a card is great because like I said
it contains objects whether there are

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880
it contains objects whether there are
 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.360
it contains objects whether there are
applications or albums or movies or

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370
applications or albums or movies or
 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.240
applications or albums or movies or
magazines or books or even people or

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250
magazines or books or even people or
 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.640
magazines or books or even people or
artists and so forth they basically

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650
artists and so forth they basically
 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.390
artists and so forth they basically
contain any type of thing and by being

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
contain any type of thing and by being
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.640
contain any type of thing and by being
in the same module we are able to

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650
in the same module we are able to
 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.530
in the same module we are able to
display things next to each other no

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540
display things next to each other no
 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.330
display things next to each other no
matter what kind of entity they are the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
matter what kind of entity they are the
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.460
matter what kind of entity they are the
other great property the cards have is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470
other great property the cards have is
 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.340
other great property the cards have is
the ability to be in different shapes so

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350
the ability to be in different shapes so
 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.800
the ability to be in different shapes so
we design a lot of different cards so

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810
we design a lot of different cards so
 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.170
we design a lot of different cards so
that the outs could be more interesting

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
that the outs could be more interesting
 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.420
that the outs could be more interesting
in hierarchical so we had what we call

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430
in hierarchical so we had what we call
 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.770
in hierarchical so we had what we call
tiny cards or small cards or big cards

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780
tiny cards or small cards or big cards
 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.020
tiny cards or small cards or big cards
and cards can also be displayed in

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030
and cards can also be displayed in
 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.700
and cards can also be displayed in
multiple orientations in order to

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710
multiple orientations in order to
 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.170
multiple orientations in order to
accommodate different layouts we also

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
accommodate different layouts we also
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.560
accommodate different layouts we also
have what we call a medium card or at

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570
have what we call a medium card or at
 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.790
have what we call a medium card or at
least video type of card so there are

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800
least video type of card so there are
 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.710
least video type of card so there are
two things that have been different

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720
two things that have been different
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.230
two things that have been different
sizes accommodate for one is that they

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
sizes accommodate for one is that they
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.140
sizes accommodate for one is that they
create hierarchy they can show things to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
create hierarchy they can show things to
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.909
create hierarchy they can show things to
be more important by being bigger and

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919
be more important by being bigger and
 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.620
be more important by being bigger and
also they accommodate for different from

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630
also they accommodate for different from
 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.570
also they accommodate for different from
initial informational purposes meaning

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580
initial informational purposes meaning
 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.640
initial informational purposes meaning
they can have more or less white space

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650
they can have more or less white space
 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.770
they can have more or less white space
in them to show more or less information

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780
in them to show more or less information
 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.860
in them to show more or less information
for example in the store when we find

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870
for example in the store when we find
 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.780
for example in the store when we find
something that you may really like we

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790
something that you may really like we
 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.640
something that you may really like we
put in a bigger car which has a bigger

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650
put in a bigger car which has a bigger
 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.620
put in a bigger car which has a bigger
info area in order to display more

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630
info area in order to display more
 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.480
info area in order to display more
reasons about why you may like it or

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490
reasons about why you may like it or
 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.510
reasons about why you may like it or
maybe we can display people that +1 it

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520
maybe we can display people that +1 it
 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.850
maybe we can display people that +1 it
and so forth and saying we do on other

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860
and so forth and saying we do on other
 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.860
and so forth and saying we do on other
applications and you will see that music

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870
applications and you will see that music
 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.050
applications and you will see that music
later another key element of our design

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060
later another key element of our design
 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.620
later another key element of our design
or canvases so once you understand cards

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630
or canvases so once you understand cards
 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.690
or canvases so once you understand cards
you also understand how your application

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700
you also understand how your application
 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.180
you also understand how your application
is basically just the canvas on top of

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190
is basically just the canvas on top of
 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.880
is basically just the canvas on top of
which elements are displayed so it

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890
which elements are displayed so it
 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.310
which elements are displayed so it
doesn't matter if the canvas is the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320
doesn't matter if the canvas is the
 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.980
doesn't matter if the canvas is the
store or music or whatnot the point is

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990
store or music or whatnot the point is
 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.750
store or music or whatnot the point is
that you have content that is displayed

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760
that you have content that is displayed
 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.030
that you have content that is displayed
on top of these canvases somehow our

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040
on top of these canvases somehow our
 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.270
on top of these canvases somehow our
design tries to be APK agnostic in a way

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280
design tries to be APK agnostic in a way
 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.340
design tries to be APK agnostic in a way
that you may want you may see in the

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350
that you may want you may see in the
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.050
that you may want you may see in the
future a book in the music application

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060
future a book in the music application
 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.940
future a book in the music application
why not the store is a perfect example

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950
why not the store is a perfect example
 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.940
why not the store is a perfect example
where all the content come together

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950
where all the content come together
 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.980
where all the content come together
in one place another great example of

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990
in one place another great example of
 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.780
in one place another great example of
canvases is what we do today in the

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790
canvases is what we do today in the
 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.850
canvases is what we do today in the
movies application if you're familiar

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860
movies application if you're familiar
 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.450
movies application if you're familiar
with it when you pause the movie you

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460
with it when you pause the movie you
 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.550
with it when you pause the movie you
basically see the actor that is there

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560
basically see the actor that is there
 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.830
basically see the actor that is there
you see a similar movies where the actor

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
you see a similar movies where the actor
 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.430
you see a similar movies where the actor
has been participating in and this is

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440
has been participating in and this is
 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.350
has been participating in and this is
just the canvas it is a canvas where we

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360
just the canvas it is a canvas where we
 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.660
just the canvas it is a canvas where we
display on top of it a personal card and

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670
display on top of it a personal card and
 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.360
display on top of it a personal card and
a listview card with a bunch of movies

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370
a listview card with a bunch of movies
 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.160
a listview card with a bunch of movies
in it it just about canvasses the

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170
in it it just about canvasses the
 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.020
in it it just about canvasses the
content lives on top of them another

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030
content lives on top of them another
 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.630
content lives on top of them another
notion that is key to our design is the

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640
notion that is key to our design is the
 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.660
notion that is key to our design is the
notion of clusters so once you have

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670
notion of clusters so once you have
 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.140
notion of clusters so once you have
multiple cards next to each other

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150
multiple cards next to each other
 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.270
multiple cards next to each other
because of the size visual psychology

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280
because of the size visual psychology
 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.730
because of the size visual psychology
law of proximity you perceive it as 1 1

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740
law of proximity you perceive it as 1 1
 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.250
law of proximity you perceive it as 1 1
unit a cluster and that allows us to

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260
unit a cluster and that allows us to
 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.600
unit a cluster and that allows us to
display collections in this way we also

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610
display collections in this way we also
 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.000
display collections in this way we also
made these collections to be dynamic and

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010
made these collections to be dynamic and
 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.680
made these collections to be dynamic and
follow that hierarchy that I talked

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690
follow that hierarchy that I talked
 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.410
follow that hierarchy that I talked
about before by allowing a cluster to

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420
about before by allowing a cluster to
 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.180
about before by allowing a cluster to
have different models in them and

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190
have different models in them and
 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.070
have different models in them and
because we designed those cards

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080
because we designed those cards
 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.350
because we designed those cards
beforehand to be plug into each other

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360
beforehand to be plug into each other
 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.560
beforehand to be plug into each other
through Heights they are following the

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570
through Heights they are following the
 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.200
through Heights they are following the
same structure we can basically display

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210
same structure we can basically display
 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.000
same structure we can basically display
clusters that have different types of

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.010
clusters that have different types of
 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.790
clusters that have different types of
cards in them and still feel as a unit

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800
cards in them and still feel as a unit
 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.180
cards in them and still feel as a unit
as you see here also naturally the

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190
as you see here also naturally the
 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.110
as you see here also naturally the
clusters they work across our typical

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120
clusters they work across our typical
 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.620
clusters they work across our typical
canvases like phones or tablets and web

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.630
canvases like phones or tablets and web
 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.310
canvases like phones or tablets and web
and beyond this led us into this

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320
and beyond this led us into this
 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.860
and beyond this led us into this
responsive layout philosophy when we

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:52.870
responsive layout philosophy when we
 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.690
responsive layout philosophy when we
talk about responsive layout we're

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.700
talk about responsive layout we're
 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.160
talk about responsive layout we're
talking more about a design approach

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.170
talking more about a design approach
 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.250
talking more about a design approach
rather than the responsive web design so

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.260
rather than the responsive web design so
 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.530
rather than the responsive web design so
we're not talking about designing your

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:01.540
we're not talking about designing your
 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.020
we're not talking about designing your
website to respond to different campuses

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.030
website to respond to different campuses
 

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.420
website to respond to different campuses
but rather how as designers we thought

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.430
but rather how as designers we thought
 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.250
but rather how as designers we thought
about how our layouts will expand across

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:08.260
about how our layouts will expand across
 

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.070
about how our layouts will expand across
multiple screen sizes and this is what

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.080
multiple screen sizes and this is what
 

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.080
multiple screen sizes and this is what
we define here is responsive layout and

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.090
we define here is responsive layout and
 

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.840
we define here is responsive layout and
responsive design so as you see we took

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:15.850
responsive design so as you see we took
 

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.250
responsive design so as you see we took
in consideration all the typical

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:17.260
in consideration all the typical
 

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.399
in consideration all the typical
canvases from phones

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:21.409
canvases from phones
 

00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:27.089

canvases in mind and we kept on
 

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.300

and when you expand those

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:15.690
and when you expand those
 

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.480

different APK so this allows us even to
mix our applications more and I guess

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:37.430

the principles marco was just talking

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.090
the principles marco was just talking
 

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.390
the principles marco was just talking
about to the design of the music app in

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:32.400
about to the design of the music app in
 

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.420
about to the design of the music app in

perhaps a provocative idea within the

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:38.940
perhaps a provocative idea within the
 

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.990
perhaps a provocative idea within the
design community there's this notion

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000
design community there's this notion
 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.820
design community there's this notion
that we should be designing for mobile

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:43.830
that we should be designing for mobile
 

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.940
that we should be designing for mobile
first that's very popularly

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:45.950
first that's very popularly
 

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.830
first that's very popularly
you know previously maybe people were

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:47.840
you know previously maybe people were
 

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.630
you know previously maybe people were
designing web apps and then they were

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:49.640
designing web apps and then they were
 

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.160
designing web apps and then they were
kind of figuring out how to scale them

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.170
kind of figuring out how to scale them
 

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.500
kind of figuring out how to scale them
down to the phone which we realized was

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:53.510
down to the phone which we realized was
 

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.740
down to the phone which we realized was
a bad idea maybe we should focus on the

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.750
a bad idea maybe we should focus on the
 

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.600
a bad idea maybe we should focus on the
phone first and I think where we've

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:58.610
phone first and I think where we've
 

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.660
phone first and I think where we've
moved on to as is possibly a next step

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:01.670
moved on to as is possibly a next step
 

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.880
moved on to as is possibly a next step
in this evolution which is designing for

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:03.890
in this evolution which is designing for
 

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.960
in this evolution which is designing for
everything at once so as Marco mentioned

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:07.970
everything at once so as Marco mentioned
 

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.340
everything at once so as Marco mentioned
we were thinking about not just the

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:09.350
we were thinking about not just the
 

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.830
we were thinking about not just the
phone at the 7-inch tablet the 10-inch

speaking one trick that we use to
 

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.220
speaking one trick that we use to
approach this problem is we found that

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.230
approach this problem is we found that
 

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.010
approach this problem is we found that
if we on a first pass we kind of think

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.020
if we on a first pass we kind of think
 

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.290
if we on a first pass we kind of think
about the phone in portrait and the

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:29.300
about the phone in portrait and the
 

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.150

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040
and we struck upon the idea of just
 

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.120
and we struck upon the idea of just
doing this kind of rotating carousel so

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.130
doing this kind of rotating carousel so
 

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.190

know the relationship between the phone
 

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.610
know the relationship between the phone
and the tablet and landscape is you can

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.620
and the tablet and landscape is you can
 

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.590

spread them out in two separate columns
 

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.180
spread them out in two separate columns
on the tablet and you can also bring in

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.190
on the tablet and you can also bring in
 

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.500
on the tablet and you can also bring in
a little bit more information on the

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:32.510
a little bit more information on the
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.780
a little bit more information on the
tablet like the song duration which just

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:34.790
tablet like the song duration which just
 

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.130
tablet like the song duration which just
doesn't really fit nicely on the phone

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:38.140
doesn't really fit nicely on the phone
 

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.960
doesn't really fit nicely on the phone
another example of this same kind of

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:40.970
another example of this same kind of
 

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.600
another example of this same kind of
principle is in our now playing bar

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:43.610
principle is in our now playing bar
 

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.610
principle is in our now playing bar
which you see at the bottom of both the

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.620
which you see at the bottom of both the
 

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.070
which you see at the bottom of both the
phone and the tablet which shows you the

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080
phone and the tablet which shows you the
 

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.310

currently playing song and gives you a

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320
currently playing song and gives you a
 

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.920
currently playing song and gives you a
few controls now on the phone where it's

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:53.930
few controls now on the phone where it's
 

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.720
few controls now on the phone where it's
it's there's not a lot of space we just

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:55.730
it's there's not a lot of space we just
 

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.190
it's there's not a lot of space we just
have a play button in addition to the

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200
have a play button in addition to the
 

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.350
have a play button in addition to the
song info but on the tablet we give you

00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360
song info but on the tablet we give you
 

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.990
song info but on the tablet we give you
a full you know previous button and next

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000
a full you know previous button and next
 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.610
a full you know previous button and next
button and even thumbs up and thumbs

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.620
button and even thumbs up and thumbs
 

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.830
button and even thumbs up and thumbs
down so you can do some reading so it's

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840
down so you can do some reading so it's
 

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.140
down so you can do some reading so it's
just that you can take the same elements

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.150
just that you can take the same elements
 

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.860
just that you can take the same elements
and just add a little bit more on the

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:11.870
and just add a little bit more on the
 

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.110
and just add a little bit more on the
tablet but you still maintain that

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120
tablet but you still maintain that
 

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.880
tablet but you still maintain that
consistency and reusing the same

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:15.890
consistency and reusing the same
 

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.260
consistency and reusing the same

components from an engineering
perspective

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.070
perspective
 

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.409

what I wanted to call out really quickly

00:18:22.409 --> 00:18:22.419
what I wanted to call out really quickly
 

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:25.149
what I wanted to call out really quickly
is that this isn't like two separate

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159
is that this isn't like two separate
 

00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:27.090
is that this isn't like two separate
apps you know throughout this entire

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.100
apps you know throughout this entire
 

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.769
apps you know throughout this entire
presentation and demo of subpar you guys

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:29.779
presentation and demo of subpar you guys
 

00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:31.539
presentation and demo of subpar you guys
have basically been showing the same app

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:31.549
have basically been showing the same app
 

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:33.519
have basically been showing the same app
on a phone and a tablet it's just that

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:33.529
on a phone and a tablet it's just that
 

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.100
on a phone and a tablet it's just that
the individual elements in the app the

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.110
the individual elements in the app the
 

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.389
the individual elements in the app the
individual elements within the now

00:18:37.389 --> 00:18:37.399
individual elements within the now
 

00:18:37.399 --> 00:18:39.430
individual elements within the now
playing bar and wouldn't be the kind of

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440
playing bar and wouldn't be the kind of
 

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.830
playing bar and wouldn't be the kind of
song list those stretch and those kind

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840
song list those stretch and those kind
 

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.899
song list those stretch and those kind
of realign themselves reposition

00:18:43.899 --> 00:18:43.909
of realign themselves reposition
 

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:45.249
of realign themselves reposition
themselves that's one of my favorite

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:45.259
themselves that's one of my favorite
 

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:46.690
themselves that's one of my favorite
things about this app is that it's it's

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:46.700
things about this app is that it's it's
 

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.549
things about this app is that it's it's
truly responsive designer at the

00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559
truly responsive designer at the
 

00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:51.279
truly responsive designer at the
individual component level yeah that's

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:51.289
individual component level yeah that's
 

00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:54.779
individual component level yeah that's
really important to our approach a

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:54.789
 
 

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:56.680
 
couple of the things i wanted to mention

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:56.690
couple of the things i wanted to mention
 

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.039
couple of the things i wanted to mention
one one cool thing we did on the phone

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:00.049
one one cool thing we did on the phone
 

00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:02.590
one one cool thing we did on the phone
because we we didn't have room for those

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600
because we we didn't have room for those
 

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.769
because we we didn't have room for those
next and previous buttons we have these

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:05.779
next and previous buttons we have these
 

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:08.289
next and previous buttons we have these
little touches like you can swipe to go

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:08.299
little touches like you can swipe to go
 

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:14.009
little touches like you can swipe to go
to the next song it's pretty cool and

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:14.019
to the next song it's pretty cool and
 

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:16.180
to the next song it's pretty cool and
the next piece I want to talk about is

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.190
the next piece I want to talk about is
 

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.080
the next piece I want to talk about is
our now playing screen

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.090
 
 

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.180
 
this again shows the idea we were

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.190
this again shows the idea we were
 

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.610
this again shows the idea we were
talking about before where the same

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:24.620
talking about before where the same
 

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.990
talking about before where the same
design when you have these large

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000
design when you have these large
 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.460
design when you have these large
graphics scales to both both form

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.470
graphics scales to both both form
 

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.320
graphics scales to both both form
factors maybe the graphic gets cropped a

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:32.330
factors maybe the graphic gets cropped a
 

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.029
factors maybe the graphic gets cropped a
little bit differently but it still is

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039
little bit differently but it still is
 

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:38.950
little bit differently but it still is
beautiful and immersive and again you

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960
beautiful and immersive and again you
 

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.779
beautiful and immersive and again you
can you can swipe to go to the next

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:40.789
can you can swipe to go to the next
 

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:43.210
can you can swipe to go to the next
track on the Now Playing screen it's

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:43.220
track on the Now Playing screen it's
 

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.200
track on the Now Playing screen it's
pretty nice the last piece I want to

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.210
pretty nice the last piece I want to
 

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.830
pretty nice the last piece I want to
talk about is our q UI this is where you

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840
talk about is our q UI this is where you
 

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.350
talk about is our q UI this is where you
can see what songs are coming up next

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360
can see what songs are coming up next
 

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.370
can see what songs are coming up next
and here there's some other nice

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:57.380
and here there's some other nice
 

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.380
and here there's some other nice
gestures like you can swipe to remove

00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.390
gestures like you can swipe to remove
 

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.070
gestures like you can swipe to remove
songs we don't want to hear one now on

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080
songs we don't want to hear one now on
 

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.200

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.210

we're we're going in deep on a design we

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:24.860
we're we're going in deep on a design we
 

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.890
we're we're going in deep on a design we
may think we may narrow the scope down

we worked on the store app everywhere in
great detail at first so this allowed us

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.110
great detail at first so this allowed us

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:02.740
to we make red lines we make a lot of
very detailed specifications because you

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:02.750
very detailed specifications because you
 

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.390
very detailed specifications because you
know it's very important to produce

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400
know it's very important to produce
 

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.700
know it's very important to produce
marks and it's really important to

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:06.710
marks and it's really important to
 

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.080
marks and it's really important to
define all paddings all font sizes

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.090
define all paddings all font sizes
 

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.790
define all paddings all font sizes
everything that is necessary to make

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:12.800
everything that is necessary to make
 

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.070
everything that is necessary to make
this layout to be the way we want it to

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080
this layout to be the way we want it to
 

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.040
this layout to be the way we want it to
be but like I said before if you had

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.050
be but like I said before if you had
 

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.799
be but like I said before if you had
these modular places in mind it's really

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:20.809
these modular places in mind it's really
 

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:23.860
these modular places in mind it's really
important to get to a very precise level

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:23.870
important to get to a very precise level
 

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.750
important to get to a very precise level
of the finishing the first time but

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760
of the finishing the first time but
 

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.310
of the finishing the first time but
after that is done there's a lot of code

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320
after that is done there's a lot of code
 

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.910
after that is done there's a lot of code
that can be shared afterwards so what

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:30.920
that can be shared afterwards so what
 

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.470
that can be shared afterwards so what
happened is that we had to produce a lot

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480
happened is that we had to produce a lot
 

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.510
happened is that we had to produce a lot
of red lines and specifications

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520
of red lines and specifications
 

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.549
of red lines and specifications
especially for the store which shipped

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559
especially for the store which shipped
 

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:39.940
especially for the store which shipped
first but after that we managed to have

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:39.950
first but after that we managed to have
 

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.500
first but after that we managed to have
engineering to be talking to each other

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:41.510
engineering to be talking to each other
 

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.750
engineering to be talking to each other
and get a lot of that information almost

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760
and get a lot of that information almost
 

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.330
and get a lot of that information almost
for free which was which was very

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:46.340
for free which was which was very
 

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.330
for free which was which was very
important also we sure is that another

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.340
important also we sure is that another
 

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.880

out so I wrote an outside-in approach so

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:54.470
out so I wrote an outside-in approach so
 

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.990

documentation documents are never enough
 

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.390
documentation documents are never enough
and they keep on changing so we also

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:13.400
and they keep on changing so we also
 

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.180
and they keep on changing so we also
have a specific website which is where

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.190
have a specific website which is where
 

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.700
have a specific website which is where
we post all our materials and they are

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:18.710
we post all our materials and they are
 

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.290
we post all our materials and they are
more accessible and this is where

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:20.300
more accessible and this is where
 

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.870
more accessible and this is where
engineering can go and get all the

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880
engineering can go and get all the
 

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.669
engineering can go and get all the
information that they need plus you know

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679
information that they need plus you know
 

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:30.040

we are lucky we work next we work next

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.050
we are lucky we work next we work next
 

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.250
we are lucky we work next we work next
to the engineering team

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.260
to the engineering team
 

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.800

the same building and so nothing can be
 

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.690

better than face-to-face of course it's

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700
better than face-to-face of course it's
 

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.840
better than face-to-face of course it's
it's it's obviously very hard to get to

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:41.850
it's it's obviously very hard to get to
 

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.110
it's it's obviously very hard to get to
the right level of specification by

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120
the right level of specification by
 

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.180
the right level of specification by
simply writing documents especially when

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:47.190
simply writing documents especially when
 

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.340
simply writing documents especially when
you get to motion design and all those

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.350
you get to motion design and all those
 

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.050
you get to motion design and all those
nuances that oh I have shown like the

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:51.060
nuances that oh I have shown like the
 

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.800
nuances that oh I have shown like the
playlist design if you don't sit next to

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:54.810
playlist design if you don't sit next to
 

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.650
playlist design if you don't sit next to
each other yeah I think one other thing

I'd add that applies that we really did

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.270
I'd add that applies that we really did
 

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.940
I'd add that applies that we really did
in the the google play redesign it just

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:01.950
in the the google play redesign it just
 

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.560
in the the google play redesign it just

involved really early in the process so

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:10.350
involved really early in the process so
 

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.160
involved really early in the process so
I started meeting with engineers and

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.170
I started meeting with engineers and
 

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.110
I started meeting with engineers and
presenting you know when we just had

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120
presenting you know when we just had
 

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.210
presenting you know when we just had
really rough sketches of you know like

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220
really rough sketches of you know like
 

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.340
really rough sketches of you know like
the information architecture and and

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:19.350
the information architecture and and
 

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.470
the information architecture and and
kind of a rough idea of how different

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480
kind of a rough idea of how different
 

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.960
kind of a rough idea of how different
features would work notnot beautiful

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:23.970
features would work notnot beautiful
 

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.900

mocks not you know things were your red

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:26.910
mocks not you know things were your red
 

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.400
mocks not you know things were your red
lined out or anything but just kind of

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:28.410
lined out or anything but just kind of
 

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.270
lined out or anything but just kind of
the rough strokes and through that we

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:31.280
the rough strokes and through that we
 

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.490
the rough strokes and through that we
get everyone's feedback early on and and

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500
get everyone's feedback early on and and
 

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.800
get everyone's feedback early on and and
also learn about things that might be

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:36.810
also learn about things that might be
 

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.270
also learn about things that might be
technical issues that might we might

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:38.280
technical issues that might we might
 

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.890
technical issues that might we might
want to work around in the design or

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900
want to work around in the design or
 

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.410
want to work around in the design or
tweak to make sure we have a really good

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:42.420
tweak to make sure we have a really good
 

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.240
tweak to make sure we have a really good
user experience at the end of the day

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.250
 
 

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.160
 
well thanks I want to ask a quick

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.170
well thanks I want to ask a quick
 

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.800
well thanks I want to ask a quick
question about the awesome use of the

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:51.810
question about the awesome use of the
 

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.750
question about the awesome use of the
action bar and a translucent background

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760
action bar and a translucent background
 

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.150
action bar and a translucent background
so hopefully people noticed it in a doe

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:56.160
so hopefully people noticed it in a doe
 

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.370
so hopefully people noticed it in a doe
there but and one of my favorite

00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380
there but and one of my favorite
 

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.510
there but and one of my favorite
features of the app is on the menu

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520
features of the app is on the menu
 

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.770
features of the app is on the menu
screens like the artists screen for

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:00.780
screens like the artists screen for
 

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.820
screens like the artists screen for
example you start off with a fully and

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:03.830
example you start off with a fully and
 

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.720
example you start off with a fully and
translucent action bar and then as you

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:05.730
translucent action bar and then as you
 

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.910
translucent action bar and then as you
scroll down the content it fades in a

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:07.920
scroll down the content it fades in a
 

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.580
scroll down the content it fades in a
background color through and for me it

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:10.590
background color through and for me it
 

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.110
background color through and for me it
works bring you for making the most of

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120
works bring you for making the most of
 

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.970
works bring you for making the most of
the imagery as well as you know working

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980
the imagery as well as you know working
 

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.560
the imagery as well as you know working
with the action well pattern very very

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:15.570
with the action well pattern very very
 

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.350
with the action well pattern very very
flexibly can you give us them some

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360
flexibly can you give us them some
 

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.490
flexibly can you give us them some
background on how you came up with that

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500
background on how you came up with that
 

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.560
background on how you came up with that
or you know what were your design goals

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:21.570
or you know what were your design goals
 

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.970
or you know what were your design goals
of that kind of for that piece yeah I

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980
of that kind of for that piece yeah I
 

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.410
of that kind of for that piece yeah I
mean I think basically the idea was just

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:27.420
mean I think basically the idea was just
 

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.810
mean I think basically the idea was just
try to we really wanted to focus on the

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:29.820
try to we really wanted to focus on the
 

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.200
try to we really wanted to focus on the
imagery and by sort of making that the

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.210
imagery and by sort of making that the
 

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.790
imagery and by sort of making that the
the action bar be transparent if you're

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:36.800
the action bar be transparent if you're
 

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.530
the action bar be transparent if you're
made the image pop more and be more of

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:38.540
made the image pop more and be more of
 

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.820
made the image pop more and be more of
the centerpiece of the screen and then I

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:42.830
the centerpiece of the screen and then I
 

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.230
the centerpiece of the screen and then I
don't remember who came up with the idea

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240
don't remember who came up with the idea
 

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.060
don't remember who came up with the idea
of it kind of fading into orange but

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.070
of it kind of fading into orange but
 

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.830
of it kind of fading into orange but
roughly it was to solve the problem of

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840
roughly it was to solve the problem of
 

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.260
roughly it was to solve the problem of
that when you scrolled down you needed

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.270
that when you scrolled down you needed
 

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.480
that when you scrolled down you needed
to make sure that you could see the

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:52.490
to make sure that you could see the
 

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.910
to make sure that you could see the
controls when the picture was wasn't

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:54.920
controls when the picture was wasn't
 

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.160
controls when the picture was wasn't
there anymore and I'm so just want it

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.170
there anymore and I'm so just want it
 

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.140
there anymore and I'm so just want it
being kind of a cool touch to solve that

00:27:59.140 --> 00:27:59.150
being kind of a cool touch to solve that
 

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.330
being kind of a cool touch to solve that
problem yeah it's something to say about

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:01.340
problem yeah it's something to say about
 

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.180
problem yeah it's something to say about
the action bar I think there's a lot of

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.190
the action bar I think there's a lot of
 

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.920
the action bar I think there's a lot of
ways that we can play with that with

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:05.930
ways that we can play with that with
 

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.170
ways that we can play with that with
action bars to be too big to be

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:08.180
action bars to be too big to be
 

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.960
action bars to be too big to be
differentiating within applications and

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:10.970
differentiating within applications and
 

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.180
differentiating within applications and
and this is a very good example and you

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:13.190
and this is a very good example and you
 

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.190
and this is a very good example and you
have a lot of examples on Android in

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200
have a lot of examples on Android in
 

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.350
have a lot of examples on Android in
general so in play for instance we

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360
general so in play for instance we
 

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.040
general so in play for instance we
decided to put a flat icon instead of

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.050
decided to put a flat icon instead of
 

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.080
decided to put a flat icon instead of
the 3d icon in the action bar we made

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.090
the 3d icon in the action bar we made
 

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.300
the 3d icon in the action bar we made
those action bar very flashy we just

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:25.310
those action bar very flashy we just
 

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.250
those action bar very flashy we just
become invested in them and investing in

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:27.260
become invested in them and investing in
 

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.800
become invested in them and investing in
the colors that we have at the same time

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:29.810
the colors that we have at the same time
 

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.180
the colors that we have at the same time
when you get to an artist you kind of

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.190
when you get to an artist you kind of
 

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:32.860
when you get to an artist you kind of
feel that that is the artist page it's

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:32.870
feel that that is the artist page it's
 

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.800
feel that that is the artist page it's
not the music page and so it has to

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:35.810
not the music page and so it has to
 

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.780
not the music page and so it has to
belong to the artist and that's why it

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:37.790
belong to the artist and that's why it
 

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.190
belong to the artist and that's why it
has to feel as more neutral as possible

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200
has to feel as more neutral as possible
 

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.730
has to feel as more neutral as possible
and like I said before the lot of

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:42.740
and like I said before the lot of
 

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.010
and like I said before the lot of
examples on Android today about

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:45.020
examples on Android today about
 

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.650
examples on Android today about
different users of action bar that can

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:47.660
different users of action bar that can
 

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.810
different users of action bar that can
make our layout very flexible another

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:49.820
make our layout very flexible another
 

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.370
make our layout very flexible another
example that I can remember for example

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:51.380
example that I can remember for example
 

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.550
example that I can remember for example
is the agenda view on a calendar where

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:54.560
is the agenda view on a calendar where
 

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.520
is the agenda view on a calendar where
the action by on the phone where the

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:57.530
the action by on the phone where the
 

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.830
the action by on the phone where the
action bar shows one of the items of the

00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840
action bar shows one of the items of the
 

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.110
action bar shows one of the items of the
agenda view itself and so it shows the

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120
agenda view itself and so it shows the
 

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.580
agenda view itself and so it shows the
information present in there it doesn't

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:03.590
information present in there it doesn't
 

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:07.300
information present in there it doesn't
have any calendar icon and it's just

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.310
have any calendar icon and it's just
 

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.280
have any calendar icon and it's just
part of the informational structure of

people application the action bar takes

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:19.820
people application the action bar takes
 

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.940

it's not just the empty real estate to

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:24.770
it's not just the empty real estate to
 

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.890
it's not just the empty real estate to
have an apple for them so I really

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:26.900
have an apple for them so I really
 

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.600
have an apple for them so I really
invite everybody to think about ways

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:28.610
invite everybody to think about ways
 

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.910
invite everybody to think about ways
that we can play with the action bar by

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:30.920
that we can play with the action bar by
 

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.830
that we can play with the action bar by
still keeping it consistent because that

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840
still keeping it consistent because that
 

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.740
still keeping it consistent because that
is really affects usability so it's

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:35.750
is really affects usability so it's
 

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.750
is really affects usability so it's
important to obviously stick to the

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760
important to obviously stick to the
 

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.260
important to obviously stick to the
patterns

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:40.270
 
 

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.490
 
yeah definitely I think it's one of the

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:42.500
yeah definitely I think it's one of the
 

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.320
yeah definitely I think it's one of the
best ways you can bring branding to your

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:44.330
best ways you can bring branding to your
 

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.640
best ways you can bring branding to your
application as well right you have this

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:45.650
application as well right you have this
 

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.799
application as well right you have this
this bar there which is persistent so I

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:47.809
this bar there which is persistent so I
 

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:49.149

sweet of you know very kind of closely
 

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.930
sweet of you know very kind of closely
like close cousins apps you can tell

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:55.940
like close cousins apps you can tell
 

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.399
like close cousins apps you can tell
that they're designed together in

00:29:57.399 --> 00:29:57.409
that they're designed together in
 

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:58.419
that they're designed together in
concert but they have their own

00:29:58.419 --> 00:29:58.429
concert but they have their own
 

00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:59.860
concert but they have their own
personalities right through the

00:29:59.860 --> 00:29:59.870
personalities right through the
 

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.140
personalities right through the
different colors and so forth so I think

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.150
different colors and so forth so I think
 

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.490
different colors and so forth so I think
