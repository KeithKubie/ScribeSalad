differences the things we can agree on
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.450
differences the things we can agree on
and live by that commonality I think

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
and live by that commonality I think

and live by that commonality I think
that's a spirit and thin commonality

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129
that's a spirit and thin commonality

the first place so I think a life
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740
the first place so I think a life
well-lived is a life of reflection on

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
well-lived is a life of reflection on
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080
well-lived is a life of reflection on
one's own moral convictions and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
one's own moral convictions and
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.020
one's own moral convictions and
traditions and not only reflection in

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
traditions and not only reflection in
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.140
traditions and not only reflection in
the sense of thinking but also learning

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150
the sense of thinking but also learning
 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.120
the sense of thinking but also learning
you know it's not really possible to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
you know it's not really possible to
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330
you know it's not really possible to
have a dialogue across civilizations or

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
have a dialogue across civilizations or
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240
have a dialogue across civilizations or
cultures unless the participants have

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
cultures unless the participants have
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850
cultures unless the participants have
some deep serious understanding of their

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
some deep serious understanding of their
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.760
some deep serious understanding of their
own traditions that I think is the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
own traditions that I think is the
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.069
own traditions that I think is the
biggest obstacle now to understand

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
biggest obstacle now to understand
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.230
biggest obstacle now to understand
mutual understanding among civilizations

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
mutual understanding among civilizations
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840
mutual understanding among civilizations
and cultures it's not just that we don't

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
and cultures it's not just that we don't
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.960
and cultures it's not just that we don't
know enough about this other society

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
know enough about this other society
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850
know enough about this other society
it's that we don't know enough about our

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
it's that we don't know enough about our
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.130
it's that we don't know enough about our
own traditions to to carry on a serious

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
own traditions to to carry on a serious
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.709
own traditions to to carry on a serious
dialogue with different societies

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
dialogue with different societies
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450
dialogue with different societies
different cultures different religious

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
different cultures different religious
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.899
different cultures different religious
faiths

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.679

so I think a life well-lived depends on

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689
so I think a life well-lived depends on
 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.030
so I think a life well-lived depends on
reflection and learning about one's own

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
reflection and learning about one's own
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.839
reflection and learning about one's own
traditions and doing so in a way that is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
traditions and doing so in a way that is
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.720
traditions and doing so in a way that is
open to the world that is alive to other

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
open to the world that is alive to other
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.670
open to the world that is alive to other

ways wider horizon
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.700
ways wider horizon
and so I think a life well-lived the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
and so I think a life well-lived the
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.340
and so I think a life well-lived the
shape of that I think can vary one

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
shape of that I think can vary one
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.430
shape of that I think can vary one
historical period to the next because if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
historical period to the next because if
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.580
historical period to the next because if
we go back to to the athenian city-state

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
we go back to to the athenian city-state
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.160
we go back to to the athenian city-state
to be alive to the wider world would be

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
to be alive to the wider world would be
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660
to be alive to the wider world would be
to attend to the way they did things in

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
