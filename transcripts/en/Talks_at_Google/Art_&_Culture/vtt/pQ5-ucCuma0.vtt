[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.230
SPEAKER: Hey, everybody.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.410
It's Mark [INAUDIBLE], one of
your Talks at Google hosts.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.320
How many people were
here for Amit Peled when

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.828
he was here back in September?

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:17.172
Okey-doke, OK.

00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:18.630
Well, we're increasing
the presence

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.700
of strings on the campus now.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.980
We're really happy to have
the St. Lawrence String

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.660
Quartet with us.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.076
They are the
ensemble-in-residence

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:28.260
at Stanford, have
been since 1999.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.450
And they tour.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.270
And they talk.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.620
And they teach.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.420
And they play all kinds
of music, old and new.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.374
And they play in
very entertaining

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:42.036
and profound and unusual
and typical ways as well.

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.410
They're all over
the map actually

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.750
as musical explorers
and performers.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.000
And when we think
about classical music,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.145
we usually think about the
three B's, Bach, Brahms,

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.330
and Beethoven.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.790
And it occurred to me that Haydn
is actually the fourth B. BBB

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.760
and H, because H in the German
scheme of naming notes, is B.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.360
And B is actually B-flat.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120
So all the three
B's are so flat.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.580
But Haydn's the real B.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.070
So we'll let the quartet
explain more about

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.470
why Haydn it is so important
and interesting, even

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.619
in these times, as well
as in his own time.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.160
Now, I want to
introduce the players.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.870
We have Geoff Nuttall, Owen
Dalby, Lesley Robertson,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.860
and Chris Costanza.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.520
OK?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.250
So without further ado, the
St. Lawrence String Quartet,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.854
Haydn discovers.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.140
GEOFF NUTTALL: Well, the
great thing about Haydn

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.360
specifically is that he
rewards constant listening,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.920
constant work.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.620
I laugh anew every time
we play that movement.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.850
And we've probably
played it 300 times.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.350
So for us today--

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.950
and I know I have a mix.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.451
How many string quartet
players in the audience?

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:58.950
A few.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.710
Yeah, so there's
some hardcore people.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.770
And how many people who have no
idea what Opus 20 Haydn means?

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.850
OK, cool, yeah.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.620
That's about what
I was expecting.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.260
So this whole thing started--

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.060
we play string quartet concerts
for a living, basically.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.690
We guide the youth of
Stanford musically speaking,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.460
I suppose, as well.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.330
But years ago, we discovered
some really basic points.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.730
And that was that we
liked Haydn string

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.801
quartets a lot more than our
students and our audience did.

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.550
And it was somewhat
frustrating because we

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.871
came offstage thinking, that was
the most incredible experience

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:35.370
ever.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.740
This is such great music.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.740
It's moving and
powerful and hilarious.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.660
And the audience was
just like glazed over.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.493
And the students never
wanted to play Haydn.

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:47.150
So we figured firstly-- and
this is sort of important--

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.240
we realized that it's
not Haydn's fault.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.380
That was a first step.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.670
Right?

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.500
And then it became,
so how do we get

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.810
people to get this like we do?

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.310
It shouldn't be that hard.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.720
It was so frustrating.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.570
Haydn, here's the
key in many ways.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.790
Haydn, more than any
other composer, especially

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.000
Classical period
composer, works really

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.410
well on a number of levels.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.290
So if you put it on
on the automatic play

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.980
thing at a cocktail party in
the background, it sounds great.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.724
Everybody feels
slightly smarter.

00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:19.640
And there's an aura of--
you know what I mean?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.630
It works.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.010
It really does.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.680
And more and more-- and this
is a whole question of where we

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.580
are--

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.310
how does technology
affect how we appreciate

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.860
and listen and experience music?

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.610
Haydn, more than anyone,
benefits, almost demands--

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.190
if you want the hairs on the
back of your neck to stand up--

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.230
active participation, active
listening, following the game.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.600
And we discovered
that the more that you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.935
could open that window, whether
you're a music expert string

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:51.800
quartet player, or someone who's
coming from zero experience

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.020
with the genre, it's gettable.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.750
And it makes the act of
listening and/or playing

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.810
so much more pleasurable.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.460
And Haydn wrote these pieces
for that kind of involvement,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.010
both playing and listening.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.690
This is slightly boring,
but it's important history.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.470
Opus 20 changed the musical
landscape as we know it.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.660
Its influence is
hard to overestimate.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.100
Let me just read
this, because it's--

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.910
well, when a famous
musicologist says something,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.840
it somehow carries more weight
than a string quartet player.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.260
This is Sir Francis Donald
Tovey, or Sir Donald Francis

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.330
Tovey, probably the preeminent
musicologist in history.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.770
And this is over 100 years
ago he was saying this.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.370
"Every page of this
six Opus 20 quartets

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.740
is of historic and
aesthetic importance.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.250
There's perhaps no other
opus in the history

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.800
of instrumental music
which has achieved

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.060
so much and so quietly."

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.680
Back to the point,
many of you never

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.990
heard these before,
never mind heard of them.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.800
But what happened, and what
he did in 1772 or so, really

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.625
did change music history.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:03.500
You mentioned Brahms.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.270
He owned the
original manuscript,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.620
annotated all sorts of things.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.210
Beethoven hand-copied all six
of these quartet parts himself,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.740
arranged one for
string orchestra

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.940
before he decided to challenge
the genre and write his Opus

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.690
18.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.500
Mozart, of course, was a close
friend and passionate follower

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.020
of Haydn, and knew these
quartets intimately

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.150
before writing his own.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.734
So for something that had so
much impact on the greatest

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:30.650
musicians in history,
it's somewhat remarkable

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.120
that you don't hear
them that much,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.640
and they have very little
impact on students.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.330
So back to our original
problem, getting people

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.630
to appreciate and get
excited about Haydn quartets

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.536
like we do.

00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:43.910
And so we came up
with this plan,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.620
both for students and
audiences, that we

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.270
would go through a piece.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.760
In this case, we're going
to play Opus 20 Number 2.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.510
So please stay for the
end, because you'll

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.700
get a whole performance.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.014
But before we play
the piece through,

00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:56.930
we're just going to go
through each movement--

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.460
there are four movements--

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.000
and explain why we think it's
incredible, what to listen for.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.730
Just giving you a
few little windows.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.610
And it's amazing
how much just that

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.310
forcing yourself to
participate actively

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.160
in the process of music, instead
of letting it wash over you

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.140
and thinking about lunch,
which is fine in a sense.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.890
You understand where
I'm coming from here?

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.150
So here's the model.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.860
Haydn was so great
on so many levels.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.700
But he both created the
form and the genre--

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.650
the idea of four people, two
violins, viola, and cello.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.540
He created the structural form--
four movements, sonata form--

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.290
and we'll go there in
a second-- a minuet,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.140
which was a dance form-- he took
from a country dance and made

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.700
it part of the concert hall--

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.760
a slow movement, usually a
song, and a final movement,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.640
for the most part,
up until Opus 20,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.490
was a Rondo or Presto finale
like the one we just played,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.844
exuberant, boisterous fun.

00:06:52.844 --> 00:06:53.760
So that's your model--

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.170
story, first movement, aria
or dance, second movement,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.740
replacing each other, so
dance, song, and then party.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.680
That was the model that he
set up himself and wrote

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.190
many quartets before 1772.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.980
But Opus 20 totally changed
everything and on so

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.940
many levels.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.380
And we're talking about
democracy a lot these days.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.140
This is the first time where
the quartet really became

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.630
a totally democratic thing.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.440
You'll hear Opus 20, Number
2 beginning, shockingly--

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.300
and I know for us, the
shock is somewhat tempered.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.760
Up until this point,
string quartet playing

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.410
was tune, diva, backup band.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.330
So what happens to
begin this quartet

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.410
signifies a really
cataclysmic change

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.670
in what the quartet could be.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.738
So here's the opening
of Opus 20, Number 2.

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:49.832
[MUSIC - HAYDN
STRING QUARTET, OP.

00:07:49.832 --> 00:08:28.180
20 #2, FIRST MOVEMENT]

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.360
So I love that.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.581
What am I doing
at the beginning?

00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:32.080
Nothing.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.090
[LAUGHS]

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.020
And again, not
shocking at all to you.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.590
I know.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.500
But that would have been,
like, amazing for the players

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.640
and audiences of the day.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.650
Cello solo to begin.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.049
The viola's playing the bass.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.240
And then, all of a
sudden, everything's

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.170
turned upside down.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.670
The roles are changing.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.380
And throughout this
movement, you're

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.255
going to hear that--
we're going to call this

00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:53.500
the first theme in our story.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.000
You'll hear that
played by everyone

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.110
in the group at various times.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.790
So it becomes, as Goethe said, a
discussion amongst four equals,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.770
amongst four friends, as opposed
to a backup band with star

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.070
soloist.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.890
So the idea of
storytelling in music

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.020
is something that's really
important to follow.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.040
And we're going to throw both
simple and complicated examples

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.080
and see how your
listening skills are.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.371
[STRANGE WHIRRING SOUND]

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:19.870
Oh.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.330
Yeah, we played it Esterhazy,
where Haydn was lucky enough

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.540
to be a composer and
musician-in-residence

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.530
for over 40 years.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.980
And leaf blowers were
not a big thing there.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.560
It's a beautiful place.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.710
So that's our first
theme material.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.030
And what he's done is set up
the topic of cello as star right

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.690
off the bat.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.750
So listen to what happens
next and that simple concept

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.895
of equal opportunity tunes.

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:52.060
So we've had solo,
me sitting out.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.650
I get to answer, play the solo.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.480
The next thing that
happens in measure 15

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.920
is Owen plays the solo.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.420
I play the bass.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.710
Chris is following along.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.690
But he decides this
is really his show.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.780
And listen to the pyrotechnics
that happen from this.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.740
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.300
Isn't that cool?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.530
So within the first
22 bars of this,

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.260
you could look at it as a
beautiful, C major welcome

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.020
to our show.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.370
This is lovely.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.290
I mean, you as well.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.170
But it's also suddenly, all
these things are happening.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:44.850
So tune, not tune, answer,
answer, bass, discussion,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.750
show-off--

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.760
it's all about me-- response.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.480
Hey, I can do that too.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.680
And this is happening.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.530
So the difference between
letting this music

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.640
wash over you and say,
hey, check that out.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.890
The cello is playing the tune.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.870
There is the answer.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.040
Bass, not, crazy lick.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.570
And then your ears are attuned.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.860
And what could
possibly happen next?

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.120
So to set up our story, in terms
of story, you need characters.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.750
Right?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.900
That first tune that Chris
plays is our first subject

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.700
or first character.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.680
Later on in the
movement, we have what

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.590
we call our second subject.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.832
And in this case, it's
in the form of a duet.

00:11:18.832 --> 00:11:21.748
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.790
So Owen and I are one group,
and responding with the viola

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.750
and cello, Lesley and Chris.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.700
So that's a totally
different type

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.340
of subject, but in the same
sort of world harmonically.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.780
So to set this up so
you can nod knowingly

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.990
to your friends and neighbors,
we're going to play--

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.230
and you're not going to be
tested on this sonata form.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.720
But it's really helpful
to follow along.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.120
So what he does, it's called
the exposition, basically,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.460
introducing the two characters.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.670
You've just heard first theme,
cello, second theme, duet.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.680
And then we get to the
end of the exposition,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.890
and we're going to repeat
that material, just so you

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.750
can really get it in your ears.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.430
You can understand
these characters.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.888
Because what's
going to happen next

00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:13.580
is what we call a
development, where

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.020
we start to dig deeper into
who these people really are.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.820
So just so you
can nod knowingly,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.800
we're going to play the
end of the exposition,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.940
this first section.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.420
And then we're going to repeat.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.060

this simple act

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.880
of hearing this lovely
C major cadence.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.450
It's great.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.480
And then return
home to cello solo.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.950
And just say oh, I get it.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.480
That's the end of
the exposition,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.306
and they're going to repeat.

[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:13:03.435 --> 00:13:04.950
Were you with us?

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.270
I mean, it's really simple.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.500
But it's hard to stress enough
how important those moments are

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.060
to get, to go, oh, yeah.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.010
I get it.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.990
Now, and this is why Haydn
is so great on another level,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.980
the basic principle of
how it makes you feel.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.110
So what's the vibe at
the end of that movement?

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.740
Pretty lovely, joyful,
everything's great today,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.490

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.450
We repeat.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.950
We're feeling good
about ourselves.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.033
We've had these two
characters, but they're really

00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:32.400
in the same tonal language.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.760
So again, if you're
listening actively--

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.470
and it works on so many levels--

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.260
listening actively to
material, who's playing what,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.150
and listening actively
in a way, it's simply

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.190
how does it make me feel.

what this music is about.

the big question,

technologically speaking-- how
much does the ear actually hear

And the question is, the
more you listen actively,

the more this
stuff you will get,

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.460

And the more you learn,
the more you dig,

the better Haydn
gets at effortlessly

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.680
We're back to this
incredible cello solo.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.550
And this is where, again,
Haydn separates himself

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.800
from other composers of the era.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.020
Normally, the recapitulation,
the return home,

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.840
would be an exact repeat
of that initial material.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.370
So you feel good about it.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.410
But already, Haydn's
brain is working.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.324
So listen to what happens.

00:18:58.324 --> 00:18:59.740
And see if you can
identify what's

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:05.188
different about our return
home than the original version.

00:19:05.188 --> 00:19:07.156
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.402
So what happened?

00:19:38.402 --> 00:19:39.740
AUDIENCE: You jumped on him.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.090
GEOFF NUTTALL: I jumped.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.310
Yeah, I love that moment.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.740
It's like the diva got
shut down the first time.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.830
But I was so excited upon
repetition of that first theme,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.990
I said, I'm coming on
top of you this time

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.070
with the same little motif here.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.040
You can just feel
his brain working.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.650
And I love that moment
every time we get there.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.980
So again, it's really simple.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.480
Right?

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.313
You don't have to have
any musical training.

00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:03.340
You can hear that as
return home, nod knowingly.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.872
And then, what's he doing?

00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:05.830
Why is he playing that?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.450
He's not supposed
to be playing that!

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.860
That wasn't in the first bit!

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.280
And that creates a whole other
world, a different discussion

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.750
of that opening material.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.050
So that's our story,
first movement.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.270
And you're expecting at
this point either a dance

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.450
or a beautiful aria, a
tune that you can sing.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.968
And this is what Haydn
lays down for us.

00:20:25.968 --> 00:20:27.908
[MUSIC- HAYDN,

20, #2, SECOND MOVEMENT]

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:31.620
So he marks this movement
adagio capriccio,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.520
so capricious in the fact
that it's not light and airy,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.070
but quickly changing
in terms of character.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.872
And the drama is
really Beethovenian.

00:21:40.872 --> 00:21:42.330
This is one of
these movements that

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.970
shook the foundation
of music history.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:50.490
This is romantic music 50
years before late Beethoven.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.310
So what just happened
at that opening?

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.000
How are our ears doing?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.060
This is a remarkable, yet
again, very simple technique.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.669
Do we hear the
beautiful cello solo?

00:21:59.669 --> 00:22:00.960
So we have this unison opening.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.510
Right?

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.350
Everybody's playing the
same thing, C minor,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.270
like a Greek chorus crying out.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.410
And then what happened?

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.540
Cello solo.

actually was in terms of tune?

[PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:37.110
GEOFF NUTTALL: Same, right?

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.770

GEOFF NUTTALL: Isn't that cool?

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.326
But you don't hear
it as the same,

00:22:40.326 --> 00:22:42.360
because Haydn has harmonized it.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.440
And underneath Chris
playing that same melody

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:50.220
that wee yelled to the hilltops
becomes this painful, intimate,

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.510
supported by this harmony.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.690
But it's the same tune.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.670
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:02.610

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.483
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:36.040
So what happens next is really,
again, simple in description,

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.626
but really powerful
and Beethovenian.

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.000
That last bar that
we just played

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.950
doesn't actually
end how we ended it.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.230
This is what Haydn wrote.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.180
Here's Chris's last bar of solo.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.136
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.050
So if you dozed off to
sleep at that point,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.140
hopefully, you will awaken.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.260
Again, the shock of not
just the dynamic difference,

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.010
the gestural difference,
this incredibly incisive

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.090
rhythmic gesture.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.670
And that plays back and forth
throughout this movement.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.330
Let's just do the middle
section, which is so great.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.635
And this is simple expectation.

00:24:25.635 --> 00:24:28.830
We were talking about this
earlier, like, with students.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:33.870
Hey, theory, music theory,
I, V, I, the basic concepts.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.470
You don't really
have to know it.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.380
But you all feel it, even
if you don't think you do.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.750
So here is a cadence in the
middle of this movement.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.712
And you expect this.

00:24:42.712 --> 00:24:44.680
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.470

call it, V, G-major chord.

[PLAYS CHORD]

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.320

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.520
So whether you know it or not,
as a group of active listeners,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.720
you're really wanting
that to happen in the air.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.640
And that's, of course,
not what Haydn does.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.660
So have you prepared
your gasp of amazement?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.080
Again, listening
actively, feeling

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.210
it wanting to go back home
to that brooding C minor

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.858
and what Haydn shows us.

00:25:37.858 --> 00:25:39.834
[GROUP PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.310
I finally get my aria.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.817
But it's both incredibly
beautiful and really weird

00:26:13.817 --> 00:26:15.650
that it appears out of
nowhere in the middle

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.890
of this super dramatic,
crazy movement.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.740
But again, if you're
not following the game,

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.180
it'll just all seem like a
lovely wash of string quartet.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.000
And that's where, back
to my original comment,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.970
this music can be either
devastating or just simply

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.410
lovely.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.680
But you have to really take
part in the match, as it were,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.490
to get it.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.080
So expectation again.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.590
Here's the end of the movement.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.015
This cadence will be
familiar when we get there.

This is the third
moment, which arrives.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:26.230
Does that opening
remind you of any--

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.661
no hint intended--
Scottish instrument?

So he brings out the bagpipes.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.540
So we've gone from Greek chorus,
beautiful aria, shocking loud

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.270
and soft, cadence expectation,
to this minuet with bagpipes.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.330
And it's Haydn, again,
a little bit of history.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.930
This is occurring right in the
middle of this galant period,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.030
where music was really--

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.240
well, emotion bad.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.750
Folk music, bad, dirty.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.650
Complexities of Baroque
era, Bach and Handel, bad.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:11.400
And in this one opus, Opus 20,
Haydn returns to all of that.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.090
He reconnects to folk music.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.620
He specifically reconnects
to the kind of human emotion

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.170
that was frowned upon
up until that point.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.380
Within three years,
an emotional journey

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.860
like this capriccio movement
shocked the music world

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.490
and really wasn't bested or even
matched until late Beethoven.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.480
And in a final movement--

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.160
get ready for it--

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.171
he writes a full
four-part fugue.

00:28:39.171 --> 00:28:40.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:40.582 --> 00:28:42.915

effect I was really going for.

00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:43.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.450
But remember-- I don't know if
you were here, or some of you

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.658
weren't here when we started.

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:49.680
That was a rondo finale, a
super fun, jubilant, joyful--

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.980
that was expected.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.250
And to play a fugue
in this case--

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:01.020
and this is that amalgam
of technology and emotion.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.789
And fugal writing,
of course-- and Bach

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:04.080
did it better than anyone else.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.780
But Haydn is showing
off here in a way.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.660
It's somewhat unprecedented,
because not only does he

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.040
write a four-part fugue.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.257
The few has four subjects.

00:29:14.257 --> 00:29:15.718

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.480
So again, some of you
know what a fugue is

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.621
and how it's put together.

00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:26.370
Some of you don't.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.420
It doesn't really matter.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.510
But the subject-- or basically,
like in the first movement,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.520
there were two
characters, two themes.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.920
In this case, there are
four separate characters.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.860
So to set it up
and just to sort of

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.020
sharpen your ears,
so to speak, we're

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.400
going to do a little exercise.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.605
The first subject of
this fugue is the thing

00:29:43.605 --> 00:29:44.730
you hear right off the bat.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:32.968
Who was second?

00:30:32.968 --> 00:30:34.840
AUDIENCE: The viola.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.500
GEOFF NUTTALL: Uh-oh.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.440
OWEN DALBY: The viola did play
next, but not that material.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.400
GEOFF NUTTALL: Ah ha.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.259
OWEN DALBY: Ah ha.

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:43.800
AUDIENCE: It goes
from left to right.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.758
GEOFF NUTTALL: Correct.

00:30:44.758 --> 00:30:46.880
Yeah, again, it's really hard.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.050
Because Owen's right.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.220
The viola played.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.560
But was playing a different
topic, a different subject

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.040
simultaneously.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.065
So it's hard enough
to hear-- so it

00:30:55.065 --> 00:30:57.200
was first violin, second
violin, viola, cello.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.760
You all got that.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.180
Now, the challenge is to
hear all these other subjects

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.420
happening simultaneously.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.870
So the second character
is our second subject.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.331
[PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:12.680
Not the most incredible thing,
but it's a different flavor.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.520
Third one--

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.993
[PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.380
And the fourth one is
easily identifiable.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.300
It's sort of spiky.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.241
[PLAYS EXAMPLE]

00:31:23.241 --> 00:31:23.740
That's it.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.040
So again, I don't
expect miracles.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.420
But listening to
this fugue in a way

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.100
is really different
than listening

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.100
to polyphonic music, music
with tune and accompaniment.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.820
It's mathematical in the sense
that you can do both-- enjoy it

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.890
as music and follow the game.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.920
Who's playing what when?

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.010
Who has the first subject?

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.390
How are the answers going?

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.950
Where does it lead us?

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.720
And to make it even more--

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.690
well, crazy is perhaps
the wrong word--

00:31:54.690 --> 00:32:01.630
groundbreaking, Haydn
says, sempre sotto voce.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.930
So we always play
really quietly.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.510
And that creates this
long-term expectation

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.170
of A, what's going on?

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.020
Why are we playing a
fugue in this movement?

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.690
And why are we playing
softly the entire time?

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.600
And what will happen?

00:32:17.117 --> 00:32:19.700
Hopefully, you'll still be here
by the end of this performance

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.300
to find out.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.910
So I think we've set it up.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.430
This is Haydn,
Opus 20, Number 2.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.970
Just for your future
listening and discovery,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.870
six quartets in the set.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.700
Three of them end with fugues.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.010
Three of them end with
traditional rondo finales,

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.680
of which we played
one to open this set.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.514
They all contained--

00:32:37.514 --> 00:32:39.930
The frustrating thing is-- we
were talking about earlier--

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.710
we really want to just come
here and play all six and just

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.060
keep going, because
every turn, there's

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.770
something amazing and something
really moving and powerful.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.620
And it's music that many of you
have never heard before, which

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.450
always sort of blows my mind.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.490
So spread the word.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.050
We're-- "evangelical"
is a little strong.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.880
But it really does support the
kind of passionate advocacy

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.350
that we hope we bring to it.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.660
Haydn is God.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.810
