[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.180
RETO MEIER: Today, we're looking
at podcast creation

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.790
apps Audioboo and
Spreaker Radio.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: And then we'll dig
just a little bit deeper

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.050
to learn some of the tricks for

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.770
recording audio on Android.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.340
RETO MEIER: All that in a tight
30 minutes, today on

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.320
"The App Clinic."

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.030
So what is a podcast
creation app?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.760
I was wondering that myself,
because I know

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.450
about podcast apps.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.990
And when I first saw that this
is what we were doing, I

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.870
thought, oh, let me bring out
BeyondPod, and DoggCatcher,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.500
and all my favorites.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.710
RETO MEIER: It's a
popular category.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: But this
is different.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.120
These apps often will let
you listen to a podcast.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.830
But they're really geared
towards the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.180
creator of a podcast.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.450
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.360
So it's an interesting idea.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790
It's this notion that
you have a phone.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.650
It has a microphone.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.530
A lot of times when you want to
be creating cool content to

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.100
share with people, you're going
to be out and about.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.590
Why not do that on your phone?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.420
RETO MEIER: So there's actually
not a huge number of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.637
podcast creation apps out there,
or at least not that I

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:10.140
could find.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.340
So we're going to have a look
at a couple today which have

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.430
been around for little while and
look at what they've done,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.570
what they've done right, what
they could have done better.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.300
And then dig a little bit deeper
and maybe share some of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.290
that knowledge as to how you can
create an app which does

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.450
something similar, particularly
because it seems

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.220
like it may be an under-served
market.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.220
So let's have a look at the key
features for podcasting.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.600
So the essential things which
you're going to need--

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.590
record audio.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.930
RETO MEIER: That seems like a
fairly straightforward one.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: But not
just record audio.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.180
And this is really important,
because the way that these

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.600
apps differ from a normal
recording app is that they

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.260
need to record a lot of audio.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.010
They need to stay recording
for a very

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.760
long period of time.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.130
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.136
And of course. you need
to be able to

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:53.200
do that audio playback.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.370
And not just for the podcast
which you create but also for

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.110
other podcasts from the
community which you're

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.940
generally belonging to.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: I wouldn't say
that's an absolute necessity.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.705
But it seems to be a really
popular feature.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:04.010
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.000
I think it helps you become a
better part of that community

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.960
if you understand some of the
things which other people are

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.570
doing, help be inspired.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.820
I wouldn't mind seeing a little
bit on playback in

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.430
terms of effects and being
able to jump to different

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.970
places in the podcast, being
able to mark times.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.830
There's a big wish list
that I would have for

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.490
one of these apps.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.880
RETO MEIER: And that's some of
this stuff, which we've got

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.270
covered here in Podcasting++.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.000
So it's signing in with Google+,
because we're from

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.780
Google, and we like that.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.430
I use Google+ a lot, so that
would be kind of handy for me.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: And of course,
you can insert the social

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.740
network of your choice here, as
long as it's supported on

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.965
the vast majority of
all Android phones.

00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:43.410
RETO MEIER: Precisely.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which Google+ is
because of the way we do login

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.000
on Android.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.350
RETO MEIER: It would also
be interesting--

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.760
the whole point of doing
podcasts on your phone, which

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.960
is arguably not the best
platform for a recording

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.690
audio, is that you can do it
while you're on the go.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.070
So having some more integration
with geolocation,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.640
mapping, so that you can see
where these broadcasts are

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.170
coming from, I think would
be really nice.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.220
RETO MEIER: And finally--

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.310
exactly what Ian was referring
to-- some more device editing.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.740
So being able to trim the
beginning and endings off your

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.650
podcast, being able to do some
audio manipulation, I think,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.450
would be a real win.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, one
thing that a lot of

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.360
people miss on this--

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420
now, I've worked in the
professional audio recording

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.350
space for video games
for a long time.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.150
And one of the most important
features that consumer apps

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.360
don't have that pro apps
generally do is what we call

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.850
punch-in punch-out.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.970
And the idea that you could just
hit a button and say, I'm

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.200
recording now, and then hit
another button and either say,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.210
I'm not recording but
I'm going to again.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.070
Or what's even more important
is to be able to press a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.830
button and say, I want to
remember this place.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.630
So either that's someplace
where I messed up, and I

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.980
wanted to edit that out.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.850
Or it's something that I did
really well, and I want to be

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.470
able to emphasize that.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.320
Or I want to be able to
put a bookmark there.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.100
That sort of functionality would
be really, really cool

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.820
to see in these apps.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.850
And it wouldn't be all that
difficult to deliver in a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.030
mobile form factor.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.830
RETO MEIER: Awesome.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.090
So we're going to take a closer
look at two apps today,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.660
the beta version of Audioboo2,
sequel to Audioboo, and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.100
Spreaker Radio.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, that's
not Speaker Radio.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.160
RETO MEIER: No, but Spreaker.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
Spreaker Radio.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.130
RETO MEIER: That's right.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.430
Because Spreaker is a completely
different word and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.450
is not Pennsylvania Dutch,
as I had assumed.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.290
RETO MEIER: Indeed not.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.990
In fact, you probably just want
to look that up on your

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.450
internets to find out the
exact definition.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.560
Because we can't say it here.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.000
It's unprintable.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.260
RETO MEIER: It's just-- yeah.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.680
We can't do it.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.540
So Audioboo is an app that I
remember from my days as a

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.370
developer advocate
back in London.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.020
And I got to know the team
behind Audioboo v1 pretty well

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.360
as they were navigating the
waters of audio recording and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.200
processing on Android back
in the v1.1, which is a

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.650
long way back now.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.460
So I know that they're going to
be pretty happy to get some

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.620
candid feedback on this
beta of version 2.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.760
Now, keep in mind that
this is a beta.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.520
So there's likely be plenty
of rough edges, and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.070
[? spoilers, ?]

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.940
there are.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.330
But generally speaking, that's
the best time to give that

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.990
sort of feedback.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.680
And I'm sure that they would
appreciate that feedback

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.030
directly, if any of you guys
choose to check it out.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.840
Now first off, I'm not a
huge fan of the icon

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.080
or the feature page.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.540
I know there's a pretty good
chance that they've left it

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.880
this way on purpose, because
they're in beta, and they're

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.340
not ready to reveal their
new, modern branding.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.440
But even still, users are going
to form an early opinion

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.575
of that app from the first time
that they use it, even if

00:05:33.575 --> 00:05:34.690
it is in beta.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.780
So it's worth getting this
right straight away.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now, I do like
their featured graphic.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.830
I think that it's actually kind
of nice and clean, and it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.500
pretty much says exactly
what the app is about.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.580
The problem is that they've
reused that feature graphic

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.280
for the icon, which is
completely inappropriate.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.420
It's tough, too, because they're
using that generic

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.240
microphone symbol, which says
"recording," but it doesn't

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.770
say "Audioboo recording."

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.220
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.030
And it's interesting, because
they've used a lot of their

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.570
own nomenclature and branding
throughout the app.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.710
The things that you record
aren't podcasts, they aren't

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.330
anything else.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.330
They are "boos." It
just makes sense.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.723
But if you're going to have
that kind of branding, you

00:06:11.723 --> 00:06:13.750
want to make that rich right
from the outset to try and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.480
provide that consistency.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.900
Now personally, I would
love to see a

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.870
richer feature graphic.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.530
Ian disagrees.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.720
But the icon, I think, we
can both agree could

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.020
do with some work.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: It'd be great
to see an icon that's a

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.220
distinctive silhouette, maybe
building on the microphone

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.720
icon but making it their own.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.920
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.110
So let's dive in and take a
bit of a look at the app.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.137
Now, the first time that you
start the app, you're

00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:37.070
presented with a walkthrough.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.110
And you can see the first page
of the walkthrough here.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.940
And there's a few issues
related to that.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.550
You can see straightaway that
the design language here is

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.920
decidedly non-Android.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.210
We've got buttons which don't
look like Android buttons.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.250
And in fact, we've got three
very similar but subtly

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.590
different button styles all
on this front page.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.900
And to make things a little more
confusing, as a user, I'm

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.560
presented with four options when
I open this app for the

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.100
first time.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.830
Now, I'm not actually
in the app, but I

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.940
already have to choose.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.680
Do I want to record a boo?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.280
I don't know what that is yet,
but that's an option.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.410
Do I want to listen to
the welcome message?

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.660
Do I swipe to be able to read
through the walkthrough?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.680
Or skip the walkthrough?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.620
Now, that's a lot of decisions
to have to make when I launch

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.110
the app, before I'm actually
doing anything.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.990
So I'd recommend reducing
this to as

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.860
close to zero as possible.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.390
So in my mind, the best apps
present you with a UI that

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.100
lets you get started
straightaway.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.200
No interstitials, no
walkthroughs, no explanations.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.490
Walkthroughs are particularly
problematic, because it really

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.160
suggests that your app needs
careful instructions to be

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.340
able to understand how
it needs to be used.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.290
And I'm not sure that that's the
case for an app like this.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.580
You would think if someone's
gone to the trouble of

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.400
downloading it, they get
the general idea.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.830
This is an app to be able
to record audio

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.830
and share it online.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.440
And I'd like to think that you
could get to that process much

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.710
more quickly than having to go
through all of these steps and

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.300
walkthroughs beforehand.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.610
So here, I've skipped through
the walkthrough, and it's

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.650
asking me to sign in.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:07.970
And once again, I've
got 1,000 options.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.700
Do I log in?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.280
Do I register?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.290
Have I forgotten my password?

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.510
Maybe I want to sign in with
Twitter, or maybe I want to

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.280
browse without signing in.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.430
Now, all of these things
are on the page.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.290
Most of them have slightly
different UI elements.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.770
There's four buttons,
but they're in

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.680
two different colors.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.230
Does that mean anything?

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.340
Do the different colored buttons
represent a different

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.490
kind of choice?

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.240
If I've forgotten my password,
that's a link.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.840
So there's all of these
different ways of being able

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.175
to proceed.

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.909
And it can be quite confronting
to a new user to

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.010
try and figure out.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.925
I just want to get to the app.

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:40.305
And I should point out that both
the first screen and this

00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:42.789
screen both have a button that
will just let you skip forward

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.940
to the actual app itself.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.050
But it's buried amongst
all this other stuff.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.830
So again, here, I'd really
suggest that you try and cut

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.040
that down as much as possible.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.280
Make it as simple as you can.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.280
Make that login process
as simple as you can.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.080
And possibly put that further
into your app, once you get to

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.880
the point where they need to be
logged in to do something.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.650
Now again, in terms of UI,
you've some very non-standard

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.920
Android controls on screen.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.090
And I noticed that even the
text views are custom.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.120
They don't actually display
the cursor position when I

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.460
have them selected.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.490
And it's worth noting that the
buttons themselves don't

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.260
respond visibly to
being touched.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.130
So again, you press the button,
nothing happens until

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.720
you let go, and you're taken
to the next screen.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.090
And again, I'd like to see
Google+ sign in available as

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.780
an option here.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.200
Now, once I get through all of
this, I get to an empty screen

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.620
with a loading dialogue.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.300
I've already spent several
minutes clicking through

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.510
logins, looking through
walkthroughs.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.360
So it seems that by
this point, I've

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.520
spent a lot of time.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.730
It should have been enough time
to pre-fetch enough data

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.860
so that these first screens can
pop up instantly and have

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.180
the data that you want.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.150
So you want to take advantage
of that startup time,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.820
particularly if you have logins,
walkthroughs, or

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.270
anything like that, to
pre-populate the data--

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.810
at least the first page and
anything within a click of

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.810
that first landing page.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.930
You can also probably notice
that, along the bottom here,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.940
there's some buttons, and
they're totally blank.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.160
I'm guessing that's related to
some sort of custom control

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.440
that they've built and it's
not rendering properly.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.730
Again, one of the risks of
building things from scratch

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.370
when there's perfectly good
built-in framework components

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.730
which do that same
thing for you.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.960
Along the top, they have tabs
that aren't really tabs.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.750
I can't swipe between them.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.180
There's a bright pink Record
tab that's in the middle,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.840
which makes me think that's
what's selected.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.140
It isn't.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.340
It's also not a tab.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.660
It's a shortcut to the
Record screen.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.800
And I can see what they're
doing here.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.520
It's the most important
thing, so you make

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.980
that big and bright.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.840
But again, it's not obvious
what's happening here.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.910
It's not a button, it's a tab.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.610
It looks like the tab is
selected, and so I'm confused.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.730
How do I get it to
record something?

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.730
So again, you want to think
about that design language.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.980
Think about what a new user
is going to think.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.230
And an easy way to do this is
to give this app to someone

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.560
who you've told nothing about
what it is, preferably someone

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.830
who's not very good with
computers or smartphones.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.010
And see how they react.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.280
Do they click the right
button to begin with?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.770
And use analytics to
see how this goes.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.860
Particularly in something like
beta, I'm hoping that the team

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.310
here is using analytics to
find out which of their

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.880
features are discoverable.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.870
Now, on the plus side, we've got
the ability to listen to

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.290
community recordings, track
our own recordings.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.740
But again, you need to wait
for each of these lists to

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.910
load before they
get displayed.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.770
So as I click through these
tabs, I get that

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.760
same loading page.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.490
And every time I click, I get
the same loading page again.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.080
So you want to do some caching,
you want to do some

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.140
pre-fetching to make sure that
all of this stuff happens in

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.610
the background, without you
having to sit there

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.820
and wait for it.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.620
Now, if we move on to the meat
of the app, the recording

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.540
screen- or, as Ian christened
it earlier today, the

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.850
"confidence screen"--

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.850
same issues here.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.470
Nonstandard buttons, a
multitude of options.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.730
There's three buttons
to press here.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.630
Really, I just want to record
and then finish recording.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.220
As it happens, only the Pause
and Record button is really

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.160
relevant until I'm done,
unless you're providing

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.700
functionality like punch-in
punch-out that Ian was

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.830
describing earlier.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.030
So it makes sense not to confuse
the UI with options

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.250
that aren't really relevant
or available to me yet.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.520
Now, I like the countdown clock

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.410
combined with the counter.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.700
And the dot matrix view
to see the audio

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.430
levels looks quite nice.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.020
But I'd love to see them
go a couple of steps

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.910
further with this.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.650
Firstly, change the
bounce animation.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:13.880
So right now, as you're
recording audio, it's

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.490
basically a triangle that's
going to go up or down,

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.810
depending on the audio level.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.770
I'd like to see something like
a spectral analyzer, so I can

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.510
see which frequencies
are being recorded.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.290
It's non-trivial to implement,
but it looks really awesome.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.250
So it's something which may
be worth looking at.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, do you want
to have a spectrum with

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.030
more elements than 16?

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.850
RETO MEIER: Not necessarily.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think you could
do a 16-element with--

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.580
RETO MEIER: I think a 16-element
would be fine.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.580
You just want something
which gives you

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:41.870
more than just volume.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: I actually
think that it might

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.060
be a spectral analyzer.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.520
I was trying some different
frequencies.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.500
It's hard to do with
your voice.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.040
But I noticed a few
differences.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.010
I think they actually might be
doing a Fourier transform on

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:52.570
that

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.530
RETO MEIER: That would
be kind of cool.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: It would be.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.260
RETO MEIER: We'll have to
investigate further.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.590
Or perhaps the Audioboo guys can
reach out and let us know

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.025
if I'm just being an idiot.

00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:01.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, we'll
talk about that later.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.110
RETO MEIER: It's generally
the case.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: The idiot part.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.680
RETO MEIER: Yeah, clearly.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.220
Ian also pointed out how nice
it would be to see the audio

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.500
levels over time, so I can
confirm the things that I've

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.660
been recording have actually
been recording.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.540
So basically just that volume,
but over a period of time, to

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.420
see how it all goes.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.960
And again, if you take it to
that next step and provide

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.490
some ability to do edits, to do
punch-in punch-outs, it's a

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.570
really easy way for you to be
able to see where those

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.590
different segments of
your audio are.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.420
Now, once I'm done, I have this
awesome button at the

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.260
top, which is a Save/Delete
button,

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.970
which is quite a dichotomy.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.625
And I'd really strongly
suggest that

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:38.490
you separate these.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.520
It's very unlikely that
anyone's going to be

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.650
particularly comfortable hitting
a button that says

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.180
either Save or Delete.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.920
It's a 50/50 chance!

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.700
We'll see what happens!

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.320
That said, the recording
itself seemed

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.030
to work pretty well.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.290
I didn't notice any issues.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.400
I think Ian, you said that there
were some cut-outs when

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.240
you were doing some testing?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I did get
a drop-out on playback.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:03.520
But I think that's actually a
reported bug for JB 4.2.2,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.020
that there are some cases where
audio track or OpenSL

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.350
can drop the last few
milliseconds of a track.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.890
RETO MEIER: That's
interesting.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.100
So I didn't notice
any problems.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.830
It could very well
be our fault.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.830
But in any case, that all seemed
to work pretty well.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.930
And I'd really love to see, like
I said, that ability to

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.630
trim the start and ends of my
boos before I upload them and

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.950
publish them online.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.190
So overall, it's an
interesting app.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.250
It shows a lot of promise.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.160
But it also needs a lot of
work, particularly on the

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.770
UI/UX to make it more
responsive, simpler, easier to

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.360
get started.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.930
And overall, it really just
needs to take a close look at

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.960
the Android design guidelines
and see if you can make it a

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.980
little bit more consistent with
that way of interfacing

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.480
with users.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: Spreaker fails
test one with a complete lack

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.945
of a feature graphic.

00:14:52.945 --> 00:14:54.290
The icon is pretty
good, though.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.330
RETO MEIER: The icon
is pretty good.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Love to see them
go the whole way, drop the

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.740
box, and use the distinctive
silhouette exclusively.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.275
Because that is a very
distinctive silhouette.

00:15:02.275 --> 00:15:03.450
RETO MEIER: It's kind
of nice, right?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.220
You can see it here.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.050
You've got that black silhouette
with the Sprooker--

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.870
Speaker--

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.940
there's too many words which
sound like that but aren't--

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.210
logo built into the headphones,

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.290
which is quite neat.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.770
So they've got a couple
of really neat

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.990
branding elements here.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.790
And I'd love to see them
focus on that and

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.030
it exclude the rest.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now of course,
we've done a great favor to

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.430
the Spreaker team and previewed
the silhouette-only

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.150
version of their icon
automatically on the bottom of

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.050
our page here.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.450
Not right now, but--

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:33.630
RETO MEIER: True.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.270
Yes, You will see it shortly.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: They did happen
to use the same color of

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.910
chroma key green that we use
for the transparency here.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.240
RETO MEIER: So let's take a look
at how that would look.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: There we go.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.870
RETO MEIER: So that's exactly
the way which we think it

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.900
should look, is just
like this.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.050
With Reto's hand behind it.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.900
RETO MEIER: Well, exactly.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.140
That can help to really
reinforce the

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.510
branding, my hand.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.350
So we have a welcome screen
here, which tells us

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.010
everything we probably already
knew before we downloaded it

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.890
from Google Play.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.432
And unfortunately, there is
a Menu button of shame.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.820
The menu button does absolutely
nothing, which is

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.910
unfortunate.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.990
Looking at the app once I'd
spent a bit of time in there,

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.510
I realized this is probably an
app that hasn't really been

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.450
touched since probably
somewhere around the

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.720
Gingerbread days.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.930
So I'm not going to dwell on
that too much, particularly as

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.400
the developers here didn't
self-nominate.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.420
They didn't ask for
candid feedback.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.460
So I'm not going to
be too harsh.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.660
But it's definitely an example
of where you've got an app

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.320
which was launched much earlier
on in the life cycle.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.540
You don't want to
abandon that.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.400
You don't want to launch
and forget.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.740
Mobile phones, Android in
particular, the UX has really

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.850
taken a step forward over
the last few releases.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.130
So it's a good opportunity to
go back, update those apps.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.390
And we're seeing several apps
that we've looked out on The

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.070
App Clinic--

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.780
Grocery iQ, I think,
being the most

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.580
notable that I can recall--

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.900
which have done a complete

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.025
Holo-based UX redesign recently.

00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:58.640
And I think it really shows
how effective that can be.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.990
So once we get past that,
we can't continue

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.980
without signing in.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.460
Which is unfortunate, as it's
going to alienate a lot of

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.440
users who aren't willing to
create yet another account or

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.880
log in with the particular
social media option that you

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.560
have available.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.880
So at the very least, again, I
would like to see Google+.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.510
Basically, just having
one social media

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.760
network, it is a choice.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.640
But in this instance, it means
that I need to choose to

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.079
either create a new account or
log in with a particular

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.329
social media.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.440
As it happens, I really
struggled to actually

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.980
get into the app.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.190
And most users won't really have
the patience for that.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.700
It took a whole bunch of having
to jump through hoops,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.810
and then create the accounts,
and then it sent me an email,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.420
and then I had to have responded
to the email before

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.220
I could actually log
in on the phone.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.620
It was kind of painful.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.390
So you want to avoid that kind
of pain wherever possible.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.690
Once we get into the app itself,
again, most of the

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.590
features are very similar
to Audioboo.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.280
UX/UI issues, which are from an
older version of Android.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.600
Not going to dwell on that.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.740
The confidence recording screen
here, you can see that

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.270
their UI is fairly non-standard
in a way that

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.040
isn't a bad thing.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.550
But for UI features like
buttons and drop-downs,

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.820
there's really a lot to gain by
sticking to the standard,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.895
rather than going your own way
or trying to implement your

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.500
own versions of that.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.640
The recording experience is
actually pretty similar to

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.140
what we saw in Audioboo.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.330
So I'd really offer a lot
of the same feedback.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.510
And again, here, we would like
to see more than just the

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.760
amplification but something
which gives you an idea of how

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.830
the recording is going over
time, the frequencies being

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.560
recorded now.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.790
So that's particularly important
for Spreaker, whose

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.650
model is live broadcasts
rather than

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:40.840
pre-recorded podcasts.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.880
The idea here is that it's more
like a live radio station

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.070
that you fire up, you do your
thing, and people tune in

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.370
live, rather than downloading
podcasts to listen to.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.610
So I'm going to keep
that pretty short.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.250
I think we can probably turn
to Ian, our resident audio

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.530
expert, who has some tips for
how you can ensure that your

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.910
audio recording works and is
of the kind of quality that

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.820
you really need it
to be on Android.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: You bet.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.610
Thanks, Reto.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.170
Let's see if we can
get this working.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.050
Oh, look at me.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.030
Awesome.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.380
So on the surface, recording
on Android is dead simple.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.670
It hasn't changed for years.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.410
You create an audio record
object, and then you

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.040
call Read in a loop.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.430
And Read returns a buffer
full of audio samples.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.030
And you take those samples and
write them to some kind of

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.290
persistent storage.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.050
At the same time, you probably
want to use those samples or

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.270
some boiled-down version of them
to create that confidence

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.650
UI, which is either the bouncing
LED type of thing, or

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.640
maybe a little waveform,
or a spectral analyzer.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.760
Just something to let your user
know that something's

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.930
actually happening.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:53.100
But ti turns out that we have
the same problem that we have

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.820
in audio in general when
we're doing recording.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.135
And that's the problem
of latency.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.270
Usually, when we talk about
latency in audio, we're

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.650
talking about the latency
in the audio drivers and

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:09.070
hardware, which is usually
measured in a relatively small

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.150
number of milliseconds.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.090
Now, for some devices, that
might be hundreds of

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.710
milliseconds.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.370
But still, we're talking about
a fraction of a second.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.040
But for recording, we actually
have a different problem,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.380
especially for the type of
recording that we're doing,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.450
where the audio is not
going to fit into

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.910
the RAM of the device.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.410
It's not going to fit into the
heap allocated to your

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:30.930
application.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.270
It's going to need to go into
persistent storage or onto the

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.400
network, somewhere other than
where it is right now.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.300
So in that case, we're talking
about a latency number that

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.150
can get very, very large, up
into the multiple seconds.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.510
So I actually sat down with
Jean-Michel Trivi and Glenn

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.050
Kasten, two of our audio
engineers, this morning.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.580
And we had a yap about the old
times and talked about

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.460
recording on Android.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.970
And this is one of the things
that I hadn't realized.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.380
But Glenn said on the Nexus 7,
he could actually measure

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:11.780
three to four seconds of latency
going from memory to

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.810
persistent storage, in that
case, to flash memory.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.830
So we're actually talking
about a very

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.230
long period of time.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.220
Now, once things get started,
the flash memory is capable of

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.280
writing just as fast as the
microphone is producing data--

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.610
much faster, actually.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.300
But it takes a while
to get started.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.860
So of course, we need to fix
this with our old friend,

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.590
threads and extra buffers.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.910
That's the way we fix every
audio problem, is with a

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.510
little bit of extra buffering.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.560
So here's how we do it.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.350
We want to have one
thread that is

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.620
dedicated to recording.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.670
The way that the audio record
API is set up, you really

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.220
don't have a choice on this,
because audio record, first,

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.330
is a blocking API.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.630
When you call Read, it
will block until the

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.200
data has been read.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.580
Second, it's not a guaranteed
delivery API.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.750
In other words, if you don't
call Read often enough, you

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.550
simply will miss data.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.300
The data will just go off to
some other app or into the bit

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.630
bucket, and you won't
read it at all.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.090
So you get a dropout.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.300
So you want one thread that's
doing nothing but call Read

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.040
over and over and over again.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.510
That's the Record thread
in this diagram.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.870
So every time it gets a buffer,
it does two things.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:32.110
First, it's going to pass it off
to a write buffer, which

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.280
is going to be a very, very long
buffer that's being read

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.440
by another thread, the
storage thread.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.800
And the second thing it's
going to do is pass some

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.690
version of that audio data off
to the UI thread so that it

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.200
can create the confidence UI.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.380
And usually, this is going to
either be RMS level, or it's

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.640
going to be a spectral analysis,
or just something to

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.230
let us know that things
are still happening.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.850
Of course, if the latency on the
SD card is very high, then

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.650
you're going to end up with an
awful lot of data stacked up

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:01.960
in the write buffer.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.570
And software being what it is,
sooner or later, you're going

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.480
to get into a situation where
it won't all fit.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.550
Now, if you're running into
this condition a lot, that

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.840
means you probably made your
write buffer too small.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.120
You're going to need
to enlarge it.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.350
But even with the biggest write
buffer in the world,

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.150
someone, somewhere, on some
device is going to end up

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.360
running out of space.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.470
Maybe they're running too much
in the background, or maybe

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.890
the SD card is filling up.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.760
Or maybe there's an abundance
of cosmic rays in their neck

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.160
of the woods, and all their
devices are beginning to

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.730
inexplicably fail.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:39.330
Whatever the condition, you need
to be prepared for it.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.300
So how do you do that?

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.400
Well, when you run out of record
thread space-- so in

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.220
other words, when the Record
thread can't write to the

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.730
write buffer anymore, that's
when you need to signal a

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.620
dropout to the UI thread.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.730
So there's two lessons here.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.940
First is that you need to make
sure that whatever you're

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:05.570
using for a write buffer, it
has the ability to handle a

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.840
single-writer, single-reader,
multi-threaded case.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.700
And it has some size that it can
signal back when it's full

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.330
to the write thread so
that you can detect

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.420
these dropout cases.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.860
And then you just want to turn
your UI red, or whatever it is

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.190
that's going to let your
user know that some

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.990
audio is going to miss.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.450
That way, they can either stop
the recording and try again or

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.860
whatever action they
want to take.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.560
Now, there's a number of other
things that you can do to make

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.770
this sort of app better.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.310
And we don't have time to go
over all of them in depth.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.080
But let's talk about
just a couple.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.740
For instance, Reto already
mentioned that running a

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.380
simple Fourier transform, even
just an 8- or 16-element

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.160
transform, over your audio will
let you do a little bit

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.910
of spectral analysis.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:58.170
Doing a larger Fourier
transform, with maybe 256

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.390
elements, would let you do
things like show whether there

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.180
is excessive noise in the input
signal, which could be

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.570
really useful in a mobile app.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.330
Or you might want to use the new
MediaCodec API that came

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.420
out in Jelly Bean.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.720
And you could use that to access
the FLAC encoder or the

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.000
MP3 encoder so that
what you write to

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.120
persistent storage is smaller.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.540
You don't have to do as much
processing, because that's

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.050
possibly a hardware-accelerated
stage.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:27.950
I don't actually think
that for audio it is.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.270
But it could be.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.170
In any case, we're talking about
things that take a lot

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:39.230
of processing power, not just
spectrum analysis but perhaps

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.650
multiband compression or
automatic gain control.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.590
All of these things will make
your audio recording sound

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.380
significantly more
professional.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.120
We don't have any samples
ourselves in the Android group

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.750
that would show you how to
take advantage of the

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.190
processing power on a mobile
device for this type of audio.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.350
But before the show, I Googled
"renderscript" and "audio,"

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.210
and came up with a bunch of
GitHub projects from people

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.490
who have done this exact thing,
using renderscript.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.470
Now, renderscript has the
benefit that it works on

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.970
pretty much all Android
platforms now.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.390
It doesn't require you to know
anything about the underlying

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.290
architecture.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.910
And it's really, super fast for
doing the sorts of things

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.810
that you're likely to do
when you're trying

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.090
to process a podcast.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.520
So I'd encourage you to take
a look into that if you're

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.550
looking for professional
audio features.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.410
With that, back to Reto.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.340
RETO MEIER: So our next step
is to take a closer look at

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.500
today's apps and see
how close they are

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.850
to being pure Android.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.400
Now, I think given the place
that each of them are,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.285
particularly Audioboo being in
beta and Spreaker being, I

00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:53.220
think, an app which hasn't
been updated particularly

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.830
recently in terms of UI and UX,
that they're probably a

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.830
little distance from that.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.370
But we would suggest to those
developers to start by going

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.810
through each of these
checklists, particularly while

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.740
you're still in beta, to find
out how much closer you can

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.510
get to being pure Android,
and really make

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.140
that launch a success.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.010
Until then, you can find our
pure Android collection at

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.420
bit.ly/PureAndroid.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.350
And you can nominate your app
for consideration by adding it

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.430
to our Trello page,
by searching

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.700
for App Clinic Trello.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.610
And you'll see there exactly
what topics we have planned

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.470
for the next few weeks.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.032
In fact, tomorrow--

00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:32.760
not tomorrow, next week, we are
going to be experimenting

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.360
with the app clinic by holding
a special session for the

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.680
members of the Prague Google
Developers group.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.350
So we're going to be recording
that early next week and

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.000
putting it online for you
guys to check out

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.990
some time after that.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.610
This is a new initiative that
we're going to try out to try

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.410
and get some of these
GDGs more involved

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.010
with the process here.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.650
So it you are part of a GDG or
run a GDG, let us know, and

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.520
we'll see if we can include
you in the schedule.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:58.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.030
We'll be back later in
the week to look at--

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.830
what is later in the week?

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.110
RETO MEIER: Weather.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.340
I think we're looking at
weather apps next week.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're looking
at weather apps.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.760
And the Android Design
in Action is also?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.890
RETO MEIER: I'm not sure.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.350
I think so.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.200
I think the Design in Action
team should also

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.260
be looking at weather.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.970
I'm not sure if Roman's going to
be available, so it may be

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.540
Nick and Adam taking a
look at weather apps.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.110
But we'll check in with
them and find out.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sounds good.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.170
RETO MEIER: So until next
week, I'm Reto Meier.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.040
RETO MEIER: And this has
been The App Clinic.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:29:26.248
