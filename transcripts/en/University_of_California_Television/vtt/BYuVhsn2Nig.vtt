00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.114
(pulsating music)

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.720
- If you ask, how does a brain work

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.200
from an engineering perspective,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.750
then you might ask, what is
the circuit diagram look like?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.160
After all, if complex modern
processors are designed

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.330
and understood by engineers,
then maybe a simple brain

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.540
could be likewise
understood at that level.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.240
Let's consider exactly
that, a simple processor.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.270
And if you take the lid off,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.340
you'll find underneath the die, the chip.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.700
Looking at it a little bit closer,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.820
you'll see that it's broken
up into various modules

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.580
for processing, for input
from various sources

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
and for outputs, memory and
likewise in the control.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.580
If you look at a small
region and zoom in on it,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.580
you'll find it's covered by a
vast mesh of tiny, tiny wires.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.830
This is about, maybe,
a dozen layers thick.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.520
Underneath it all, there
are the actual switches,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.480
the transistors, which
do the switching on this.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.690
Now if you wanna make it, you just need

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.300
a few billion dollars, machines like this,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.390
and you're good.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.200
If you wanna reverse engineer it,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.730
then maybe you could use
some machines like this

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.160
as one example which I'll be discussing

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.210
in more detail called a FIB-SEM.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.990
Now on the other end, here's
another processing unit.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.750
Let's take the cover off and
underneath there's a brain

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.210
and it too has various
modules in it, you know,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.510
optical inputs, called optic lobes,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.020
antenna inputs for smell, memory units,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.410
they all have different names,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.440
mushroom bodies, ellipsoid
bodies, and so forth.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.380
Studied by biologists.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.180
So you can also zoom in
and look very carefully

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.580
and presumably, there's also gonna be

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.450
a vast mesh of wiring in there

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.140
and somehow buried in
underneath all of that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.060
should be synapses, which
are switching between

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.750
all of these different wires.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.090
Now if you wanna make one of these,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.123
you need to invest in an old banana.

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:35.060
(audience laughing)

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.060
- And wait, not much cost,
and it'll self assemble.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.230
And it's amazing, and
you've heard about this,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.780
you know, in the first talk,
and it's truly amazing.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.860
So now if you wanna reverse engineer it,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.040
we really need, it's a tough problem,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.260
and we need tools from
across the spectrum.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.420
From biology, from genetics,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990
and I'll talk a little bit of
the aspect that can come in

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.740
from the semi-conductor
industry, that FIB-SEM.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.840
So just to put a perspective,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.130
let's put some dimensions on these

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.240
and compare them side-by-side.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.110
A current processor is sort
of a flattened structure,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.700
2 1/2 dimensions, but the volume

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.930
of it is under a millimeter.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.310
The fruit fly, it's a nice little blob,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.660
under a millimeter in size.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.930
Not too different in the volume.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.840
The number of transistors
and switches in the processor

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.180
are getting pretty impressive,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.110
about a billion transistors nowadays.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.000
That's a bit more than the fruit fly.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.880
If you go back 10 years, the Pentiums,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.820
they had about a comparable number.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.050
And the last part, now, is the wire size

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.900
and the transistor size and the
dendrite size, synapse size,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.900
they're all in the tens of nanometers.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.360
Very small, and the challenge
is to bridge the gap

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.230
between the small size
of tens of nanometers

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.760
all the way up to a good
fraction of a millimeter

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.290
and catch that large, dynamic range.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.320
So to reliably resolve these transistors

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.750
in all three dimensions,
we need to sample,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.350
probably instead of 15 nanometers,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.130
maybe at five or 10 nanometer increments.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.470
These are the voxels that
you'd use to form images

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.490
and you've seen before,
one can sort of collect

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.950
many such images in 3D, form a stack.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.930
But if you just quickly
look at the numbers,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.990
how many voxels, how
many pixels are there?

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.517
Eight nanometers compared
to half a millimeter.

00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:39.760
There're lots, it's a good
fraction of a pieta byte

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.220
and if you're acquiring the data

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.145
at a modest rate of a megahertz,

00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:47.010
then you'd be acquiring
data for eight years,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.070
even for something simple
as a fruit fly plane.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.530
Now I should also point out,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.540
we do need to really see the connectivity,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.960
one needs to go down to the EM level,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.879
to the electron microscope level.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.960
Light microscopy cannot
quite resolve the details

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.050
and see the fine connectivity.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.200
Light microscopy can do many
other things, image life,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.020
so all these techniques are very

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.430
complementary and support each other.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.090
So what is the FIB-SEM?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.660
This is basically an
instrument where you use FIB,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.710
which is a focused ion beam,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.620
and it basically abrades away the surface

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.690
a few dentimeters at a time.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.570
The advantage of an ion beam is

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.000
the abrasion is just a little bit finer,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.670
more controlled, in the Z-dimension.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.050
Otherwise it's very similar to what Mark

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.570
was talking about earlier,
the serial block face cutting.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.080
After you abrade or remove a little layer,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.630
you image the surface with
a scanning electron beam

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.500
and then you ablade again
and you cycle through this

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.870
about every minute, and
you keep going and going

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.940
for as long as you possibly
can and in the end,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.300
you gradually reconstruct a circuit.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.620
In this case, if you're looking
at a semi-conductor chip,

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.340
you can see all the metal layers inside.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.780
If one's looking at a fly brain,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.690
then you should get a
three-dimensional reconstruction

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.580
of all the details inside.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.160
So this here is the outline
of one of these synapses,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.970
the black part is actually
the membrane itself.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.880
Ah, and there you can see.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.880
So what you saw, time
here is moving in in Z

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.430
and you'll see on the
left picture right there

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.980
the dark spots, those are
actually the synapses,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.330
they're pretty small, and this
is a typical fan in circuit,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.774
they're multiple synapses
going all onto one dendrite.

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:49.020
And you see the opposite in the fly,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.780
fan ins, fan outs, there're
just a variety of structures

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.690
that are all visible.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.670
It's more complex than it
is for a mammalian brain.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.680
So we got one of these
machines and started out.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.250
And so we ran it.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.520
Three days later,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.340
it came to a grinding halt and stopped.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.340
And so we imaged 1/1000 of a
brain and couldn't continue,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.250
there were problems, and so
we came to this conclusion.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.820
- FIB-SEM's irrelevant because it can't

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.640
image anything useful.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.432
I continued to be employed.

00:07:25.432 --> 00:07:26.670
(audience laughing)

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.300
And worked on the next problem,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.860
five years of reliability engineering.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.130
Basically to handle all of
these interrupts as they happen,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.120
can we anticipate things,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.450
make graceful stops if something
bad is going to happen,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.570
mitigate damage control,
and we can restart

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.705
without loss of anything.

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:50.880
The bar is very high
because if you have a gap

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.939
in this dense interconnect of wiring,

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:56.010
there's no way that you
can connect the wires

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.520
from the left half to the right half

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.020
and you're circuit
diagram is just useless.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.840
So you don't want to be
there imaging several years

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.840
into the project and then say oops.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.240
So a few years later, here we are,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.920
imaging now for about
a three months project.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.500
That is looking at the optical lobe.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.316
You might've noticed three pieces,

00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:20.450
madella, lobula, and lobula plate.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.840
And this is sort of what
you see inside a fly brain.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.720
The motion you see is, again,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.720
is moving in Z deeper and deeper.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.890
Initially the width was about 120 microns,

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.380
it's about the width of two human hairs,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.550
and in zooming in about 10x,
and we can look at detail,

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.610
and for example right
there, that's a synapse,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.290
and it's connecting this dendrite

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.130
over to several other
guys on the other side.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.520
It's all very subtle.

00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:56.130
It's a big challenge

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.130
to try to pull all of that
information out and segment it.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.300
So it took us three months to image this,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.900
and then we gave it to some other people,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.540
and about three years later,
they processed the data.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.030
Processing it and analyzing it is, by far,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.720
the bigger challenge.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.160
This is not easy and it
requires a lot of hand effort,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.640
or it did require a lot
of hand effort to segment,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.340
curate, make sure there's
no mistake in there.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.190
And what we're doing here
is dense segmentation.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.650
We're getting, pretty
much, all of the processes,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.870
all of the neurons, identifying them,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.100
and then you can pull
them out, one by one,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.610
and you find that they have their own

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.070
unique shapes and sizes

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.960
and compare them to what is
known from other experiments.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.330
For example, some of these neurons

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.680
are coming in from the retina,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.480
some of them are
sensitive to on-transition

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.700
or to off-transition or
to a left-to-right motion

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.450
or front-to-back motion,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.900
and people can identify that

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:09.540
based on optical imaging.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.570
But optical imaging can't tell you

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.460
the detailed synaptic connectivity,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.280
but it can give you the classes of neuron

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.100
so one can connect the two
and bootstrap our way forward.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.470
In addition, optical imaging
can look at life samples, too,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.200
and tell which ones are firing

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.270
on on-transitions and off-transitions

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.070
and we can actually monitor that.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.340
So all of that data can be put together

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.510
and you can begin to
identify the components

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.220
of a circuit diagram.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.780
And these are the three major
parts that you saw earlier,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.520
the madella, the lobula,
and the lobula plate.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.440
Up here's the retina.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.090
The thing is with the FIB-SEM,

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.620
it allows you to make the
last little connection,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.060
which is to ask, here's one neuron,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.760
which we know reacts to a
left-to-right on-transition,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.340
what are its inputs?

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.220
And you can define the neurons that are

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.250
responsible for that,
characterize those independently,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.350
and we make this last step,
and then you can begin

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.290
to test models of the circuit.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.290
Is this a coincidence detector
based on exutory inputs,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.980
is it a different version of that,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.720
a nor-detector where you might have

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.160
an inhibitory input on one side.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.250
And it turns out that it's a little bit

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.150
a combination of both are
present in the fly brain,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.480
and you can even sort of get estimates

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.940
of what might be causing the delay

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.330
based on the length on the synapse.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.380
So having this extra level of detail

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.910
helps close a lot of open gaps.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.710
So so far, we still haven't
gotten to the full fly brain

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.930
and we reverted to another technique

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.550
called hot knife sectioning
to get all the way up.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.080
Imagine the fly brain,
you chop it up into, like,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.880
a loaf of bread, into about 30 pieces,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.140
each about 20 nanometers thick.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.390
You put it on a little laminated surface

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:02.120
and you have about 30 of these tabs

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.630
and feed them in to a bunch of machines.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.310
And this puts us in the range of getting

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.430
this eight FIB-SEM year effort

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.620
maybe down to a little
bit more reasonable time.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.300
And we are gearing up and trying

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.780
to expand toward this direction here.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.450
And so far, over the past two years,

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.715
we've come just a little
ways along that path.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:29.350
Looking in here, we have what we've

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.630
accomplished called a hemi brain.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.130
It aspires to be half a brain,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.420
but it's a little bit shy of it.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.180
It's on a female fly, but it's unilateral

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.430
over a good part of it,
misses some aspects, you know,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.480
too much on the optic lobe,
missing the parts below

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.090
which are associated with
feeding and appetite,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.610
but a lot of modules are in there.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.310
The central complex,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.170
which is sort of an internal
compass for the fly,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.200
and people are studying
that independently.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.580
Olfactory learning and the mushroom body,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.820
lateral horns, all these
names are dear to biologists

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.560
studying different parts of the fly brain.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.990
Here's what that looks like.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.430
That big round circle,
the donut that you saw,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.730
that's the ellipsoid body,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.390
and that's associated with its navigation,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.880
sort of an internal compass of the fly.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.920
And here we're just sort
of flying through the data

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.000
and you can just sort of see the complex.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.670
Here we're getting pretty close at this,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.210
you know, resolution isn't as beautiful

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.160
as what Mark has with the
dedicated high-res microscope,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.970
but we're doing, right
here, as we fly in and out,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.570
that's going across that section.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.430
We have to make sure that
section has good enough quality

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.710
that we can match the dendrites

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.217
from one side to the other without loss.

00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:50.700
That's critical.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.220
And I'll just let this play a little bit.

00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:00.170
It's amazing that this thing self-wires

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.700
and it looks so disorganized

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.230
but in the end it really is organized.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.020
And there are the different
modules, we're zooming back out.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.590
Here you can see the whole upper head

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.210
of the fly brain there.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.280
Remember, these are several slabs

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.690
and we're just gonna
go through six of them,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.060
we have 13 altogether.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.923
This represents about two years
of imaging that we've done.

00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:23.760
We've just sort of completed this.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.240
And what will come next after this,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.060
we want to go over, try
looking at a male fly,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.901
but doing it now in its
entirety all the way

00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:37.140
and that'll be a larger imaging effort.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.260
And here we are back
to the central complex.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.850
So what's next?

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.190
That data is not good enough by itself,

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.950
it needs some processing,
and it goes off to experts,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.700
computer science experts
who use neural nets,

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.180
and there've been a lot of
fascinating developments

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.700
in the past few years of what they can,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.600
how quickly they can extract it,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.610
so they are now maybe at the level

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.270
where instead of taking 10
times longer than imaging,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.430
they might almost be able to keep up

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.500
and pull out the nerves and get
these connectivity diagrams,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.530
what nerve connects to
what, out of the thousands,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.400
hundreds of thousands to
different nerves in there

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.890
and give those to biologists
so that can be correlated

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.370
with all the other information
that they work with.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.370
So, like to put this
technology, this FIB-SEM,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.980
on a little diagram like this

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.600
just to show where it
might fit into the world.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.790
The bottom axis is size.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.930
We're looking at relative
larger size structures,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.070
it's getting close to a millimeter,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.490
little bit below that for the fly brain.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.030
And the vertical axis is resolution.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.420
There's some techniques out
there, as Mark talked about,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.620
which can get much better resolution,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.450
but the size is going to be
a little bit more limited

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.930
and we're playing this trade
off between size and resolution

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.450
and I think FIB-SEM has a
little bit of a sweet spot,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.990
and fly brain sort of demands
some of those attributes.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.789
Now the FIB-SEM can also be used

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:15.628
in a different modality where you can

00:16:15.628 --> 00:16:18.070
operate it with lower current.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.730
And in there, one might be
able to image, let's say,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.850
a whole cell with higher resolution.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.290
The whole cell's smaller in
volume but higher resolution.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.680
And images, instead of
being blurry like this,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.970
can be somewhat crisper,
and we can see a more detail

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.290
of the synapse in the
bottom slide over here,

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.590
like right down here, post
synaptic vesicles over here,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.970
individual ribosomes can be imaged

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.590
and at the top, we can
even see microtubuals.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.840
This is just a random
piece of mammalian cortex,

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.040
and one can take out a part of that,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.560
segment it similar to what Mark has shown,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.180
and you can get all the
intercellular organelles,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.220
endoplasmic reticula, the mitochondria,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.050
and mine it for various details,

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.590
or the bottom, maybe even
label all the vesicles.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:19.140
It's up to the biologists
how they begin to mine

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.190
this kind of information,
but it is accessible.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.780
So where do we go from here?

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.320
I think next we'll continue on trying

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.240
to acquire the fly brain atlas.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.350
That's gonna be a little
bit of a longer-term effort

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.300
and that'll be, then, combined with all

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.420
the neural processing

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.640
to get the synaptic details

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.230
and the connectivity diagram,

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.117
and then that'll be
absorbed by other scientists

00:17:50.117 --> 00:17:53.580
with light imaging and behavior

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.270
to really understand the circuitry.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.330
I think, going on to the
next level beyond that,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.510
after we have one nice, complete brain,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.870
you begin to look at differences.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.940
And I think this will be
another exciting phase

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.070
for this field where we look
at fly-to-fly difference.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.330
In the semi-conductor industry,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.260
if you wanna do failure analysis,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.510
you do die-to-die.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.260
Two computer chips, take two images,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.730
subtract them from another,
if there's a difference,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.680
that's a error, you throw it out,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.900
or you know where the problem is.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.340
Here, we have to do a
similar version, fly-to-fly,

00:18:28.652 --> 00:18:31.730
and the differences could
be in development stage,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.370
not being overwhelmed
by all the background,

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.750
or is there experience, is there memory,

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.170
can we pull it out?

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.430
Is it gonna be represented
in this EM data or not?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.290
But I think it'll be just,
you know, fascinating time.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.245
Thanks for your attention.

00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:48.390
(audience applauding)

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.490
- So what I'd like to tell you about today

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:56.370
is our efforts to get a high
temporal and spatial resolution

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.600
of changes in membranes in the cell.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.840
And what we're doing is
using electron microscopy

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.190
with a technique that's
called flash and freeze.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.670
And the key to this
technique is to be able

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.560
to synchronize this cell
at a particular time

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.030
and then look at events
that occur afterward.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.380
And so we've come up with two methods

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.490
for synchronizing cellular activity.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.470
The first is light stimulation

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.430
and the second is electrical stimulation,

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.980
so I'll tell you about both of those.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.940
So the way a synapse works is shown here.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.940
I think a lot of you
are familiar with that.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.400
This is the vision of Bernard Katz.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.430
And here's the cell body of the neuron

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.390
and an action potential
travels down this axon

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.060
and then invades the bouton,
the presynaptic bouton,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.570
and what that does is open
voltage gated calcium channels.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.290
And calcium channels then open up

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.550
and cause the fusion of synaptic vesicles

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.760
filled with neurotransmitter to fuse

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.460
at the plasma membrane and
release those molecules

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.850
onto ligand gated ion channels
on the postsynaptic surface.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.710
And so at the time, this was not believed.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.200
It was thought that
these synaptic vesicles

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.230
that were observed did in
fact contain neurotransmitter,

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.910
but they were just storage
organelles for neurotransmitter.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.850
And the reason was that no
one had seen these vesicles

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.010
actually fuse with the plasma
membrane after a stimulus,

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.040
and so it wasn't clear that this part

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.830
of the hypothesis was correct.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.860
And it took some 23 years
before that was proven.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.860
And that was proven by the work
of John Heuser and Tom Reese

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.400
because they built a
really cool instrument

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.590
called the freeze slammer,
and that's what's shown here.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.560
So they have a piece of
the frog pectoral muscle,

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.170
which is really thin and
can freeze very rapidly,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.530
and then they have nerves
that are still attached

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.430
and wrapped around stimulating wires.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.060
And these stimulating wires,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.140
this whole apparatus was
attached here to this rod

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.850
and the stimulating wires went up

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.070
and could be connected to a circuit.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.480
And so what they could do then
was release this solenoid,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.340
and then as the bar was
falling through space,

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.280
they would calculate five milliseconds

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.950
before it hit a copper
block, cooled to four Kelvin,

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.610
stimulate the motor neurons,
which would then cause

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.150
an action potential,
which would then cause

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.950
the release of neurotransmitter

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.550
at the neuro muscular junction.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.180
And then they could ask whether
the vesicles actually fused.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.910
And this is the image they got out of it,

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.780
absolutely spectacular.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.230
So here is a frog neural muscular junction

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.700
which has not been stimulated.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.810
You can see that there are
vesicles that are docked

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.760
at that surface, and it stimulated

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.220
and then frozen five milliseconds later,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.080
you see these beautiful
fusions that are taking place

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.950
of the synaptic vesicles
fusing with the plasma membrane

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.220
and releasing neurotransmitter.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.220
So Katz' quantal and vesicle
hypothesis was thereby proved.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.380
But Tom and John also recognized

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.080
that there was another problem.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.240
And that is that there
was a limited number

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.350
of synaptic vesicles at a synapse.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.720
And so at a neuro muscular
junction maybe there's 300.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.000
And a mouse neuromuscular
junction can fire

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.700
at 100 times a second, so at these rates,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.260
you can see that the
synaptic vesicles could be

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.530
rapidly consumed and then
you would exhaust the synapse

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.600
and it would no longer be functional.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.480
And so they then were convinced that these

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.530
synaptic vesicles had
to be recycled locally.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.460
It would take a week for
vesicles to be transported

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.370
down the axom to replenish a synapse,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.140
so there had to be local recycling.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.000
And so what they did was they used

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.263
their freeze slammer once again.

00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:45.950
And now, instead of
freezing five milliseconds

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.790
after stimulation, would freeze one second

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.637
and then two seconds,
10 seconds, 15 seconds,

00:22:51.637 --> 00:22:55.350
to 30 seconds, and then look
at each of those stages and see

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.240
whether they could see
membrane being taken back in.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.520
Now this is a freeze fracture,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.970
so what they've done is
they've taken their ice block

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.570
and they've hit it with
a wedge on the side,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.740
and that ice block will break
where the weak parts are.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.430
So where are the weak parts?

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.160
It's where the lipid bilayers are,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.620
so there's no covalent bonds
between those lipid bilayers.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.810
Everything else is frozen
and stuck together,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.380
so when they strike the block,

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.340
it splits at the lipid bilayer,

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.400
they can coat that with an
electron-dense material,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.920
take those replicas, and put them

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.480
in the electron microscope,
and this is what they saw.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.830
At zero milliseconds, that
is an unstimulated synapse,

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.080
you could see these little buttons,

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.690
and those are likely
to be calcium channels.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.810
At five milliseconds after stimulation,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.560
they could see these indentations,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.580
and these are vesicles
that are on the other side

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.830
of the screen, right,
we're looking at the face

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.020
of the synapse, those are now fusing

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.280
with the membrane and
creating these dimples.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.724
Then they looked at one
second and three seconds,

00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:58.360
10 seconds and so on,
and they saw nothing.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.130
And it wasn't until 30
seconds that they began to see

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.830
these proteins would come
together and form clusters

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.870
and then they would be pulled inside,

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:08.240
so you see these little dips.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.110
This one in particular is beautiful

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.830
because you can see the
neck where it broke off

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.890
because, of course, you can't break into

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.090
that concave surface.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.560
When they looked at cross sections,

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.160
they saw that these
invaginations were coated

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.342
with this electron-dense material

00:24:24.342 --> 00:24:28.080
and it had been seen
before, this is clathrin.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.730
They now were able to
say that at synapses,

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.890
after stimulation, that
vesicles or membranes

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.680
that are lost to the plasma membrane,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.990
are recycled via this
clathrin-mediated process,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.440
and the process is rather slow,
it takes about 30 seconds.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.890
So we have revisited those experiments

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.970
and I think we see another
process that's occurring.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.430
We call this ultrafast
endocytosis and in this case,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.770
we see that the membrane
is removed from the surface

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.190
between 50 to 300 milliseconds
in a mouse neuron.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.970
This then generates a synaptic
endosome within one second.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.580
These are budded by clathrin
into mature synaptic vesicles

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.890
that can be refilled and
reused in five seconds.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.210
So the process that we're
observing is much faster

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.470
than what had been observed
by Heuser and Reese.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.760
When we started these experiments,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.780
we needed a way to replicate
the freeze slammer,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.350
we needed to freeze the
samples as quickly as possible

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.190
and it needed to be deep
because the first organism

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.040
that we did this in was C. elegans,

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.090
and so it's 80 to 100 microns thick,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.040
so we needed to have a frozen
sample all the way through

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.550
So the way that a
high-pressure freezer works,

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.000
it goes from one to 2,000
atmospheres in 15 milliseconds.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.640
So the water molecules
are vibrating around,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.920
but under high pressure
they become sluggish.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.170
And if you can drop the
temperature fast enough,

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.720
then you don't have
time for those molecules

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.820
to reorder themselves and
then generate ice crystals.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.170
Ice crystals will shred your cells,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.450
so there will be no morphology left.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.980
And so by doing this, we're
able to freeze the sample

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.530
without any distortions from ice crystals.

00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:18.390
The experiments I'm gonna show you here

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.770
are not done in C.
elegans and the nematode,

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.340
they're done in cultured
hippocampal neurons.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.930
And so now what we need
to do is we have these

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:28.840
in the high-pressure
chamber, but we need some way

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.150
to initiate a deep polarization
that will then initiate

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.510
that action potential and
then stimulate this synapse

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.470
so that we can look for vesicle fusions

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:41.280
and endocytosis at that synapse.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.520
And the way we're doing that
is with channelrhodopsin,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.570
so channelrhodopsin is a
light-activated ion channel.

00:26:48.734 --> 00:26:52.310
When you stimulate it
with 470 nanometer light,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.380
you can then open that
channel and sodium will flow

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.550
into that neuron and then
cause an action potential.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.410
So we now have a way to
stimulate an action potential

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.420
in a neuron that's deep inside
this high-pressure chamber.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.350
So let me just show you
that this actually works.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.310
Here is a neuron that's
expressing channelrhodopsin,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.840
this is on-cell configuration.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.110
We stimulate with light and
here is the light stimulus,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.380
it's 10 milliseconds long, and you can see

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.010
these beautiful action potentials

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.130
that are occurring during
the light stimulus.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.440
Usually there's just one,

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.780
but in this case we see that there are

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.340
two axion potentials occurring.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.590
We can then move that pipette
to a post-synaptic neuron

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.690
that is not expressing channelrhodopsin,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.320
so it will not be stimulated by light,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.890
but it will receive
inputs from this neuron.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.010
So we flash the light, that
now fires an action potential

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.910
and what we can see are
these post-synaptic currents.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:51.340
These are synaptic
currents, they're beautiful,

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.640
and you can see in this case we also had

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.890
two action potentials that were leading

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.830
to this post-synaptic current.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.750
So then we now have a
neuron that's expressing

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.230
channelrhodopsin in our
high-pressure chamber,

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.300
but we need to get a light
path into that chamber.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.870
And so we modified the
Leica high-pressure freezer

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.630
at the time, and so it is
composed of this structure here.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.070
So here's the specimen cup,
that's where our neurons

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.940
are going to go, and it's
held in place by a bayonet.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.500
And this bayonet will
then fire down a rail

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.760
into the high-pressure chamber,
the chamber will close,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.540
and then it fires and freezes the sample.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.560
So what we did was we,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.090
here's this little cup
that holds the neurons,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.360
there's a black diamond anvil here,

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.870
and the pressure comes
here and slams out against

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.860
that black diamond anvil and
creates 2,000 atmospheres.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.490
Liquid nitrogen flows around

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.610
on either side to freeze the sample.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.120
So what we did was we
replaced that sapphire,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.500
the black anvil with a sapphire anvil,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.570
we then drilled out that mounting screw,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.180
and we drilled out the bayonet

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.700
so that we had an LED right at this point

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.660
and now we have a light
path to the sample.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.420
So the experiment now is quite simple.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.330
We're going to provide a
10-millisecond light stimulus,

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.880
and then we'll freeze at 15
milliseconds, 30 milliseconds,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.830
50 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.550
300 milliseconds, et cetera.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.260
These were the first images we got,

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.130
and we were extremely excited by these

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.770
'cause they're just beautiful.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.670
So if we freeze 15 milliseconds
after the stimulation,

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.540
we see vesicles fusing
with the plasma membrane.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.710
It's just, isn't that beautiful?

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.000
It's collapsing into the membrane.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.340
Here at 30 milliseconds,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.510
almost fully collapsed into the membrane.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.580
So we can capture those very rapid events

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.600
caused by an action potential
causing vesicles to fuse.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.760
So what about recycling, right?

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.170
Remember, it took 30 seconds in the Heuser

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.630
and Reese experiments and we came up,

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.810
we saw he had a huge
surprise when we saw that

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.030
recycling of the membrane was occurring

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.460
on the scale of 100 milliseconds.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.900
So here's the active zone,
that's where vesicles are fusing,

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.390
and at the lateral edge,
at 50 milliseconds,

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.380
you can already see this
invagination that's building.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.230
At 100 milliseconds it's much deeper,

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.630
and this one you can actually see

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.500
some electron-dense material.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.700
The membrane is being
cut from the surface,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.855
so that is the act of endocytosis.

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:21.870
And then at 300 milliseconds,
you can see that the vesicle's

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.920
been completely cleaved from the membrane.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.730
So we can now calculate the
time during which endocytosis

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.020
is taking place, and that is seen

00:30:33.894 --> 00:30:35.740
by quantifying the number of each

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.420
of these structures we see.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.560
We see the first pits at 30 milliseconds,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.070
then we see large vesicles
form at 50 milliseconds,

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.000
we see the last pits
forming at 300 millisecond

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.600
and so that determines the
first presence of vesicles

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.880
and the last presence of
the appearance of vesicles.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.880
So endocytosis is taking place

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.040
between 50 to 300 milliseconds.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.040
So this is a tomogram, and
it's really an important image.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.120
So I wanna spend a minute on it.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.270
So what we've done here
is done a tilt series

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.310
and reconstructed the electron densities

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.590
inside that thick section.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.980
And we have now drawn this membrane,

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.410
the presynaptic membrane,
slightly transparent.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.670
You can see the postsynaptic
density which is shown in red

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.750
through the membrane, and so that defines

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.410
where the synaptic
vesicles are being released

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:32.080
and where the receptors
are on the other side.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.990
In this synapse, you
can see that there are

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.920
three synaptic vesicles
fusing at this point

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.940
in this active zone.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.230
Look here, already you can
see these invaginations

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.220
that are taking place at the
lateral edge of this synapse.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.700
This means that the membrane
that is in the synaptic vesicle

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.530
and is fusing is not the same membrane

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.900
that is being taken up
by ultrafast endocytosis.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.590
Here at 100 milliseconds,

00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:01.710
the fusions have fully
collapsed into the membrane.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.620
Here is one of those shallow invaginations

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.080
and here's one that's being
cleaved from the surface,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.270
the active endocytosis.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.730
So we're able to then follow what happens

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.670
to this membrane later,
and what you can see

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.120
is that it is transported
to the back of the synapse,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.540
and it makes these large
synaptic endosomes, shown here,

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.650
and then this synaptic endosome

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.330
is then cut apart by a clathrin

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.360
into individual synaptic vesicles,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.360
and here is a 3D view of that.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.380
And if we just focus on one of these buds,

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.230
when you just look at the
densities, you can see that,

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:43.670
in fact, there's a clathrin
geodesic dome or buckyball

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.220
forming around one of these vesicles.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.375
So that was great.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.790
We're able to see this new process

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.570
called ultrafast endocytosis.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.840
But it came under a lot of criticism,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.270
and I think it valid if you are trying

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.940
to make a major claim here.

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.570
One of our reviewers said that there are

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.230
40 years of experiments

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.070
that suggest that clathrin mediated

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.240
into cytosis is the mechanism
by which synaptic vesicles

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.720
are recycled, and there's
probably 10,000 papers,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.600
and now there's one paper that says

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.330
it's not the way it works.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.640
So the major thing people were focusing on

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.370
is that we were seeing four
synaptic vesicle equivalents

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.840
being endocytosed and so why,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.120
and the dogma is that there's
only one vesicle fusing.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.810
There are people who think
that that's not true,

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.030
that there are multivesticular
release, but nevertheless,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.890
that's how people imagine
the synapse works.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.220
And they all hinged on the
fact that we were using

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.200
channelrhodopsin instead
of electrical stimulation,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.040
which is what everybody else uses.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.330
I actually have to thank my critics

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.570
because they were relentless,
but they're well-meaning

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.290
because all of these criticisms were told

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.130
to my face at meetings and they said,

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.430
you've got it, figure this out.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.010
And so the ideas were that
there's an excess depolarization

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.200
by channelrhodopsin, that's possible.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.960
There's increased membrane
fluidity by channelrhodopsin,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.780
eh, but also possible,

00:34:12.852 --> 00:34:15.710
and that there was calcium
influx by channelrhodopsin

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.680
as well and that was leading
to these greater responses

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.220
and this unusual form of endocytosis.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.260
So the solution is obvious,

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.530
come up with a way to stimulate
these samples electrically,

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.470
and we call this zap and freeze.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.550
I have to give credit to
my senior research fellow

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.440
who came up with this, Wayne Davis.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.140
He said, this is what you're
middle plate looks like

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.230
in the center of that
high-front pressure chamber.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.990
And the sample is held right
here, and so the light comes in

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.270
and stimulates that sample
and causes the neurons

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:48.830
to fire action potentials.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.670
So he said, why don't you
just move the sample holder,

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.980
the sample cup, to this lateral position,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.500
add stimulating leads, add capacitors

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.780
that will carry a charge, and then add

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.030
a light-activated switch so
that when you now take this,

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.100
insert it into the high-pressure chamber,

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.210
the light will stimulate that switch

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:15.720
and then cause a
depolarization of the cells

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.830
in your sample and
cause action potentials.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.240
And so this is what we did,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.100
this is what this thing looks like.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.800
It is a independent little circuit board

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.930
that fits deep into the
high-pressure chamber.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.690
You can see the capacitors here,

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.780
and here is where our specimens go,

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.680
and then the leads are on either side.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.990
And so these are the images,

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.520
the first images that
came from this device.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.710
Here is an unstimulated sample,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.710
and then here is a stimulated sample.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.440
This is one action potential
at 1.2 millimoles of calcium,

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.710
so this is physiological, and you can see

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.540
that there are three
vesicles that have fused

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.660
with the membrane and are collapsing

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.430
into the plasma membrane.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.830
So this is frozen after a single stimulus

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.980
and frozen 11 milliseconds
after the pulse.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.300
So what about ultrafast endocytosis?

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.880
So now what we've done
is we stimulate once,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.600
it's a one-millisecond pulse,

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.490
and then we freeze 100 milliseconds later.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:14.230
And now, again, here's the active zone.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.860
Postsynaptic densities marked here.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.350
And here is an invagination,
here is an invagination,

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.850
here is an invagination, and
here is another invagination.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.680
At the lateral edge of the active zone,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.390
once again showing that
ultrafast endocytosis takes place

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.520
even with electrical stimulation.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.540
So here's quantitation of that.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.160
Here's an unstimulated
sample and here's a sample

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.940
stimulated 100 milliseconds earlier,

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.252
and we see the presence of these

00:36:43.252 --> 00:36:46.160
endocytic pits and endocytic vesicles.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.080
So it looks like ultrafast
endocytosis takes place

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.540
along with, well,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.455
we'll see when a clathrin-mediated

00:36:54.455 --> 00:36:58.500
endocytosis occurs, but we
see these very fast responses

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.800
that disagree with what
people have been seeing

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.180
in hippocampal neurons.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.010
So the issue is why do our
results differ from those

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:09.460
who have been imaging
hippocampal neurons in the past?

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.940
And I think we know the answer now,

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.660
and the answer is temperature.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.090
So we did all of our experiments
at either 34 degrees,

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.950
because that's where
electrophysiologists like to record,

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.560
or 37 degrees, which is
physiological for the mouse.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.580
And when we do that, we see these large

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.150
endocytic vesicles forming and
we see ultrafast endocytosis.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.140
When Shigeki did his
experiments at 22 degrees,

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.640
you now see that clathrin-mediated
endocytosis takes over,

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.560
so you can see a clathrin coat there.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.330
Here's an enlargement of
that beautiful clathrin coat.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.100
So what we think is going
on is at 34 degrees,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.090
we see normal, we see
ultrafast endocytosis.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.020
And then at 22 degrees, we
see clathrin-coated pits

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.120
and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.630
So in conclusion, we think that normally

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.210
we have ultrafast
endocytosis, removing membrane

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.710
from the surface after action potentials.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.270
And then, in the absence
of ultrafast endocytosis,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.240
there's an emergency backup system,

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.550
which is clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.640
And with that, I would just like to thank

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.223
the people who did the work.

00:38:18.223 --> 00:38:20.290
All of the electron microscopy was done

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.500
by Shigeki Watanabe, who has his own lab

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.020
now at Johns Hopkins.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.630
Instrumentation was from Wayne Davis.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.750
I'd really like to thank
the people at Leica,

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.400
particularly Cveta Tomova.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.050
They provided us with every
one of their instruments

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.450
every summer at MBL, and they would say

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.750
do whatever you want to it, we just need

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.150
to take a picture of it
at the end of the summer.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:44.040
And so I have no financial
interest in Leica.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.440
We turned over all
intellectual property to Leica,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.430
and so these things are
now available commercially,

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.263
and you can use them.

00:38:50.263 --> 00:38:53.730
And then finally, my host in
Berlin, Christian Rosenmund.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.256
Thank you for listening.

00:38:55.256 --> 00:38:58.670
(audience applauding)

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:03.130
- All right, so the question
that we are studying in my lab

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.510
is how does something
as complex as the brain

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.000
form in the course of
embryonic development?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.880
How do the first circuits develop,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.540
how do they become functionally active,

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.910
how do they perform the first computations

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.740
and instruct the first behaviors?

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.230
And so because all of these aspects

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.900
are highly dynamic aspects,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.700
we spent quite a large
fraction of our time, actually,

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.890
also developing technology that allows us

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.870
to visualize and also measure,

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.760
at the cellular level and
at even smaller scales,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.130
what's happening during the development

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.170
and the emergence of function
in the nervous system.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.120
And so I'd just like to
start with two examples

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.030
of microscopes and imaging assays

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.440
we've developed for this purpose.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.360
What you can see here is
a live imaging experiment

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.560
with a nuclei labeled to sample an embryo

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.210
going through embryo genesis,

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:58.430
and we can basically follow
all of the different cells

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.810
as they move and divide and specifically

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.750
reconstruct the formation
of the early nervous system.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.787
So the structure is the equivalent

00:40:05.787 --> 00:40:09.620
of the vertebrae spinal
cord has been formed here.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.140
So we have this lineage reconstruction

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.490
and the morphodynamic building plan

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.930
of the early nervous system.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.020
Now complementing this
(mumbles) perspective,

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.200
we also like to capture what's happening

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.200
in the individual neuron response

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.440
to neuro system's really up and running,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.000
so we need tools that are even faster,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.180
now imaging at 100 times higher speed

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.260
and even larger volumes.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.180
This is the brain of the larval zebrafish

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.630
where we have about 100,000 neurons,

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.230
and using calcium
indicators, we can follow

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.750
the activity during
different types of behaviors.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.100
And so from these whole brain
functional imaging recordings,

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:49.264
we can then figure out what
kind of circuits are involved

00:40:49.264 --> 00:40:52.000
in certain types of behaviors
and what kind of networks

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.180
across the brain are
communicating with each other

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.080
and are jointly involved in
certain types of computations.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.350
And so I chose these two examples, also,

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.950
because in both of these cases,
these imaging experiments

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.950
mark the first time that an
analysis like this was possible.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.280
This was the first time that
we could actually track cells

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.590
systematically across
a higher invertebrate

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.660
and the first time that we
could image neural activity

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.460
at the cellular level
across a vertebrate brain.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.240
And what's made it possible
to do these types of,

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.840
you know, to record
these types of data sets,

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.046
to do these types of analysis,

00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:25.790
is the concept of light-sheet microscopy.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.470
So I'd just like to
remind you very briefly

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.720
what the key concept is
behind this technique.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720
It's actually a very old technique,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.070
it's been around for more than 100 years,

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.100
makes it twice as old
as confocal microscopy.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.130
And to the present day,
the fundamental concept

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.480
has basically remained the same.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.750
What we're doing is we're
illuminating a sample

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.480
with a thin sheet of
light, of laser light,

00:41:48.368 --> 00:41:50.300
that is entering the sample
chamber from the side,

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.960
so we're selectively illuminating
a thin volume section

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.220
in the sample and then the
fluorescence that is emitted

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.850
by this thin section is imaged
with a conventional light

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.840
for detections of system
oriented at a right angle

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.220
to this incident light sheet,

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.160
so we have this detection objective

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.820
and then a camera for the (mumbles) arm.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.020
It takes a snapshot of that
plane, of that thin section,

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.560
and so that makes this
technique a very fast

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.880
imaging technique
because with one snapshot

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.870
we can capture millions of
volume elements across this plane

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.580
and we can rapid 3D imaging by just moving

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.450
the light sheet through
the sample step by step,

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.650
just recording the image sequence.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.130
And so then we're basically just limited

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.540
by the speed of the detector.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.733
The camera can get giga
(mumbles) per second

00:42:30.733 --> 00:42:32.950
with modern CMOS cameras.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.600
But it's also a very gentle technique.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.860
And so it's gentle because
we are only sending light

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.730
exactly to the part of the
sample that we're taking

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.050
the image off of in any point in time.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.570
We're not sending light
to out-of-focus regions,

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.840
we're not breaching or
damaging parts out of focus.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.000
And so this combination is
really important for our work.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.990
And so now I'd like to be
a little more quantitative

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:53.490
about the imaging
experiments I just showed you

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.170
on the first two slides, and
as a reference, you know,

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:00.530
just embed this, basically
embed these experiments

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.160
in the parameter space that
we would care about a lot.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.620
In most of these live-imaging experiments,

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.880
we are looking at the size
of the sample we can image,

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.290
the duration for which we can image it,

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.700
and the spatial and temporal
resolution we can achieve.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.958
And so as a reference
point, now just connecting

00:43:12.958 --> 00:43:16.070
to Daniel's talk again, I think
Daniel made this nice point

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.700
that if you use a
state-of-the-art spinning disk

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.770
confocal microscope, a very
powerful, fast imaging device,

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:26.847
you can still kind of do this
experiment of tracking cells

00:43:26.847 --> 00:43:28.630
in a C. elegans embryo, but only up

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.590
to a certain point of time.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.650
If you go too far into
development, and the embryo

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.089
moves so quickly that you
can't follow the cells anymore.

00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:37.200
This is kind of like at the
limit of the performance

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.440
of the system, and so that
puts us somewhere here

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.670
in this parameter space.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.630
And so I'm sure you've heard of the work

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.510
of my colleague Eric Betzig at Janelia,

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.140
who's also using light-sheet microscopy

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.770
to push spatial resolution
in these experiments.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.490
So he's able to get these
really dramatic improvements

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.040
in spatial resolution of
more than a factor of 10,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.750
same model system, and so
using these really, really thin

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.340
light sheets, either using vessel beams

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.870
or latter-slide sheet techniques.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.090
So for us to challenge
has been a different one.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.810
We wanted to stay at
the single cell level,

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:13.090
but scale this up to a much,
much larger model system.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.840
So for the Drosophila we're
imaging at 1,000 times

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.180
larger volume, we still
want to follow cells

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.280
at the same speed, at
the same volume rate.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.460
And then if you put it
into the functional realm,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.840
we need to image not only at
1,000 times larger volume,

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.660
but also image that volume
at a 100 faster volume rate.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.700
So this is where light-sheet microscopy

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.700
has been really helpful to us.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.800
But if you look at these different
data points in this plot,

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.170
there's one thing that's
really unsatisfying about it,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.620
and that's they're seemingly,
the implication here

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.090
is that there's seemingly this trade off.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.570
You can either image a fairly small sample

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.830
at very high resolution
or a fairly large volume

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:54.340
sort of at a cellular level very quickly,

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.090
but you can't do both at the same time.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.110
And so I think what we
really want is a technique

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:01.216
that allows us to image
a fairly less volume,

00:45:01.216 --> 00:45:04.680
like the brain of a larval zebrafish,

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.180
over long periods of time

00:45:07.502 --> 00:45:11.150
over developmental time
scales, doing during behaviors,

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.650
both at high spatial and
high temporal resolution.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.474
And so I'd like to show you, first,

00:45:17.474 --> 00:45:19.070
it's amazing how we can get to this part

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:20.260
in the parameter space.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.090
And so the goal here is really

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.510
to find a way to add
this fourth parameter,

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.850
and three of the four parameters
we're kind of happy with,

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.210
we have the large volume,
we have the high speed,

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.780
but what is missing is
the spatial resolution,

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.650
so how can we add spatial
resolution to this mix

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:39.760
without trading off,
sacrificing any other parameter?

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.800
Let's look at the challenge first.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.490
What's the problem we need to solve?

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.670
The reason why spatial
resolution is not as high

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.500
as we would want it to
be in these experiments

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.850
is that we suffer, in
many light microscopes,

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.680
in fact, from anisotropic
spatial resolution.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.590
So the problem here is that
we are not really collecting

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.400
all of the light that
is provided by object.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.270
So we have a limited numerical aperture,

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.010
we're only collecting light on a certain

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.080
small angular range and so this anisotropy

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.780
in sampling information
results in an anisotropy

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.080
in the way in which we form the image

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.020
and represent the samples.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.430
We have, typically, much
lower axial resolution

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.020
than lateral resolution, as
Daniel pointed out earlier.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.520
Ideally what we would want
to have is axial resolution

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.890
be as good as lateral resolution,

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.260
so that would be a big step forward.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.180
I mean, light-sheet microscopy
often has a factor of 10

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.060
that we're talking about,
and then on top of that,

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.360
it would be biologically
much more meaningful

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.500
because we're treating all of
the dimensions the same way,

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.900
which makes much more sense.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:44.400
What we need to find now is
a way to solve this problem

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.350
without compromising any of the
other aspects of performance

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.920
because for all experiments,
it's really important

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.300
that we can maintain the
high temporal resolutions,

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.100
we can still stay in the
realm of calcium imaging,

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.910
maybe even push us forward
to (mumbles) imaging

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:56.743
in the future.

00:46:56.743 --> 00:46:58.600
We really don't want to touch speed

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.960
and still get imaging at
the whole brain level.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:07.930
So the way we can do this is
we combine light-sheet imaging

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.810
with another fairly old concept,

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.810
and that's the concept of multi-imaging.

00:47:13.825 --> 00:47:18.360
What we do in this approach
is that, counterintuitively,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.630
the first step is that we don't solve

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.320
this problem of anisotropic resolution.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.620
We simply accept the fact
that if we, let's say,

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.453
have a point-like object,

00:47:26.453 --> 00:47:27.560
the image that we get is ellipsoid,

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.030
so like this distorted representation.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.100
So we have low resolution
along the axial component,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.750
high resolution laterally.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.950
But then in the next step, what we do

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.960
is we rotate the sample 90 degrees

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.850
relative to the microscope,

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.580
and so we caught a second
view of the same scene.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.410
And so now we have permuted the dimensions

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.260
along which resolution's
high and low respectively,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.580
and taken together
across these two images,

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.290
we have actually almost all
of the frequency content

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.370
that we're interested in of our sample,

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.520
and we basically just have
to register these two views

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.240
and combine them, for
example, with a process

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.540
called multi-view deconvolution
and then we have this

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.240
near-isotropic spatial resolution.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.550
So that would be a powerful way

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.540
to improve spatial resolution
because we can just keep

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.520
our microscope and the
way in which we build

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.110
our light sheets the way it is.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.840
Basically the main challenge
that we have to solve now

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.940
is to find a way to record
these multiple views

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.120
at the same time, then we haven't

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.580
sacrificed a poor resolution.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.010
And so Raghav Chhetri,
a postdoc in my lab,

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:26.190
addressed this problem,

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.190
and built a microscope that can do that.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.330
And so here's the idea.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:32.060
It's a little bit, the arrangement's

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:33.710
a little bit more complex
and it's basally the idea

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.740
as I described, so we
don't only have two views

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.000
of the sample, we actually
have four opposing objectives.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.330
So it gives us four following views,

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.220
which simply means that
we can scale this idea up

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.400
to larger specimens that are
not entirely transparent.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.320
So for Drosophila and zebrafish
it's actually very helpful,

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.630
also for mouse, mouse
embryos that we are studying.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.740
But now the problem is, if
you sent in four light sheets

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.960
at the same time from
all these four objectives

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.010
and then take four images,
light for the images

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:00.300
for these objectives,

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.210
we've violated a fundamental concept

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.430
of the optical sectioning concept

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.510
in light-sheet microscopy.

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.350
So we've actually sent in, light in a way

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.990
that we now illuminate
out-of-focus structures

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:14.720
with respect to the
respective other light sheets.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.230
So we get out a focus
slide, we basically degrade

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.230
the image quality

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.940
by doing this at the same time.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:25.220
So the way we can solve this
is that we don't actually

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.980
use light sheets in our
light-sheet microscopes.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.971
What we do is we send in a
very, very thin pencil beam,

00:49:31.971 --> 00:49:33.810
and so then if you take this pencil beam

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:36.430
and you scan it up and down very quickly

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.650
across your plane of
interest and just keep

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.990
the camera shutter open,
you get the equivalent

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.590
of a light sheet, that's
like a scanned light sheet.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.330
If you use this concept now
and implement it in a way

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.810
that the beams that come in
from these different views

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.870
are slightly offset in
space, so we keep them maybe

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.890
a couple of tenths of microns apart,

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.080
and then we scan them across
their respective planes

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.450
at a constant pace so they maintain

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.810
that same constant distance,
so they never cross

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.080
their paths in real space,

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.380
then all we need to do is match this up

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.380
with a set of confocal line
detectors that really only

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.910
detect the light that comes
from that beam and blocks out

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.060
the light that comes
from the (mumbles) beam,

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.270
they're slightly offset in space,

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.370
it's just hitting the
detector at the wrong spot,

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.010
not at the rolling shutters
at that point in time.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.530
We have the same trace offset in our

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:27.830
confocal line detectors,
everything is matched up

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.980
and synchronized, and now
we can scan four views

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.450
at the same time without
any signal crosstalk.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.418
So that's the key idea in
what we call the isotropic

00:50:36.418 --> 00:50:38.640
multi-view light-sheet
microscope, the ISU microscope.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.290
And so here's the data we
can get with this approach.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.720
Again, the low anisotropic resolution

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.190
in the contributing views,
but if you combine these views

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.660
into one single image,
cause it's a multi-view

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.540
deconvolved image, we now
have isotropic resolution,

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.660
you can turn this in any way, and

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.280
you don't have any perceived difference

00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.180
in spatial resolution.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.990
This is a GCaMP expressing
Drosophila larva

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.680
in a GCaMP (mumbles) system.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.950
So let me just zoom in onto
this cluster of neurons

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.940
so you can actually see the
impact on spatial resolution.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.140
So now with contributing views,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.190
we have one dimension
along which it's very hard

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:16.960
to distinguish these individual neurons.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.450
They're just blurring into each other.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.240
In the other set of views
is a different dimension

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:22.830
but the same problem but then

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.110
combining all this information
into the S view construction,

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:29.400
we now have high resolution for
any view along the XYZ axes.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.530
And so we've basically
restored cellular resolution,

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.190
even in these deeper regions
of the nervous system.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.090
Normally, we find about four
nanometer spatial resolution.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.980
And so because we haven't
sacrificed temporal resolution,

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.426
we can now do these types of
functional imaging experiments.

00:51:45.426 --> 00:51:48.000
For example, imaging at
the whole animal level,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.730
the entire Drosophila
larvae expressed in GCaMP

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.500
during motor behaviors,
we can see forward,

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.880
backward crawling and then
sort of concurrent calcium

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.650
activity that is
orchestrating this behavior

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.660
in the ventral nerve course
areas, you see these waves

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.775
in the B and C,

00:52:02.775 --> 00:52:06.850
and sort of a similar
context in the zebrafish,

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.430
so we have a larval zebrafish here

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:10.610
that executing different
types of swimming behaviors,

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:12.180
and you can see this
activity in the hind brain

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.555
and the spinal cord
during these behaviors.

00:52:14.555 --> 00:52:17.230
This image is at two hertz
and this is at one hertz,

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:18.870
and it's just rotating the
fish, but as you can see,

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:23.400
there is no change in resolution
as we rotate the volume.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.300
So I think live imaging
is where it really unfolds

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.450
its full potential,
but you can, of course,

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:28.960
also use it for structural
imaging experiments

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.910
with fixed samples.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.570
So the main gain is that you
gain isotropic resolution,

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.690
you can image it very quickly,
so this is now an expanded

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:39.854
Drosophila brain combined
with expansion microscopy,

00:52:39.854 --> 00:52:43.530
so that makes it, actually,
about two millimeters long

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.710
along each side, and so
within about 15 minutes

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.510
we get then 100 nanometer
isotropic spatial resolution

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.610
across the brain.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.330
Then sort of like a sparse
pattern of fruitless neurons

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.240
that are labeled here,
and so if you zoom in,

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.320
you can see the fine structural details

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:00.051
which can aid (mumbles) types analysis

00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.630
in relatively high throughput

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.180
with these imaging experiments.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.210
So let me just summarize this.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:08.540
We have basically an
improvement of about tenfold

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.580
in resolution without sacrificing
speed and field of view.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.960
And in more absolute quantitative terms,

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:16.860
that means 49 meter spatial
resolution, system resolution

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.980
at sub-second time scales for the volume

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.900
of about 800 micron cubed.

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.220
And so I just showed
you very short sequences

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.610
from, actually, longer
imaging experiments.

00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:27.370
We've imaged these
examples for hours to days

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.260
in each of these cases, so you can use it

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.900
under physiological conditions
in this parameter space.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.970
But one thing I'd like
to point out is that,

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.800
intentionally I said
system resolution here,

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.450
so which means this is
the performance we expect

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.870
on ideal imaging conditions if you have

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.730
a fairly transparent sample.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.640
And unfortunately, most of
the samples we are looking at

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.360
are far from transparent,
and we're in this realm

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:53.290
of imaging relatively large
specimens for life imaging,

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:56.890
Drosophila, larval zebrafish brain,

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:58.750
they actually perturb the light

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.100
that we need to use to rely
on to do the measurement

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.890
in the first place, and
so this is a problem

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.930
we need to solve because
the way it impacts

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:07.410
our light-sheet microscope is that,

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.330
because of the heterogeneity,
the optic heterogeneity

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.250
of the samples is like this
toy model of a cross section

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.240
of a, let's say the Drosophila larva,

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.120
as the light sheets enter the sample,

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.830
they are deviated from their light path

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:22.420
to change their course,

00:54:23.998 --> 00:54:25.840
so this can change further inside a sample

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.400
depending on the optical properties,

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.670
can change over time as
optical properties change,

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.780
as the sample develops,
and the same thing happens

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.700
in the detection process.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.020
We have some increasing
curvature of the focal planes,

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.488
they're not really clean planes anymore,

00:54:36.488 --> 00:54:38.480
they get bent as a function

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.970
of the spatial location
and as function of time.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:44.770
And so bottom line is
that we lose this nice

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:47.141
coplanarity that we rely on
in the light-sheet microscope,

00:54:47.141 --> 00:54:48.570
but if the light sheet should be coplane

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.660
over the focal plane to
get an in-focus image,

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.870
that's not really the case anymore,

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:56.730
so we basically image out of
focus and we get low resolution

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.780
and low image contrast.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.130
And so Loic Royer, another
postdoc in the lab,

00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.560
addressed this problem
in the following way.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.830
Basically developed, first of all,

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.430
so there are two components
to this solution.

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:11.860
First of all, we need a
microscope that has access

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.230
to the degrees of freedom that he needed

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.600
to bend things back into shape.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.880
We need to be able to rotate
and translate the light sheets

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.210
and the focal planes so we
can actually fix the problem

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:22.080
if you know what the
problem is geometrically.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.260
And so the second part is
that we need to measure,

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.150
take the right measurements.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.030
We have (mumbles)
deployed on the microscope

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.270
that allow us to estimate image quality

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:33.760
as a function of changes
in these degrees of freedom

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.190
and basically build a model of
the sample in the background

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.570
of the live imaging experiment
to constantly improve

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.780
in space and time the spatial relationship

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.020
between focal planes and light sheets.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.450
And so with this combined sort
of adaptive imaging approach,

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:49.960
we can now hand the experiment
over to this real-time

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.720
control layer and
basically have it optimize

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.760
the image quality, and so for example

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.340
in a zebrafish embryo that
has the following effect,

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.880
if you look at different regions here,

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.330
try to track the cells as
they form the nervous system,

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:07.050
we can't really without
the adaptive imaging

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.601
follow cells in many parts
of the sample anymore

00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:11.150
over time because the
image quality degrades.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.830
And with the adaptive imaging approach,

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.410
we can recover that high resolution.

00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:18.120
We can also use it in a
functional imaging context.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.780
So this is now a zebrafish larval brain.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.620
Again, I'm showing you the
quality with the adaptive

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.150
imaging engaged and
with all this framework.

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.970
And after some time of imaging,
you can see how quality

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.820
really degrades because
if the brain is growing,

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.770
the fish is actually
growing, and we're changing

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:37.250
the optical context and losing the ability

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:40.260
to really accurately measure activity

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.610
at the single neuron level.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.920
And with that, I'm at the end.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.510
Just like to give you a quick outlook.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.160
We are now integrating these imaging tools

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.515
with optical emulation tools.

00:56:50.515 --> 00:56:52.090
We don't only want to
watch what's happening,

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.010
we want to control what's
happening, manipulate it.

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.130
And so particularly with
a layered, it allows us

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:58.140
to classify behavior in real time

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.950
so that we can interact with
behavior at different stages,

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:04.130
at different phases, and for
example, control the state

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.500
that the (mumbles) is
in, control, for example,

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.540
motor behavior from
forward-walking to backward-walking

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.880
and so on, and so that's
the next stage now

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.870
for this technology for us.

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.440
And so with that, I'm
at the end of the talk.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:18.270
And just like to acknowledge very briefly

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.630
Raghav Chhetri who built
the IsoView microscope,

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:22.980
Loic Roya who developed this
adaptive imaging framework,

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.800
built it, a lot of the imagings from

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.290
(mumbles) of these imaging experiments.

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:29.070
And then we have a lot of
fantastic collaborators

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.250
at Janelia that contributed
a lot to the work

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.390
that I showed you here, Misha
Ahrens and Kristin Branson

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:36.600
in particular, to whom I'm very grateful.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.433
All right, thank you.

00:57:37.433 --> 00:57:39.747
(audience applauding)

00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:42.330
(upbeat music)
