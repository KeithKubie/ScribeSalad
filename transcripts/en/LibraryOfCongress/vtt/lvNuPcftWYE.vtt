00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:56.192
Hayden, particularly her proud 
mother, Mrs.

00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:03.868
 Colleen Hayden who has lots of 
reasons to be proud of her 

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:09.788
daughter today.  In over 200 
years ago, when the Library of 

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.643
Congress was created, our 
founders really charged the 

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:16.392
joint committee of the library 
and the librarian of Congress to

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:23.259
 collect and curate a diverse 
exilation lit ray warks for the 

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.195
education and use of members of 
Congress.  Even then they knew 

00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:28.758
that members of Congress didn't 
know nearly all they

00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:34.808
 needed to

00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.871
 know.  When you really take any
 time at all to look through the

00:08:42.513 --> 00:08:44.724
 Library of Congress's vast 
collections or visit any of the 

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.774
library reading rooms, you get a
 sense of the importance that 

00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:52.936
our founders and those who 
followed and placed on that 

00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:56.917
meeting that original mandate, 
ensuring that our shared 

00:08:56.918 --> 00:09:02.047
cultural experience is preserved
 and made available to future 

00:09:02.048 --> 00:09:04.869
generations through this 
magnificent institution.  

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.583
Anybody who has been here almost
 always leaves saying this is 

00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:11.807
the unheralded jewel of the 
Library of Congress, so 

00:09:12.764 --> 00:09:17.633
well-managed for so many years 
by Mr. Billington who's here 

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:22.084
today.  The library's first 
collection was largely destroyed

00:09:22.085 --> 00:09:28.269
 during the war of 1812 was 
replaced by purchasing tomentz 

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.114
Jefferson's only personal 
library.  From that relatively 

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:34.359
small but big for the time 
personal library, we've gone to 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.199
where it is now the world's 
largest collection of books, 

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:43.230
films, of sheet music, of sound 
regardings.  This couldn't have 

00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:48.064
been accomplished without the 
guidance of the nation's chief 

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:50.276
librarians.  The first joint 
committee on the

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:55.435
 Library of Congress was ms the 
first joint committee of 

00:09:55.436 --> 00:09:58.591
Congress and only 13 times 
previous today have they been 

00:09:58.592 --> 00:10:02.538
able to witness the swearing in 
of the librarian of Congress.  

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:06.883
Each of those individuals 
brought a unique perspective to 

00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:10.987
this position and took steps to 
expand the library's collections

00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:14.595
 and how people all over the 
world and people in our country 

00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:19.186
would share that collection.  
The 13 previous librarians have 

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.386
included a

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:31.464
 poet, a political scientist, a 
historian, two clerks of the 

00:10:31.596 --> 00:10:33.975
house, two lawyers and two 
individuals who actually had 

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:40.748
library experience.  In fact, 
athe longest serving librarian 

00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:43.885
of Congress who became the 
librarian at the turn of the 

00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:48.620
century and led the library 
through World War I, the great 

00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:53.042
depression right up until the 
eve of World War II had served 

00:10:53.369 --> 00:10:57.065
longer than anybody else had bin
 a life-long library 

00:10:57.264 --> 00:11:02.003
administration.  I have no doubt
 that our 14th liib rain, Dr. 

00:11:02.134 --> 00:11:06.393
Carla Hayden with her experience
 in library management, will 

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:09.585
further the work of her 
predecessors and leave an 

00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:13.144
important mark of her own on the
 Library of Congress and the 

00:11:13.347 --> 00:11:15.722
unique opportunity and challenge
 the library faces at a time 

00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:17.931
where there is more 

00:11:20.808 --> 00:11:28.119
information, more accessible in 
more ways than any of her 

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.864
predecessors would think 
possible.  It's an honor for all

00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:33.583
 of us to be here

00:11:46.732 --> 00:11:47.181
with you today.  
[ Applause ] 

00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:51.691
&gt;&gt; Librarian was really an 
adventure to me to find out 

00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:53.980
there was a profession that was 

00:11:57.562 --> 00:12:00.360
dedicated to making books and 
knowledge available to people 

00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:07.641
and that just seemed ideal.  The
 conservation process really an 

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:12.277
eye-opener for me because I got 
to meet legislators that were 

00:12:12.863 --> 00:12:16.109
committed to not only the 
nation's history, but making 

00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:21.594
information available and that 
ways just a wonderful thing that

00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:29.668
 made me very pleased that I was
 confirmed.  And my vision for 

00:12:29.973 --> 00:12:33.370
this library -- realize that 
they have a national treasure 

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:37.772
and that it is part of their 
heritage and everyone can find 

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:41.829
something in the Library of 
Congress, produced by the 

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:46.470
Library of Congress, that 
relates to their lives what I 

00:12:46.813 --> 00:12:52.168
hope to accomplish with the 
dedicated staff of the library 

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:58.226
in the next 10 years of the 
appointment is to really make 

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:03.981
more of the collection 
accessible.  And if we can say 

00:13:05.282 --> 00:13:14.198
that we have collections in the 
next 10 years that have never 

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:16.699
been -- around the country and

00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:22.979
 that people are going

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:44.989

welcome the speaker of the 
United States house of 

00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:59.082
representatives, the

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.301
 honorable Paul Ryan.  
[ Applause ] 

00:14:06.302 --> 00:14:10.750
&gt;&gt; In 1815, as senator blunt 
just mentioned, tomz Jefferson 

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.495
sold most of his library to 
Congress.  Partly because he was

00:14:14.774 --> 00:14:18.471
 a patriot, but mostly because 
he was broke.  The British had 

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:21.836
burned the original Library of 
Congress when they invaded 

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.152
Washington the year before, and 
though a later fire destroyed 

00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:28.628
most of Jefferson's books, we 
still have some of them.  They 

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.675
make up the heart of the library
 that we have here today.  

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:35.998
Jefferson as you know was a 
very, very unique man.  Other 

00:14:36.627 --> 00:14:40.153
people arranged their books 
alphabetically or by size.  He 

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:46.905
divided his library into three 
sections that corresponded with 

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:51.852
the three main faculties of the 
mind:  Memory, reason and 

00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:55.832
imagination.  And when you stop 
to think about it, those are the

00:14:56.047 --> 00:15:03.183
 very same qualities that define
 Dr. Hayden.  First, as a 

00:15:03.387 --> 00:15:05.998
librarian herself, she has the 
institutional memory necessary 

00:15:06.241 --> 00:15:09.671
to run the largest library in 
the world.  That's a long way of

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.657
 saying she's a pro.  She knows 
what she's 

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.951
doing.  Second, she understands 
the need to bring the library 

00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:25.853
into the digital age.  We have 
millions of documents that 

00:15:25.854 --> 00:15:28.210
almost knows a thing about.  It 
would be a shame if they were 

00:15:28.211 --> 00:15:30.211
lost to the world out

00:15:33.191 --> 00:15:36.140
 of mere inconvenience.
It's that third quality.  

00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:39.119
Imagination.  That's what I 
think is so important.  We all 

00:15:39.554 --> 00:15:44.854
think of America as this great 
land of program  promise.  Where

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.836
 people from all works of life 
can get their start.  The public

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:53.745
 library itself is the icon of 
opportunity.  It's a safe haven 

00:15:53.947 --> 00:16:01.865
where people can go to learn and
 to feed their imagination.  I 

00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:06.226
think of the writer James 
Baldwin.  James Baldwin as a 

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:13.010
young man would go to the 
library and read his every book 

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:16.036
he could get his hands on.  
There he would be holding a 

00:16:16.337 --> 00:16:19.580
sibling in one arm and one book 
in another.  What would have 

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.710
happened to James Baldwin if 

00:16:24.781 --> 00:16:26.726
there had mind would have been 
starved of its essential 

00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:30.428
material.  Nobody knows this 
better than Dr. 

00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:35.267
Hayden.  She was widely praised 
for keeping open her library 

00:16:36.074 --> 00:16:38.723
during Baltimore's unrest last 
year, but for her it was the 

00:16:38.838 --> 00:16:43.648
only real choice, the obvious 
things to do.  She seems to come

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.588
 from really sturdy stock.  One 
day when she told her mom she 

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:50.695
was heading to the library right
 in the middle of all the chaos,

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:57.143
 all this trouble, her mother 
replied oh, make sure you have 

00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:01.593
some coffee.  Our next librarian
 is an accomplished woman and I 

00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:04.664
have every confidence she is 
going to make us all very, very 

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.099
proud.  Jefferson once said, I 
cannot live without books.  

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.662
Neither can we.  The Library of 
Congress is our national 

00:17:13.874 --> 00:17:20.479
treasure, and with Dr. Hayden at
 the helm, I know it is in 

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:22.681
excellent 

00:17:32.821 --> 00:17:34.058
hands.

&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please 

00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:21.876
welcome the senior senator of 
Maryland, the honorable

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.824
 . 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Good morning, everybody.  

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:37.277
I'm delighted to be here to have
 the high honor, the privilege 

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:42.066
of introducing Dr. Hayden to 
you.  

00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:45.947
To make us proud, you all know 
her you're ready to cheer her on

00:20:46.137 --> 00:20:50.911
 and you can hear from her.  
Well, first of all, greetings to

00:20:51.112 --> 00:20:54.802
 all of you who have come from 
Baltimore and from around the 

00:20:55.168 --> 00:20:57.771
nation.  Other professional 
librarians and I want to 

00:20:57.972 --> 00:21:01.038
acknowledge that there are other
 members of the Maryland

00:21:05.503 --> 00:21:07.503
 delegation that are

00:21:13.431 --> 00:21:19.584
 here.  We have all three 
senators here.  

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:25.258
And of course Nancy Pelosi.  We 
know her heart is in little 

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:30.874
Italy in many ways.  And Nancy, 
I understand that after school 

00:21:31.097 --> 00:21:39.494
you used to go to the library 
right on the -- am I correct 

00:21:39.706 --> 00:21:41.706
yes. 

00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:45.811
 And so did

00:21:53.908 --> 00:21:57.350
 I.  Felt that access to 
acknowledge and education would 

00:21:57.351 --> 00:22:02.685
be the key to the success of our
 democracy.  

00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:08.363
That we would have public 
schools for education and 

00:22:08.552 --> 00:22:12.690
inspiration.  Public 
institutions, public schools in 

00:22:13.654 --> 00:22:15.893
public libraries.  It didn't 
matter what zip code you were 

00:22:16.426 --> 00:22:20.892
born in, what was the income of 
your family, you would have 

00:22:21.093 --> 00:22:24.797
access to a school, and you 
would have access to a library. 

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.601
Wow.  What a tremendous vision. 
And here in our own country, 

00:22:30.212 --> 00:22:34.809
when the founders came and were 
busy writing the constitution, 

00:22:35.017 --> 00:22:39.466
trying to decide what would be 
the Missouri compromise, et 

00:22:39.665 --> 00:22:44.904
cetera, and they -- I'm sure 
that the ladies who were also 

00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:49.167
encouraged to be included they 
would ferment their own 

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:52.441
resolution, encourage the 
library.  Senator blunt gave our

00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:58.134
 history so well, and 
Congressman and others have 

00:22:58.135 --> 00:23:01.538
spoken about Dr.
Hayden but know that the first 

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.414
Library of Congress was directly
 across from the old senate 

00:23:06.358 --> 00:23:11.306
chamber so that members of 
Congress literally would caulk 

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:15.209
-- could walk across the hall 
and use the library.  We knew 

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.669
that members of Congress didn't 
know everything.  Write that one

00:23:20.982 --> 00:23:25.600
 down.  Wouldn't know 
everything, but there would be 

00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:30.893
people who knew more, gave us 
new ideas to lead this country 

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.465
into its future and its destiny.
That's always been the spirit of

00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:42.583
 the library.  In all of 
American history, only 14 have 

00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:46.575
served.  
And first Dr. Hayden will be the

00:23:47.326 --> 00:23:51.056
 14th.  When I was called and 
said the president was thinking 

00:23:51.704 --> 00:23:53.777
about nominated Carla Hayden to 
be the next head of the Library 

00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:59.216
of Congress, what do you think? 
I said wow!  That's like 

00:24:01.308 --> 00:24:03.518
bringing Cal Ripkin back to the

00:24:11.635 --> 00:24:15.331
 Orioles!  You couldn't do 
better.  She has essentially 

00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:21.453
been peer reviewed by other 
librarians and received numerous

00:24:21.843 --> 00:24:25.535
 awards and in Baltimore she 
took over one of the 

00:24:25.536 --> 00:24:29.287
distinguished libraries and 
working with her able board of 

00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:33.397
directors she helped number one 
made it through creating 

00:24:33.398 --> 00:24:37.914
financial stability.  Making 
sure that we maintain not only 

00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:42.206
the big downtown library, but 
that we had branches open and 

00:24:42.207 --> 00:24:45.480
accessible in neighborhoods, 
where families and children and 

00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:52.112
senior citizens needed to do it.
  And along the way she also 

00:24:52.113 --> 00:24:57.098
brought it into the digital age 
and now has got the effort with 

00:24:57.099 --> 00:25:02.598
her board and committee to raise
 the money for the renovation.  

00:25:02.599 --> 00:25:06.327
She literally through working 
with others in a collaborative 

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:12.528
way, which I know she will be 
here, she literally brought the 

00:25:13.087 --> 00:25:19.504
Onod prat into the 21st century.
  She will do that here.  She's 

00:25:19.505 --> 00:25:23.915
an inspirational leader.  She 
also knows that the library here

00:25:24.328 --> 00:25:27.321
 for the people.  
Speaker Ryan talked about our 

00:25:27.712 --> 00:25:30.422
recent troubles and boy did we 
have them during the up rising. 

00:25:30.616 --> 00:25:36.947
But when the schools were 
closed, Dr. Hayden kept the 

00:25:37.252 --> 00:25:41.303
library open.  Right down to the
 neighborhood we called ground 

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:45.529
zero, one side of the street is 
the CVS that had been burned 

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:53.586
down.  Across the street was the
 ENOT Pratt library branch that 

00:25:53.938 --> 00:25:59.878
was opened.  The lights kept 
burning, open with light.  Ben 

00:26:00.117 --> 00:26:07.301
and I and others in the 
delegation used that library to 

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:11.640
have community meetings when the
 second of education came, where

00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:14.685
 could we have our meetings 
where people would feel 

00:26:14.686 --> 00:26:17.145
comfortable coming, it was at 
the library.  

00:26:17.146 --> 00:26:22.624
And when you walked in that 
library, during that time the 

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.288
intention, there were kids 
reading, there were people on 

00:26:26.536 --> 00:26:28.536
the computers trying to find

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:34.131
 a job and to try -- what a 
possibility could be.  She kept 

00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:37.450
it open.  A new innovation to 
the library.  It's called 

00:26:38.786 --> 00:26:44.719
lawyers and libraries.  We pass 
laws in Maryland criminal 

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:50.653
justice reform.  There is the 
possibility of getting your 

00:26:50.853 --> 00:26:55.590
criminal records streamlined and
 because of errors in the whole 

00:26:55.935 --> 00:27:04.540
process.  In the neighborhood 
where they -- which the one of 

00:27:05.036 --> 00:27:07.757
the hard scramble neighborhoods 
in Baltimore.  On a Saturday 

00:27:07.961 --> 00:27:12.911
morning when lawyers and 
libraries were introduced, 600 

00:27:13.121 --> 00:27:15.909
primarily men, all 
African-American men, stood in 

00:27:16.292 --> 00:27:21.986
line to meet with a pro bono 
lawyer or a paralegal to help 

00:27:22.197 --> 00:27:24.970
them work their record through 
so they could reenter -- not 

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:31.453
only reenter society, but get a 
job in the job market.  As they 

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:36.218
went through that process, 600. 
At the end, they met with the 

00:27:37.104 --> 00:27:41.005
librarian who said hi, would you
 like a library 

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:53.773
card.  I hear that day, that men
 who had been through a lot in 

00:27:53.774 --> 00:27:56.900
their life could not believe 
they were given a library card. 

00:27:57.286 --> 00:28:00.794
 Do you mean I can come here at 
any time?  Yeah here is the 

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.663
computers if you're going to be 
looking for a job.  This is what

00:28:03.902 --> 00:28:07.104
 the library means?  The answer 
was yes.  All of those 

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:09.505
innovations came from Dr. Carla 
Hayden.  And what does that mean

00:28:09.534 --> 00:28:12.465
 now to the Library of Congress?

00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:16.328
We don't do programs like that. 
You know what?  This library is 

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:22.107
now in the process of 
transforming itself.  Libraries 

00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:26.494
are redefining itself.  But what
 we know is we go back to the 

00:28:26.683 --> 00:28:30.397
founding principles of our 
country, public institutions 

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.280
made available to the public for
 their use to empower 

00:28:35.805 --> 00:28:38.064
themselves.
And I know that Dr. Hayden would

00:28:38.397 --> 00:28:42.034
 work very closely with the 
Congress with some of the 

00:28:42.749 --> 00:28:44.926
reforms that are necessary and 
some of the new transformational

00:28:45.868 --> 00:28:51.731
 ideas that she will bring.  I 
feel President Obama made a 

00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:56.717
great choice in Dr. Hayden and 
your mother Colleen, we want to 

00:28:57.037 --> 00:29:00.460
say hello to you, a teacher and 
educator in her own right.  I 

00:29:00.562 --> 00:29:05.510
want you to know that the gift 
from Baltimore, you've had a lot

00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:13.298
 of us, but the real gift will 
be that Dr. Hayden will really 

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:17.399
take this Library of Congress, 
which will be, I will assure 

00:29:17.737 --> 00:29:22.448
you, as over the next days and 
months become the Library of 

00:29:22.449 --> 00:29:26.790
Congress for the American 
people.  Thank you and I'm going

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.543
 to bring Dr. Hayden up so she

00:29:36.681 --> 00:29:38.681
 can tell 

00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:14.808
you.  
[ Applause ] 

00:30:14.809 --> 00:30:19.427
&gt;&gt; Thank you, senator Mikulsky 
for your very kind introduction.

00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:24.214
Your 39 years to the service of 
the state of Maryland and to the

00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:27.867
 United States Congress is a 
shining example of dedicated 

00:30:29.112 --> 00:30:31.961
public service.  I am also 
extremely grateful for your 

00:30:32.221 --> 00:30:37.837
personal friendship.  It's meant
 so much to me.  Mr. Speaker, 

00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:41.344
I'm honored by your remarks and 
your presence here today, your 

00:30:41.544 --> 00:30:43.727
commitment to the nation and 
public service and your respect 

00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:47.115
and admiration for this library 
are so appreciated by the staff 

00:30:49.726 --> 00:30:55.368
and especially by me.  Mr. 
Chiefjustice, there is no 

00:30:55.818 --> 00:30:58.563
greater distinction than to be 
sworn in by you as librarian of 

00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:01.717
Congress.  I want to thank you 
for your regard for this 

00:31:01.997 --> 00:31:04.961
institution and its role as a 
source of knowledge and 

00:31:06.285 --> 00:31:08.285
information for the country.  I

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:15.784
 would also like to acknowledge 
the joint committee on the 

00:31:15.989 --> 00:31:19.554
library.  The oldest continuing 
joint committee of the United 

00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:23.203
States Congress.  Your belief of
 the library's mission builds on

00:31:23.422 --> 00:31:26.252
 the partnership between 
Congress and this library.  

00:31:26.253 --> 00:31:30.508
Thank you so much for your 
continued support.

00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:37.279
Now, I must admit that it is 
hard for me to imagine the 

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.245
little eight-year-old girl with 
pigtails who checked out a book 

00:31:42.457 --> 00:31:49.213
called bright April, over and 
over and over again, until the 

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:53.587
fines came in.  That she is 
standing here today.  And it 

00:31:53.886 --> 00:31:59.534
feels like yesterday when I 
began my career at a storefront 

00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:04.808
branch of the Chicago public 
library and watched Judy Zucker 

00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:08.992
on the floor leading storytime 
for children with autism.  

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:11.710
Watching her interact with the 
children and in turn seeing 

00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:15.966
their reactions demonstrated the
 power and potential of a 

00:32:16.672 --> 00:32:22.113
librarian's work.  And 40 years 
later, it is an honor to be 

00:32:22.342 --> 00:32:25.100
nominated by President Obama and
 confirmed by the United States 

00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:28.344
senate to lead one of the 
greatest institutions of our 

00:32:28.562 --> 00:32:34.815
nation.  I am truly grateful and
 humbled by this selection.  Now

00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:39.228
 some people have noted that I 
am making history as the first 

00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:43.360
woman, and the first 
African-American in this post.  

00:32:57.068 --> 00:33:04.030
[Cheers and applause] and that 
is true.  Library pioneer Dewey 

00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:08.709
often encouraged women to enter 
the profession because they can,

00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:13.308
 quote, bear pain. 
[ Laughter ]

00:33:13.309 --> 00:33:15.309
And 

00:33:17.315 --> 00:33:19.315
could, quote, perform,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.560
 monotnous

00:33:32.534 --> 00:33:37.182
 tasks without boredem.
As a descent ebt for people who 

00:33:37.714 --> 00:33:40.347
were denied the right to read, 
to now have the opportunity to 

00:33:40.445 --> 00:33:44.587
serve and lead the institution 
that is the national symbol of 

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:46.839
knowledge is a

00:33:48.743 --> 00:33:50.743
 historic moment. 

00:34:05.663 --> 00:34:07.017
[ Applause ] 
So many people have been part of

00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:13.168
 my journey, family, friends and
 colleagues, many of them here 

00:34:13.617 --> 00:34:16.430
today.  Too numerous to mention 
by name, but I think all of you 

00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:20.676
for the life lessons you taught 
me, all of which have shaped my 

00:34:20.677 --> 00:34:27.689
experience.  I do want to thank 
my mother, who among many gifts 

00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:31.082
introduced me to reading, music 
and public service.  It is very,

00:34:31.455 --> 00:34:35.586
 very special that she is here 
today with me as I embark on a 

00:34:35.803 --> 00:34:38.337
new chapter that brings all of 

00:34:49.216 --> 00:34:50.571
those passions together.  
[ Applause ] 

00:34:50.572 --> 00:34:55.630
To have her join me on stage and
 hold the Bible that belonged to

00:34:55.992 --> 00:35:00.474
 Abraham Lincoln was a special 
moment for us.  My family is 

00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:04.506
from Illinois.  And many of my 
family members are buried in the

00:35:04.874 --> 00:35:10.931
 same cemetery as the 16th 
president.  I want to thank the 

00:35:11.105 --> 00:35:14.367
United States Congress for 
building and sustaining this 

00:35:14.677 --> 00:35:19.492
library.  I appreciate seeing so
 many of you here today from 

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:22.762
both houses and both parties.  
This library is your library and

00:35:22.932 --> 00:35:26.437
 its service to Congress remains
 the core function of the 

00:35:26.637 --> 00:35:30.526
institution.  The library is 
also one of the greatest gifts 

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.432
and legacies that Congress has 
given to the American people.  

00:35:34.659 --> 00:35:37.439
The vision of the national 
library to serve members of 

00:35:39.765 --> 00:35:43.553
Congress and the community they 
represent continues the legacy 

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.553
of my 13 predecessors.  
Over time, these leaders have 

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.733
expanded the scope of the 
materials collected, advocated 

00:35:52.647 --> 00:35:56.232
successfully to bring the 
federal copyright system here, 

00:35:56.634 --> 00:36:00.404
and one by one, overseeing 
construction of the facilities 

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:04.847
necessary to house and preserve 
the collection and services 

00:36:05.249 --> 00:36:09.918
offered.  For over two 
centuries, each librarian's 

00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:13.116
experiences and contributions 
reflected the country's social 

00:36:13.751 --> 00:36:17.204
and historical landscape, and 
all have advanced the progress 

00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:22.555
of the library.  The sixth 
librarian of Congress famously 

00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:26.193
called it the book palace of the
 American people.  When this 

00:36:28.035 --> 00:36:33.308
building opened in 1897.  The 
Library of Congress is so much 

00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:37.135
more than beautiful architecture
 wrapped around book shelves.  

00:36:37.136 --> 00:36:42.694
It is in fact a second part of 
the quote, less often used, that

00:36:42.899 --> 00:36:46.928
 is truly powerful.  He called 
it the book palace of the 

00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:52.422
American people in which you all
 have equal rights with me, in 

00:36:52.423 --> 00:36:59.602
which the works of all of you 
will be welcomed and forever 

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.810
preserved. 
The eighth librarian of Congress

00:37:01.811 --> 00:37:05.390
 described the library as a 
service outside of the limits of

00:37:06.296 --> 00:37:10.389
 Washington, and it is indeed a 
service to the country at large.

00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:15.435
And the 13th librarian of 
Congress believed whole 

00:37:16.648 --> 00:37:23.248
heartedly in this idea.  Dr. 
James billington often talked 

00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:27.710
about getting the champagne out 
of the bottle and he made

00:37:46.319 --> 00:37:47.067
 significant progress.  
[ Applause ] 

00:37:47.068 --> 00:37:53.421
I am touched that he is here 
today as librarian of Congress

00:37:57.485 --> 00:38:02.709
 emeritus with his wonderful 
wife.  I want to thank you for 

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:06.132
your graciousness, your service 
and the strong legacy that you 

00:38:06.337 --> 00:38:11.549
created.  I would also like to 
take a moment to acknowledge day

00:38:12.553 --> 00:38:14.553
 ofty librarian of

00:38:18.027 --> 00:38:20.027
 Congress David 
&gt;&gt; And the senior staff

00:38:23.613 --> 00:38:25.045
 of the library --

00:38:25.046 --> 00:38:28.653
Who are making my transition 
into this post well-informed and

00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:34.101
 as smooth as it could be.  The 
stewardship of this team on 

00:38:34.668 --> 00:38:38.424
behalf of the library is a 
shining example of the human 

00:38:38.982 --> 00:38:41.617
assets our nation is so well 
served by.  The staff of the 

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.210
Library of Congress believed in 
this institution and feels 

00:38:44.224 --> 00:38:49.587
honored to serve as I do.  Now 
today, through the power of 

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.667
technology, thousands around the
 country are able to watch this 

00:38:55.025 --> 00:38:58.564
ceremony live.  This is an 
opportunity to build on the 

00:38:58.786 --> 00:39:03.195
contributions of the libraries 
who have come before, to realize

00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:08.235
 a continuing national library 
vision that reaches beyond the 

00:39:08.769 --> 00:39:13.839
limits of Washington.  When I 
contemplate the potential of 

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.051
harnessing the power of 
technology with the unparalleled

00:39:16.963 --> 00:39:21.454
 resources at the Library of 
Congress, I am overwhelmed with 

00:39:21.817 --> 00:39:29.902
possibilities.  These resources 
include more than 162 million 

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.657
items on nearly 840 miles of 
book shelves.  If you stretch 

00:39:34.658 --> 00:39:39.182
these book shelves from 
Washington, D.C. along the 

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:47.188
interstate system, you could 
travel all the way to Davenport 

00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:49.960
Iowa before reaching the end.  
This library holds some of the 

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:54.402
largest collections from maps to
 comic books, founding documents

00:39:54.613 --> 00:39:58.619
 like Thomas Jefferson's 
handwritten draft of the 

00:40:00.432 --> 00:40:04.895
declaration of independence.  
The full paper of 23 presence, 

00:40:05.665 --> 00:40:11.460
the works of Frederick Douglass,

00:40:14.819 --> 00:40:16.819
 thurgood

00:40:18.496 --> 00:40:23.754
 mar shal.  I am reminded of a 
moment during the unrest in the 

00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:30.797
city of Baltimore in April of 
2015, the Pennsylvania avenue 

00:40:30.798 --> 00:40:34.408
branch library was located in 
the epicenter of those events.  

00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:38.359
But I made the decision to keep 
the library open, to provide a 

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.341
safe place for our citizens to 
gather.  And I was there hand in

00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:46.765
 hand with the staff as we 
opened the doors every morning. 

00:40:47.054 --> 00:40:54.738
 Cars were still shouldering in 
the streets, closed signs were 

00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:58.281
hanging in storefronts for 
blocks, but people were lining 

00:40:58.663 --> 00:41:01.883
up outside the doors of the 
library.  And I remember in 

00:41:02.087 --> 00:41:05.829
particular a young girl coming 
up to me and ask, what's the 

00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:14.152
matter?  Why is everyone so 
upset?  She came to the library

00:41:20.088 --> 00:41:24.316
for sanctuary and understanding.
The Rosa parks collection, which

00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:29.708
 includes her family Bible, the 
Bible she carried in her purse, 

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:35.129
and her handwritten letters.  In
 one such letter she reflects on

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.855
 her December 1, 1955, arrest 
writing quote.  I have been 

00:41:41.054 --> 00:41:43.700
pushed around all my life and 
felt at this moment that I 

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.534
couldn't take it anymore.  That 
letter, and all of her papers, 

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:54.157
are now digitized and available 
online.  So anyone, anywhere, 

00:41:54.468 --> 00:41:59.499
can read her words in her own 
handwriting.  They can read them

00:41:59.714 --> 00:42:04.208
 in the classrooms in Wisconsin,
 in a small library on a 

00:42:04.967 --> 00:42:08.508
reservation in New Mexico, and 
even in a library of a young 

00:42:09.844 --> 00:42:14.243
girl in Baltimore looking around
 at her city was in turmoil.  

00:42:14.456 --> 00:42:19.318
That is a real public service.  
And a natural step for this 

00:42:19.811 --> 00:42:23.813
nation's library.  A place where
 you can touch history and 

00:42:24.028 --> 00:42:30.313
imagine your future.  This 
Library of Congress, a historic 

00:42:30.537 --> 00:42:33.584
reference source for Congress, 
an established place for 

00:42:33.783 --> 00:42:36.949
scholars, can also be a place 
where we inspire young authors, 

00:42:37.322 --> 00:42:40.705
where we connect with those 
individuals outside the limits 

00:42:40.896 --> 00:42:45.471
of Washington and help them make
 history themselves.  How do we 

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:49.018
accomplish this?  By building on
 a legacy that depends so much 

00:42:49.019 --> 00:42:53.949
on the people in this room.  Not
 only the elected officials, who

00:42:54.055 --> 00:42:57.601
 have quite a bit to say about 
the direction of this 

00:42:59.328 --> 00:43:04.088
institution, but also the staff 
of the Library of Congress.  My 

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.393
new colleagues here on the 
mezzanine, watching in the Adams

00:43:11.507 --> 00:43:17.713
 cafe, watching in Culpepper, 
Virginia at the campus for audio

00:43:18.602 --> 00:43:22.310
 conservation and watching in 
the national library services 

00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:25.772
for the blind and physically 
handicapped.  Public service has

00:43:25.981 --> 00:43:30.590
 been such a motivating fact for
 for me in my life and my 

00:43:30.884 --> 00:43:33.172
career.
When I received the call from 

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.932
the White House about this 
opportunity, they said, will you

00:43:38.646 --> 00:43:43.742
 serve.  And without hesitation 
I said yes.  Throughout my 

00:43:44.246 --> 00:43:46.338
career, I've known that the 
staff of the Library of Congress

00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:51.031
 is a dedicated and enthusiastic
 group of public servants and I 

00:43:51.032 --> 00:43:54.389
look forward to working with all
 of you for the years to come.  

00:43:54.390 --> 00:44:00.245
But we can't do it alone.  I am 
calling on you, both who are 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.771
here in person and watching 
virtually, that to have a truly 

00:44:04.117 --> 00:44:09.461
national library, an institution
 of opportunity for all, is the 

00:44:10.291 --> 00:44:13.992
responsibility of all.  That 
means collaborating with other 

00:44:14.599 --> 00:44:22.901
institutions; that means private
 sector support, and patriot I 

00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:27.214
can philanthropy.  That means 
starting a new dialogue about 

00:44:27.511 --> 00:44:30.528
connectivity to classrooms and 
other libraries.  I cannot wait 

00:44:30.857 --> 00:44:36.681
to work with all of you to seize
 this moment in history.  So 

00:44:36.824 --> 00:44:38.824
let's reach history at the 

00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.137
Library of Congress together.  

00:45:34.513 --> 00:45:34.865
Thank you.  
[ Applause ] 

00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:42.976
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome the chaplain and rise 

00:45:43.181 --> 00:45:49.265
for the benediction. 
&gt;&gt; Before I pray, I want to pass

00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:56.994
 on the regrets of the senate 
chaplain who was called away at 

00:45:57.543 --> 00:46:02.326
the last minutes and from my 
regrets that I cannot replicate 

00:46:03.146 --> 00:46:08.227
the dull set tones of his mafl 
lus voice.  Let us pray.  We 

00:46:08.381 --> 00:46:14.466
give you thanks, o God, for this
 opportunity to celebrate the 

00:46:15.267 --> 00:46:18.842
swearing in of Dr. Carla Hayden 
as the 14th librarian of 

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:23.266
Congress.  It is an opportunity 
for all present and for all of 

00:46:23.635 --> 00:46:27.110
the American people to reflect 
upon the importance of this 

00:46:27.316 --> 00:46:33.031
greatest of institutions which 
today is entrusted to her.  May 

00:46:35.749 --> 00:46:40.549
she be confident that her work 
is a vital thread in the fabric 

00:46:40.765 --> 00:46:46.503
of our nation and appreciated by
 those gathered her before all 

00:46:46.976 --> 00:46:50.608
Americans.  Bless Dr. Hayden and
 dear God, bless the United
