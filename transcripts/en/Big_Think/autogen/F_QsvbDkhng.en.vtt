created by shooting out photons but it's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010
created by shooting out photons but it's
 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.649
created by shooting out photons but it's
very small and that's the trick in order

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.770
have to have gigantic lasers firing
energy from one side and how do you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780
energy from one side and how do you
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.929

energize these lasers with chemical

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939
energize these lasers with chemical
 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.850
energize these lasers with chemical
reactions so you're back to the same

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860
reactions so you're back to the same
 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.060
reactions so you're back to the same
problem chemical reactions so there is a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070
problem chemical reactions so there is a
 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.279

going to come from so photon engines

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020
going to come from so photon engines
 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.359
going to come from so photon engines
sound like a great idea

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369
sound like a great idea
 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.209
sound like a great idea
but in practice photons have very little

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219
but in practice photons have very little
 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.550
but in practice photons have very little
momentum so you have to have gigantic

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560
momentum so you have to have gigantic
 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.999
momentum so you have to have gigantic
solar sails gigantic laser engines in

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009
solar sails gigantic laser engines in
 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.219
solar sails gigantic laser engines in
order to propel them some people say

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229
order to propel them some people say
 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.139
order to propel them some people say
let's put them on the moon let's have a

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
let's put them on the moon let's have a
 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.389
let's put them on the moon let's have a
battery of laser engines on the moon and

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399
battery of laser engines on the moon and
 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.340
battery of laser engines on the moon and
then the spaceship could be very small

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
then the spaceship could be very small
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.490
then the spaceship could be very small
it could be simply a gigantic sail you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500
it could be simply a gigantic sail you
 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.039
it could be simply a gigantic sail you
shoot lasers from the moon to a sail and

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
shoot lasers from the moon to a sail and
 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.340
shoot lasers from the moon to a sail and
then push that sail into outer space

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
then push that sail into outer space
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.499
then push that sail into outer space
well the advantage is that if the engine

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509
well the advantage is that if the engine
 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.380
well the advantage is that if the engine
is on the moon and you're simply using

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390
is on the moon and you're simply using
 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.539
is on the moon and you're simply using
this engine to push a solar sail to the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549
this engine to push a solar sail to the
 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.999
this engine to push a solar sail to the
Stars then you could actually reach a

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009
Stars then you could actually reach a
 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.340
Stars then you could actually reach a
fraction of the speed of light so that's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350
fraction of the speed of light so that's
 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.410
fraction of the speed of light so that's
something to look at now however I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420
something to look at now however I
 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.869
something to look at now however I
prefer to use laser power in a different

it's a dirty word it is cost C OS t it

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519
it's a dirty word it is cost C OS t it
 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.520
it's a dirty word it is cost C OS t it
cost 10,000 dollars to put a pound of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
cost 10,000 dollars to put a pound of
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.619
cost 10,000 dollars to put a pound of
anything into orbit that is your weight

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629
anything into orbit that is your weight
 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.930
anything into orbit that is your weight
in gold you could go to the Space

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940
in gold you could go to the Space
 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.699

how much would it cost weigh your body

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
how much would it cost weigh your body
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.949
how much would it cost weigh your body
in solid gold and that's how much it

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959
in solid gold and that's how much it
 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690
in solid gold and that's how much it
costs for you to go to the Space Station

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
costs for you to go to the Space Station
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.720
costs for you to go to the Space Station
and why is that because the rocket has

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
and why is that because the rocket has
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.870
and why is that because the rocket has
to carry its own fuel fuel is heavy

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
to carry its own fuel fuel is heavy
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.020
to carry its own fuel fuel is heavy
something on the order of 90% of the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
something on the order of 90% of the
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.380
something on the order of 90% of the
weight of a rocket is rocket fuel so if

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
weight of a rocket is rocket fuel so if
 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.479
weight of a rocket is rocket fuel so if
you could eliminate the rocket fuel you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
you could eliminate the rocket fuel you
 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.069
you could eliminate the rocket fuel you
could increase the efficiency of the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079
could increase the efficiency of the
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.350
could increase the efficiency of the
space program by a factor of 10 to 100

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360
space program by a factor of 10 to 100
 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.930
space program by a factor of 10 to 100
and how could you do that with lasers

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940
and how could you do that with lasers
 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.509
and how could you do that with lasers
what you do is you have a bank of lasers

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519
what you do is you have a bank of lasers
 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.050
what you do is you have a bank of lasers
on the earth firing at a projectile

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060

water creating thrust and that shoots
 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.789
water creating thrust and that shoots
the rocket into space this principle

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799
the rocket into space this principle
 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.610
the rocket into space this principle
works it's been tested as a prototype we

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620
works it's been tested as a prototype we
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.830
works it's been tested as a prototype we
can already do this but there's no

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840
can already do this but there's no
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.590
can already do this but there's no
vested interest there's no funding for

vested interest there's no funding for
 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.650
vested interest there's no funding for
the laser or the microwave rocket so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660
the laser or the microwave rocket so
 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.900
the laser or the microwave rocket so
again the advantage of the laser rocket

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
again the advantage of the laser rocket
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.940
again the advantage of the laser rocket
is the fact that your energy comes from

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950
is the fact that your energy comes from
 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.240
is the fact that your energy comes from
the ground that is the projectile does

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250
the ground that is the projectile does
 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.729
the ground that is the projectile does
not carry any fuel at all other than

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739
not carry any fuel at all other than
 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.819
not carry any fuel at all other than
water and by shooting lasers you can

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829
water and by shooting lasers you can
 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.160
water and by shooting lasers you can
vaporize the water creating steam and it

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170
vaporize the water creating steam and it
 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.220
vaporize the water creating steam and it
simply blasts off on steam that could

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
simply blasts off on steam that could
 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.259
simply blasts off on steam that could
reduce the cost of space travel

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
reduce the cost of space travel
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.260
reduce the cost of space travel
enormously
