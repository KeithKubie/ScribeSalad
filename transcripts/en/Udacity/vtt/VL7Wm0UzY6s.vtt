00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.430
That's enough HTML elements for now. I want to talk about the

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.770
structure of an actual HTML document really quick before we move

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.370
on. Now, what we've been seeing before is just little mark

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.560
up. We've been seeing things like this. You know little tags, a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.680
few little simple tags. But an actual complete HTML document has

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.490
quite a bit more in it. Here's a whole lot more

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.750
HTML. Let's take this piece by piece but this is what

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.768
a complete HTML document looks like. First we have the DOCTYPE. And

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:29.940
this is what kind of, of HTML this is. This

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.780
string right here is, used to be a lot more

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.540
complex. If you were to Google for DOCTYPES you would

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.180
see a lot of different answers here. But now that

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.610
we're using HTML5, it has a nice clean simple doc

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.730
type, which is just the string HTML. Very simple, okay.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.660
Then we have a tag. This is the basically the,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.850
the opening HTML tag and the closing HTML tag. This surrounds

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.170
the entire rest of the document. That's all it does,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.680
is it surrounds the entire document. Now I've got this

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.246
other tag here, the head. This part of the document

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:06.230
has kind of metadata and, and another random stuff. If

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.220
you were to include JavaScript and CSS, CSS, remember we

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.880
talked about it as the filing sort of stuff, that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.410
would be included in the head section. Now we also

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.870
have this little tag here, the title, and this is the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.320
title of the page. This is what would appear in

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.330
the top of your browser window, or in, in your

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.770
browser tab, this string right here. Then we have the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.580
body tag, and the body tag is the actual contents

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.190
of the document. And basically, we've been, we've been working

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.070
just in the body tag in this lesson. And for

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.080
most of this course, we're really just going to be focusing

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.120
on generating the content that fits between the body tags.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.310
It's all this other stuff is important and you'll see it,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.970
and we'll be, you know, we'll sending over the wire. But it

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.860
doesn't change very often and, you know, it's pretty simple, but it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.660
is pretty important for it to be there. All of the interesting

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
stuff though happens between the body tags. Okay, let's take another

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.640
view at HTML documents, they have a structure that can visualized like

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.850
this. An HTML document this whole thing has a head section and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.390
that's where we have our title, references to any CSS files, and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.610
Java script files, and that sort of stuff. And then we

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.300
have the body section and this is where the actual contents of

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.570
the document, the stuff that you see on the screen. This is

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.230
where that comes from. And in this course where mostly going to focus

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.430
on this part of an HTML document. Just the body section

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.770
and there's a lot of content that can go in there. Well,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.980
we'll, you know, discuss briefly, you know, CSS and JavaScript and how

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.810
they fit into everything. But, for the most part, we're going to be

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.550
generating the contents, the body, of, of an HTML document.
