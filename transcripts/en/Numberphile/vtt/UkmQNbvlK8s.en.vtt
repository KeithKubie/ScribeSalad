00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.540
DNA molecules inside a confined environment - just like your headphones inside your backpack -

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.720
will tend to tie knots... There is a theorem,
due to De Witt Sumners &amp; Yuanan Diao that says

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.180
that the knotting probability goes to 1 as
the length of the chain goes to infinity, in r 3.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.740
So if you have a very long cable - it doesn't need to be a complicated knot, but eventually - it will knot itself.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.980
So 'you have such long molecules in so such small environment, it is to be expected that these molecules

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.480
will have some topological complexity. Now, we do not know if there is spontaneous knotting...

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.260
We can anticipate there is. And we do not know
- if there is spontaneous knotting - is it important

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.460
for the cell? We don't know that. We know that the cell typically does not like topological entanglement.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.760
So the cell has an army of enzymes that, the moment they see a knot, they'll come here...

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.640
they say 'Oh, look there is a knot here. Ok, we need to break it. ',

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.540
They open, they break, they transport, one strand through the break, and they reseal the break.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.480
And when they do that, they unknot the knot.
So these are little pacmans that go around the cell,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.820
they're called 'Type-2-Topoisomerases', and they will  just break the chain, transport another strand,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.580
reseal the chain, and remove the topological complexity.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.840
Type-2-topoisomerases are enzymes that are ubiquitous; they have been found in every possible organism;

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.540
I mean from archaea to humans,
and they are essential to life.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.760
meaning: if the Type-2-topoisomerase
in the cell doesn't work, the cell dies.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.280
So they are wonderful targets for antibiotic drugs,
for example... So there's uh...

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.260
a big family of drugs called 'Fluoroquinolones', ...

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.980
you may have heard of 'Cyprofloxacin', ...

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.760
used for... to treat bacterial... uh, like urinary tract infections, or sometimes * infections,...

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.620
What that drug will do is it will target the Type-2-topoisomerase in the bacterium that is making you sick.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.240
In all those bacteria, when the T-2-TopoIsomerase stops working, these bacteria will have an accumulation of

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.460
interlinked DNA - not knotted, but interlinked DNA - 
and that accumulation of topology will kill the bacteria.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.960
So let's assume this is a DNA molecule
that is not helical yet.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.680
Okay? So now let's make it into a helix.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.340
It has to be a right-handed helix, and I need to twist this an even number of times, because otherwise

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780
when I close it, I would get a MÃ¶bius band;
And that's not what I want.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:58.780
So, now, I'm going to close this chain right here...

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.820
- So this is not human DNA then, or...?
- No, let's assume this is either one of those loops

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.200
or is a circular DNA molecule that could be a bacterial genome, or it could be just a naturally-occuring plasmin.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.620
And this coil is just a natural coil from the double helix.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.760
And here I just put two of those turns to make it simpler.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.060
But there's many more turns...

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.340
- Now, what 'you doing?
- And now, these scissors are the enzymes that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.920
are going to start DNA replication.
So the circle - if we assume that this is a bacterial DNA -

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.380
there will be an origin of replication; replication will go by directionally; there will be first enzymes called helicases

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.480
that will unwind the DNA. So they will break the hydrogen bonds and open up the two strands.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.760
So.. unwind DNA, and we can mimic that by just cutting.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.140
And you can imagine another pair of scissors
going in the other direction.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.740
Okay, replication is done.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.360
Now we went from one circle - one circular DNA molecule - to two circular DNA molecules.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.340
Well, look what the problem is...
We have a topological problem right here...

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.460
- What's going on there?
They're knotted together, they're linked...!

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:26.340
- They're interlinked. So they are two independent circles. Each one of them has exactly the same genetic code.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.340
But these two circles are interlinked.
So, now, if each new cell wants to inherit one circle,

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.380
they will pull. If they pull, they will break... If DNA breaks, that's a very bad... that's very bad news for your cell.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:48.620
Or, very gently, an enzyme called Type-2-Topoisomerase - your old friend - will come here,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.660
will break very gently, will transport one chain
through the break, and reseal the break,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.980
and then assess 'Am I done?' 'Oh, I'm not done!'
'Okay, then I need to break again!'

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.260
'Okay, I'm going to break again, transport, reseal...'
'Okay, now I'm done..!' 'Now I'm done.'

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.260
Now each one of those chromosomes can segregate
to a new daughter cell, and cell division can happen.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.260
So this is a problem: when Type-2-Topoisomerases
don't work, then the newly-replicated chromosomes are

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.740
interlinked. And there is nothing you can do about that.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.260
And that interlinking will
eventually kill the bacterial cells.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.160
And this happen every time the DNA is replicated.
Every time you go through replication,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.880
the DNA is interlinked.
Why? Because DNA is a helix. That's the reason.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.540
It's a very simple mathematical reason: DNA is a helix, so when you cut it through the center

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.140
- if it's circular and you cut it through the center -

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.520
these crossings will become linked
- interlinks between two chains.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.800
Chromosomes look like notes but the occupy distinct territories within the cell nucleus.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800
And then you're looking here.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.400
Well, the question is, is there an organisation here?
