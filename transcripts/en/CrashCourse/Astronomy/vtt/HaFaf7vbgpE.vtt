00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.900
This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.139
As we saw in the last episode, Jupiter is
by far the largest and most massive planet

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.340
in the solar system. That means it has a very
strong gravitational field, which also means

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.240
it can hold on to a lot of moons. A lot. Right now,
as we record this episode, there are 67 that have

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.820
been confirmed. And how many it really has depends
on how small an object you're willing to call a "moon."

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.180
In 1610, Galileo pointed his telescope at Jupiter,
and witnessed a revolution. Oh, hey, literally!

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.920
He saw three little stars lined up on either
side of Jupiter, stars he could not see with

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.439
his naked eye. And they moved! A week later
he saw a fourth one, and he knew he was seeing

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:58.140
objects revolving, orbiting around Jupiter.
It was proof that not everything in the solar

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.269
system revolved around the Earth. That was
a pretty big deal.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.309
Those four moons are now called the Galilean
moons in his honor. Not bad for a week’s work.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:10.979
All four are really big, too. If Jupiter weren’t
there, drowning them out with its glare, they’d

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.070
be visible to the naked eye. In that case
we might even call them planets, too.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.060
The biggest of Jupiter’s moons is Ganymede.
At 5270 km across, it’s the biggest moon

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.360
of any planet. It’s even bigger than the
planet Mercury—in fact, in size it’s halfway

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200
between Mercury and Mars!

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.080
Size isn’t the only planet-like characteristic
of Ganymede, either. It’s mostly rock and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.980
ice, but it probably has a liquid iron core. It even has
a magnetic field, likely generated by that liquid core.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.679
The surface is similar to our own Moon in
that there’s very old, cratered terrain

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.460
as well as smoother, younger areas. Ganymede
is also criss-crossed with large grooves.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.580
It’s not clear what the origin of those
grooves is, but it may be related to stress and

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.520
strain on the surface caused by the tides from the other
large moons as they orbit Jupiter and pass each other.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.400
Ganymede has a surprise well below its surface,
too: Oceans of water! Measurements of Ganymede’s

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.180
magnetic field, made during multiple passes by the
Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s, combined with Hubble

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.069
observations of the moon, indicate Ganymede has
quite a bit of salty liquid water, deep beneath

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.470
its surface! As we’ll see in a sec, it’s
not alone in that regard.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.400
The next biggest moon is Callisto, at 4800
km in diameter. In many ways it’s similar

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.860
to its big brother Ganymede, mostly rock and
ice. It probably has a rocky core, then a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.810
layer of mixed rock and ice above that. The
surface is mostly ice, but mixed with darker

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.420
material as well. It has a magnetic field, too,
but it probably doesn’t have a metallic core.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.220
The surface is heavily cratered, and there’s
no indication of any volcanoes or tectonic

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.700
activity. That means the surface is very old,
maybe as old as Callisto itself. It even has

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.069
an atmosphere, but it’s a tad thin: roughly
one one-hundred-billionth the pressure of

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.260
Earth’s air at the surface!

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.959
Callisto orbits Jupiter farthest out of the
four biggies, almost 2 million km away. That’s

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.879
too far to gravitationally interact with the
other three; when I talk about the moons affecting

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.499
each other, it’s really the other three
interacting.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.379
Next up is Io. It’s only a little bit bigger than
our own Moon, and orbits Jupiter so tightly

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.659
it only takes about a day and a half to go
around the planet.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.420
When the Voyager 1 space probe passed Io in
1979 it revealed a surface that was really

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.469
weird. It was yellow and orange and red and
black, and didn’t seem to have any obvious

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.110
impact craters. An engineer, Linda Morabito,
noticed that in one image there appeared to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.010
be what looked like another moon behind Io,
partially eclipsed by it. But that was no

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.330
moon: It was a volcano on Io erupting, its
plume shooting up from the surface and opening

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.710
up into a wide arc.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.910
Io is the most volcanic object in the entire
solar system, with over 400 active volcanoes.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.000
Quite a few of them are erupting at any given
time, and images taken even a few months apart

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.980
show changes in the surface due to ejected
material. A lot of the erupted material is

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.290
rich in sulfur, which is why the surface has
all those odd colors on it.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.189
The energy for all this activity comes from
the other moons: As they pass Io in their

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.980
orbits they flex it via tides, heating its
interior through friction.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.310
A lot of that sulfur ends up as a very thin
atmosphere around Io, and some of those sulfur

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.400
atoms are then picked up by Jupiter’s powerful
magnetic field as it sweeps past Io and accelerates

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.060
them to very high speeds. This has created
a tremendous donut-shaped radiation belt around

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.060
Jupiter, like Earth’s Van Allen belts, but
far more powerful. The radiation there is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.890
so intense it would kill an unprotected human
in minutes. Of course, if you’re floating

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.880
in space near Jupiter unprotected, you might
have some more immediate concerns.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
Oh, one more thing: Both Ganymede and Io are
magnetically connected to Jupiter. Charged

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.610
particles flow from those moons along the
lines of magnetism to Jupiter, which then

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180
slams them down at Jupiter’s poles, just
like the Earth does with the particles from

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.699
the solar wind. On Earth this creates the
aurorae, the northern and southern lights,

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.350
and it does at Jupiter, too. You can even
see the ultraviolet glow where each of the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.850
moons connects to Jupiter; their magnetic
footprints in the planet’s atmosphere!

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.380
And now we come to Europa, the smallest but
perhaps most exciting of all the Galilean

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.720
moons. Slightly smaller than our moon, it was
known for decades to be very reflective, meaning

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.440
its surface was probably loaded with water ice.
But even so, the Voyager observations were shocking.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.030
They showed a surface completely lacking in
craters, meaning something had resurfaced

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.610
the moon like Io or Venus; but Europa has
no volcanoes. Even more intriguing, the surface

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.110
was covered in long cracks, dark streaks all
over the moon, as well as complex ridges.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.460
These and other features appear to be due
to material from the interior of Europa welling

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.270
up and forming the new surface, kind of like
the way lava does on Earth.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.190
But in this case, the material is water. It’s
now thought that Europa has an entire ocean

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.509
of water, sealed up under a solid crust of
ice several kilometers thick. Water welling

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.330
up and moving under the crust causes it to
shift, creating all the various surface features.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.550
The amount of water that may be locked up
on Europa is staggering; easily more than

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.740
all the water in all the oceans on Earth!
Like Ganymede and Io, the interior of Europa

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.020
is kept warm by tidal flexing from the other
moons, keeping the ice melted.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.460
Now get this: A lot of Europa’s material
is silicate rock, like on Earth and other

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.379
terrestrial planets, located in a layer under
the ocean. If this interacts with the ocean

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.629
in the same way Earth’s oceans interact
with the sea floor, this could make the subsurface

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.090
Europan water salty. In fact, those dark cracks
on the surface have been found to be rich

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.340
in salt and organic materials - in other words,
carbon-based compounds!

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.540
This is pretty exciting. We think Earth’s
life originated in salty ocean water. If there

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.500
are carbon-based molecules actually in Europa’s
water, it’s not too crazy to wonder if the

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:34.220
same spark that occurred here also happened
there. We think Europa has everything it needs

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.680
to spawn life. We just don’t have any direct
evidence of it yet.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.020
Some people have proposed sending a space
probe to Europa specifically to look for life.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.420
It would land near a crack in the ice, where the
crust is thinner, and somehow penetrate it

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.940
(perhaps melting its way down). Chemical sampling
could then look for signs of biological activity.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.740
That’s amazing to me: The idea of life in
Europa, even if it’s just microbial life,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.180
is taken very seriously by astrobiologists,
scientists who study the possibility of life

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.040
in space. It used to be science fiction. Now
it’s a topic of scholarly research.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.180
Astronomers have a concept called the habitable
zone: The distance a planet can be from its

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.310
parent star where the temperature on the planet’s
surface can support liquid water. It’s a

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.190
fuzzy concept; Venus and Mars are both technically
in the Sun’s habitable zone, but Venus is

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.350
too hot and Mars too cold for liquid water.
Atmospheres make a big difference. But it’s

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.650
still a useful concept as rule of thumb for
potential habitability.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.070
But Europa changed that. Jupiter is way, way
outside the Sun’s habitable zone, yet there’s

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.290
Europa, all wet. It’s a great example that we
need to let our ideas breathe a bit sometimes,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.440
let them relax and flow outside the boundaries
we set for them. When we look for signs of

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:47.099
life on planets orbiting other stars, I bet
we’ll have to keep our minds open to types

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.259
of life we’ve never considered before.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.919
Those are just the four big moons of Jupiter,
each thousands of kilometers across. They

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:59.150
probably formed along with Jupiter, coalescing
from the eddies and whorls around the protoJupiter

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.819
as it formed billions of years ago.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.199
But the planet has dozens of other moons,
too. About the only thing they all have in

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:08.270
common is that they’re tidally locked to
Jupiter; they all rotate once for every time

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.970
they go around the planet. Jupiter’s tides
are hundreds of times stronger than Earth’s,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.340
so no surprise there.

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:18.319
The next biggest moon after The Big Four is
way smaller; named Amalthea, it’s an irregular

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:25.150
lump about 250 km across its longest dimension.
It was discovered in 1892, and it’s red—probably

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.470
polluted by sulfur from Io. It orbits just
over 100,000 km from Jupiter’s cloudtops;

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.110
if you stood on Amalthea’s surface, Jupiter
would fill half the sky.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.110
The moons get smaller and more irregularly
shaped from there, with Himalia and Thebe

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:45.260
and Elara and Pasiphae, down to Hegemone, Kale,
and Kallichore, which are no bigger than hills.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:50.100
Many of the irregular, distant moons of Jupiter
orbit the planet backwards relative to the

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.310
others, in what are called retrograde orbits.
They may be captured asteroids from the nearby

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.529
asteroid belt. Many of the moons have orbital
characteristics that are very similar, too,

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:02.529
which may indicate they were once a single
object that broke up. Several such families

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:03.680
of moons orbit Jupiter.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.720
The smallest moons we’ve seen are roughly
a kilometer across. If they were sitting on

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.579
Earth they might be hard to pedal up on a
bicycle, but orbiting Jupiter they hardly

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:16.190
rate as more than debris. There are probably
thousands of moons the size of houses circling

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.560
the planet, and who knows, maybe millions
the size of tennis balls.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.170
Should we even call those moons? Maybe. But
I don’t really worry about that kind of

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.529
thing. The important thing to remember is
that these are worlds, big and small, each

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:33.339
fascinating, rich, and diverse. And there’s
still a lot more left to explore about them.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:37.740
Today you learned that Jupiter has lots of
moons, and four big ones. They’re mostly

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:43.180
rock and ice, though Ganymede, the biggest,
may have an iron core. Io is riddled with

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.040
volcanoes, and Europa has an undersurface
ocean that is the object of intense study

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.470
for scientists looking for life in space.
Io, Europa, and Ganymede are close enough

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.850
to interact gravitationally, providing a source
of heat for their interiors. There are lots

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.470
and lots of littler moons, but at the moment
we really don’t know much about them. Someday.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:05.960
