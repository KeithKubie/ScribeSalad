00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.620
people approaching me to make book
because if you could read them you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
because if you could read them you
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389
because if you could read them you
suddenly realized which ones are going

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
suddenly realized which ones are going
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.359
suddenly realized which ones are going
to teach you in which ones worked

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
to teach you in which ones worked
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.610
to teach you in which ones worked
and was kind of the first moment that I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620
and was kind of the first moment that I
 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.740
and was kind of the first moment that I
began to realize that maybe it was more

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750
began to realize that maybe it was more
 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.250
began to realize that maybe it was more
important to read context to just be

important to read context to just be
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.309
important to read context to just be
able to compute content and that's where

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
able to compute content and that's where
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.430

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:22.910
scaleable learning in the workplace and
 

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.620
scaleable learning in the workplace and
in our governments and I think that is a

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:26.630
in our governments and I think that is a
 

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.400
in our governments and I think that is a
new type of design challenge and we add

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.410
new type of design challenge and we add
 

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.190
new type of design challenge and we add
to that what we're now capable of doing

to that what we're now capable of doing
with cloud computing and now how we can

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.100
with cloud computing and now how we can
 

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.790
with cloud computing and now how we can
actually rethink learning on demand as
