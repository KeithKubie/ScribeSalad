00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.470
You probably think your options after death
are basically just burial, or cremation.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.520
But what if you, with your buddy John Stuart
Mill, co-founded utilitarianism?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.499
And as a utilitarian you believe that when
it comes to issues of morality, sentience

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:23.590
– the ability to feel pleasure and pain
– is really all that matters.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.480
The only way to cause harm is to cause pain
and since corpses can’t feel pain, dead

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.539
bodies aren’t deserving of moral consideration.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.280
Now, you might think that, by that logic,
your body can just get dumped in a ditch.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.880
Or, maybe somewhere a bit more sanitary.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.260
It doesn’t really matter - the dead don’t
deserve consideration because it’s awful

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.340
hard to harm them.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.680
But also, as a utilitarian, you want to produce
the greatest good for the greatest number

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680
of people.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.820
And, for Jeremy Bentham, apparently the best
way to do that after death was to have

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.280
your dead body put in a glass cabinet at the
University College London for, as of this

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
recording, more than one hundred and eighty
five years.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760
Just sticking his corpse into the ground would

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.080
have been wasteful – of no help to anyone,
except a lot of microbes.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.720
Reportedly, in the last decade or so of his
life, Bentham became fixated on how to be

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.940
as useful as possible, even in death.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.610
And so, he left meticulous instructions in
his will, specifying that his body be given

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.040
to a “dear friend of his” to see his plans
through.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.830
Bentham requested that his head be preserved
according to a mummification process said

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.530
to have been used by the Maori people of New
Zealand.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.550
He asked that his body be dissected for educational
purposes – a practice that was illegal at

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.070
the time – so that others could learn from
it.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.620
And once all possible use had been obtained
from what he called his “soft parts,”

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.950
he asked that his bones and head be displayed
as what he called an “Auto-Icon,” a powerful

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.990
reminder of the values he stood for in life.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.270
This way, even though he wasn’t able to
continue spreading his beliefs through teaching

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.290
in the classroom, generations of students
would still learn about Bentham and what he

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.260
believed from his public skelton.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.050
In the end, Bentham got his wish, more or
less.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.620
185 years after his death, his corpse stands
in his old black suit in that glass cabinet,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.120
creeping out visitors.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.710
The mummification of his head was something
of a failure, leaving it in such a gruesome

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.510
state that it wasn’t returned to his body;
instead, a wax replica was affixed to his

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.510
neck.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.330
But his head has nonetheless provided some
useful lessons.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.490
Bentham’s dessicated skull used to sit near
his body.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.160
But it was repeatedly stolen by students who,
in true utilitarian fashion, demanded ransom

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.690
money, to be donated to a charity, for its
safe return.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.270
So now, Bentham’s head is only available
for viewing by special arrangement.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.480
In addition to spinning a wild and intriguing
tale, Bentham’s decision, and his friend’s

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.050
willingness to carry it out, show true dedication
living and dying according to philosophical

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.050
principles.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.920
Bentham cared little about social acceptability,
but he cared a great deal about what he believed

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.020
to be right.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.050
Which is somewhat ironic as, legend has it,
he is sometimes brought into university meetings

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.580
where he is noted in the attendance records
as “Jeremy Bentham, present, but not voting.”
