00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We have three equations here that also supposedly describe the same thing--motion.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But if they all describe the same thing, why do we need three of them?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, let's think for a second.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Motion so far seems to involve talking about these five quantities.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How much our position changes, our initial velocity, our final velocity,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
our acceleration, and our time.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If we go through each of these equations,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we can see they each involve some combination of these variables.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We can see that this equation involves all the variables except for the final velocity,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
this one everything except for change in position,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and this one everything except for time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
These are all going to be useful in different circumstances. Let's do some practice.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's say I gave you this situation.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here we have Galileo again on the top of the leaning tower,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which he may or may not have every done,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and he's going to through a ball downwards at 5 m/s.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, the height is 57 m. That's the change in position that the ball is going to have to undergo.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, my question is out of these five variables,

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which three do we know? And we do know three, not only two.
