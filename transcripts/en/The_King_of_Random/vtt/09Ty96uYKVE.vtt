00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.620
What's up guys welcome back to another

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.020
day of metal casting experiment and you

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.370
remember in a previous project I showed

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.720
you how to make some green sand for

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.309
metal casting and I also showed you how

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.200
to make a special sandbox for metal

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.759
casting as well and the purpose of those

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.290
two videos was to create tools that we

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.790
could use to cast a metal fidget

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.410
spinner which is something I've had

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.820
hundreds and hundreds of requests for

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.560
however a channel on YouTube called

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.939
pressTube went ahead and did a first

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.410
day did a really good job and got about

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.029
seven million views in the first day so

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.109
so I don't want to redo something that's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.550
already been done really well and I feel

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.109
like the fidgets spinner trend won't

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.820
really work on this channel I went ahead

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.260
and printed out my own templates for a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.329
radioactive gear kind of symbol so we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.620
could still have the same fun with sand

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.750
casting but for this video we're casting

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.640
with copper now a couple quick things I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.079
wanted to mention when I made my green

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.610
sand I think I made it a little bit too

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.020
wet so I've been letting this sit out

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.160
for a couple of days I blend it all

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.379
together and it's a lot finer and a lot

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.700
drier but I think it's going to work

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.860
even better these copper ingots here the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.270
ones we made in yesterday's video where

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.460
we melted down stands of copper pipes to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.780
make four different ingots which are

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.219
worth about seven dollars and fifty

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.440
cents each apparently so the purpose of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.879
today's video is to use our template to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.129
create a custom styrofoam gear pack it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.019
in green sand then remelt or copper

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.700
ingots so we can create ourselves some

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.920
kind of a random metal gear just for fun

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.780
so step number one is to cut out our

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:31.990
template and glue to some foam

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.460
so here we are guys I've got my

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.840
templates attached to some housing

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.460
insulation and now to trace out the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.780
edges we're going to bring back to the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.849
StyroSlicer

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:17.169
alright let's cut out the inside

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.819
alright guys our gear is finished it's

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.170
cut out of the styrofoam when it's ready

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.330
to be packed with sand now there are two

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.950
parts of our sandbox the coke and the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.330
drag and for this I'm just going to using

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.590
the drag we're going to flip it over

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.450
turn it upside down over top of the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.980
baseboard then we're going to take our

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.120
styrofoam gear and we're going to place

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.830
it facedown right in the center of the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.750
board on second thought this box is a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.769
little bit bigger than we need so I'm

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.549
going to use the smaller one instead now

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.810
if we had a really intricate mold we're

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.250
trying to copy the pattern of we would

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.409
use a sieve and take our green sand and

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.569
just sprinkle it over top like to it but

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.739
since we're using styrofoam here that's

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.269
just going to be obliterated it doesn't

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.650
really matter so much we can just grab

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.140
handfuls of our sand and pack it down

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.060
tight ramming tool

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.290
cool our stand is packed down tight so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.580
now we can just use this scrap piece of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.530
one by three to shimy the top and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.069
smooth it all out

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.370
beautiful it goes on like this take out

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.870
the excess and flip it over take a look

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.540
at what we got right there is our gear

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.740
maybe we did a pretty good job guys our

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.150
gear is packed in the sand it's ready to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:00.280
be cast let's take it outside our copper

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.300
has been sitting in the metal foundry

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.800
for about 20 minutes so let's open it up

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.890
and see what we got ah beautiful liquid

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.430
copper look at that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.180
yeah alright guys where it all happened

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.880
copper looks molten that's beautiful

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.870
take that out now as I begin to pour

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.340
this it's going to start shooting flames

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.240
just to let you know nice and easy nice

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.699
and easy here we go oh cool

00:04:44.290 --> 00:05:00.880
that's the cool

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.630
you know what's interesting about that

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.190
is as I was bringing the crucible over

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.780
to para you could see the styrofoam was

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.830
already starting to melt

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.840
just from the radiant heat and I ended

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.919
up pouring a little bit more than I

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.360
wanted to because it was cooling down a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.380
little bit too quickly and it wasn't

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.000
filling the edges it wasn't flowing in

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.830
the way I was hoping it would but that's

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.240
okay because we can always grind this

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.550
stuff off and make a nice smooth surface

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.210
we're just going to give that a few

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.350
minutes to cool down then we're going to

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.850
quench it in some water take it out of

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.330
stand and see we got it's looking pretty

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.110
solid let's dig it out oh sweet look at

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.800
that beautiful it's very hot quenching

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.890
is in order

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.500
that's what we got oh it's not perfect

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.840
it's still pretty cool check this out

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.220
guys my OCD is killing me right now

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.170
because it didn't form a complete gear

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.460
it stopped right here where it looked

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.530
like the two sides kind of solidified

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.420
and then joined together I think that's

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.560
because the styrofoam didn't get out of

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.670
the way as fast as I thought it would I

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.080
thought it would just evaporate it

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.610
actually took quite a long time burning

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.160
off allowing the molten copper to pour

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.380
in and cool down as it did so I'm really

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.580
tempted right now just to chop this down

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.070
remelt it and cast it all over again I

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.060
think I have to do that

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.740
bangerang success that is why we made

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.590
two templates all right we're going to

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.789
have to do this best because we don't

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.139
have any time to wait we don't want to

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.759
let that copper cool down at all there

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.150
we go

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.569
flames gone out copper is liquify that's

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.310
what a pity well transfer of course

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.400
extreme is extremely hot getting up look

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.680
at it melt of styrofoam right there just

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.090
going to use the heat actually to melt

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.310
to start from right out and look how it

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.879
leaves that cavity there that's cool all

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.099
right here comes the core that's

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:21.059
beautiful oh I just found out I can't

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:28.419
call that good cumin burning I couldn't

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.210
tell if this family knew or not so I

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.430
guess we're going to find out a bit all

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.840
right let's just let that cool down for

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.220
about five minutes and see if we got any

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.289
better result fingers crossed because I

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:40.509
don't have to do that again it was

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:42.039
really incredible about that experience

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:43.900
was how the styrofoam just melted away

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.639
under the key to the crucible it was

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.800
actually fantastic the cavity that I

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.330
left behind in the sand was absolutely

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.370
perfect and my only concern now is as

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.750
the liquid metal went in there did it

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.669
push the sound out of place or did the

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:55.960
sound actually have enough integrity to

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.430
hold its position we're gonna have to

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.389
let this cool down for a few minutes

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.370
then we can dig it out and see as long

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.840
as we got a clean casting on the bottom

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.729
we can send all that stuff off the top

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:05.020
and still make it look pretty decent

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.669
we'll get all the wood on the side of

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:08.050
the box is charred from the peat of the

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.889
crucible as well

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.970
and that is some pretty intense heat and

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:19.570
all right well let's see we got oh that

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.169
side looks decent not perfect we got

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.729
another little imperfection right there

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:29.199
but looking nice alright go for the

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:37.750
water bath here

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.070
Hot Stuff

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.340
dang we almost got a perfect cast on

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.510
this side we got a little bit right

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.130
there and a little bit right there it

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.500
wasn't going perfectly I think that's as

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.730
good as it's going to get for today you

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:01.900
can definitely see the radioactive

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.720
symbol there that's cool almost looks

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.450
like some kind of genetic mutation looks

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.510
like flesh dripping off interesting

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.300
color it's heavy well there you have a

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.830
guys that's what we got it looks like

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.540
the sand actually did hold its integrity

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.640
fairly well the problem that we have is

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.070
copper cooled down so dang fast we're

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.030
getting these imperfections on the

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.530
bottom where it hits the sand and cool

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.150
it down a little bit too quickly but I

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.470
might still be able to make this work I

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.760
might take a just shop and just grind it

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.680
down and see if we can make of it so

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.850
there you have it guys that's my first

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.770
experience with hybrid styrofoam green

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.660
sand casting looks like I still need to

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.920
sharp it up on these skills a little bit

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.720
but hey it's not bad and it is a lot of

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.830
fun and we're learning as we go

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.660
but the proof of concept is here guys we

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.340
can use green sand to make pretty much

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.320
any molds that we want and cast any

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.540
metal that we want from here on out it's

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.280
just practice hey thanks for joining me

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.510
for this video today I'll be looking for

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.300
you the next one talk to you then cool
