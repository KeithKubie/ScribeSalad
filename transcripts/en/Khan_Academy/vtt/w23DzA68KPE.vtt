00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.430
We're asked to move the
orange dot to negative 0.6

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.850
on the number line.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.760
So the dot right now is at 0.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.710
And let's see,
this is negative 2.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.760
This is positive 2.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.910
So each of these big
slashes look like it's 1.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.690
So this would be
negative 1, negative 2.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.550
This right over here
would be negative 0.5.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.810
So we're going to
go a little bit more

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.240
negative than negative 0.5.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.530
That would be negative 0.6.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.230
We want to go another tenth.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.880
And so that looks right
at about negative 0.6.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.840
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.876
Move the orange dot to
1.9 on the number line.

00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:36.500
So it seems like we
have the same scale

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.340
as in the previous example.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.810
This gets us to 1.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.720
In fact, this is 0.5, 1, 1.5.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.830
And 1.9 is only going to
be a tenth less than 2.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.890
So it's going to be--
let's see, that's 2,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.000
so a tenth less than that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.080
And I'm assuming that it's
locking us to the tenths.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.020
And it looks like it is, so
that looks pretty close to 1.9.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.280
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.400
Move the orange dot to
0.5 on the number line.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.500
Well, once again, we
have the same scale.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.320
It's important to
always check the scale.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.790
And this right over here is 1.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.590
So 0.5 would be halfway, so
that little small mark right

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.300
over there.
