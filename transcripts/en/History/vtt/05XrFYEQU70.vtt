00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.380
How can I help you?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.040
JACOB: I've got an
1894-S Barber dime.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.170
And where did you get this?

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.380
JACOB: My wife found
it in the garden,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.460
and I know that it's very rare.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.330
It's the rarest of the rarest.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.330
They call this one
the King of Dimes.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.580
It's one of the most expensive
American coins there is.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.080
[change rattling]

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.380
JACOB: In 1894,
the San Francisco

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.920
mint printed one of the
most collectible coins

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.580
in US currency.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.170
My wife found the coin while
she was weeding the carrots.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.880
I'd like to sell this
coin because it's

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.330
worth a lot of money, and I
could pay my house off with it.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.080
This is pretty amazing.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.920
It's debated how many
there are out there.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.670
The rumor is 24.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.580
One of the stories is
that the director of mint

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.000
was having a reception or a
party, and he printed 24 dimes,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.920
and handed them out at
gifts at the reception.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.710
Another story is the
mint director gave

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.080
some dimes to his daughter.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.420
He told his daughter
to keep them,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.960
they'd be worth a
lot of money one day.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.580
And on the way
home from the mint,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.420
it was a hot day, so she
used one of the times

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.210
to buy some ice cream.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.960
[laughter]

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420
[music playing]

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.920
If you're gardening and
you find an 1894 S dime,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
it's sort of like hitting the
lottery five times in a row.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120
But not all of them
are accounted for.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.250
So there is a possibility.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.920
So have you had this
checked out by anybody?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.580
JACOB: We had NGC look
at it, but they just said

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.540
that the date was hard to read.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.380
OK.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.120
How much you looking
to get for this?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420
JACOB: I'd like to get $400,000.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.460
$400,000?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.000
JACOB: Mm-hmm.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.170
All right.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.920
So did you clean this?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.920
JACOB: My wife did.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.080
She couldn't read the date.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.830
She couldn't see the
front side of the coin.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.000
So she actually scrubbed
it with a Scotch Brite.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.250
And I jokingly said she
scrubbed $100,000 off the coin.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.830
Yeah.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.670
You have 1, 8, part of
a 9, and nothing else.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.500
There's no way to bring
that date back up.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.750
It's gone forever.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500
Also, the first ones that
were struck were proofs.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.670
And they were
struck really hard.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.380
This is not struck really hard.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.500
This is not an 1894 S.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.880
OK.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.040
Thanks for coming in, man.
I appreciate it.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
JACOB: All right.
Well, thank you.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040
I wish it was real.
But--

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.540
Me, too.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.040
I'm pretty disappointed.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120
I really thought I
had the real thing.
