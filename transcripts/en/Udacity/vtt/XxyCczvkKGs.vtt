&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, I always forget how to add things. New, oh yea,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.430
new fields. Okay, so purchase source, that's

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.070
a pick list right? Pick list just like.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.770
&gt;&gt; A little drop down list you can

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.390
click and choose one of the definied values.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.110
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.500
Okay, so the places you could buy a ticket would be. At the box office.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.020
&gt;&gt; Box office.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.710
&gt;&gt; The official website.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.990
&gt;&gt; Official website, yeah.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810
&gt;&gt; What else?

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.856
&gt;&gt; Maybe like third-party ticket vendor.

00:00:30.856 --> 00:00:32.964
&gt;&gt; Okay. Anything else?

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:33.850
&gt;&gt; maybe Facebook?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.630
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, yeah. Okay, and description, I guess

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.860
this is where the customer or attendee bought the ticket.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.750
we wanted to add more values to the pick

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.620
list later, we could just go back and add them.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool, right. So, moving on, Next. Lots of Next.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.950
&gt;&gt; Default visibility, yeah.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, I do want to add it to the Layout. Right?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.170
&gt;&gt; I guess I should Save anew because I'm going to add a bunch more fields?

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's add the next one.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So I'll finish that and add a few more fields.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.500
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
