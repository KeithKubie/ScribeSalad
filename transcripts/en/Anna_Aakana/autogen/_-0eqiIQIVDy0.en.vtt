00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.020
 Hi! 

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.100
 After a year and a half 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
 From writing, rewriting, refining and polishing 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.780
 I wrote a book. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.980
 Name of the book "I have a lot to tell you - Letters to my little sister" 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.340
 It is a collection of articles on life, love, creativity, work, 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.820
 It is lessons and ethics I would like to give my sister if she is still alive 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.160
 It's on sale today if you want it, and I'll put the link down 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.700
 But unfortunately because I came out of the movie Miss 2059 season 2 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.920
 I have no time but to sign a single book on Friday June 16th at 19:30 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.080
 In the last library in downtown Los Angeles 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.400
 I will read excerpts from the book and of course I will end up with some poetry 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.380
 And to 'meet and greet' and then sign the book 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.760
 I hope you like it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 I have worked hard on it, 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.860
 I'm very nervous about it, but I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.920
 Good-bye!
