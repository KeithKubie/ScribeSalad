00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.259
Here's a question for you. What is it that makes us most human? Is it our

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.098
opposable thumbs? Is it walking on two feet? Well, I would argue, it's the

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:13.700
brain, its overall size and structure. Now, the brain has not always looked

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.490
like this. 3 million years ago with the first humans, habilis, it was much

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.392
smaller. And then, we had erectus, and then we had neandethal, and in the last

00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:27.745
200,000 years we've had us, modern humans, or homo sapiens. And the thing that

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.800
really has changed across these different species is the frontal lobe, right

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.196
here. It's bigger, it's more complex. And it's the frontal lobes that really do

00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:39.730
make us human. It's where we think abstractly, it's where we have working

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.505
memory, think about the past and the future. And, we're creative. And it's that

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:49.730
creativity saw first or long ago in the, the cave paintings, and we continue to

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.448
see, currently, in modern society, to expose of creativity. Art, science,

00:00:56.448 --> 00:01:01.842
music, dance, and so on. So, I would argue, it's the brain that makes us most

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:03.070
human.
