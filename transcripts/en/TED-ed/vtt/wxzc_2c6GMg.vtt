00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:09.598
Which of these has 
the least carbohydrates?

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:10.977
This roll of bread?

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:12.327
This bowl of rice?

00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:14.224
Or this can of soda?

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:15.380
It's a trick question.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.689
Although they may differ in fats,
vitamins, and other nutritional content,

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.051
when it comes to carbs,
they're pretty much the same.

00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.323
So what exactly does that mean
for your diet?

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:30.375
First of all, carbohydrate is 
the nutritional category for sugars

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:34.480
and molecules that your body breaks down
to make sugars.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.687
Carbohydrates can be simple or complex
depending on their structure.

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:42.611
This is a simple sugar,
or monosaccharide.

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:46.889
Glucose, fructose, 
and galactose are all simple sugars.

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.505
Link two of them together,
and you've got a disaccharide,

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:55.254
lactose, maltose, or sucrose.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.517
Complex carbohydrates,
on the other hand,

00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:00.990
have three or more simple sugars
strung together.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.330
Complex carbohydrates with three
to ten linked sugars

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.257
are oligosaccharides.

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:09.367
Those with more than ten
are polysaccharides.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:10.975
During digestion,

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:14.052
your body breaks down those
complex carbohydrates

00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:16.906
into their monosaccharide building blocks,

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:19.469
which your cells can use for energy.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.331
So when you eat 
any carbohydrate-rich food,

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:27.238
the sugar level in your blood,
normally about a teaspoon, goes up.

00:01:27.238 --> 00:01:31.965
But your digestive tract doesn't respond
to all carbohydrates the same.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:33.673
Consider starch and fiber,

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:35.230
both polysaccharides,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.892
both derived from plants,

00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:42.120
both composed of hundreds to thousands
of monosaccharides joined together,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.272
but they're joined together differently,

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:47.205
and that changes the effect 
they have on your body.

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:51.884
In starches, which plants mostly store
for energy in roots and seeds,

00:01:51.884 --> 00:01:55.708
glucose molecules are joined together
by alpha linkages,

00:01:55.708 --> 00:02:00.488
most of which can be easily cleaved
by enzymes in your digestive tract.

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:05.658
But in fiber, the bonds between
monosaccharide molecules are beta bonds,

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.876
which your body can't break down.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:12.560
Fiber can also trap some starches,
preventing them from being cleaved,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.931
resulting in something called
resistant starch.

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:19.852
So foods high in starch,
like crackers and white bread,

00:02:19.852 --> 00:02:21.328
are digested easily,

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:24.774
quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose
into your blood,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:28.972
exactly what would happen if you drank
something high in glucose, like soda.

00:02:28.972 --> 00:02:31.958
These foods have a high glycemic index,

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.398
the amount that a particular food
raises the sugar level in your blood.

00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:39.705
Soda and white bread have a similar
glycemic index

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.923
because they have a similar effect
on your blood sugar.

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:47.414
But when you eat foods high in fiber,
like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains,

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:52.544
those indigestible beta bonds slow 
the release of glucose into the blood.

00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:54.988
Those foods have a lower glycemic index,

00:02:54.988 --> 00:03:00.759
and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats
have the lowest glycemic index.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:04.164
When sugar moves from the digestive tract
to the blood stream,

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:08.091
your body kicks into action to transfer it
into your tissues

00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:10.942
where it can be processed 
and used for energy.

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:14.643
Insulin, a hormone 
synthesized in the pancreas,

00:03:14.643 --> 00:03:17.936
is one of the body's main tools
for sugar management.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.509
When you eat and your blood sugar rises,

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.173
insulin is secreted into the blood.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.992
It prompts your muscle and fat cells
to let glucose in

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:30.777
and jump starts the conversion
of sugar to energy.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:33.672
The degree to which a unit
of insulin lowers the blood sugar

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:37.335
helps us understand something called
insulin sensitivity.

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.992
The more a given unit of insulin
lowers blood sugar,

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:43.115
the more sensitive you are to insulin.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:47.549
If insulin sensitivity goes down,
that's known as insulin resistance.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.763
The pancreas still sends out insulin,

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:54.864
but cells, especially muscle cells,
are less and less responsive to it,

00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:57.139
so blood sugar fails to decrease,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.546
and blood insulin continues to rise.

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:03.951
Chronically consuming 
a lot of carbohydrates

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:06.255
may lead to insulin resistance,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:09.214
and many scientists believe
that insulin resistance

00:04:09.214 --> 00:04:13.465
leads to a serious condition
called metabolic syndrome.

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:15.600
That involves a constellation of symptoms,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.205
including high blood sugar,

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:19.033
increased waist circumference,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.156
and high blood pressure.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.465
It increases the risk 
of developing conditions,

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:25.261
like cardiovascular disease

00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:27.384
and type II diabetes.

00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:31.935
And its prevalence is rapidly increasing
all over the world.

00:04:31.935 --> 00:04:37.261
As much as 32% of the population
in the U.S. has metabolic syndrome.

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:40.088
So let's get back to your diet.

00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:44.319
Whether your food tastes sweet or not,
sugar is sugar,

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.338
and too many carbs can be a problem.

00:04:47.338 --> 00:04:49.656
So maybe you'll want to take a pass

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:54.437
on that pasta sushi roll pita burrito
donut burger sandwich.
