of us want to live in a polluted cities
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.670
of us want to live in a polluted cities
or live global warming and I think the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
or live global warming and I think the
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.099
or live global warming and I think the
good news is that the newly developing

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
good news is that the newly developing
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.890
good news is that the newly developing
countries is committed to the green

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
countries is committed to the green
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.400
countries is committed to the green
movement as the West is interior this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
movement as the West is interior this
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.669
movement as the West is interior this
enough but of course in practice that

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
enough but of course in practice that
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920
enough but of course in practice that
global warming for example if you want

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
global warming for example if you want
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.819
global warming for example if you want
China and India to reduce their flows of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
China and India to reduce their flows of
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.299
China and India to reduce their flows of
new greenhouse gas emissions then then

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
new greenhouse gas emissions then then
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.010
new greenhouse gas emissions then then
the West must take responsibility for

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
the West must take responsibility for
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.889
the West must take responsibility for
the stock of greenhouse gas emissions

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
the stock of greenhouse gas emissions
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.000
the stock of greenhouse gas emissions
that the West has put up in the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
that the West has put up in the
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799
that the West has put up in the
atmosphere since the Industrial

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
atmosphere since the Industrial
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540
atmosphere since the Industrial
Revolution but you don't take

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
Revolution but you don't take
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939
Revolution but you don't take
responsibility for the stock and you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
responsibility for the stock and you
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.029
responsibility for the stock and you
only go to txt the new flows they come

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
only go to txt the new flows they come
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560
only go to txt the new flows they come
on they're gonna say China need is a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
on they're gonna say China need is a
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720
on they're gonna say China need is a
come on that's not fair you're not

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
come on that's not fair you're not
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580
come on that's not fair you're not
putting an economic price on what you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
putting an economic price on what you
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380
putting an economic price on what you
put up and you're putting economic price

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
put up and you're putting economic price
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060
put up and you're putting economic price
and what I am putting up and I'd much

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
and what I am putting up and I'd much
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.950
and what I am putting up and I'd much
poorer than you come on let's be fair

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
poorer than you come on let's be fair
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.469
poorer than you come on let's be fair
about this so I think if the West can

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479
about this so I think if the West can
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.320
about this so I think if the West can
accept responsibility for what it has

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
accept responsibility for what it has
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660
accept responsibility for what it has
done do you know create global warming

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
done do you know create global warming
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460
done do you know create global warming
that in China and India will join the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
that in China and India will join the
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.289
that in China and India will join the
bargain too

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.789
well i think that the good news is that

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799
well i think that the good news is that
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.580
well i think that the good news is that
when you in your late comer you don't

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
when you in your late comer you don't
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.950
when you in your late comer you don't
have to pick all technology you can

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
have to pick all technology you can
 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.459
have to pick all technology you can
switch to new technology i mean the good

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469
switch to new technology i mean the good
 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.440
switch to new technology i mean the good
news for example japan as you know is

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450
news for example japan as you know is
 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.240
news for example japan as you know is
one of the most energy-efficient

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250
one of the most energy-efficient
 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.700
one of the most energy-efficient
countries in the world indeed for every

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710
countries in the world indeed for every
 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.419
countries in the world indeed for every
additional unit of GNP that is created

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429
additional unit of GNP that is created
 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.149
additional unit of GNP that is created
china china spends ten times the energy

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159
china china spends ten times the energy
 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.459
china china spends ten times the energy
that Japan does but if you can create

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469
that Japan does but if you can create
 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.340
that Japan does but if you can create
technology transfer from japan to china

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
technology transfer from japan to china
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.770
technology transfer from japan to china
and it is happening by the way you can

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780
and it is happening by the way you can
 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.510
and it is happening by the way you can
progressively reduce the amount of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
progressively reduce the amount of
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.850
progressively reduce the amount of
energy consumption that china does for

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
energy consumption that china does for
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.380
energy consumption that china does for
every additional unit of GNP so i think

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390
every additional unit of GNP so i think
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.899
every additional unit of GNP so i think
it can be done and you can avoid the old

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
it can be done and you can avoid the old
 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.199
it can be done and you can avoid the old
steel mills very polluted and new steel

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209
steel mills very polluted and new steel
 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.509
steel mills very polluted and new steel
mills less polluted all these things can

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519
mills less polluted all these things can
 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.790
mills less polluted all these things can
be done
