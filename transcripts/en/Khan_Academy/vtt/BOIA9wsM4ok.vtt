00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.024
- Let's get some practice solving equations

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:04.044
that involve fractions and decimals.

00:00:04.044 --> 00:00:06.703
And this equation clearly involves fractions.

00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:07.307
Let's see.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:11.173
We have negative 1/3 = j/4 - 10/3.

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:12.252
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:13.494
and see if you could solve for j.

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:16.849
What j would make this equation true?

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:17.650
Alright.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.148
Now let's work through this together.

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:20.994
So what I like to do, I like to isolate

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:22.050
the variable that I'm trying to solve for

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.617
on one side.

00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:25.196
Since it's already on the right-hand side,

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:26.589
let's try to get all the things that involve

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.191
j on the right-hand side, and then

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.689
get rid of everything else on the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.908
right-hand side.

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:32.835
So I want to get rid of this negative 10/3,

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.553
and the best way I can think of doing that

00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:35.992
is by adding 10/3.

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:38.349
Now I can't just do that to one side

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.011
of the equation.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:40.195
Then it wouldn't be equal anymore.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.052
If this is equal to that, in order for the

00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:43.712
quantity to be true, whatever I do to this

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.500
I have to do to that as well.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.240
So I have to add 10/3 to both sides.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.761
I have to add 10/3 to both sides

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.399
of the equation.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.334
And so what am I going to get?

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.656
On the left-hand side,

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:57.117
I'm going to have negative 1/3 + 10/3,

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.835
which is 9/3.

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:00.518
9/3.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.875
And then that's going to be equal to.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.442
And on the right-hand side,

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.135
the negative 10/3 and the positive 10/3,

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:09.062
those cancel out to get a zero,

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.804
and I'm just left with j/4.

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.718
It's equal to j/4.

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.295
Now you might recognize 9/3, that's the

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.059
same thing as nine divided by three.

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:20.579
So this is just going to be three.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.960
So that simplifies a little bit.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.063
Three, let me just rewrite it so

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:24.665
you don't get confused.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.856
Three is equal to j/4.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.317
Now, to solve for j,

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.418
I could just multiply both sides by four.

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:34.834
'Cause if I divide something by four

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.274
and then multiply by four, I'm just

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:37.435
going to be left with that something.

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.558
If I start with j and I divide by four,

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.682
and then I multiply, and then I

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:44.798
multiply by four, so I'm just going to

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.087
multiply by four, then I'm just going to be

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.933
left with j on the right-hand side.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.769
But I can't just multiply the

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.209
right-hand side by four.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.194
I have to do it with the left-hand side

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:52.704
as well.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:53.528
So I multiply the left-hand side

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:54.968
by four as well.

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:56.710
And what I will be left with,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.332
four times three is twelve.

00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:01.469
And then j divided by four times four,

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.710
well that's just going to be j.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.775
So we get j is equal to 12.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.667
And the neat thing about equations

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.014
is you can verify that you indeed

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:11.291
got the right answer.

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.715
You can substitute 12 for j here,

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:17.896
and verify that negative 1/3

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:23.034
is equal to 12/4 - 10/3.

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:24.339
Does this actually work out?

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.879
Well 12/4 is the same thing as three,

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.360
and if I wanted to write that as thirds,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.809
this is the same thing as 9/3.

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.828
And 9/3 - 10/3 is indeed equal to

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:36.685
negative 1/3.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.926
So we feel very good about that.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.407
Let's do another example.

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:46.689
So I have n/5 + 0.6 = 2.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.788
So let's isolate this term

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:51.147
that involves n on the left-hand side.

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:53.248
So let's get rid of this 0.6.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:56.185
So let's subtract 0.6 from the left-hand side.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:57.207
But I can't just do it from the left.

00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:58.298
I have to do it from both sides

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.261
if I want the equality to hold true.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:02.187
So, subtract 0.6.

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:04.021
Now on the left-hand side,

00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:07.481
I'm just going to be left with n/5,

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.419
and on the right-hand side,

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.993
2 - 0.6, that;'s going to be 1.4.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.967
And if you don't want to do this

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:17.209
in your head, you could work this out

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.905
separately.

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:22.375
It's going to be 2.0 - 0.6.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:26.090
You could say, "Oh, this is 20/10-6/10"

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.493
which is going to be 14/10, which is that there.

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.607
Or if you want to do it a little bit

00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:32.115
kind of the traditional method,

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:32.939
you say, "Oh, I'm trying to subtract

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.690
six from zero, let me re-group."

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.153
That's going to be a 10.

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.803
I'm going to take from the ones place.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.556
If I take a one from the one's place,

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.263
and that's going to be equal to 10/10.

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:46.956
10/10 - 6/10 is 4/10.

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:49.552
And then, bring down one one

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:51.315
minus zero ones is just one.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.338
So it's 1.4.

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:53.592
And now, to solve for n.

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:55.379
Well on the left have n being

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.761
divided by five.

00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:57.631
If I just want n here, I can just

00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.314
multiply by five.

00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:01.937
So, if I multiply by five,

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.073
five times n divided by five

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:06.512
is going to be just n.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.172
But I can't just multiply the left-hand side

00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:08.659
by five.

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.612
I have to multiply the right-hand side

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:12.120
by five as well.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.093
And so what is that going to get us?

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:18.550
We are going to get n = 1.4 x 5.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.114
1.4 x 5.

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:24.007
Now you might be able to do this in your head,

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.328
'cause this is one and 2/5.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:28.222
So this thing should all be equal to seven,

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:29.824
but I'll just do it this way as well.

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:33.736
Five times four is 20.

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:35.117
Re-group the two.

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.659
One times five is five plus two is seven.

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.658
And when I look at all the numbers

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:40.957
that I'm multiplying, I have one digit

00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:43.312
to the right of the decimal point.

00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:44.614
So my answer will have one digit

00:04:44.614 --> 00:04:45.972
to the right of the decimal point.

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:48.954
So it's 7.0, or just 7.

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:52.009
n = 7.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.820
And you can verify this works,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.600
'cause seven divided by five is

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.076
going to be equal to 1.4, plus 0.6

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.635
is equal to two.

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:01.913
Let's do one more example.

00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:02.829
This is too much fun.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:03.537
Alright.

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.811
0.5 times the whole quantity

00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.668
(r + 2.75) = 3.

00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:11.106
Now there's a bunch of ways

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:12.187
that you could tackle this.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.347
A lot of times when you see

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:14.416
something like this, your temptation

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:17.249
might be, "Let's distribute the 0.5."

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.966
But that makes it a little bit hairy,

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.532
'cause 0.5 times 2.75.

00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:22.971
You could calculate that, and

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:23.935
you will get the right answer if you

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:24.690
do it correctly.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.896
But a simpler thing might be,

00:05:26.896 --> 00:05:29.833
well, let's just divide both sides by 0.5.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:30.727
That way I'm going to get more

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:32.666
whole numbers involved.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:33.895
So if I divide.

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:34.592
Remember, whatever I do to the

00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:35.451
left-hand side I have to do to the

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:36.995
right-hand side.

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:38.806
And the way my brain thought about it was,

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:40.385
well, if I divide by 0.5 on the left-hand side

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.895
I can get rid of this.

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:43.844
And if I divide by 0.5 on the right-hand side

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.609
I'm still going to get an integer.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:47.931
Three divided by 0.5 is six.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.324
It's the same thing as three divided by

00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:50.253
a half.

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.610
How many halves fit into three?

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.386
Six halves fit into three.

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.011
So this going to be six right over here.

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:56.812
So these cancel out.

00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.342
And then this is going to be equal to six.

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:02.866
So the whole thing is simplified now

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:07.576
to r + 2.75 is going to be equal to

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:11.007
is equal to six.

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:12.527
And now to just isolate the r on the

00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:14.222
left-hand side, I can substract

00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:17.066
the 2.75 from the left.

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.970
But, like we've seen multiple times,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.521
I can't just do it from,

00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:24.692
I can't just do it from the left.

00:06:24.692 --> 00:06:26.628
I'm having, my brain is malfunctioning.

00:06:26.628 --> 00:06:27.545
2.75.

00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:28.741
I can't just do it from the left.

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:30.378
I have to do it from the right as well.

00:06:30.378 --> 00:06:31.841
2.75.

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:36.141
So this simplifies to r,

00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.149
this simplifies to r,

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.761
Is equal to -- what's six minus 2.75?

00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.363
Well if you want to do it in your head,

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:44.139
six minus two would be four,

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.240
and then if you take 0.75 from that

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.003
it would be 3.25.

00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:49.758
If you don't feel comfortable

00:06:49.758 --> 00:06:50.779
doing it in your head, we could just

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:51.499
write it out.

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:56.151
6.00 - 2.75,

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.113
be careful to align the decimals

00:06:58.113 --> 00:07:00.215
and then I've got to do some re-grouping.

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:02.200
Let's see, I have zero hundreds,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.570
trying to subtract five hundreds.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.812
That's not going to work out.

00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:06.170
So I try to re-group from here,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.936
but I have nothing here.

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:08.213
So let me re-group from here.

00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:09.130
One one.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.454
Let me take away one of these ones.

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:11.475
I'm going to have five ones.

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.439
And then that's going to be equivalent,

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.994
so I have five ones here,

00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:15.596
and that one one I took away is going to be

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.268
ten tenths.

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:18.928
And then I can take one of those

00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:20.310
tenths away.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.269
So I'm going to have nine tenths.

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.149
And that's going to be ten hundredths.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.030
And now I could subtract.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.679
Ten hundreths minus five hundredths

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.594
is five hundredths.

00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:31.612
Nine tenths minus seven tenths is

00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:32.797
two tenths.

00:07:32.797 --> 00:07:34.213
My decimal is going to be there.

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:36.175
Five minus two is three.

00:07:36.175 --> 00:07:38.032
3.25.

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:39.530
And you can verify that.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.115
3.25 + 2.75 is six, times 0.5 is indeed

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:45.926
equal to three.

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:47.215
So we feel, once again,

00:07:47.215 --> 99:59:59.999
really good about this.
