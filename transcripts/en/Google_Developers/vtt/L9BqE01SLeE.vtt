00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.240
Ever notice how when you're
searching for funny movies

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510
or cake recipes,
you click on a link,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.980
you look at these suggestions,
and you're like, meh.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.967
So you go back.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.050
You click on another link.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.466
You look at the
suggestions there,

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.420
and it just takes forever.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.970
It's a bit annoying, isn't it?

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.630
Why is that?

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.290
Because what you're
searching for is things.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.670
And, in fact you're
getting links.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.460
What if instead you got
organized visual results

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.430
to help you spot the thing
that you wanted right away?

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.710
That would be neat, right?

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.810
We thought so.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.930
So for this type of
category queries,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.800
we're changing Search to show
more things and fewer links.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.380
I am Mariya, and
these are Rich Cards.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.630
Rich Cards are building on
the success of rich snippets.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.560
They present
categories of content

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.810
in beautiful visual
carousels that you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.330
can scroll left and
right with images

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.410
and other interesting
information.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.050
As a developer, it's
a great opportunity

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.250
if you present your
content in this way

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.980
because you can stand
out in the results

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.030
and attract more
visitors to your site.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.530
You also take up
more space, and you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.160
can add more elements
from your on-page content

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.110
to the Search Result page.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.040
Today I'll show you how to
get your things into Search

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.980
for users who are
looking for them.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.930
So how does this work?

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
To get your content
displayed as a Rich Card,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.680
you need to add
schema.org and JSON-LD

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.050
to the relevant
bits of your site.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.560
First, you need to find out if
your content matches the Rich

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.180
Card verticals.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.580
Verticals are listed
in the gallery.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.980
We've built up screenshots.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.200
We have code samples.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.330
We have different examples.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.380
So you can browse there.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.580
You can have a look and
see what actually matches

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.120
what you have on your site.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.280
And then also, each
code sample has a link

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.190
to the Structured
Data Testing tool

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.200
so that you can tweak
the code in real time

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.340
and see what happens
to the examples.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.460
After you've figured
out which vertical

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.370
is most representative of your
content, what you need to do

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.580
is find the essential
things to mark up.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.690
Each type of Rich
Card has fields,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.380
without which we cannot
display it in Search.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.260
So, for example, for recipes,
that's name and image.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.916
But you can add more fields to
make your cards richer and more

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.540
attention-grabbing
than everything else

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.570
that we show in the
Search Results page.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.360
Again, for recipes,
you can add calories.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.920
You can add preparation time.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.990
You can add ingredients.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.950
And you can even add ratings.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.740
So here, side-by-side,
you can see the basic card

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.340
with only name and image marked
up, and then an enhanced card

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.450
with ratings and
preparation time.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.350
So you can see yourself
which one you would click on.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.420
Now let's get down to
business and add some markup.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.650
We recommend using JSON-LD
because it's an easy format

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.470
to use, especially if
you're using a Tag Manager.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.550
It saves you tweaking
time when you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.430
have to change the source
code of individual pages.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.266
But, of course, your
implementation on your site

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.140
will depend on the type
of content management

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.430
system you're using.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.670
Once you've got
your initial markup,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.990
you can test it in the
Structured Data Testing tool,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.840
and you immediately
see any errors,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.950
like missing fields
or syntax issues.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.050
Input either the markup
of a URL or the page with

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.080
marked up content into the
Structured Data Testing tool.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.860
If there are any errors, you
will see them immediately

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.180
in the tool UI.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
In our case, there's
a missing image field.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.120
Once you add the
missing image field,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.370
then everything
checks out, and you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.580
can use the Preview
function in order

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.590
to see how this Rich
Card will actually

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.340
appear in search results.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.060
Once you're happy with the
final state of your markup,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.185
you need to deploy it across the
different pages of your site.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:43.810
One easy way that
I'm going to show you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.920
here is to use
Google Tag Manager.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.860
But, again, depending on
how your site is set up,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.870
you might have to
use other approaches.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.490
So, in our case, we go
to Google Tag Manager,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.797
we create a custom tag, and then
we input the JSON-LD in there,

00:03:59.797 --> 00:04:01.250
in the space for the tag.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.040
And after that you
can pick if you

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.830
want to deploy it as across all
the pages of your site or just

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.350
a specific set.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.150
You can pick individual
pages, or you

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.440
can use regular expressions
to catch specific patterns.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.500
And once that's
ready, every time

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.540
your page loads,
Google Tag Manager

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.930
will also load the
necessary JSON-LD

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.300
so that you have the structured
markup on each of your pages.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.450
So now you've done
all the markup.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.520
Your pages are
getting processed.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.740
What do you want to know?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.530
You want to know what you're
getting out of this, right?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.750
So the place to go to find
this out is Search Console.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.050
Search Console is
a free tool that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.200
knows all the stats
about how your site is

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.120
doing in Search, including your
Rich Cards, if you have any.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.420
First, you have to verify
that you're an owner,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.830
and then you will
see every detail

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.560
that we know about
your Rich Cards,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.240
including how many were
indexed, how many have errors,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.310
and how many are just fine.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.170
So one good question
to ask yourself here

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.230
is, the ones that are indexed
and reported in Search Console,

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.450
are they approximately
the same number as the one

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.090
that you originally
marked up and submitted?

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.820
If not, then you might have
an issue with discovery.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.260
Meaning that Google can't
find all of your pages

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.600
and process them.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.530
One way to solve this is
by submitting a sitemap.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.220
A sitemap is
basically an XML file

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.940
which has a list of
the URLs that you

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.460
want to submit to
Google for discovery

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.000
and has some metadata
about each URL.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.700
So you can easily generate
this with a third-party tool

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.790
and then upload it
through Search Console.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.160
And this will help
us find out about all

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.710
of your pages that have markup.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.760
Another issue that
you might encounter

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.920
is that we're not showing
some of your Rich Cards

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.923
in Search because
they have errors.

00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:51.070
And I'm talking
here specifically

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.930
about the required
fields that are missing,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.730
or maybe the syntax
is wrong for them.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.960
So we'll show you all of
those in the same report,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.730
in the Rich Cards report.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.300
And you can see them grouped
first by markup type,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.780
and then by error type.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.560
So you can drill
down, pick a category,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.990
and take a few examples.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.370
Then you can examine the code.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.320
Each URL has a direct link to
the Structured Data Testing

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.380
tool, where you can tweak
the markup, fix the errors,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.670
and see exactly how you need to
change this across your site.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.490
As you deploy to fix and we
start re-indexing those pages,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.690
you'll see the number of
errors in the Rich Card report

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.660
go down, down, down as
we're re-indexing each page

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.240
and adding more Rich Cards.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.840
So now you know how to
keep track of coverage

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.930
and also how to
get rid of errors.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.020
The next and the more
interesting question

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.792
is, how much traffic are you
getting from all these Rich

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:48.230
Cards?

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.060
So another place that you can
look in order to find this

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.050
is Search Analytics
Report in Search Console.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.790
And we've added
there a filter that

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.140
allows you to look
at only the clicks

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.790
and impressions
specifically for Rich Cards,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.500
and here's how to
filter down to that.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.930
Now, here you'll
find information

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.690
on queries, impressions, clicks,
average position, top pages,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.890
anything you want to know
about how your Rich Card

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.730
content is doing in Search.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.050
This is also a
really useful place

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.700
that you can derive data
for finding opportunities

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.650
to grow your traffic
and attract more users.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.380
One thing that you can do is
compare your Rich Card queries

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.560
and impressions with
everything that you get

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.710
for known marked up content.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.020
And maybe you will identify
some portion of your content

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.600
that you can mark up and
make it even more attractive

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.390
in search results and
that way get more traffic.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.700
Another thing that you
could do is also go back

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.330
to the Rich Cards Report and
look at your enhanceable cards.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.250
Those are cards where you've
done correctly all the markup

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.410
for the required fields,
but you could do some more

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.040
and mark up more fields to
make the cards even more

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.660
eye-catching.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.770
So having that and
then comparing it

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.120
to the query information
in Search Analytics

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.190
can help you see where it's
worth the effort to invest

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.190
a little bit more in marking
up different types of content.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.830
So now you know
what Rich Cards are,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.650
how to implement them,
how to debug errors,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.150
and how to keep
track of the traffic

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
that you're getting after they
start showing up in a search.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.000
If you want to find out
more for specific verticals,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.205
including the examples
and the code snippets,

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:32.354
you'll find everything
on the Developer Site.

00:08:32.354 --> 00:08:34.520
And once you've done all
the work to implement them,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.940
you can keep track of how
you're doing in Search console

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.750
after you verify your site.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.450
Thanks for watching,
and good luck.
