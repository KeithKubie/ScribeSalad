Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W. N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Okay. From the top. You Ready? Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:13          Hello. How are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:16          We're going to start things off today with this lady, Zelda Gamson. Come to our little spot to beautiful. Thank you. She's 80 years old and these days Zelda lives a quiet life by the sea on Martha's vineyard. Did you have some coffee? She visits with her grandkids, does some gardening. We have a bird feeder and it is the bird show of the world, but life for though wasn't always so calm back in the 60s when our story begins, she was a very different kind of lady. She even went by a different nickname, just z.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Okay. I was a smoker 30 years. I started when I went to college in 1954 first it was just a cigarette here or there, letting the bad girl out a bit and then I got hooked really and I couldn't stop. Went to graduate school, smoked, got my dissertation, smoked, got my degree, smoked in somewhere in the fog. She meets. Hi My friend Mary. Also a smoker. Loves Smoking, made me feel very elegant. We were very good friends. We were part in the year,

Speaker 2:          01:21          early sixties of the Congress on racial equality together. They'd organize protests. We would demonstrate in the two of them would even go under cover to fight housing discrimination and the backdrop to all of this social change.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Smoke. Yeah. You got it. I mean, our houses were filled with these ashtray. How much were you smoking at that point? Probably smoked a packet of day. I was aware smoker than Mary and I was sometimes up to two packs a day. Wow. You know, I had kids, I was pregnant, um, while you were pregnant. Guy Did. Wow. Yeah. I feel so guilty about that. So at a certain point, Zelda and Mary decide they want to stop. Yeah. No. Mary who had never been as badly addicted to Zelda. It wasn't easy. It was agonizing, but eventually she's able to do it. Zelda now I thought sometimes that I could stop and so I would over and over, she throw out her cigarettes. Okay. Done. But then, then I'd be around somebody with cigarettes. Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:23          F any reason that you'd give yourself cancer? My kids this smell, the fact that I could die, you'd always lost out to the urge. And I'd always start smoking again.

Speaker 3:          02:37          And this is how we'd go resolve failure, resolve failure. Okay? So this is not the most unusual situation in the world. But the question you want to ask right now is like, how do you get out of this? You know, you want to do something, they happily, but then another part of you says, no, I don't want to do that. So if you against

Speaker 4:          03:00          you, what do you do? I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, and today I'm the little deals that you make when you are stuck with yourself. Okay? So before talking with Zelda, just so happened that I had went with Adam Davidson, one of the planet money guys to visit, uh, this fellow Nobel prize winning economist named Thomas Shelling me. You're the first to know who's written a whole lot about the seemingly simple idea of commitment, arranging it so that you can't compromise. I'll give you an example. Here's the one from ancient Greece, Xenophon, the Greek who, uh, was being pursued by a huge army of Persians, had to make a stand on a hillside and one of his generals said, I don't think this is a good location to make our stand. There's a cliff behind this. There's no way we can retreat if we need to. And Xenophon told his general exactly.

Speaker 4:          03:57          Welcome the cliff. In fact, he said, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna March our armies so that their backs are directly to the cliff. That way the Persians will know that we can never retreat. We're bound to fight to the death. You're really binding yourself. You're not binding the other side. Yeah. It's attempting to influence somebody else's choice by restricting your own choice. But then we asked him, what if your adversary isn't on the outside like the Persians, but rather it was you. [inaudible] how do you do with Xenophon? Did to yourself? Yeah. I, uh, I began smoking when I was 17 years old. I, I did quit several times,

Speaker 5:          04:35          but I always say I back. Ooh.

Speaker 4:          04:44          But he did tell. He did give us some suggestions. One in particular, there was so awesome to use your favorite words. So a diabolical yeah, that we just didn't think anyone would ever do it. Oh, that is until we met Zelda. Yeah. Fast forward a few decades,

Speaker 1:          05:03          1984 Marion Zelda now live in different parts of the country. I happened to be going to a conference in Vermont and Mary picked me up at the airport, right. And I was smoking when she picked me up, which was curious because nobody smokes anymore. She said, why Celta are you still smoking? And Zelda said, yeah, and don't tell me to stop. I was very belligerent. Yes. So I went to the conference and smoked and where they guilty cigarettes. No, they were delicious. But what Mary said was starting to worm its way into her brain. Are you still smoking? Still Smoking, still smoking. And when she dropped me off at the airport, I said, okay, Mary, as if she had been putting pressure on me, which she wasn't at all. If I ever smoke again, I'm going to get $5,000 to the Ku Klux Klan. What did she say? $5,000 to the Klu Klux Klan, correct?

Speaker 6:          06:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:11          this was shelling suggestion can work, but he didn't think anyone would ever do it.

Speaker 1:          06:16          $5,000 to the Ku Klux Klan. It just came out of my math. Huh? You know how horrible they are, right? Sure. So heinous. But

Speaker 3:          06:25          her and Mary made a deal. A pact. If Zelda smoked, she'd have to tell Mary to send the KKK her money,

Speaker 1:          06:32          take it out of my savings or something. And you were really serious. You were going to do this. Yeah, but I have to say after I made this pledge to marry under my breath, I said, but I can't be responsible if she smokes again. What if she smokes again? If she smokes again? Who's the she in that sentence? Me You. What does that mean? Well, that means that a part of me, the part of me that was smoking and that might pick up smoking again was an alien part. You're saying you are two people at that moment? Yeah. And she xe didn't really want to stop smoking. She, she, yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:21          After the pact, Zelda says that often when she would fall asleep, I would dream of myself smoking and she'd wake up in a terrible sweat reach for her cigarettes. But every time she says this other thought, we just rush into her mind. The KKK robes, burning crosses, lynchings, Gosh, she'd throw the cigarettes down. I could. The idea of them having her money,

Speaker 1:          07:44          I can't even imagine. It

Speaker 3:          07:51          sounds like you really backed yourself up against the cliff.

Speaker 1:          07:53          I did.

Speaker 3:          07:56          Zelda had found a thought that was hotter than the years

Speaker 1:          08:00          and she didn't smoke again. Never again. Nope. That was it. Cold Turkey.

Speaker 7:          08:09          Mm.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Look at this. There's a picture of me on a cruise that bill and I took your sheet. Yes. It's a profile picture of me. Look at the cigarette. I [inaudible] gorgeous there. See, that's the best picture ever taken of me.

Speaker 7:          08:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:29          now if we are many people on the inside, and we've talked about this on the show before, how like our brain is literally divided into these camps that sometimes wrestle, right, fight. Well, the problem, I think the problem is according to Thomas shelling, is that these cells exist simultaneously. We're never at the table together. The one who's in charge never confronts the other. I guess that makes it hard to compromise, although you know there

Speaker 4:          08:56          is another way to think about the problem. Things that are offered right now have so much more power than things that are offered in the future. Oh, this is David Eagleman. He's a neuroscientist and he says, you know, really you could think about this whole thing as a battle about time. We'll make all sorts of very poor economic decisions now versus leader if something is offered right now versus later. When you look at the neuroimaging, it becomes clear that there are different parts of the brain that are, that are battling this out in the now parts are waste. Trunker yes. Here's the key. What she's doing in the case of the cigarettes is she's saying, I know that I want to win this longterm battle, but I'm having a heck of a time doing it. But if I can make the longterm plan tied into a different immediate feeling of disgust, then all I have to do is have the discussed battle, the the desire. I see. So she's, what she's done is she's turned this battle into a present tense battle on both sides. I want a cigarette now versus I hate the KKK now. Precisely. It's a now versus now thing. And I think that's the only way we ever win these longterm battles is to give them some sort of emotional salients some reason why they matter to us right now. Otherwise it'll never work. And there are any number of ways of doing this.

Speaker 3:          10:11          Here is how Thomas shelling did it, 1980 gather my children together and I said I quit and that they should never have respect for their father again. If I returned to smoking any never. He never did. And that was it for him.

Speaker 7:          10:31          [inaudible].

Speaker 8:          10:31          The thing I like about about those two stories is that like there's the case where like, okay, say you've got these sales battling in your head, you've got the now part in the later part and the later parts week. Yeah. In this case, the later part found a way to trick the now parts, and this has a name, this kind of approach. It's called the Ulysses contract in the Elliot. Make that the out thing. There's a moment where you list these in as men have to sail past the island of the sirens and you list these nos. If they hear the siren song, they're dead. Sailors were so attracted to these melodies that they would steer towards them and crash their ships into the rocks and die. So on his way there, before the music started, he came up with a plan. He had his men lash him to the mast with ropes so that he couldn't move and he had them fill their own ears with bees wax. And he said, no matter what I do, no matter how, I'm just sticky waiting or shouting or acting like a crazy man, just keep rowing. Just keep going. And so when they got to the sirens

Speaker 7:          11:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:33          Ulysses, he goes nuts and he's screaming and yelling and telling the men go towards the women. We don't want to pass this up. And of course the men have bees wax in their ears. They're not swayed by the siren song because he had planned for this, the present tense Ulysses, by using his men and the rope had literally bound the future to the

Speaker 9:          11:54          mast cause he knew that guy would be weak.

Speaker 7:          12:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          12:02          we can just move off the ocean for just a moment. Gun, get out of your ocean

Speaker 5:          12:09          radio. What a weird medium. Anyway, what is the bargain that you strike isn't just about something, you know, very, very small. And now like this puff of smoke, what if it's a deal that you have to do that will decide what you're going to do for every day of the next 40 years? Yeah. What then?

Speaker 9:          12:30          Well, this brings us to a story from our producer Pat Walters. Ready? Okay. Set it up. Okay. Okay. I'm in Chinatown. About a year ago, a corner of Hell and ah, my friend Jenny posted something on Twitter. It said, overheard. I flipped the coin and I lost my life.

Speaker 7:          12:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          12:50          I flipped a coin and lost my life. Yes. And what's Twitter? Yeah, I mean she, she actually heard someone say this? Yeah. She was just like, she's a reporter. She was just chatting with the guy and he s and he said he said that to her. I flipped the coin and I lost my life. Wow. What was the context I, while she was getting a massage in Chinatown. And how would that phrase come up in the middle of a massage? I don't, I honestly don't know. But she's a reporter. Did she, did she ask you to say, get your hands off me, man, and tell me the story. I don't know exactly what went down, but I asked her what the situation was. She said that she basically didn't know anything, but she just heard that she heard it and she told me that it was at this place that was like either at one of seven different addresses that she gave me. So I just wondered around, do you know if some place around here called health trail a massage place has no idea. No. Wandered around to several different addresses and eventually I found this tiny little storefront. It a little sign on

Speaker 7:          13:49          the feet kind of hidden.

Speaker 9:          13:53          Oh, you're one those [inaudible] my son and a found the guy. What that is. You said the thing, hi. Hi. How are you? I'm okay. His name is Dennis Dennis. And you just asked him how you, tell me about this coin flip. Can you tell me, can you, so when did this happen? How bout about four years ago? I was 26 and my brother was uh, 21. Both of them had gone to college, Dennis for photography, his brother for art, joy. And they come out of school with these big dreams in new places, meeting New People, making a live and making money. But that hadn't really worked out. Yeah, I know Jeff for me, they're having a hard time finding jobs and they ended up living at home with their dad. Yeah, with my dad. So basically I just staying home to picture and my brother, he's just working at a restaurant, low life eater.

Speaker 9:          14:40          So this is basically post-college flail. Yeah. Like they're stuck. Stuck in the middle of the road. That's what happened to us. And one day their dad comes up to them and says, look guys, one of you guys follow me. I need one of you. I don't care which one of you, but I need one of you to take over the family. My phone is getting all this design I eat above you. Come out or one of your [inaudible]. So one of them now has to carry on his, his thing. Yeah. What is it that I do here in this massage parlor? Yeah. Since we're not interested. Yeah, Nita was what really want to do it. That's kind chi will Dennis's little brother because touching people food, it's some kind of disgusting. Right. And there's always a hairy guy or like some girls like busted toes. Disgusting and annoying.

Speaker 9:          15:23          Facing your father for 24 hours. Seven days a week. Yeah, a little more than I can take. Like I love my dad, but he just don't want to follow your dad's footsteps, but the dad says get over it. It's about family, keeping the business alive, keeping the technique he has alive in the whole channel town. I don't think any massage place or any therapy place will have my father. To me, it's a special kind of thing. Yeah, it's this like deep tissue. Acupressure is painful type massage. I don't know. Have Jenny told you? That is really painful. Anyhow, they're sitting at home and this question is kind of like silently hanging over them for days and weeks till one day that a friend's place having some tea, talking about their dad and Dennis looks up at his brother and says as make a bet. Let's do the TV thing.

Speaker 9:          16:10          The weather. Let's see what the what the what the TD say? Well, Dennis says, when you're drinking loose tea, the Chinese, right, you put the leaves right in the bottom of your cup and you pour the water over them and usually the leaves float up to the top flat on the surface of the team. But every now and that every tank company buys the tips is floating and the rest of the body is inside of water. So like the stem sort of? Yeah. And then the leaf is hanging down. Yeah. You mean like every so often instead of the whole leaf being on the top of the water or the leafy part just falls to the bottom and just the tip of the stem is touching the surface of the water. Almost like it's hanging down from the surface of the water. And this is rare.

Speaker 9:          16:49          Yeah. So when you get that estimate is good luck. It is that like a traditional, fun old people that was doing it. That's how we understand it. And we was kid. So we just decide, okay, whoever, we get that, whoever gets the most lucky tea leaves, we didn't. Well, when you're out, you don't need to. My Dad, whoever lost, follow my father foster, they trusted their whole future to this. Yeah. It was like the spur of the moment thing. Why didn't we, yeah, we didn't really plan anything from pipe people to flip a coin. Like they can't figure out which way should they go. So this is flip a coin. When you pull all the hot water in, they will like rolling out loud like a small tomato. Is it spinning? And then once it's done, each cup has a layer of tea leaves on the surface and Dennis notices. So whoa, look at it that he'd gotten one, one piece that was like, wow. As that incredible. Then you looked over to his brother's cup.

Speaker 6:          17:55          Oh my God.

Speaker 9:          17:57          Way More of these lucky leaves. It was pretty obvious. Yeah. He lost and it wasn't even close. No. Do you remember if he was like angry or looks like he was deep in thought. I don't think like, damn, this is like as the worst thing in my life.

Speaker 7:          18:18          Uh,

Speaker 10:         18:18          and it basically was because now he was bound by these tea leaves to go and work for his dad.

Speaker 9:          18:26          What happened? Did you first come here to work? I don't feel like touching anybody foot, so he forced me to touch the foot. Did he have to like grab your hand and go? It says sit down, take off his shoes without washing his feet. Okay. That's kind of discussed to myself. Is this telling me to try to work on that? His Dad eventually said practice on your friends. Oh, is that Oh god, no. They still hate me right now for giving them all the pain. When that was gone, do you remember like what was going through your head? Were you like, what am I doing? Like did you feel like you're on the wrong track? Well, um, I don't know how to explain. Here's the funny thing. Dennis says that there came a point up to a month, look on my a fit. I don't feel disgusting anymore.

Speaker 9:          19:12          I'd feel kind of like it. He likes it. Yeah. I don't know why. It's just like making me, ah, it seemed nice to work on people. Um, I don't know how to explain. I just stopped fall in love with this job. Yeah. I don't know. How's that happen? I just, I working here seven days a week, save, become part of my life, wake up in the morning, come here, work, go home, sleep, come in with. So as those become part of my five in, when I've got a day off, I don't know what to do, where to call and just staying home. Let me come back over here and work as what happened. It's just that I think that's how foreign love is. You don't know has to happen when it's happened. It just happened. It was a good loss. I was thinking, I left this job.

Speaker 10:         20:06          So it sounds like you made this deal with fate and he just got lucky. No, no. Kai has a slightly different

Speaker 9:          20:15          on the whole thing. Well, so if he had one, would you have had to do it? No, no, no, no, no. Kai says the whole Tealeaf deal was really just about Dennis. I think at that point in the back of his head, he wants to do it. Just an excuse. I think he was just looking for a sign. I'd have to ask him, I guess. And when I did ask Dennis, he didn't really agree with his brother. Well, it's just a, how you say his own, but he didn't entirely discrete either because I wanted to do it just like this kind of, I'm using my brother to push me to work from right there.

Speaker 4:          20:49          That's what, what do you mean by that? I don't think he wanted to make his own decision. It might be better just for, for my dad, but I don't want to face him. So if my brother just pushed me, okay. I'll be facing him as that could be what happened

Speaker 7:          21:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          21:04          so we just needed a push. All right.

Speaker 7:          21:07          Would you be thing to do?

Speaker 4:          21:09          No. You know, when you think about it, why is that wimpy? Well, I mean, he did. He wanted to be a Missoula, you know, and he didn't know what he wanted. Yo, he knew and he set up his brother to make him do it. So it's very, no, if you call it wimpy and call it Wimpy, I call it a powerfully wimpy, muscularly wimpy. Meaning what? What does that mean? Meaning that, oh, I got one for you. I'm going to lay this. You ready for this? Maybe the new strength is understanding your own wind penis. What do you think about that? Ooh, I just thought I just tied you into a philosophical, not right there, buddy. You're going to be thinking about that one for years. I'm thinking about it. I'm over thinking about it in take it in the complexity. Can I speak now? Yeah. David's going to say something. This is who we are. I mean that's the reality on the ground. We're just weak. We need help and I actually think this gives, this gives us a new way to think about and understand virtue.

Speaker 6:          22:04          I think it gives us a much richer view of human nature.

Speaker 4:          22:12          Thanks to Pat Walters, our Chinatown correspondent, and to Thomas Shelling who's written many, many books including the strategy of conflict and to Adam Davidson from the amazing planet money team and to David Eagleman whose latest book is incognito.

Speaker 6:          22:27          We'll be right back.

Speaker 11:         22:28          Hey guys, it's David Eagleman radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. Hi, this is Yolanda Gamson calling more information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org Radiolab is produced by w n y c and distributed by NPR. And this message.

Speaker 4:          22:56          Hey, I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. And today today we are trying to figure out how to make a deal with yourself when most of you doesn't want to do what the rest of you wants to do. Right? And we've talked about these kinds of deals when it comes to avoiding the sirens, quitting smoking, figuring out what to do with the balance of your life. Now we're going to change things a bit. Let's say instead of being an addict, let's say you're just a writer. Yeah. And you want to be inspired. You want the words to come. And this is very typical situation. They're not coming. No. No words to the question is in that kind of situation, what kind of deals could you make with yourself to get the words out? This is, uh, this is fanciful. My friend Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and the writer, um, he made a deal, which frankly find this kind of

Speaker 5:          23:45          astonishing [inaudible] bargaining with creativity. I will tell you, although I probably shouldn't, uh, the first book I wrote, Migraine, um, was very obstructed. And then by obstructed he means he just got stuck. Yes. Day after day, he, she tried to write something down and it just didn't come and I was getting desperate on the matter. And finally on September the first of 1968, I said to myself, you have 10 days to write this book. If it is not done, then you commit suicide. Whoa. And under the imagined threat, which seem to tell the me in a way because you're, you're what the other half of you thought that the first half of you meant it. Yes. Did the first half of you mean it? I don't know.

Speaker 8:          24:43          Right. But the result of this was that after months of, of stewing and not doing anything, I started work. And what started as a, as a fearful task soon became a joyful task with this own momentum. And suddenly he had this feeling that there was something inside him. Some engine inside me, a wonderful associative engine, which we've sourced together, brings unexpected things into acquisition. It had kicked into gear and just kind of pulling things out of him and putting them right there onto the page.

Speaker 5:          25:19          I felt the book was being dictated to me healing. Uh, I, I, I was passive. I was the bridge. I was the transmitter. Um, and in fact I finished the book a day early. That's a strange way to kick yourself in the pants. I have to say, yeah, well I'm, for me a deadline sometimes is felt homeless literally as such.

Speaker 5:          25:44          This is not an easy way to go to work every day. I wouldn't think [inaudible] can make bank. And it's like that definitely not too often. And it will have a cost. Oliver, of course, did that only once, but the story he told got us thinking, is there a bargain that you can make with yourself, your creative self? It's somehow avoids this terrible cost. Yeah. That as long as this led me generally in front of you late. Okay. A woman who just does it differently. I have this fascination with trying to figure out how you can live a lifetime of creativity without cutting your ear off. You know what I mean? And who is, who is that? Oh, I'm Liz Gilbert and well just something a little bit now. Which Liz Gilbert, you, I'm the Liz Gilbert who wrote the book called the pray love. I guess that's the way she described myself cause that's how my obituary will read, eat, pray, love in case you were born under her rock or raised by wolves is one of the most popular books ever, ever, ever in the world.

Speaker 5:          26:40          It became even more popular when the book became a, and guess who played Liz? Liz Gilbert is remarkable. Julio Roberts, her courage and the way America's sweetheart and the success was great, but she says, you know, it was also kind of frightening because there she was back at home under the same old blank page with a new question. How will you ever outdo what you did last time? Suddenly she's back where Oliver was obstructive. She didn't think that that success was going to be there the last time. So was the last time of fluke. Do I even have another big book in me? Dangerous Recipe for madness madness. But then she thought back to a conversation that she once had with,

Speaker 7:          27:19          nope.

Speaker 5:          27:21          Who Tom Waits. Tom Tom, wait, that's sort of [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          27:29          where this all began was that I was, I was a journalist for GQ and I did an interview with him and he spoke about the creative process I think more articulately than anybody I have ever heard. Um, and he was talking about how every song has a distinctive identity that it comes into the world with and it needs to be taken in different ways. And he said, you know, there are songs that, that you have to sneak up on, like you're hunting for a rare bird and there are songs that come fully intact, like a dream taken through a straw

Speaker 7:          28:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          28:04          and there are songs that you find little bits of like pieces of gum underneath the desk and you scrape them off and you put them together and you make something out of it. And there are songs he said that need to be bullied, um, where he said he's been in the studio working on a song and the whole album is done and this one song won't give itself over. And he said, you know, everyone's gotten used to seeing him do things like this. He'll march up and down the studio talking to the songs, saying

Speaker 5:          28:27          the rest of their families in the car, we're not going on vacation. You coming along or not, you got 10 minutes or else you're getting left behind, you know, and he's like, you gotta shake it down. Sometimes lists as that. The interview was maybe the first time she

Speaker 2:          28:40          thought of inspiration as, as, as an it. And I remember feeling my own center of gravity shift and thinking, wait, you're allowed to talk to this thing. That the source of her ideas was outsider. That she could get some distance from it, maybe negotiate with it, even fight with it instead of beating yourself up all the time. Right. And this story that I loved, that he told me about where his artistic anxiety ended and his sort of new artistic liberation began as when he's driving along the freeway in Los Angeles and like eight lanes of traffic one day. And this little fragment of a beautiful song comes into his head

Speaker 7:          29:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          29:23          and he has no way to record it. He's gotten no pencil, he's got no tape recorder and he's in eight lanes of stressful trap.

Speaker 7:          29:27          So come [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          29:32          And he immediately starts to feel all the old pressure that he's felt his whole life of, I'm not good enough. You know, all the artistic struggle, right? I, I can't do it. I'm not good enough. I'm lose it. I, it'll haunt

Speaker 12:         29:42          me forever. And then he just backed off from it.

Speaker 2:          29:46          And instead he established that negotiating distance between him and the melody. And he looked up at the sky and he said, excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving if you're serious about wanting to exist, I spend eight hours a day in the studio. You're welcome to come and visit me while I'm sitting at the piano. Otherwise leave me alone and go bother Leonard Cohen. Oh, that's very bold. It is. I think that's what she wants. She wants you to push back and she wants you to set some terms and some boundaries.

Speaker 12:         30:18          She doesn't want you to go to the Leonard Cohen Concert two years later and very, very kind of you to come to this. Now, this idea that somehow the creative act comes from outside you. You get a visit from a somebody, this isn't the new idea. This is a very old idea. You know the Greeks would call it the Muse

Speaker 6:          30:43          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          30:43          The Romans called it the ingenium the genius, which was an interesting idea because it's not the way we use genius today. Right? Today we say that a person is a genius and back then they would've said a person had one. Um, and again it's the separation so that the, the creative person has this externalized collaborator. So this is a tinker belly kind of a thing. It sprinkles you. It has little wings. And I think it depends. I think it depends on the process. I mean it's got a lot of names because it takes a lot of forms, right? And, and we're talking about all this as though these are actually kind of believe it cause I don't think it would work otherwise. But I kind of do believe that the world is being constantly circled as though by Gulf stream forces ideas and creativity that want to be made manifest and they're looking for portals to come through and people, and if you don't do it, they'll go find someone else, you know?

Speaker 2:          31:36          And, and so you have to convince it that you're serious and you have to show it respect and you have to talk to it and let it know that you're there. Like for the last few years, there's been a novel that has been sort of stirring in me and I haven't had time to give it the attention it wants me to give it. But every day I talk to it and I have a little conversation with it and I say, listen, I'm in April, I will be with you. I want you to stay. Don't let me wake up and read in the New York Times that someone else wrote you. Um, stay here with me. I'm coming. This feels like this, like a golden retriever or something. You have to keep petting it. Actually, that's probably as good a metaphor for me as any because I would relate to that being half golden retriever myself and, and liking dogs.

Speaker 2:          32:19          That's great. And when you say you talk to it and it's golden retriever reform, that's our producer pat Walters. Like, do you actually talk to it? Yeah, I do. I talk. That's why I have to work alone in a quiet room because I talk to it all the time and I ask you questions. I say, what do you, what is it that you want me? What do you want me to be doing here? Because you seem to be to what I'm trying to do here. Like show me, give me a clue. Um, like I, uh, the title of eat, Pray Love was the last thing that came of that book. And the book was about to be published in it, had any number of ridiculous stupid titles that I'm going to tell you cause they're so embarrassing and they're so not what that book was meant to be titled.

Speaker 2:          32:56          And I ended up writing an email to all my friends and saying the subject heading was title search. And I said, my book won't tell me its name and can you, can all of you help me? And a friend of mine wrote back and said, um, if you're going to talk to it like that, it's not going to tell you anything. Um, so I really did that night, talked to and sweetheart, listen, I respect you, I love you. I honor you. I have defended you these last few years. I want to bring you into the world, but you have to tell me your name and the next day, eat, pray, love.

Speaker 13:         33:32          Oh, and you know it because it's, I know the difference between something I thought of and something that I was given. I can, I can tell the difference. She says sometimes it's the whole scene. Sometimes it's just a word, maybe a phrase. And then you have the job to make it into something. Wait. But if I,

Speaker 2:          33:51          if I say to you, [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         33:58          any yellow water,

Speaker 2:          33:59          so you can write that down. Two roads diverged in the yellow one, then you're done. Do you know how that phone got written? No.

Speaker 2:          34:06          So he was working for, I may be exaggerating this cause I tend to, but I'm going to tell it my way. How I heard it. Uh, he was working for months and months and months on, on what was going to be the greatest epic poem of his life. It was the biggest challenge that he was taking on. He was going to be up there with the masters, with this [inaudible] named the prison. We talking about. Yes, this would be Mr. Frost. And, um, and, and, and he worked on it for, um, you know, forever and ever. I mean, perspiration, perspiration, perspiration. Right. And it was 20, 30 pages long and it was, I don't know what the meter was, whatever it was. It was the most ambitious thing he'd ever done. And it was arduous and it probably had sweat all over it. Um, put it down, went to sleep, woke up, sat down and wrote two, two roads and all of a sudden in one setting, this tiny, perfect, immaculate thing was created that had nothing to do with what he had just done.

Speaker 2:          34:57          He earned it. I think the angels reward people who are at their desk at six o'clock in the morning working right. And he earned it by showing his, his intent to be a great poet. And they said, okay, cool. You showed your intent, that thing you just wrote with crap, I'm going to give you this one, here's your reward. So except for that, it's a great story. And I liked the idea and I feel like, I really do feel like when they see me working, they take pity on me. Um, and they say, you look, you're showing a real commitment to this. You've been up at five o'clock every morning for the last year working on this novel. I'm just going to give you the ending, you know, um, or I'm, I'm going to spare you from that really bad idea. You just having, you know, I always think of it as like Henry Ford's famous line about how creativity is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration, which is a very mechanical way to divide it up. But it also assumes that those two things have equal weight, that they're the same quality. Right. I agree with 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration, but it's 99% oyster 1% Pearl

Speaker 8:          36:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          36:01          you can't even compare the, the matter like it's a bargain to get 1% inspiration.

Speaker 8:          36:08          You know, it's, it's a miracle.

Speaker 7:          36:22          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          36:26          I could get with the muses sort of. What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          36:31          Well, I think it's interesting that you can hear at one point she says that she believes, I actually kind of believe in another point she says, it just makes a good story. It's a great story. And I like the idea so you can hear her negotiating with the idea.

Speaker 4:          36:45          Yeah, of course. She's a little bit between the two thoughts, which is interesting. I mean, you know, you know, a serious neuroscientists would tell you that it's all in your unconscious and it's all, all you all the time. But another way to think of it is, uh, is to say that you got a gift and, and therefore it's not all about you. When it's bad and it's still about you when it's good, but it's not all about you. It's just this business of all. Okay. This is a form of well organized and modesty. It's a nice phrase. I'm just going to, it's going to go with that. Yay. It's time for us in our ferries to go to break.

Speaker 15:         37:28          This is drew Lewis from Salt Lake City. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information about Sloan had www dot Sloan

Speaker 4:          37:44          [inaudible]. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Today we are continuing our search for ways to outside oneself, solve the problems going on inside oneself. Ooh, nicely done. Now thinking back to Oliver Sacks, the story that we heard at the top of the last segment, [inaudible] this notion that you, one might use terror to, uh, to broker a relationship with one's creative self or one's perhaps addicted self. Let's take that idea and kick it up a notch. All right, let's see. Two notches. Oh, I mean for that we go to the reporter, Gregory Warner, reporter with marketplace though marketplace was nice enough to let us borrow him for this story. He's a budget [inaudible] right now. You understand that? I have no idea. Gregory. None. Whatever. What is you're about to tell me? I am. I have been purposely in the dark.

Speaker 16:         38:36          Yes. Unless of course you have already told me somewhere. No, I'm sure you've forgotten that. So Greg, just set it up. How did you find out about this? I heard about it, um, while washing dishes. Actually, my wife was telling me about a friend's ex boyfriend who was an alcoholic friend's ex boyfriend. Friend's ex boyfriend is an alcoholic in Russia. He's, he's, he's Russian. And um, this man didn't want to drink anymore. And so the treatment that he got was to have a capsule surgically inserted under the skin. Some kind of chemical compound that if he drank again, this capsule would explode into his bloodstream and kill him. What wish he was given the bomb? Yeah, that would be triggered by his bed. Behave. Exactly. And that's all you know. That's all I knew. Well, but wait a second. Who would, who would do this? Who, who did he go to? Well that's, that's what I, fortunately I was on my way to Russia. And what was the question in your mind was what's this real check check? So I get to Moscow and I hired a fixer interpreter. Her name is [inaudible]. It's hard to tell what street I'm on right now. She had found this clinic that does this treatment. We go in through the gate, call this area, lungs of Moscow, the lungs of Moscow, because the wind is coming through this area and we arrive at this sort of large house, kind of a drab exterior. They usher us immediately into a waiting room.

Speaker 1:          40:15          [inaudible] there's a fish tank. It's their plants. Pretty Lush. So it wasn't very hospitaly. No, not very hospitaly very, very comfortable. Guys are really lazy fish. And then there's your question

Speaker 16:         40:30          where summit, hi, my name is so head doctor, his name, slow, very slow, yet just slow Davita. He greets us. We become into his pretty spare office. It's been described vouchers love. He looks actually exactly as you'd guess a a Russian psychotherapists and oncologist. But look, I have no guessing for that. Maybe I take that back. He's got a point t beard and he's got a bulbous head, bright, bright green eyes. And this man is a doctor and this man is absolutely a doctor, no of which there are degrees on the wall. She was a [inaudible]. Usually this capsule is inserted into the buttocks as well. It therapy actually is. That's why it was cold at torpedo because it is placed in a person's body and kept the way a torpedo and assemble marine is kept in your butt or under the skin. And if the person drinks, does it make them sick or does it make them die? [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         41:40          he said, you know, it doesn't, no [inaudible] kill you. One can never exclude death, but of course the doctor is not going to kill his patient. Which employee but personal feel. It's very bad, extremely bad. So still to know you will have a type pains, almost unbearable. [inaudible] accelerated heart rate less than an hour. And the shortness of breath, everything. Nausea, vomiting, throbbing headache, visual disturbance, mental confusion come pre and circulatory collapse. And these medicines can remain in the body from a short period of time, two, three years for instance. But the pill is real well, so that's exactly what I asked them next is the capsule in some way a placebo yet it's not a placebo, placebo, vpg and [inaudible] if he don't believe I can give you a pill and that will be like coding for one day. Okay. Wait a new freaking pair. I would, um, can you give me a pill that would last um, three years [inaudible] at least with this [inaudible] if you agree, drag rate, what the phrasing. I'll tell you what I was thinking because at this point I have it off and I had been talking for like two hours and he hadn't let me out of the office. I had asked to see the procedure room. I had asked to see the torpedo until I realized the only way to actually see it was to agree to have it done. [inaudible] a patient. Yeah. You were ready. Yeah. Let's go. We leave the office, we go down a hallway and up some stairs.

Speaker 16:         43:37          There's no lush carpet, no fish tanks, no plants. That someone's screaming. Yeah. Ah, it's a psychiatric clinic. Meanwhile, my translator is getting worried. She's like, you know, if you meet a friend in Russia, you have to go drinking with them. I said, I'll die. And so he leads me into this room. It looks just like an exam room in a doctor's clinic. There's this sink in the nurse heart defibrillator machine. You can, I see the, uh, and he just immediately ignores me, kinda picks up some instruments, washes his hands. I see the torpedo. He then turns and he says, yes, there is a cart. He does a stabbing motion with his foot, his hand. This is how deep it is. [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         44:35          so he's going in? Yes. Just before he's going to actually cut open my butt. And he does this with everybody. He gives you a pill, which is the same drug, but it only lasts for one day. And then he tests it. He tests it. How does that work? Can you take a pill and he'll give you a drop of [inaudible] as he puts just a drop of vodka. Small job of on your towel drop off. Once that drop of Baka hits my tongue, I will feel all those symptoms. You had sinks. You can't pre in January a personal pills. He's telling you [inaudible] sometimes people are so scared that urinate right here. Maybe a, uh, can I take it at home? How much of the [inaudible] so I, uh, actually no, I don't want to take care of it. Chicken dog can't do it. I'm not, I'm not strong enough. He at that point realized he had one w and he shows me the pillow. This is what is inserted in the body. Really. This is it. It's so little little

Speaker 8:          45:44          mm about the size of a, uh, a tech Tech Tech Tech. Okay. The Ticketek torpedo, it comes right off the lips. It turns out that inside that little pill is a very real drug. It's called [inaudible] and it was, oh, it was actually a substance that was used in the rubber industry. This is Eugene, Eugene Reichel. I'm an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. He's writing a whole book about these treatment programs in Russia. He says this drug was discovered back in the early 19 hundreds and they found that the a workers in the rubber industry were unable to tolerate, um, alcohol. This is kind of folk knowledge in that in the industry for awhile it was like, don't give that guy a beer. He works in rubber. I know I'm in bay. Basically what they sell fram does is it creates a kind of toxic byproduct. They still for in blocks a certain enzyme from being absorbed and it causes all these very real symptoms. So you'd get a little bit poison. Yeah. And is this used outside of these Russian clinics? It is, but, but there is a big difference only in in Russian clinics do they have these long acting capsules, long acting form of diesel for Ram, which is not

Speaker 17:         46:51          something that exists. The subdermal implants basically, they don't actually release any dice slow fram after, you know, the first week or something like that.

Speaker 16:         47:03          So, so if I had taken that drop of alcohol, then I would have felt all those symptoms, but it doesn't last for longer than a week.

Speaker 17:         47:10          Yeah. So effectively that's basically a scam. I believe scam is the word you're looking for.

Speaker 16:         47:19          Mainstream is this, I mean, is this the equivalent of like guava pills or whatever they are where you can find them in like vitamin shops, but they're kind of fringy.

Speaker 17:         47:27          That's the thing is that is not

Speaker 4:          47:30          fringy at all. You know, over 60% of the treatment methods offered by Russian Nikon narcolic six zero 60 like more than half. Yes. Yes. And Eugene emailed later to say he was just being conservative. The real number is closer to 80%

Speaker 8:          47:45          mm. Wow. Coded, which happened 15 years before he died. My own translator, honor her uncle went through this procedure when he, when he was drunk, he didn't care before. I remember my grandmother crying all the time because you could go fishing and then disappear for a night. And this guy, textbook alcoholic, everybody knew that he was drunk. He went through this coding procedure. It's called coding because it wasn't the drug form that goes in your bud. It was actually a a, it's a kind of hypnotic suggestion that goes into your brain. But, but same general procedure doctrine, the white go, he was doing something with his hands, some, some gestures in front of [inaudible] face. And then he Sergei closed his eyes and he had a feeling that, uh, some wicked, uh, force was pulled out of his body.

Speaker 4:          48:45          Had this guy finished high school. This guy was an aeronautical engineer. Oh. My sense is that, that there's some people who suspend their disbelief because at some level they have the motivation to do that. But if it only lasts a week, why wouldn't people like after two weeks or a month or six months, just start, just take it sip and realize, oh, nothing happened and they just start drinking again. Cause some people do. Some people do. First of all, there are lots of people who do go to 12 step therapy and who Google could do go 60% 60% you said that 80% no, no, no, no. I know, I know it's, it is very prevalent and very popular. So no, there's to this story. We thought there's something Russian about this. Yeah, I know that it's got a sense of submission and belief, all sort of asserted by a higher authority with no way to check or to second guess ev.

Speaker 4:          49:34          Even the way in which we're repression is used instead of acceptance. It just feels very rushed and wouldn't work in Manhattan, wouldn't work in Los Angeles, wouldn't work in Chicago. But I think that here's the distinction in North America, the prevailing understanding of addiction is that it's a disease of denial. It's not about the substance as much as it is about the fact that you're kind of out of touch with some kind of truths about your self in your condition. That's a radically different understanding of what the problem is. Um, then the one that underlies the Saturday interrupt as a skeptical American, I got to say there is something about this treatment, this Russian treatment that makes sense to me. Seems to me when you're in the grips of an addiction, you've already lost control of a certain part of yourself or a part of yourself as already in control that shouldn't be. And you can try and kind of love that part and make peace with it and hug it and do the 12 step thing. Or you can

Speaker 16:         50:28          destroy it, you know, build a wall around it so that you don't have to deal with it. That's what [inaudible] is so good at imprisoning that part of you. [inaudible] religious [inaudible] skeptic. Do you know what a panic attacks of panic are? [inaudible] struck? Struck is fear. Fear. There is strong fear. Do you understand what it is? Strong, very strong fear. This is when [inaudible]. Dr. David have told me that he had trained as a psychotherapist during the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 80s he says to me as to where we just imagine a situation where a soldier sees his friend on the road. He has mines c tied to his body. He has no ears, no eyes. His legs are cut. It will be his look normal, but he's still alive. According to all rules, this kind of person should be taken to the hospital, but after seeing this, every soldier says to his friend, if you find me in this kind of condition, tortured by the Mujahideen Godly kill me, just watching go to these tortures yesterday, we mean you can drive a person crazy beatitudes. Is that just something he was having you imagine? Are you saying that's something he saw? That's something he saw. Would he learn from the way in which these mujahideen were fighting? This war is that you can, you can kill your enemy. That's one method of warfare. Or you can strike fear into the heart of your enemy and kill not only that soldier, but terrorize his whole Putin a stolen [inaudible] and what rules this world's through fear.

Speaker 8:          52:16          If he could make you afraid he could change here, this coding, it completely changed his life. This is her uncle. Yeah. He became very, uh, I had a feeling that he sort of discovered the life for himself. Once again, he started gardening. He started picking mushrooms. Do you think coding worked? I guess? Yeah.
