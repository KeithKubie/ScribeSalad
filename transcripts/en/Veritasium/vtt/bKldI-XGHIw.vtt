00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.900
can we? Can we really touch something?
So like, can I touch the camera?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.320
The question of can we really touch something
is a great one.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.880
Well let's say we have two electrons, I imagine
what we mean by touching is that they come

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.510
in and they actually physically touch.
Now one of the problems is an electron actually

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.869
has zero size, as far as we can tell, no volume.
So these would be infinitely scaled up.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.780
So how do the electrons actually interact
with each other? Well they interact by exchanging

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.760
a particle. In the case of the electron it's
a photon that they exchange. So as they come

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.620
in a photon is passed from one to the other,
which changes the momentum of both of them

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.210
and pushes them off. So they never really
have to touch in order to interact with each

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.309
other, to exchange that particle and therefore
change their momentum and change directions,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.870
experience a force. So I guess well what do
we mean by touching something? Every time

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.129
we touch something we are exchanging force-carrying
particles with it and that is touching.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.960
If photons are both quanta of light and the
force carriers of the electromagnetic force,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.670
does that mean that photons propagate magnetic
fields? And if so, why can't these photons

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.101
be seen?
Well that's because the photons are not real

00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:18.619
photons they're virtual. Now this is a bit
of a problematic topic and one which I hope

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.040
to address in detail in a coming episode.
The basic idea with virtual particles is you

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.009
can't detect them. They are particles that
are there but you cannot directly detect them.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.131
And they may not obey all of the laws that
we force real particles to adhere to. For

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:39.880
example there is the Einstein energy momentum
relation E squared equals m naught c squared,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.650
squared, plus p squared c squared. And a virtual
particle doesn't necessarily need to obey

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.119
this equation. So you can't really detect
it because if you did it would have to be

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.219
a real particle and then you can't disobey
those equations like that. So this is something

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.720
that I'll delve into in a future episode.
Who are your top three most inspirational

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.170
scientists? I'm gonna take Einstein, Feynman,
and Tesla. Who are your most inspirational

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.280
scientists? Hey Derek, I guess a question
that's been on the minds of a lot of us for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.959
a while now is who would win a chin-up competition
between you and Henry from MinutePhysics?

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.680
Now I wish this was a hypothetical but we
actually did this on the tube in London so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:59.230
roll the tape.
I thought it would be Henry - that guy is

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.629
ripped!
So in school they say atoms want to have their

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.379
outer-most electron shells full, and will
willingly become ions in order to achieve

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:14.410
that. Well, why? And why do the shells have
the electron-holding capacities of 2,8,18,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.879
32 and so on specifically?
Let me deal with the electron shells first.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.770
See if you accept that electrons are not only
particles but also waves, then if they are

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.700
waves bounded to a nucleus that means that
they must be standing waves. So you may be

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.159
used to standing waves on a string - they
don't seem to move anywhere, they just wiggle

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.379
back and forth. Or you can have standing waves
in two dimensions on a plate. And what you

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.630
notice is that these standing waves take on
particular stable patterns so bound electrons

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.780
are just standing waves in three dimensions
and the mathematical solutions are called

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.340
the spherical harmonics. Because of the number
of stable configurations you can have with

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.359
growing amounts of angular momentum there
are different amounts of electrons which can

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.140
fit in every shell and that goes with Pauli's
exclusion principle which says "no two electrons

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.920
can have the same state," because they're
Fermions. So the whole point is what we're

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.219
looking at is standing electron waves and
there are only certain of them which are stable,

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:18.760
which are possible, which you can see in analogy
to say vibrations in a plate. So why do atoms

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.570
want the outer-most shell to be full? Well
this kind of minimises the energy state of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.550
the whole system, so let's say you had two
atoms. if you actually removed the electron

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.480
off one atom and stuck it in the other so
that they both now had full shells, you would

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.100
find that the total energy is now lower than
it was before when the electrons were in their

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.531
previous configurations so the point is it's
just like a ball rolling down a hill. It's

00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:49.040
that everything in nature "wants" to go to
the lowest energy state.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.670
Why are the available frequencies of light
continuous? I keep hearing that atoms absorb

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.830
and emit photons of particular frequencies
which correspond to the energy levels of their

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.380
electrons. So where do all the other colors
come from?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.860
OK it's true that atoms emit particular colours
due to electrons jumping between certain allowed

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.430
orbits around them but we get different frequencies
of light when these atoms bind up into molecules

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.950
or even solids or when they form plasmas because
then the charges are flying around all over

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.630
the place.
And in those cases, there's no longer these

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.690
clearly defined energy levels for the electrons
where they can jump and only produce certain

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.910
distinct colours. Then there are whole bands
of electron energy levels so we can get a

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.900
real range of colors. So that's what we see
from the sun or from hot solids, so that's

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.720
why we get a continuous range of frequencies
because the electron bands of energy allow

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.530
virtually any transition.
Derek, can I get a Veritasium shirt so I can

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.630
look nearly as cool as you?
It's funny you should mention that, Grey,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.180
because Veritasium actually now has a T-shirt.
So if you want to get you can click on this

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.670
shirt. go ahead, click on it, or click on
the link in the description.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.750
For your viewers interested in pursuing a
science career, what field do you think is

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.740
going to be the most exciting in the coming
centuries and why?

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.610
Look I can't say I know what fields of science
are going to be important in the coming centuries

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.151
but at least in the coming decades, I would
put my money on genetics. You know if you

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:17.590
think about the human genome project, that
took about ten years and a billion dollars

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.030
to sequence one human genome. And within the
next couple of years you should be able to

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.930
do it in a week for a hundred bucks. So the
pace of growth is simply extraordinary in

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.840
that field of science and that's why if I
were going into science now I might select

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.250
that kind of field. Have you every downloaded
a book from audible.com?

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.510
I have actually downloaded a book from audible.com
and I was listening to it on my most recent

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.830
trip, which was handy because I was on this
plane that didn't have an entertainment system

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.310
and I was also listening to it in the airport
and I found it really a good way to pass the

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.650
time. So if you're interested in downloading
audio books then you should probably try audible.com

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.800
And I have a book to recommend to you. It
is Richard Dawkins' book the Selfish Gene.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.050
I read this a few years ago and I found it
really enlightening, but I have a bit of a

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.301
spoiler alert. Ah, well not really a spoiler,
more of a clarification on the title. I mean

00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:15.190
it sounds like a book about a gene for being
selfish, but that's not what it's actually

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:23.210
about. What it's about is the fact that genes
themselves act in selfish ways and this I

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:29.400
found a kind of enlightening revelation because
if the genes are acting selfishly then the

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.510
organism can act altruistically if you get
what I mean. So if you haven't read that book

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.930
or listened to it you should definitely check
it out and if you want to download it for

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.520
free you can, just go to audible.com/veritasium
You know I really want to thank audible.com

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.960
for supporting me in this, my five hundred
thousand subscriber video. It really means

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.480
a lot to have their support so I can keep
going and hopefully get another five hundred

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.740
thousand.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:21.720
One last question, Derek, I'd like to know
how, obeying the laws of physics, you ever

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.120
managed to put these jeans on.
