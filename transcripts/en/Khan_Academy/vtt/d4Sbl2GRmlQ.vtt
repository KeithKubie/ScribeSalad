00:00:00.606 --> 00:00:02.545
- [Voiceover] So we're asked
to pick any three pairs

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:04.982
of corresponding input and output values

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.175
of the following function, and
fill the table accordingly,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.804
and if necessary round our
answer to the nearest 0.1,

00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:14.683
and our function is
defined as if I input a t,

00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:17.248
what I'm going output
f of t is going to be

00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:19.187
negative two times my input,

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.648
negative two times t plus three,

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:25.247
and so we can just pick
three arbitrary t's

00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:26.803
and input them into our function

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.042
and see what the function spits out.

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:32.723
We could go picking some
really easy t's to compute.

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.929
So for example, if t is equal to zero,

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.704
then f of t, we could do this in our head,

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.655
but it would be negative
two times zero plus three.

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:45.642
Well, negative two times zero
is just going to be zero,

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.160
plus three is just going to be three.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.140
If t is one, well then
f of t is going to be

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.598
negative two times one, I'll
write it in parentheses,

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.897
plus three.

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:04.820
Negative two times one is negative two

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.734
plus three is one.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.116
This is one.

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.159
And just for kicks, we could
even put in negative one.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.224
Once again, I could
put in crazier numbers.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:18.415
I could have put in 2.30789,
but that would just be

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:22.013
more computation, might as
well pick some easy numbers.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:23.755
We're just trying to get
a feel for this function.

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:25.216
Depending on what I
input, what do I output,

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:27.458
and I'm allowed to pick my inputs.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.115
So if it's negative one, it's going to be

00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:35.032
negative two, so t is now
negative one, plus three.

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:38.891
So negative two times negative one is

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.782
positive two plus three is five.

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:45.032
So it's gonna be positive five.

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:48.237
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:51.034
So this says choose any three
points on the following graph

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:53.171
of y is equal to g of
x, and fill the table

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.574
so each column represents a point.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:58.487
If necessary, round your
answer to the nearest 0.5.

00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:00.508
So once again we could see,

00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:02.156
there's a bunch of
interesting points here.

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:05.059
If x is equal to zero, what is g of x?

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:07.379
This is y is equal to g
of x and we see g of x

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.132
is equal to negative one.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:11.931
Actually, let me make
this a little bit smaller

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.286
so that we can see it all on one screen.

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:16.981
So there we go, so now we should be

00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:19.326
able to see it a little bit easier.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:23.320
So if x is zero, and once again,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.827
I'm just picking zero
because it's easy to see

00:02:25.827 --> 00:02:29.948
that when x is zero, y
is equal to negative one.

00:02:29.948 --> 00:02:32.249
And y is equal to g of x,

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.323
so g of zero is negative one.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.227
See that right from the graph.

00:02:38.227 --> 00:02:40.304
Let's see, some other points.

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:41.675
So we have this point right over here.

00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:45.622
When x is negative one, y,
which is equal to g of x,

00:02:45.622 --> 00:02:49.518
is equal to two, the point
one comma two is on this line.

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:53.860
When x is one, y is two,
and y is equal to g of x.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.505
So g of one is two.

00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.593
All right, let's pick another one here.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:04.215
Let's see, when x is
one, y is negative four.

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:07.991
When x is, sorry, this was
negative one over here.

00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.090
When x is negative one, y is equal to two,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.701
and when x is positive
one, y would be equal

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.871
to negative four, and actually, let me,

00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.171
these are the exact same
numbers that I used last time

00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:20.610
for the inputs.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.577
Let's just see that I
could use these numbers,

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:25.120
but I could pick different numbers.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.639
I could say, let's see this
number, this point over here

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.558
is interesting because it looks like

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.093
both the x and y coordinates are integers,

00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:36.384
so if x is negative three, y is eight.

00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:39.928
So if x is negative three,

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:43.632
y is eight.

00:03:43.632 --> 00:03:45.988
So once again, you should
try to pick some values

00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:50.214
where you can clearly see
what the corresponding

00:03:50.214 --> 00:03:53.093
x and y coordinates are of that line,

00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:55.149
but any of those would be valid pairs.

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.938
For a given input, what's g
of x going to actually be?
