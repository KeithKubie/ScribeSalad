00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:03.169
- [Voiceover] If Arianna
turns the stove dial

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.531
135 degrees to the right,

00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:08.271
what setting will the dial be on?

00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:10.637
So two very important things up here.

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:14.762
First she's turning the dial 135 degrees.

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:16.879
And which way is she turning the dial?

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:19.879
She's turning the dial to the right.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.534
So here's our dial it's facing up.

00:00:23.534 --> 00:00:25.117
This red dial right here.

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.493
Facing up sort of like on a clock.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:32.341
And we're going to be turning
the dial to the right.

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.088
And how far to the right?

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.088
135 degrees.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.507
So this dial will turn until
it's reached 135 degrees.

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:43.529
So how can we figure out if we start

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.438
turning this dial when to stop?

00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:48.224
When it's reached 135 degrees.

00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:52.081
Well, one common way would
be to use a protractor.

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:53.665
We could set up our protractor,

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.204
measure out 135 degrees.

00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.911
But in this case we can't do that

00:00:57.911 --> 00:00:59.448
'cause we don't have a protractor.

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:01.023
So let's use some other information.

00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:03.219
Some other stuff we know about angles

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.792
to see if we can solve this.

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.461
One thing I know, one
angle that we see a lot

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:11.211
is a 90 degree angle.

00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:14.491
And a 90 degree angle

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.786
if we start up at the top like our dial

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.453
and turn 90 degrees,

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:23.533
we're gonna end up with
an angle like this.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.818
An angle where we could put a square

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.814
in the middle and finish the square.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.645
Well it's like a square angle.

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.843
So this is a 90 degree angle.

00:01:31.843 --> 00:01:33.984
So coming over to our dial,

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:38.025
if we start at the top
and we go 90 degrees.

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:41.939
So we start here at the
top and we go 90 degrees,

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.892
we'd end up on the low setting.

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:45.809
90 degrees.

00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.011
But we're not going 90 we're going 135

00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.880
which is more than 90 degrees.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.418
So here's one clue.

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:56.416
We know we're going farther
than the low setting.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.204
We don't know how much farther.

00:01:58.204 --> 00:02:02.182
We're definitely gonna
go past the low setting.

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:04.500
Another angle I could use to help me

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.829
is the straight angle.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:06.829
180 degrees.

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:11.216
If 180 degree angle again starts

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.325
at the top like our knob is currently.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:14.696
Like our dial.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.812
It will go all the way around

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:20.229
until we have a straight angle like this.

00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:23.653
So again, looking at our knob,

00:02:23.653 --> 00:02:25.857
if we started at the top and we went

00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:27.440
around 180 degrees,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.366
we would end up facing
straight down at medium.

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.533
This would be 180 degrees.

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:40.786
So where does 135 fall?

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:44.703
Well 135 falls somewhere
in between 90 and 180.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.727
90 was not far enough of a turn.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.784
And 180 was too far of a turn.

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:54.821
So we want something in the middle.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:57.017
And what setting is in the middle

00:02:57.017 --> 00:02:58.850
of the 90 and the 180?

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.981
Right here in the middle of them

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.148
is medium-low.

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:09.767
So turning our stove to
135 degrees to the right

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.517
will set our stove to medium-low.
