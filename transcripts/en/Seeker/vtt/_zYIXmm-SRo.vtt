Today on "D News,"
we're focusing entirely

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.380
on grown-up stuff.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.040
We're going to talk about how
your gastrointestinal tract

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.800
behaves in an altered pressure
environment-- airplane farts.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:18.230
Her, frequent flyers,
Trace here for "D News."

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.160
Before I leave for
CES today, I posed

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.230
a question to my
"D News" fellows--

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710
do we fart more on planes?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.250
Responses were mixed.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.732
But I'm here to say, I do.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:29.190
If you ever meet
me on an airplane,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.910
you're welcome to
let it fly too,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.500
because science
says that it's OK.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.120
Also, it's national bean day.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.230
So this is apropos.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.080
Let's clear the air.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.880
Flatulence results
from the build up

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.624
and release of
gas in the bowels.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.540
When food makes it through
the small intestine

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.630
and enters the large intestine
as an undigested mass,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.770
the bacteria living inside
of you go to town on it.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.930
As they digest the
food you didn't absorb,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.620
they release gases sort
of like yeast in bread.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
So your farts are
actually collected

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.550
farts of millions
of tiny bacteria.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.950
A study in the New
Zealand Medical Journal

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.025
sniffed out the truth about
flatulence on airplanes.

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:07.150
The average person farts
about a dozen times a day,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.660
but the volume of your
gas will vary depending

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.004
on the air pressure you're
living in, they say.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.420
On the ground, at
sea level, we're

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.710
experiencing the air pressure
of all of that air above us.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350
This is called one atmosphere.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.930
It's roughly 14.7 pounds
per square inch, or PSI.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.380
Our bodies evolved to think
that 14.7 PSI is normal.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.400
And then we put
humans on airplanes.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.560
At altitude, airplanes
have cabin pressures

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.076
so that we don't have to
wear masks to get oxygen.

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:34.450
It varies depending
on the plane,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.510
but it's usually around
11 PSI, basically

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.359
the pressure of about
7,000 feet above sea level.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.900
This lower air
pressure is what makes

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.740
people feel bloated
on airplanes.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.240
The gases in your body expand in
response to the lower pressure.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.390
This includes the gas
in your large intestine,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.700
and then boom, more
farts, or so it seems.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.530
They're less dense, if that
makes you feel any better.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.330
The study goes on to suggest
solutions for farting on high,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.200
mainly you should filter
them out, using charcoal.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.730
Charcoal is essential
for Brita water filters,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.530
but it can also be
used to filter the air.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.110
If charcoal was
introduced into the seats,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.199
the researchers say,
it would go a long way

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.784
to helping passenger comfort.

00:02:11.784 --> 00:02:13.450
Next time you're on
an airplane and have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.180
to fart, just let it go.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.830
Holding it in can cause stress,
it can create physical pain,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.900
and it can damage your bowels.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.070
Letting it go might make
you an airplane pariah,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.120
but at least you'll
feel at ease knowing

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.910
that it's just
lower air pressure.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.950
Thanks, science.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.820
Be honest, though.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.280
Do you far more on airplanes?
