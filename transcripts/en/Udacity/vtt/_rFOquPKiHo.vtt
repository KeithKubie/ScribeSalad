00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This next problem, we're going to construct a basic timing device

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
using a block bouncing back and forth between two springs.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Imagine that we have two springs here, each with a spring constant K,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one attached to this wall over here and one attached to this wall over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In the middle, we have a block that's freedom-bounce

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
between the two of these over this friction less surface here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The separation between the two springs' equilibrium distance is 3 mm as shown here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, right in the middle of the 3 mm here is a little switch which connects to a timer over here,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and every time the block moves over the switch in either direction,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it sends a signal to the timer telling it that one second has passed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
As an extra point of clarification, this switch is 1.5 m from either spring.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I want you to tell me what does this initial velocity V₀ have to be

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
such that every time the block passes over the switch here, a second has actually passed.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In other words, we want to choose V₀ such that the time it takes the block

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to push up against the spring and bounce back to this same spot again will be one second exactly.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can put your answer over here in meters per second.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now there's one thing in particular that might trip you off with this problem.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you imagine that this block was attached to this spring,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then the block would push against the spring in one-fourth of a period,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
return to the equilibrium position in half a period extend outwards in three-fourths of a period,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and finally return to the equilibrium position once again after an entire period.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But keep in mind that the block is not actually attached to the spring,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This point, where the block extends outward

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and is pulled backwards by the spring actually never happens.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In fact, the block loses contact with the spring at this point right here

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
when it has maximum velocity at the equilibrium position.

00:01:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Keep that in mind when you're solving a problem. Good luck!
