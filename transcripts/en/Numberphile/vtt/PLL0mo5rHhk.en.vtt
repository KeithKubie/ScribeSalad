00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.530
JAMES GRIME: OK, so today
we're going to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.820
talk Mersenne numbers.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.080
So we have to pick one of our
Mersenne numbers to exemplify

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.900
the category.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.220
Now, Brady always makes me do
this, so I've decided to pick

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.660
31, because by the time
you watch this

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.330
video, I will be 31.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.090
So it's a nice personal
number for me.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.700
So 31 is our example of
a Mersenne prime.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
So a Mersenne prime is a prime
number to begin with like 31.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.800
31 is a prime number.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.190
A prime number is, as you
probably know, a number that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
can only be divided
by 1 and itself.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.500
The first few prime numbers
are 2, 3, 5, 7.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.150
31 is a prime number, but it's a
special type of prime number

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.730
because it's one less
than a power of 2.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.510
What are the powers of 2?

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.914
Well, you've got 2.

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:04.110
You've got 4.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.090
You've got 8, 16,
32, and so on.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.730
OK, so that's just 2 times 2
times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.070
That's the sort of thing.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.820
None of these are prime numbers,
but let's have a look

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.070
at one less.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.680
Well, 1.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.940
Now, if I'm honest, we
don't say 1 is prime.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.610
There's a special
reason for that.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.980
But let's have a look
at the others.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.920
3 is a prime number, and it's
one less than a power of 2, so

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.260
that counts as a
Mersenne prime.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.070
7 is a prime number, and it's
one less than a power of 2.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.340
Fantastic.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.390
15.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.940
Now that's not a prime number,
so that does not count.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.090
And 31, there you go,
that was our example

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.850
of a Mersenne prime.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.660
Now, there aren't many of
these Mersenne primes.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.590
In fact, there's only
47 Mersenne primes.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.554
Now, they start off
as 3, 7, 31.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.460
The next one after
that is 127.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.860
So let's have a look
at the next couple.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.550
Powers of 2--

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.340
64, 128, and, well, this is
63, and that's not prime.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.810
But this is 127.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.760
That is prime, so it's one
of our Mersenne primes.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000
They're called Mersenne primes
because they're named after a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
French mathematician called
Marin Mersenne, who was a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.970
monk, a mathematician, and
a musician, and a fan of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.370
alliteration.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.430
His favorite cartoon
was Mighty Mouse.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.880
His favorite film was Mad Max.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.760
So he was in contact with a lot
of other mathematicians

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.180
around the world.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.230
And he was trying to make a list
of this special type of

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.500
prime number, and that's why
they're named after him.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.240
MALE SPEAKER: What are
they used for?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
Are they used by
code breakers?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.270
Are they used to make
better iPads?

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.340
Or are they just a game for
smart mathematicians like you?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.950
JAMES GRIME: Well, prime numbers
are obviously very

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.230
useful to mathematicians.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.570
They're famous, and they're
famous for a reason.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.760
Mersenne primes are a special
types of prime number.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.370
Something very special about
Mersenne primes, they are

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.880
related to the perfect
numbers.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.920
We've talked about perfect
numbers before.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.850
They were 6, 28, 496, 8,128.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.700
They were known by the
Ancient Greeks.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.910
They were given this idea that
they were perfect, unique.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.300
Mersenne primes and the perfect
numbers are two sides

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.600
of the same coin.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.930
Let me show you why.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.290
If I pick a Mersenne prime,
let's call it M

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.570
for Mersenne prime.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.030
OK, so M is our Mersenne
prime.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.360
Times it by M plus 1, divide by
2, and that will give you a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.420
perfect number.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.370
Let me show you.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.380
3 times 4 divide by 2.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.780
That's 12 divided by 2.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.930
That's 6.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.592
That was the first
perfect number.

00:03:55.592 --> 00:03:56.900
OK, let's try the next one--

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.580
7.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.434
7 times 8, divide by 2.

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:05.280
That's 56 divide by 2.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.100
That's 28.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.938
That's the second
perfect number.

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:09.730
31?

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.350
Same thing.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.339
31 times 32, divide by 2, and
that will give you the third

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.382
perfect number--

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.930
496.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.310
And let's try 127.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.122
127 times 128.

00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:30.610
And half it, it's 8,128.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.880
Two sides of the same coin.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.560
Right, so you can help to find
the next Mersenne prime.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.780
It's called The Great Internet
Mersenne Prime Search.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350
A great website with an
unfortunate acronym.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.090
It's at mersenne.org, and
you can try it yourself.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.140
Download the program.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.460
It uses collaborative computer
power to find the next

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.700
Mersenne prime.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.910
MALE SPEAKER: Why?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.960
Why should I do that?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.410
Why should anyone do that?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.110
JAMES GRIME: For the glory.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.110
For the glory.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.360
Because mathematicians will
thank you for it.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.220
Like the perfect numbers,
we don't know if there's

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.220
infinitely many perfect
numbers.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.130
We don't know if there are
infinitely many Mersenne

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.710
primes or not.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.270
So that's another open question,
something that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.260
maybe, hey, you could
work out.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.460
MALE SPEAKER: What's it going
to take to work that out?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.590
How will that question
ever be answered?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.560
JAMES GRIME: It's not
going to be easy.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.670
It's not going to be obvious.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.980
It's going to take a different
way of looking at things,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.810
coming at it from a different
angle, something that other

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.310
people haven't tried yet.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.290
Maybe not your usual school
math, but something else.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.670
Whatever it is, something
we haven't tried yet.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.450
MALE SPEAKER: The man or woman
who does that, what will it

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.940
mean for them?

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.930
If a man or a woman
comes up with that

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.020
proof, what will happen?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.070
JAMES GRIME: If you do you come
up with that proof, you

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.520
will have glory thrust
upon you.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.450
You will be famous for coming
up with such a proof,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.350
something that has eluded
mathematicians

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.980
for hundreds of years.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.810
MALE SPEAKER: Is it something
you can have a hunch about?

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.070
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, I think
technically we would have to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.760
be Mersenne prime agnostic, but
it's definitely something

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.680
you have a hunch for.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.460
Mathematics is done that way.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.060
People think mathematics is a
dry subject, that is logical.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.860
But people have intuition.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.800
They have to pursue
their intuition.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.970
So if you ask me, I would say
yeah, infinite number of

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.580
Mersenne primes?

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.510
Yeah, I would think so.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.760
I might be wrong.
