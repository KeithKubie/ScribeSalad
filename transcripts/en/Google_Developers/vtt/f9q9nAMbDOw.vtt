[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:18.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That was awesome.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.880
Hi, and welcome to "I/O Life.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'm
standing here with Magnus.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.950
Magnus, how are you doing?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.783
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hi.

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:24.610
I'm fine, Timothy.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.570
How are you?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I am really good.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.120
We're in the ML booth.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.610
It's my favorite booth.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.530
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yep.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Don't tell
the other booths that.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.121
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Of course not.

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.722
It's exciting in here.

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
in this sandbox,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.010
we are looking at-- right
now, we're in a track,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.420
and there's cars going around.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.690
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Exactly.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What's happening here?

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.260
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: This is
a self-driving car track.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.270
These are actually
something called Donkey Car.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.230
We'll post the link
later on to these things.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.850
You can build them yourself.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.890
There are full instructions
on the internet.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.380
It's built on Raspberry Pi.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.410
And we put a TensorFlow
Lite model on there,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.469
running [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.260
And then we trained
them around this track.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.992
And they're capable of
going around like this.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.366
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.560
It's amazing.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.230
So Raspberry Pi was just
a supported platform

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.220
by TensorFlow Lite.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.324
So it really opens up
a lot of possibilities

00:01:15.324 --> 00:01:16.490
to do these kinds of things.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.550
So it's really, really exciting.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.758
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, and
this is just so delightful.

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:23.080
I saw them training it earlier
where it's just a phone on it.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360
And he was operating
it with another phone.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.600
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.670
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And then
the autonomous vehicle

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.229
used a model built on
those driving instructions.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.270
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Exactly.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.090
So it takes images when
it's going around the track,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.610
and then it's using those
images to train the car,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.520
so it knows where to
go and also how fast

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.872
to go in each of the
segments of the track.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:43.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.780
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.864
What else do we got
going on in this sandbox?

00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:48.130
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So as we
heard from the keynote,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.260
we just launched a new
version of the TPU, TPU v3.0.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.510
Should we check that out?

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.343
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:01:53.343 --> 00:01:54.460
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Cool!

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Over there?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.240
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's do it.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.770
Wait a second.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.435
I think I see Zak
Stone over there.

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:00.173
Is that Zak?

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:01.060
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do you think
we could get him over here?

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.693
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Zak, come over.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:09.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
this is TPU v3.0.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.130
ZAK STONE: That's right.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.140
This is our latest
and greatest TPU.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.330
Actually, this is just
a part of the TPU pod

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.210
that contains many
boards like this.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How-- how many?

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.960
ZAK STONE: Enough to deliver
more than 100 petaflops

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.651
of computers.

00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:30.150
That's kind of hard
to think about--

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.740
100 petaflops.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.350
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How do you
conceptualize 100 petaflops?

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.750
ZAK STONE: So it's not
quite apples to apples,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.390
but some of the top
supercomputers in the world

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.350
are only doing a few
more than 100 petaflops.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.116
And so we use reduced
precision that's

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:47.490
appropriate for
machine learning.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.940
So like I said, this is
not a direct comparison,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.680
but there are very few
computers in the world that

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.500
can do more than that many
mathematical operations

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.152
per second.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:57.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.870
And we were talking
to Jeff yesterday.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.510
He mentioned that this is
the first liquid cooled

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.120
component in our data centers.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
ZAK STONE: That's right.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.495
To the best of my
knowledge, this

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.600
is the largest-scale
liquid cooling system

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.250
that we've deployed
here at Google.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.583
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's exciting.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.950
And it's really pretty.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.650
ZAK STONE: I'd love to have
one of these in my living room,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.130
on my wall, all over
my house, actually.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.481
That would be great.

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:22.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
a little bit more

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.550
background on what people
are doing or will be doing

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.284
with something like this soon.

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:28.950
ZAK STONE: Sure.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.210
Well, so today, if you look over
here, that second generation

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.700
system, that's a cloud TPU.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.620
Anybody with a GCP
project, there's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.750
no more requesting
quota, waiting in line.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.582
Anybody today can
start up a cloud TPU

00:03:43.582 --> 00:03:45.540
and use one of our open
source reference models

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.300
for image recognition,
for speech recognition,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.180
for machine translation,
language modeling,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.140
even generating images from
scratch, pixel by pixel.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.870
And it all runs on this amazing,
self-contained supercomputer

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.370
here.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.520
That's 180 teraflops over there.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.590
And so that's pretty exciting.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.360
We're trying to make
machine learning

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.000
acceleration affordable and
accessible to everybody.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.610
And then we are just
relentless about pushing

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.760
the envelope of performance
with these new generations

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.649
of hardware, like
you're seeing here.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:17.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome, Zak.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.180
Thank you, so much.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.390
ZAK STONE: Any time.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.579
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
Magnus, what's next?

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.209
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: OK, cool.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.220
Let's go over and check
out an object detection

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.400
robot at the TF Lite stand.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I love robots.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.000
Let's do it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.790
SPEAKER 2: So basically here
we have a TensorFlow Lite model

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.440
running on a Raspberry Pi.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.130
This is a very cheap and
easy to find computer.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.810
And what we've done
with it is we've

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.390
added a servo motor,
or two servo motors,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.040
that can actually point the
camera in different directions.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.460
So the TensorFlow Lite
model detects objects,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.220
and then it tries to
center them on the screen.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.720
So it's like a
virtual camera person

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.920
that's able to keep things
in frame as they move.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.980
So if you take the
apple or the banana

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.050
and you put it in the
frame, it will start

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.107
to actually move the camera.

00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:01.940
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So
what this thing is doing

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.660
is that it's presenting
us with words.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.960
And then it knows
related words by having

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.140
been trained on the huge data
set that puts those words close

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.460
together.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.430
And then we use our brains
to do the association.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.540
And if the answers are
matching each other,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.410
then I'm successful.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.030
Otherwise, I'm not.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And this
seems like just fun.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.060
But what's represented there
is a dramatic reduction

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.030
in the work to build
something like this,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.470
because the associations
are created by a model

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.380
rather than a whole bunch of
people working all those rules

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.000
together.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.210
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.265
And, yeah, exactly.

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:39.030
And these models, they
actually exist pre-built.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.670
So you can actually reuse
one in your own app.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.830
You should definitely
check out a technology

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.430
called TensorFlow
Hub on tensorflow.org

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.100
where we have these types
of models available.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.940
The classical example
for this relationship

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.480
is if you take Paris,
and then you add France,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.770
and then you subtract
Italy, what do you get?

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:03.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Something else?

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.375
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
You get Rome, right?

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Sure.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.830
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Exactly.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.630
And that's how we
calculate the distances

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.050
between these vectors.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.800
So Paris is related to
France in the same way

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.240
that Italy is related to Rome.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, OK.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.856
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:17.390
So I'm playing a game here.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.990
And I need to associate
things with the word

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.600
here and bring it down
into the green area here.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.095
So you can see, I wasn't--

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.280
so school, what is the
association to school for you?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.280
Pupil?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Homework?

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.366
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:06:33.366 --> 00:06:34.020
Pupil is fine.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.520
OK.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.900
Because that's nice.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.720
I took that out.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.670
So what the machine
learning algorithm knows,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.260
it knows about all of
these associations.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.740
So garden is related to hose.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.295
Shoe is related to--

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:48.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Foot.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.620
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Foot?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.270
Yeah.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.020
Good job, Timothy.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.436
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you, Magnus.

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:54.200
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
The newspaper is--

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.790
so what should we do?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.600
"New York Times?"

00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:02.180
Yeah.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.179
It's a newspaper, right?

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:04.646
So I bring these words down.

00:07:04.646 --> 00:07:06.270
And eventually, it's
going to build up.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.630
So I got to get faster and
faster at these things.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.570
Horse, riding?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.090
Riding.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.590
OK.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.010
So let's see here.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.100
We now have hamster.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.480
Hamster?

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.670
Fluffy?

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.230
Fluffy!

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.980
Fluffy worked!

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.040
Yeah!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.230
Motorcycle, fast?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.140
No.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.812
Motorcycle?

00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:29.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Riding.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.445
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Ride?

00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:31.490
Well, yeah, that's right.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.980
Summer, winter.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.660
Hot?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.775
Well, summer, hot.

00:07:34.775 --> 00:07:36.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.484
