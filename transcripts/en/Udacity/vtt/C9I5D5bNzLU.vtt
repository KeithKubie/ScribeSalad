00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.300
So Andy, when you were looking at the

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.120
source code how did, how'd you get started?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.700
&gt;&gt; I probably didn't do the right way,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.130
whatever that is. I just Googled 2048 source code.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.510
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
&gt;&gt; Found myself on GitHub. I felt very confused, but I clicked around

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.850
a bit, found some code, copied and pasted, made some changes and then-

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.196
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:17.610
&gt;&gt; Ta-da.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.600
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
&gt;&gt; Is there a better way I'm guessing?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; yeah. But we'll talk about that a little

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.420
bit more detail later but for now let's just get

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.330
a quick look at the code.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.100
&gt;&gt; Right here in the browser. So since we're in

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.620
Chrome, we can just right click, and go to Inspect Element.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.100
&gt;&gt; And that brings up the development tools.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. This is all the code that

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.960
I had played with in the wrong way. That's cool.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is the, this is the HTML

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.960
here. So that gives the basic structure for the page.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.421
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.917
&gt;&gt; And then over here, we've got the CSS, which

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:50.270
gives the page it's styling, the sort of look and feel.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.270
&gt;&gt;

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.460
Okay. Cool. So, the HTML from when I was going over this. This

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.150
has things like, we have Head, which is the Header and the Body,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.310
which is basically the whole document. And then you keep going, and we

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.760
have, oh that's the Heading. We have Above Game, Game Container and so on.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.330
&gt;&gt; If you just hover over these things, it will

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.230
show you what part of the page that elements refers to.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.190
&gt;&gt; And can I modify this right in the browser?

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.930
&gt;&gt; So if I were to delete?

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.030
&gt;&gt; Yikes, okay, I'm going to refresh cause I don't want to break anything

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.880
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.236
&gt;&gt; Okay so what about what's going on over here?

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:28.422
&gt;&gt; So this is basically telling us you know, what, what color

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.736
things should be. What the, the exact positioning of things should be.

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:32.136
&gt;&gt; huh.

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:34.188
&gt;&gt; So for example, it gives the color for

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:37.090
the background, of the main background of the page here.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.740
&gt;&gt; And what does this mean? I, I see HTML, and I see Body over here. I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.280
see HTML. I see Body here.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this is basically saying this rule

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.790
applies to HTML elements that basically are called those

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.250
things. So anything that starts with HTML or body,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.560
are going to have those rules apprised to them.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, and so if I click on this background thing, and I change it

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.954
to. Oh that is so cool. Okay. Nice.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:09.729
So imagine I am trying to figure out what's going on here.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.940
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.340
&gt;&gt; How should I spend the next five minutes of my time?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.350
&gt;&gt; Just, you know, pull up the page, right

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.140
click Inspect Element, sort of look around the page.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.030
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.330
&gt;&gt; Figure out, you know, maybe like delete some

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.270
things to see what corresponds to what on the page.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.930
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'll give it a shot.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.190
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.461
&gt;&gt; Cool. [SOUND]
