00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
We're going to talk about coin flipping.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.740
Lets say you got two people. You got Person A Person B, right, they're flipping coins.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.660
Let's say one of them is flipping coins and waiting for Heads-Heads to turn up

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.600
right, so they're going to make a sequence of coin flips, and they're waiting for Head-Heads.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.660
Person B, he's doing it and he's waiting for Head-Tails.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.180
So one of them is waiting for Head-Heads, and one of them is waiting for Head-Tails.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.420
Now, what's the probability that you're gonna get Heads-Heads?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.820
Now even Brady would probably know this. What's the probability you get Heads-Heads?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820
Brady: Is it one in four?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.900
Yeah yeah exactly. So it's one in four, and Heads-Tails it's the same, right? It's one in four.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.480
Even though they have equal probability I claim your average waiting time for Heads-Heads

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.060
is going to be longer than for Head-Tails.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.500
Let's do it, let's do the experiment. Let's not just write out mathematical formula.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Let's do it let's go.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm gonna flip this coin. Now this is, we're gonna do an average. I wanna do a long sequence

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.800
and we're gonna see what the average is.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.460
So if I flip this coin, let's say 50 times, is a nice long number.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.260
Then we'll be able to take an average of how long we have to wait for Heads-Heads or Heads-Tails.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Right, so we do this if it... actually this is gonna take me ages, isn't it? So instead of flipping this one coin 50 times

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.460
what i can do is I can flip 50 coins all at once alright

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.380
which I've just done there, OK?

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.160
The First coin is a Tails alright. Second coin is, without looking, it's a Heads.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.000
Alright, next coin is Tails, I'm gonna a sequence like that.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.040
Not even Looking.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.480
We've run out of space we better do another.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.780
Let's make them random.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.720
Right, so I poured them out, I tried not to look at them, so it should be a sequence of random coin flips.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.660
I better write out so we can see what they are a bit better.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:03.060
Tail...Head...Tail...Head...Tail...and a Head and a Tail and a Tail...Tail...Head...Tail

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.440
Alright, we're gonna look at this sequence and we're gonna play the game

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.520
where tossing a sequence of coins.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.960
And we're waiting to see how many, how long we have to wait for Head-Tail.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.900
If i start here I'm looking for a Head-Tail, Oh, there it is. Right.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.040
Alright that's my first Head-Tail there. That was a waiting time of three

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.000
and then i got Head-Tail, then I start agina OK. I do a new game

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.280
I'm gonna look for Head-Tail, and I had to wait one two three four, and there it is.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.580
Now i'm gonna do it again, oh look this one is straight away look Head-Tail.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.380
Now I'm gonna start again. I'm looking for Head-Tail. Ooh this is a long wait here.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.000
And then there it is Head-Tail.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.460
And Head-Tail there...there...there it is. Oh and there's one right at the end as well.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.060
Right, what was the average waiting time. Let's have a look at the waiting time.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.400
So that's about an average wait of 4.5 .

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:03.760
Lets look at the Heads-Heads though. You would have to wait, ooh how long? Ooh this is a long waiting time here.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.920
It happens all the way over here.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.780
There Heads-Heads, which was a long wait. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.740
So you've player a game and it ends when you get Head-Heads. Great, done.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.720
So now start a new game, a completely different game form this point on.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.300
So we'll just start again, oh, but this time notice there the Heads-Heads comes up really quickly. Look at that, it's just straight away.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.540
And now we start a new game OK. So we had a success, we'll start a new game and we have to wait 1, 2, 3

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.280
let's look for our average waiting time for Heads-Heads, OK.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.820
Which is 7, right. And yes, oh look, yes.You have a longer average waiting time for Heads-Heads than you do for Heads-Tails

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.500
even though they have an equal probability, they're both one quarter. Why is this?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.800
You can kind of see what that reason is from this, this sequence.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.840
Because if you noticed when we were doing it, when you play Heads-Tails

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.240
you get Heads-Tails, then you start a new game and you wait for Heads-Tails, and you start a new game.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.180
Heads-Heads was slightly different, when we did it with Heads-Heads look what happened here.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.820
when you have something like this: Heads-Heads-Heads-Heads we have this overlap.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.520
And this overlap isn't counted, we were playing it until we got Heads-Heads

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.420
and then the game stopped. And then we play a new game from that point.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.480
So here we've got a Heads-Heads, that didn't get counted as a Heads-Heads.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.420
So if you look at how many Heads-Heads we've got it should about an equal number to Heads-Tails

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.980
but the overlaps don't get counted. Let's just check.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.380
How many Heads-Tails did we have? Actually we know we got 11, i know for a fact we got 11.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.800
How many Heads-Heads did we have, including the overlaps?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.400
One here, we have two, we have three.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:03.420
So if you actually count up the Heads-Heads we had 9 of them, but only 6 were included in our waiting time average.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:11.260
So this sequence, we were looking at what would happen for consecutive values

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.200
so Head-Heads, Heads-Tails. The same sort of thing would happen with Tails-Heads and Tails-Tails.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.320
We're look at consecutive values, in fact the reason I mentioned this is because

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:30.460
if you remember there was that prime news where they were looking at primes, and the ending of primes for consecutive primes.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.520
This is what they were looking for, they thought if primes were random like coin flips

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.720
I'm going to find this effect.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:45.840
What turned out to be the case is that they didn't find this effect because the primes weren't being random like coins.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.220
If you did this forever, if you had a sequence that went on to infinity the average waiting time then is

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.820
I'll show what that is. It's called expectation or expected waiting time.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.720
The expected waiting time for Head-Tails is equaled to 4

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.560
Which kind of make sense when it's a quarter probability. That does make sence.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.960
And then the expected waiting time for Heads-Heads is longer, and it's 6.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:21.640
So we were close but just a little off. And if you wanted  the expected waiting time for Tails-Tails, well that's 6 as well.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.640
That's just the same idea.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.040
Brady: Audible's ever growing collection of books and other spoken material has now reached

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.940
in the order of 250,000 titles. So no matter what what you're interested in Audible's bound to have

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.360
multiple options for you. Now I spend a lot of time driving, as you can see here, often in the UK's

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.200
delightful traffic and there are few better ways to pass the time than listening to audiobooks.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.360
You can have something entertaining, something educational, or maybe a bit of both

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.860
The choice is yours.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.900
I particularly enjoy books about mountaineering. These titles here about Mount Everest are very good.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.400
I'll put their details in the description, along with this one about K2 which is one of my favourites as well.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.020
And that's just a fraction the the mountaineering books on Audible. I told you they've got something for everyone.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.220

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.760
and then the free trial for 30 days. Our thanks to Audible for supporting this episode of Numberphile.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.740
Maths works, maths just works, it's wonderful that way how maths just works out

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.640
Brady: Every time.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.180
Every time just how you want it to work out. Especially with the power of editing.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.020
Brady: What happened?

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:53.180
What happened, we did out first take and we got the opposite result from what we wanted.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.180
Brady: It's done you

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.640
48 over 11, which is the opposite of what I said.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.120
And we have to film the whole thing again, right?
