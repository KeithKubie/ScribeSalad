00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.847
We've helped Grant a ton throughout his journey building up his glasses wiper

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.766
and nozzle enterprise. He's doing algebra all the time now to solve problems he

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.579
encounters in his business and he knows how to do all of it because of us. He's

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.178
been so successful that he was able to afford new office and he's trying to

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:19.008
decorate his new place with art that reflects his products. Although he has

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.208
different sculptures and paintings and other masterpieces strewn throughout his

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:26.868
new space, one of the things he is most excited about is this fountain that

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:30.932
looks like a giant wiper nozzle. He thinks he's worked out an equation for the

00:00:30.932 --> 00:00:35.028
trajectory of the water coming out of the fountain and then going up, falling

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.189
down on the ground. However, he wants us to check that equation for him. Let's

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:43.003
help him see if it's right. Just like we had with Grant's slingshot a few

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:47.227
lessons ago, let's set up a coordinate plane so that the fountain is positioned

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:51.214
at the origin, just like this. Now, I realized that the fountain is not as small

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:54.695
as its single point on the coordinate plane but for the purposes of this

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:58.471
question, let's just pretend like the entire thing is located exactly at the

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.536
origin. From this position of the origin, the water is going to shoot up out of

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:06.518
the fountain and then fall and end up slightly over to the right. Here's the

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:11.310
equation that Grant came up with. Y equals negative 7x squared plus 14x minus

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.874
10. In this equation, x stands for the horizontal position of the water, at a

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:20.626
given moment, and y stands for a corresponding vertical position for that same

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:25.986
drop of water. So, every drop of water of this fountain should follow about this

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:30.400
equation. Remember, this is just an approximation. We're sort of idealizing the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.476
situation, so just go with it. Now, if Grant is right, then one of the roots of

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:38.454
this equation should be where the fountain is located, at 0. And the other

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:42.536
should tell us where the water lands, over here. In other words, if we saw the

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.826
quadratic equation that goes along with this equation for a parabola, then we

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:51.262
should get those two solutions, those two roots. Let's use the quadratic formula

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:55.062
to see if Grant is right. For now, I'd just like you to simplify the parts of

00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:59.138
the formula that belong in each of these boxes. Just put a number in each spot.
