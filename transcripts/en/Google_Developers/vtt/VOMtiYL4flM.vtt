00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
&gt;&gt; 
So, can you start by introducing yourself

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.710
and telling me about your application and
your motivations for creating it?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Sure, my name is Ryan. I work with
Zagat Survey. Zagat is a fame producer of

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.680
restaurant guides in both prints and online.
Our application today is called NRU, that’s

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.240
N-R-U. It’s developed by lastminute.com.
And it’s available right now in the Android

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.210
Market. The application gives you a 360-degree
view of restaurants that are around you, and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.440
it’s only available on Android.
&gt;&gt; So, tell us about how you chose to use

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.790
Android for this application?
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Absolutely, well, Zagat has always

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.809
been a company that, you know, the strategies
has been, we want our contents to exist as

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.460
many platforms or popular with consumers.
You know, we really like the fact that Android

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.559
is open sourced. And as well, it has the opportunity
to be on multiple carriers. And we think that

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.129
bodes well for getting the application into
as many consumers’ hands as possible.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.890
&gt;&gt; So, when you were developing the application,
did you have any sort of interesting war stories,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.950
things you ran into while you are working
on it?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.350
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Sure, sure. So, you know what, we
created a very unique experience with this

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.390
360-degree first-person view. And one of the
issues that we ran into has to do it if you’re

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.360
looking around you, there might be multiple
restaurants, you know, either one right next

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.350
to each other or one right behind another.
And you end up having issues in terms of how

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.530
it – how do you display that. So, the great
team that we worked with at the last minute,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.560
came up with this idea of a stacking logic
and that allowed us different restaurants

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.979
to sort of be over laid on top of each other
based on different qualities and priorities.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.481
And we were able to kind of figure away around
it without kind of scrapping this sort of

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:54.290
cool new UI that we developed.
&gt;&gt; So, the real (inaudible) of having on the

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.990
phone is the phone knows where you are?
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Oh, absolutely. I mean, the application

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.000
is really, it’s a combination of GPS, accelerometer,
as well as digital compass. And all of those

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.079
things kind of put together will give you
a real sort of, you know, a real idea of the

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.749
restaurants that are around you or the bars
or night life that’s in your area.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:17.959
&gt;&gt; So are there any memorable tips and tricks
that you could share for developing your application?

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.049
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Sure, one of the things that if you
decide that you’re going to leave the application

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.460
at any point or allow the user to leave the
application to go to a Web browser, you know,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.540
I think the ideal experience to try to keep
it as in app browser whether than kind of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.749
launching something externally. When you do
that, it gives a more seamless experience

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:43.219
and it kind of makes it seem like the application
is a little bit larger in scope when in reality

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.249
all you’ve done is you’ve taken your Wap
site and you’re kind of skinned it.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:50.289
&gt;&gt; So, what’s your favorite aspect of the
entire development process?

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:56.689
&gt;&gt; RYAN: I think the – my favorite aspect
is definitely the speed to market. The ability

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.650
to, you know, upload and application and twenty
minutes later, see that’s alive in the Android

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.439
Market and see feedback already coming in
is really great. We were able to quickly turn

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.730
around an update based on kind of feedback,
you know, it’s just a few minutes after

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.469
the application was updated. And you know,
ten minutes later people are getting notification

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.439
update. So, you know, we’re really happy
about that process.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.110
&gt;&gt; So, are there any features that you can
do in your app that you can do on other platforms?

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.580
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Absolutely, because the app uses
a Magnetometer. The application’s ability

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.689
to kind of map in 3D and based on cardinal
directions can only be done on Android. And

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.159
you know, really that’s the basis of the
application, this isn’t really an application

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.139
that can only done on a platform right now.
And that’s why we were eager to kind of

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.639
dive in there and create this.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Can you show us a really quick click?

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.070
&gt;&gt; RYAN: Sure, absolutely. So, as you see
the application right now. It’s showing

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.489
you the first-person view and you can actually
see a restaurant that’s blinking right behind

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.129
me, it’s showing the distance as well as
there’s a gat rating and the food quality

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.220
source.
&gt;&gt; Uh, that’s really cool. Thank you so

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.239
much for showing.
&gt;&gt; RYAN: All right. Thank you.
