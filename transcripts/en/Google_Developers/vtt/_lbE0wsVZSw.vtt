With Flutter, making a scrollable grid
of widgets is easy with GridView.

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:13.580
But what about
if you have a grid of widgets

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.940
that you don't want to scroll?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.489
That's what Table is for!

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.640
Especially if you have widgets
of different sizes,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.808
there's no need to build up your own tree
of custom-size rows and columns.

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:24.174
Table can resize <i>children</i>,

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:26.821
which is to accommodate
all of its contents.

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.828
You can specify how widgets
are aligned vertically

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:32.780
and their relative widths
of columns horizontally.

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.011
You can set this specific behavior
for individual columns

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.048
with the <i>columnWidths</i> parameter.

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:44.480
Use the <i>border</i> parameter to add
a border decoration around your table.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.041

and all the other Flutter widgets,
