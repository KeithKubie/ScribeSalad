00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.539
No matter what you’re a fan of, you can
probably think of two characters who fit the

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:08.339
description. Holmes and Watson. Brennan and
Booth. Kirk and Spock. Ron and Hermione.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.919
They’re close. They understand each other
in ways that others don’t, and you really

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.799
can’t picture one without the other. But when when
happens, they usually react in different ways.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.970
Like, if you’re snooping around Hogwarts
at night, and you come across some beastie,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.370
the smart money’s on Hermione to come up
with a spell that saves the day, while Ron

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.360
probably standin’ there with his mouth open.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.850
And when Sherlock starts to go crazy because
there hasn’t been a fiendishly clever jewel

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.750
heist or whatever for him to figure out, you
can count on Watson to calm him down. Mostly.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.590
My brother John, who is a writer of books,
will tell you that these characters are foils

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.950
-- they’re not opposites, exactly. They’re
contrasts, and the more you see them together,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.890
the more they seem to complement or round
one another out.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.750
And that is basically your autonomic nervous
system in a nutshell.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.540
Your autonomic system is the branch of your
peripheral nervous system that regulates the

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.149
functions of your internal organs, like your
heart and stomach, and also controls your

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.329
smooth and cardiac muscles, and your glands.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.640
All things that you you do not consciously control, so,
yes, you could say it has a lot of power over you.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.900
But the funny -- or maybe confusing -- thing
about this system is that its effects on your

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.150
organs and muscles and glands are by no means
consistent.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.170
Not at all.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.580
At any given moment, whether you happen to
be totally relaxed or completely flipping

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.670
your wig, your autonomic system is constantly
making involuntary, fine-tuned adjustments

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.220
to your body, based on what signals your central
nervous system is picking up.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.570
This could mean changing your body temperature,
sending extra blood to a particular area,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.939
slowing your heart beat, or tweaking your
stomach secretions.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.650
Its effects change, depending on the situation
you’re in -- and also which part of your

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.450
autonomic system is in charge at that moment.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.720
Because this weird little corner of your nervous
system that keeps you alive is actually run

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.110
by two competing interests.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.810
Two divisions that serve the same organs,
but they create opposite effects in them,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.250
battling it out back and forth, to either
excite your body’s functions or subdue them.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.880
One of them is dedicated to amping you up
and preparing you for activity -- that’s

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.360
your sympathetic nervous system. And the other
one talks you down and effectively undoes

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.509
what its foil did. And that is the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.649
Together, they’re what make your body experience
stress, fear, relaxation, and defiance. Courage

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.040
and cowardice. Panic and peace.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.540
If there’s an epic novel going on in your body right
now it is probably being written by these two.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.360
Let’s talk about names for a minute.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.989
One of the two divisions of your autonomic
nervous system is called the sympathetic system.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.440
That sounds kinda nice, doesn’t it? It’s
like understanding, and calming, and telling

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.160
you that it’s not so bad after all.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.900
WRONG! Contrary to its comforting name, the
sympathetic system is what sounds your internal

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.040
alarm bells. It’s the hardware behind the
famous “fight or flight” response. It

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.770
is synonymous with stress.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.569
If the sympathetic is for “fight or flight,”
the parasympathetic is for “resting and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.410
digesting” -- it’s responsible for maintaining
your body and conserving energy for later.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.080
I recognize that this is confusing.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.090
But, when you explore the anatomy of these
two systems, like we’re gonna do today,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.739
they start to make a little more sense.

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.560
Because, even though their basic components
are essentially the same, their physical structures

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.810
turn out to be different in a few really important
ways. And those differences can help explain

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.690
why they act like the foils that they are,
and why sometimes you feel more like Sherlock

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.720
than Watson, or the other way around.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.320
First big difference: the nerves of these two
divisions originate at different sites in your body.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.519
Your sympathetic fibers are thoracolumbar
-- meaning that they originate from between

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.879
your thoracic vertebrae where your ribs attach,
and the lumbar vertebrae just inferior to your ribs.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.450
Early anatomists saw how a network of nerves
radiating from the middle of the spine like

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.020
this could quickly coordinate the functions
of many major organs at once. So it was called

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.709
the sympathetic system, from the Greek words
for “feeling together.”

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.149
But the nerve fibers of your parasympathetic
system begin both above and below where

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.819
the sympathetic ones do.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.000
They’re craniosacral, meaning they sprout
from the base of your brain and also from

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.409
your sacral spinal cord, just superior to
the tailbone.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.189
And because the roots of these nerve fibers
basically frame the starting points of the

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.080
sympathetic nerves, they were called parasympathetic
-- literally “beside the sympathetic.”

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.849
Another difference between these two foils?
Their ganglia.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.680
Unlike your sensory or motor neurons, where
a single axon can reach all the way from your

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.610
spinal cord to whatever muscle or touch receptor
it works with, both parts of your autonomic

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.300
system require two neurons in order to work.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.640
And those two neurons meet in ganglia -- clusters of
neuron cell bodies that house millions of synapses.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.360
But where these ganglia appear relate to 
their function, and which division of the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.280
autonomic system they're serving.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.600
Sympathetic ganglia are found closer to the
spinal cord, because in those fight-or-flight

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.319
moments of high excitement or activity, they
need to be able to send a single message far

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.879
and wide, like the Bat Signal.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.400
This way, excitatory signals traveling into
a ganglion near the spine -- ganglion being

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.669
the singular of ganlia -- can trigger action
potentials in a whole bunch of other neurons

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.960
that lead to many different effectors, like the
heart, and lungs, and stomach, and adrenal glands.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.889
By contrast, most parasympathetic ganglia
are found way out from the spine -- near,

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.330
or even inside of their effector organs.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.360
Because this system is responsible for taking
care of particular functions only when you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.289
have the time and energy to do it -- like
digesting food or excreting waste -- it uses

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.439
more specific, strategic signals.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:21.330
It’s more like Commissioner Gordon calling
Batman on the batphone, one on one just to

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.930
talk about how things are going and you know
whether Alfred’s doing OK after his meningitis.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.250
It’s a private conversation -- not everybody
needs to be involved.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.680
Anyway, because the ganglia of these two divisions
appear in different places in your body, it

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.280
also makes sense that their neurons themselves have
slightly different forms, namely the length of their axons.

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.069
Now, ganglia can be kind of complex -- it
actually comes from the Greek word for “a

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.240
knot in a string” -- so when dealing with
neurons around these structures, we look at

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.040
the fibers before they run into the ganglion,
as well as after they come out of it.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.780
Understandably enough, the axon lengths of
the neurons before the ganglion are called

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.899
the preganglionic fibers, and the ones coming
out are postganglionic.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.710
The key here is that, in the sympathetic system,
the preganglionic fibers are much shorter

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.649
than the postganglionic ones.

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.879
Which makes sense, when you think about it,
because sympathetic ganglia are really close

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.189
to the spinal cord, and the axons don’t
have, or need, very far to go from the central

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.990
nervous system. But they do have a lot of
distance to cover, on the other side of the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.279
ganglion, in order to reach their effectors. So naturally
the fibers leading out of the ganglia are a lot longer.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.459
And, foils being what they are, the reverse is of
course true for the parasympathetic system.

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.800
Since parasympathetic ganglia are so close
to, or even inside of, their effector organs,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.210
the preganglionic fibers are a lot longer.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.499
They extend from the cranium and sacrum where
they start, out to the lungs or liver or bladder

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.960
-- wherever their effector is -- where they
reach their ganglion.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.300
From there, the postganglionic fibers are super short --
just long enough to communicate with their effector.

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.589
So, once again -- it’s anatomy and 
physiology -- the structure of each

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.080
of these systems is related to its function.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.830
The sympathetic nervous system is set up in
such a way that even a small stress signal

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.969
sent down one path could trigger a response
in many effectors at once.

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:04.900
Which is one reason why your reaction to a
sudden, stressful event can feel so all-encompassing.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.980
By the same token, the resting and digesting
that’s overseen by the parasympathetic system

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.279
doesn’t require urgent, all-hands-on deck
communication. If you need to process a burrito

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:20.159
or take a nap or maybe a trip to the bathroom, it can
communicate with the organs involved, one on one.

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.539
But still none of this tells us how these
systems do what they do -- how these nerves

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.979
communicate with your organs, and muscles,
and glands in times of either stress, or relaxation.

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.830
We’ll start that next week, with a white-knuckle
ride through your sympathetic nervous system.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.240
So, between now and then, rest up.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.589
For now, you learned the basic two-part system
of your autonomic nervous system. Mainly that

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:43.899
it consists of two primary, complementary
divisions, the sympathetic nervous system,

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:48.039
which arouses your body, and the parasympathetic
nervous system, which is charge of resting,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.660
digesting, and repair.

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.429
We also talked through the three main anatomical
differences between the two systems. Their

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:57.580
nerve fibers originate in different parts
of the body, the ganglia of the sympathetic

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.409
system are located close to the spinal cord,
while the ganglia of the parasympathetic system

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:06.580
are close to their effectors. And finally, the nerve
fibers themselves have different structures.
