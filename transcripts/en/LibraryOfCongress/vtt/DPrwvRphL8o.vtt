00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.390 position:58%
&gt;&gt; We're going to go ahead and begin.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.940 position:58%
My name is Mike Apfeldorf, you are in
Library of Congress 101 for Teachers.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.140
I would like to introduce our
presenter, Cheryl Lederle.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.060 position:67%
Cheryl Lederle has worked as an educational
resources specialist at the Library

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.370
of Congress since December of 2003.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.400
She has advanced the Library's
educational mission

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.750 position:58%
by providing professional development
both in person and via webinar.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.800 position:64%
She has also played a significant role in
shaping the Library's online repository

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.350 position:56%
of classroom materials and resources
for teachers at loc.gov/teachers,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.590
and continues to contribute to the
development of those materials.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.410 position:73%
She has 15 years of experience teaching English

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.820
at both the high school and
community college levels.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.730
We're very lucky to have her here.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.740
Cheryl, take it away.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.550
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Mike.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.690
It is my privilege and honor
to be here with you tonight,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.010
giving you a tour of the
Library of Congress for teachers.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
So this is me at an earlier
conference, just because you might

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.920 position:58%
like to know who you're talking with.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.890 position:72%
So my -- some thoughts on what we'll do today.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.650 position:59%
We'll look at the what the Library has
for teachers, and we're going to look

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.260 position:70%
at lesson plans, primary source sets, eBooks,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.790 position:72%
webinars and other professional development
opportunities, social media channels and more.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.140 position:64%
And along the way I would invite you to
use that chat box to share your top tips,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.670
favorite resources and experiences
so that we are learning together.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.560 position:56%
I always enjoy hearing from teachers
and find it very rich and wonderful

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.430
to know what do you find useful,
where do you get hung up so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.170 position:64%
that we know what we might focus on next.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.070 position:64%
This is not going to be a search webinar.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.590 position:75%
We're only going to look at what we've built for
teachers in particular, but hold that thought,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.840
I had some scoop as of about
3:30 this afternoon some scoop

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.850 position:69%
on a search webinar, so just hold that idea.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.540 position:69%
What I'd like you to do first is take you
briefly to Capitol Hill to visit the Library

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.300
of Congress, as we do -- oh,
Emily, Taylor and Hailey,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.550 position:66%
I hope you resolve your computer problems.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.860 position:61%
Mike will interact with you about that.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.990 position:59%
While I'm talking a little bit about
where the Library is and what it does,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.590 position:72%
feel free to use the chat to let me know and
let everybody else on here know where you are,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.730 position:66%
what state you're in, what grade or grades
you teach and what subjects you teach.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.420 position:69%
So you'll see, if you look at this, to
orient you a little bit, near the top center

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.270 position:58%
of the screen is a tall white figure,
that's the Washington Monument.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.130 position:67%
The orange circle that you see just about
dead center is around the Capitol building.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.420
The big, big blue circle is around
the Library's Capitol Hill campus.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.220 position:61%
We have three buildings and the small
yellow circle is around the most famous

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.960
of the three buildings, the
Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.930 position:70%
Thank you to those of you who are chiming in.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.440
It looks like you come from many
different geographic places,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.270 position:58%
and teach a wide variety of subjects.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.110
And I appreciate that.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.590
A little more about the Library.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.740
This is a different angle with
the Capitol front and center.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.460
Behind the Capitol and a little bit
to the left, under the lowest box

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.230 position:69%
of text there is the Supreme Court building.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.670 position:64%
And behind the Capitol and to the right
is, again, the Thomas Jefferson Building.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.660 position:75%
And I've always enjoyed the [inaudible] position
of these three institutions so close together.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.310
So a little bit about the Library.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.980 position:58%
It holds more than 160 million items,
and to house of all those we have,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.570
it's a changing number, but more
than 830 miles of bookshelves.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.730
Just stop and think about
that for a minute, 830 miles.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:47.280 position:72%
From where I'm sitting in Washington D.C., 830
miles is, what, from here to Atlanta, maybe?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.090 position:63%
The Library receives 15,000 items daily.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.620 position:69%
Many of those are through copyright deposit,
and of those it adds about 12,000 items

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.840 position:58%
to the collection every business day.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.510 position:70%
So it's a big and growing bigger institution.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.930 position:67%
Here's a peek inside, and what I'd like you

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.860
to do is take a good look
at this picture right now.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.110 position:64%
So if you're still typing, finish your
typing or pause your typing for a minute.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.860 position:61%
I'm going to pause for about 20 seconds
and ask you to take in as many details

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.370 position:63%
about this picture on screen as you can.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.750
But don't start typing them yet.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.400
Now take just a minute and jot down
a few details that you remember,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.100 position:61%
and feel free to read what other people
notice and build on their answers.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:09.450 position:69%
So I'm going to pause my conversation for
just about 10 seconds while you answer this.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.660 position:59%
Thank you for kicking us off, Janelle,
noticing the arches and columns.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.830 position:63%
And Mary builds on that and notices very
specifically three statues in each arch.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.310
Circular format, statues.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.270 position:58%
Maria notes that she finds the lights
on the table make the room cozy.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.940 position:58%
William says there are writing areas.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.020 position:56%
William, I might push on that a
little and say, what are the details

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.960 position:58%
that build up a writing area for you?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.320
Lots of details here.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.940 position:69%
A small eagle at the very top of the arches.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.500
You guys are good observers.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.970 position:70%
Take a minute and scan this list and see, did
somebody notice something that you didn't?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.630
So a little bit about this room.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.880
This is the main reading room
of the Library of Congress,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.590
perhaps the most famous space
within the Library of Congress.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.390 position:73%
If you are of a certain age you might have seen
this in the film <i>All the President's Men </i>.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.760
If you're a little younger
you might have seen this

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.770
in National Treasure [inaudible]
a little more recently.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.940 position:67%
But this is an actual working reading room.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.830 position:67%
If you come to the Library of Congress here
in Washington D.C. and you're above the age

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.040 position:69%
of 16 you can do your own work in this room.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.260 position:70%
So I just wanted to take you into the Library
for a minute, and I tied that to an activity

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:51.890 position:70%
that we like to use to get people involved in
observing and comparing their observations.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:57.730 position:59%
You've done a great job of writing
down observations in about 20 seconds.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.510 position:61%
So now on to the main part of the tour.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.460
We've visited the Library briefly.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.120
Here's the Library's homepage.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.190
And I will point out, I didn't
want to say this earlier

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.360
because I didn't necessarily
want you popping out,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.880
but all of these slides are
hot linked to the page.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.090
So if you want to explore something
now or through the recording later,

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.650 position:58%
go ahead -- feel free to click on it.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.450
It will take you to a new browser
window, and you just need to return

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.070 position:58%
to this window to resume the webinar.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.150 position:70%
So loc.gov, the Library of Congress homepage,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.230
under Collection Highlights
are tens of millions of items.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.350
I don't know an exact number.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:48.690 position:72%
I'm fond of saying what's the most exciting
thing about searching the Library of Congress?

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.780
About 30 million items.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.050 position:64%
What's the most frustrating thing of
searching the Library of Congress online?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.980
About 30 million items.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.690
So we're going to zero in on the
Teachers page, loc.gov/teachers.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.300
Again, this slide is hyperlinked.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:12.160 position:66%
My colleagues and I spend our professional
lives trying to make those millions

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.560
of primary source items more
accessible to you, to teachers.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:24.730 position:66%
And one of the easiest access points is to
subscribe to the Teaching with the Library

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.820
of Congress blog, right there
in the center of the homepage.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.650
It's keyword searchable.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:38.040 position:69%
I did a search on informational text because
it seems like that's an important concept

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.250
and phrase in a lot of classrooms,
and this pulled up 22 results

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.140 position:56%
on a variety of kinds of approaches.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.930 position:59%
And you can search it for other things
as well, whatever you're interested.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.040
I'd encourage you to try a
few different approaches.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.070
Back to the Teachers homepage.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.140 position:58%
I'm going to anchor out of this page.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.600
Again, I would invite you in
the chat, if you have experience

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.360 position:70%
with these materials, share them in the chat.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.350 position:73%
If you have questions, share those in the chat.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:19.200 position:63%
Mike will be harvesting them and I'll
return to them at the end of the session

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.930 position:58%
and answer as many as I possibly can.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.050 position:64%
The first place I'd like to show you, I'm
just going to work through the left nav

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.220 position:61%
of this page, is Using Primary Sources.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:38.090 position:69%
It's kind of a nuts and bolts of how to use
primary sources, why to use primary sources,

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:43.510 position:75%
including engaging students, developing critical
thinking skills, and constructing knowledge.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.480
Citing primary sources.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.150 position:56%
It might be small on your screen, so
I'm going to just point out to you

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:58.880 position:63%
that we have published format examples
for Chicago and MLA, and we focused this

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:05.000
on the most common kinds
of primary source materials

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.550
that you would encounter
on the Library's website.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.510 position:70%
We have a lot of questions about copyright in
Primary Sources, and the Library is the home

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:19.940 position:67%
of the U.S. Copyright Office, so we try to
answer at least some basic questions there.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.310
Of course we get questions about
where to find Primary Sources.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:32.950 position:75%
And if you want to branch beyond the [inaudible]
things, here are some starting places.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:38.030 position:67%
And then finally -- and I'll return to this
and talk to it a little bit more later --

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.710
we have teachers guides and then
analysis tool for guiding analysis.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.670
And, again, I'll return to that
in more detail in a few minutes.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.920 position:75%
Back to the anchor point, the Teachers homepage.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.400
I'd like to explore some of the
classroom materials that we have.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.730
This is perhaps my favorite place.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.060
First you should note that
they're searchable by standards.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.450 position:63%
All of these classroom materials you
can search by common core or if you want

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:17.940 position:72%
to use your own state content standards,
that, or we have aligned them to the standards

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.880 position:61%
of a select number of organizations, if
you're looking for something that way.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:34.090 position:69%
The first place I'd like to pause and look
at more closely are the Primary Source sets.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:39.210 position:56%
Those are sets of primary sources
around particular curricular themes.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:45.630 position:73%
What I've pulled up is the Constitution because
last I checked this was the most popular,

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.030
at least measured by the
number of clicks into it.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:54.720
And I'd like to point out that in
the red circle there are a couple

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.030
of stopping places we're going
to go in the next few slides.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.480 position:73%
Each Primary Source Set, in addition to Primary
Sources themselves, which you can see arrayed

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:10.670 position:69%
at the bottom of the page, has -- there
will be a Teacher's Guide, the analysis tool

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:17.810 position:70%
and guides are also linked here, and there's
a student discovery set attached to this one.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:31.540 position:75%
So first the Teacher's Guide provides historical
background, and also some teaching ideas.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.070 position:72%
What we heard from teachers when we asked them

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.960 position:64%
about using the Library's published
lesson plans sounded very familiar to me.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.350 position:69%
What I heard was -- what we hard was that
they tended to pick out the primary sources,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:52.940 position:63%
pick out the ideas, and then reconfigure
those [inaudible] primary sources

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.130
into their own lessons.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:59.660 position:56%
And so these Primary Source Sets are
just that, it's the primary sources

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.340 position:63%
and the ideas deconstructed, because
what we heard was teachers don't need us

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.600
to write their lesson plans.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.530 position:58%
Here's a closer look at the Teacher's
Guide and Analysis Tool page.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.380
Up at the top we have two
versions of the analysis tool.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:21.210 position:67%
There's a printable PDF version that if you
want to use paper that is the route to go.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:26.140
And if you're wanting to use
a digital tool there is a link

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.830 position:56%
to the primary source analysis tool.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.680 position:61%
They're parallel to the analyzing --
to the Primary Source Teacher's Guides.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.430 position:56%
A general one for analyzing primary
sources of general sort and a number

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:49.720 position:73%
of format specific ones, and each Teacher's
Guide has a question set aligned to that format

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.630 position:66%
to help you as a teacher know the kinds of
things to ask your students to go deeper.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.150 position:59%
And here's an example of the analyzing
primary sources Teacher's Guide.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:06.530
And I'm going to click back
to the analysis tool.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:13.180 position:59%
You'll notice it uses the same columns
of observe, reflect and question.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:18.730
And I've put red circles on
a couple of places to note.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.330 position:64%
One is that this online analysis tool has
a dropdown, if you'd like to customize it

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:29.950
with questions by format, you
can do that using that dropdown.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:38.080 position:72%
And then what that gets you is the second,
slightly lower red circle is around a small --

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.650
Maria, it's on the website and
it's hot linked from this page,

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.510
so we'll -- several access points.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:52.100 position:58%
That question icon will give students
a set of prompts that they can use

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:58.640
to help them do a deeper
analysis of the primary source.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:05.250 position:73%
Again, the Teacher's Guide, one thing that I'd
like to point out that's on the Teacher's Guide

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.090 position:67%
but not the primary source analysis tool is

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.500
at the very bottom there are
some follow-up activity ideas,

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.130 position:58%
beginning, intermediate and advanced.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:21.770
And I would say that those
levels are more the complexity

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.550 position:59%
of implementing it than anything else.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.710
I often use the beginning ones in
teachers workshops where I want

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:34.540 position:58%
to deepen the user experience
without a huge heavy lift on my part.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.210 position:63%
So I recommend looking at those as well.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:44.100
The last thing, and this was back
on the Primary Source Set page,

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.080
is 12 of the primary source sets
have an additional component

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.750
and that is a student discovery
set that's free on iBooks.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:00.920
That's all of the primary sources
from the set loaded in just

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.990 position:61%
for students with particular tool sets.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:10.420 position:72%
What's up on screen right now is an annotation
tool that allows students to draw on,

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:20.940
to mark up the primary source in
the -- on their -- in the eBook.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.200 position:70%
This might look familiar if you look closely.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:31.120
This is a built-in primary source
analysis tool with questions.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.560
You'll notice it has the same
sections of observe, reflect,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.560
question and then in investigate.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.800 position:63%
And so -- and there's a sample
question there that a student could ask.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.270 position:61%
So we've made this interactive for
students in a couple of different ways,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.630 position:59%
trying to make it as flexible for your
use as we possibly, possibly could.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:03.980 position:63%
The next place I'd like to take you from
the classroom materials is a quick look

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.380 position:56%
at the presentations and activities.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.140 position:75%
I'm not going to go into every click of every
page because that would be a much longer webinar

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.780 position:70%
than we have time for, but I do want to point

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.490
out that we do have presentations
and activities.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:24.110
For example, the American Memory
timeline, access to primary sources

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.770 position:61%
through a timeline of American history.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:31.790 position:63%
I'm going back to the Teachers page now.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.900 position:61%
Again, this is my anchor point for you.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.980 position:59%
And I'm just going down this left
navigation and I'd like to take a peek

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:47.960 position:70%
at Professional Development now for a moment.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.920 position:67%
You are participating today in professional
development but we have other options.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.530
So taking a tour of this
page, take online modules.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:07.580
We have six self-directed online
modules addressing the kinds

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.240 position:58%
of questions that we hear most often.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.200 position:72%
What does the Library of Congress have for me?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.290
What does an inquiry approach
look like with primary sources?

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.160
And that's an interesting module
because it has actual footage

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:32.080 position:67%
of fourth graders analyzing primary
sources in deep and really meaningful ways.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.660
Copyright and then two samples of
analyzing primary sources using two

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.690 position:59%
of the more popular visual formats,
photographs and prints, and also maps.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.890
And then we have a module
on finding primary sources.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:54.050 position:69%
Now is the moment I'm going to tell you that
if you're really interested in learning how

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.910
to search the Library's website
more effectively and efficiently,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:11.180
just this afternoon we scheduled
a webinar December 10th

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:15.050 position:70%
for PM Eastern time, that's the current plan.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.710
As I say, we just settled
on this this afternoon,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:24.170 position:70%
but watch the Twitter feed @teachinglc or the
Teaching with the Library of Congress blog

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:31.010 position:63%
for details on this, if that's a topic
of interest to you to go more personally

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.300 position:70%
and more deeper than these online modules do.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:42.060 position:72%
Back to the Professional Development homepage,
if you're trying to figure out where I am.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:50.670 position:75%
We also have PDF's available of the kinds of
workshops we deliver when we work with teachers,

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.560
and that's all there for a click,
and to get away [inaudible].

00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:02.590 position:67%
It has everything you would need to develop
-- excuse me -- to deliver a workshop.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.870
The next thing is webinars.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:11.940 position:56%
We are in the middle of one right
now, but we host these at intervals.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.610
And one of the things to know
is that we also record them.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.170 position:58%
So if you go to this page you can see

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:25.790 position:63%
that so far this year we did a
Constitution Day Primary Sources webinar

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.020
and that recording is available.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:34.430 position:73%
And there's a link to this event, the Online
Conference, and all of these recordings will be

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:40.880 position:58%
up beginning next week, available for
you to watch and share with friends.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.650 position:66%
Back to the Professional Development page.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.480 position:73%
Every summer we host Summer Teacher Institutes.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.340 position:64%
Those are weeklong programs that teachers
apply and get accepted to come to.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:01.540
We have -- do not charge for these,
so this is a great opportunity.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.860 position:67%
There are your fees for travel and lodging,
but with little advanced notice a lot

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.030 position:63%
of teachers have been able to get grants
through local organizations for that.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.490
So if you want to do a really
deep dive and come "live with us"

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.100 position:66%
for a week, that's a terrific opportunity.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:25.170 position:63%
And we'll be putting up that application
I would say within the next month or so.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.800
Mike, if you have details on
that, add that to the chat.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.620
I say that because, not to put Mike
on the spot, but because he's one

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.770 position:58%
of the main organizers of that event.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:40.030
Back to the Teachers homepage.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:46.540 position:75%
I'd like to anchor you again and point out we
have a number of local partners -- thanks, Mike.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.130 position:75%
Look for that application coming up in December.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.770
And, again, watching the
Twitter feed and the Teaching

00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:04.460 position:64%
with the Library blog are the best places
to have the early information about that.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:10.440 position:73%
We have part -- a whole consortium of partners,
the Teaching with Primary Sources partners,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:18.580 position:61%
throughout the United States, providing
professional development more locally.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:27.080
And as part of that program there's
also a journal published online,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.040
and that's a rich place if you
want to explore some theory

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:43.130 position:72%
and get also some practical applications of
that theory you might explore the TPS journal.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:51.560 position:75%
It always has a current issue and right now that
is Teaching with the Fine and Performing Arts.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.070 position:56%
But there's also an archive and
we'll look at that in just a moment.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.150 position:75%
So here's what's in a typical TPS journal issue.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:09.200 position:75%
There's a feature article, in this case, Primary
Sources from the Fine and Performing Arts.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.000 position:67%
There's a section on research and current
thinking, if you want to explore that more.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.910 position:75%
There's a Teacher's Spotlight, an interview with
a teacher who's been working with this theme.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.290 position:66%
And then there will be learning activities

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.490
at both the elementary level
and the secondary level.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.520
Because, again, when we talked
to teachers we learned --

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:36.580 position:63%
we heard that teachers are very adept,
you are very adept at adapting things up

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:42.020 position:61%
or down a little bit, so you don't need
us to write a first grade lesson plan,

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.760 position:75%
but you can see an elementary level one and take
it to the level appropriate for your students.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.490
Here's the archive.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.050
So you can see there are
a lot of topics covered.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:56.250 position:67%
Literacy Integrations, elementary learners.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.700
I saw a couple of questions
flash by on elementary

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.330
and Mike will be giving me
those questions a little later,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.930 position:67%
when we pause for question and answer time.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:11.650 position:59%
Historical thinking, so lots of topics
here if you want to learn the theory

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.810
and also see some more activities.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:27.670 position:72%
I would be remiss if I didn't point out one of
the perhaps best kept secrets of the Library

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.000
of Congress, and this might be
the answer for a number of you

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.070 position:64%
who have had some family specific content
questions that I may or may not be able

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.650 position:72%
to answer in the context of this presentation,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.310
but the Library offers an
Ask a Librarian service.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.200
And you can see the little pink
box at the top of the page.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:57.430 position:61%
That will take you to this page and you
can see this is staffed by a wide array

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.630 position:58%
of experts from all over the Library.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:07.680 position:72%
So think about if you have a teaching specific
question, probably directed to Resources

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.470
for Teachers, my colleague, Dana,

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:15.230 position:56%
who's also staffing our Twitter feed
this afternoon, will field those.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.870 position:72%
And she is dedicated to getting you an answer.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.260
There she is in the chat, hi, Dana.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:25.160
Dana is dedicated to giving you an
answer within five business days

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.650 position:59%
and often much, much sooner than that.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.570 position:67%
But if you have a content specific question
about, say, newspapers and periodicals,

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.240 position:66%
for example, or you're a language teacher,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.080
you can see we have a number
of international collections.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.650 position:75%
The Library collects in more than 100 languages.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.350
I should know that number but
I don't off the top of my head.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.020
I want to say 140.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.780 position:66%
Colleagues, if you have the number at the
top of your head, feel free to correct me.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.810 position:58%
So use this service -- 500 languages?

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.850
Good golly.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:06.250 position:72%
Anyway, I distract myself reading the numbers.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:11.610
Use this Ask a Librarian service
if you're not finding something

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.960
that you believe we probably have.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.600 position:59%
Here's a list of high level resources.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.000
Library's homepage, loc.gov.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.450 position:73%
And, again, these are all hot links, as are all
of the pages in this, from during the session

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:39.250
and also during the recording, you
can go directly to any of those.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:45.930 position:70%
The page for teachers, where I've spent most
of my time this evening, is loc.gov/teachers.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.810
And we do maintain a blog,
blogs.loc.gov/teachers,

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:58.410 position:66%
and that's a terrific place to explore
some of these particular questions as well

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.950
for teaching elementary students.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.950
We have a science teacher in
residence who's been blogging,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:08.010 position:67%
so we have more science than in years past.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.970 position:58%
So if you haven't visited us lately
and that's of interest, check us out.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:19.620
As I say, this is a terrific place
to explore some ideas and learn.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:27.290 position:67%
The things that I really enjoy about the
blog is it's a place to hear from teachers,

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:31.010
and so we appreciate your feedback.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:36.730
Mike, I'm going to leave this
slide up and ask you to --

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.280 position:61%
what questions have you fielded for me?

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.860
&gt;&gt; Well, a few questions.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.250 position:70%
Let's start with -- and these are [inaudible]
questions, so you can answer or Dana, also,

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.720
if you're still on the chat,
you can chime in, too.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.100 position:61%
But Maria asked, "Do you have materials
I could use in my Spanish class?

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.880
And specifically for elementary."

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:08.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria, if you're looking for
materials that are in Spanish, we --

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:15.290 position:64%
most of what we have is probably going to
be a high reading level because you layer

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.530
in the fact that it's historical.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.940 position:59%
But I'm making a guess on that because
I've never taught elementary Spanish.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:30.230 position:67%
I will say that what we hear from teachers
is that the visual materials cross language

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:36.380 position:70%
and so if you're having your students analyze
a photograph, for example, or read a map,

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:43.720 position:66%
they can do that in any language and
practice their language skills describing.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.820 position:63%
The other resource that I would point
you to, although it is outside the scope

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.670 position:72%
of what I said I was going to do, is I've just
put in the link for the World Digital Library.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:59.460 position:56%
We had a whole session on the World
Digital Library earlier this evening

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.310
and you might check that out.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:09.440
They have materials in many world
languages, and the information

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.260 position:61%
about those materials can be translated
into seven different languages,

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.050 position:69%
all the languages of the UN plus Portuguese.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:23.280
And Dana chimes in, thank
you, Dana, I knew that one.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:29.780 position:63%
But [inaudible] America or Historical
Newspaper database also has some Spanish

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.970
language newspapers.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.660
And Dana has pasted in the
link to the advanced search tab

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.790 position:69%
where you can specify materials by language.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.230
So there are a lot of things.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.330 position:61%
The other thing I would point out is --

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.800
Dana maybe you can find the link
for this while I'm chatting --

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.760 position:66%
we do have a Primary Source Set that we've
built out of the World Digital Library

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:05.700 position:70%
and that might have some ideas for you, also.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.260
I'm going to pause, Maria, if you
want to clarify your question,

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.210 position:58%
I see you're typing, that's terrific.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:23.160
Mike -- thank you, Dana,
that was very efficient.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:29.610 position:63%
Mike, if you have another question while
Maria is typing hers, I'll go ahead --

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.160 position:75%
awesome, I'm glad that you find visuals helpful.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.920
I see a number of people
typing, so I'm going to pause.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.970
And, Mike, what's the next --

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.580
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I believe I was muted.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.310 position:70%
Emily asks, "What materials would you suggest

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.970
for an English teacher doing
a unit on the American Dream?"

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:18.170 position:64%
&gt;&gt; Emily, that's a huge question, and I
think there are probably a lot of things,

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:24.150 position:63%
depending on exactly how you're students
or you defining the American Dream.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.180 position:56%
There is, as Dana has pointed out,
a lesson plan on the American Dream,

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.270 position:70%
and that would certainly be a starting point.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.370
I would suggest adding to that a
good search in Chronicling America

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:42.650
to see what experiences people had.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.460 position:70%
Just give me a yes or a Y if you can hear me.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.610 position:58%
Janelle, I see is asking about sound.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.060
Yes? Okay, perfect.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:53.510
Thank you.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.560
Just wanted to make sure.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:03.650 position:75%
As I was saying, I would explore Chronicling
America as well, because I know for certain sure

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:10.540 position:73%
that Chronicling America went live online after
the American Dream lesson plan was published,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.490 position:69%
but those are some terrific starting places.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.300
Mike, what's the next question?

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.980
&gt;&gt; Just to -- and also just to
reinforce what Cheryl said earlier,

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.340
while she's doing a really good
job and Dana is doing really a job

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.730 position:72%
of answering these [inaudible] Ask a Librarian
feature is really something to utilize

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.470
for these questions, as well, as
they're going to take the time

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.180 position:69%
to give you very thoughtful answers as well.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.750 position:64%
So the next question is from Christopher.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:45.210 position:59%
He's asking about the use of the
resources are permitted -- are uses --

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.710
it really has to do with copyright.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.050
Can they use these as a teacher?

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:57.620
&gt;&gt; If you're -- I'm not sure from
the site, yes, almost all of them.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.710
Please all of the materials
from the Teachers Page,

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:07.010 position:73%
all of the teacher specific materials are
entirely for your use, use them as you need to.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.680
Share them lively.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.590
We do like it if you give us
credit, but, yes, use them.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.580
That's why we create them.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:21.770 position:61%
And since they're created by government
workers for hire as part of our job,

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.380 position:75%
they're not covered by copyright, so take those.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:33.620 position:56%
Most of the primary sources are also
outside the bounds of copyright.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:44.970 position:69%
And when we build teacher materials we're
pretty particular to check whenever possible

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:50.680 position:63%
that they're not covered by copyright so
that you don't have to worry about that.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.070 position:75%
I'll always point out, though, I am nothing like
a copyright expert and that's my disclaimer.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:59.540 position:67%
But for the most part, if you're using
them in the course of your normal teaching,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.380 position:56%
you're probably covered by Fair Use.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.170 position:73%
You'd want to do a much closer investigation if
you're doing anything published or putting it

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.640
on a t-shirt or something
commercial that you might sell.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.680
But, yes, Christopher, I hope
I've answered your question.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.570
And if you have more details or
something I haven't gotten to,

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:22.270 position:69%
please feel free to add those into the chat.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.600
Great questions.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.190
Thank you.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:27.220
Michael, what's next?

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.730 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Here's another question that's come in.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.700 position:56%
This one is one that often comes up.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.660
Does the Library have a copy of
every manuscript ever produced?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.120 position:56%
So I've heard of a manuscript, can I
automatically get it at the Library?

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.950 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Boy it would be great if we did, but we
don't, so that's kind of a quick and easy one.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:51.120 position:66%
No, I don't think anybody in the world has
a copy of every manuscript ever produced.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.320
I'm just going to jump line, Mike,
I see that Christina has asked,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.050 position:61%
"Are there any new library materials
or programs for teachers on the horizon

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.170
that you can get a sneak peek of?"

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:09.720 position:59%
You know, yesterday our director of
Education Outreach did a whole program

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.650 position:63%
on just what's new and what's coming up.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:19.600 position:70%
So if you weren't able to attend that,
Christina, look for that recording next week.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.930
And we're always up to something
and that's all I'm going to say

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.970 position:56%
about that, but watch the recording.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.440
&gt;&gt; Cheryl, do you have time
for one more question?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.400 position:63%
&gt;&gt; I'm doing great on time, so bring it.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.770
&gt;&gt; Cheryl, I have another question.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.810
I believe you might be muted.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:54.890 position:64%
The question is, "What's the best," it's
kind of from a new teacher's perspective,

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:59.440
"What's the best way for me to
get started with Primary Sources?"

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.370
You may have to unmute [inaudible].

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:07.190 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Sure. I'm just muting when you're
talking, otherwise people get feedback.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:10.100 position:56%
But thanks for reminding me of that.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.320
You know, as a new teacher I think
the best way for you to get started

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:19.090
with Primary Sources is probably to
explore those primary source sets.

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:25.640
And Mike or Dana, if one of you
would want to plug that link

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.810 position:63%
into the chat box that might be helpful.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:37.480 position:75%
But skim the list of Primary Source Sets, find a
theme that you're teaching, and then pull up one

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.510
or a few related primary sources.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.970
Think about your teaching purposes.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:49.920 position:67%
Look at the Teacher's Guide, see what
ideas there are, and then dive right on in.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.310
You know, give it a try.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.950 position:56%
Ask the -- you know, give the
students some space to work with it.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:04.270 position:70%
One of the things that we hear from teachers
is pretty consistently how surprised they are

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:14.430 position:64%
that their students are able to think way
above what they would necessary expect.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.450
So, you know, dive right in.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:24.480 position:75%
If you have somebody in your district or
building who's experienced with Primary Sources,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.270 position:63%
you might ask that person for tips, too.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.830 position:59%
And especially if it's somebody who --

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.630 position:64%
if you can find somebody who's teaching
your same subject, that person might have

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:41.620 position:73%
in mind some ideas on how you could get started
that might already tie into your curriculum.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.430
And I see some of you thanking me.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.260
That's wonderful.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.090
You're very welcome.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.170 position:61%
I'm glad that you were able to join us.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:53.140 position:70%
I will point out, before you leave, we would
be grateful if you would give us a little bit

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.750 position:63%
of feedback via the three questions
about this session on the Survey Monkey,

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.830 position:64%
and the link is right there on the slide.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.730 position:67%
Mike, I'm going to mute myself, I believe
you have at least one more question for me.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:10.810 position:73%
And we have a few minutes, so if there are more
questions [inaudible] put them in the chat.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm -- I will --
my typing will catch up.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.890 position:69%
But essentially the question is, what are --
from your experience working with teachers,

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.760 position:63%
what are some of the creative ways that
teachers are using these primary sources

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.250
with their students?

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.210
&gt;&gt; I love that question.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.430
There are so many creative ideas
we have heard from teachers.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.960
The thing that has struck
me most recently is just how

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:45.410 position:66%
across the curriculum Primary Sources can
be a good fit for teaching content ranging

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:56.260 position:59%
from anatomy to astronomy to languages
other than English, to English itself.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:02.190 position:73%
And I -- as you may or may or not noticed in
the bio, English Language Arts is my background

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:06.810
and I'm just constantly delighted
at the possibilities with that.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:12.970
One of the things that I personally
have been engaged with is breaking

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:18.100
in those historic American
newspaper pages to add some depth

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:24.040
and context to the Primary Sources.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.640 position:56%
Especially if you lay the foundation
with visuals and then ask your --

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:38.200 position:64%
invite your students to continue their
research with additional primary sources.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.820 position:67%
And the newspapers were wonderful for that.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.830 position:58%
They're also wonderful for propelling
additional kinds of questions,

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.150 position:59%
because of course when you're looking
at a newspaper page you're not reading

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:54.350 position:66%
about just the one thing you started with,
and that's maybe a little bit of a danger

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.340
of using the newspapers because
it's easy to get sidetracked,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.020 position:69%
but I call that building historical context.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.860 position:59%
And Bonnie is pointing out, thank you,

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.610
that she loves using photographs
as a way to engage students.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.630
And absolutely, it's visual,
it levels the playing field,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:17.420
students can access the photograph
according to their own experience.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.980
They can observe using that
skill that you used earlier

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.650 position:69%
in the program, thank you for playing along.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.870
And you can then deepen it.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.610 position:59%
One of the things that I particularly,
again, English Language Arts teacher,

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:40.800 position:73%
love about photographs is talking with students
about how a photograph has a point of view.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:47.250 position:64%
Perhaps more subtle than a written piece,
but there's absolutely a photograph.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.730
And thank you for all of the ideas
you're sharing with each other.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.490
Thank you for the questions.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.770 position:73%
Mike, I'm going to mute myself and back to you.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:01.130 position:69%
I haven't been tracking the questions, so I
don't know if you have anything more for me.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:09.860 position:63%
Dana has been busy putting in blog posts
from teachers documenting their uses.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:14.160
Mike, any other questions
or is it time to wrap it up?

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.570
&gt;&gt; I don't have any more questions.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.280
We do have another minute, if
somebody else has a final question,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:26.360 position:69%
please enter it in the chat window or if you
are Dana have anything final for the good

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.970 position:61%
of the cause now would be a great time.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.500
Okay, with that said -- oops.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.190 position:67%
Well, Christopher comes in with a question.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.980 position:66%
Here you go, Christopher asks, "May school
groups come to the Library of Congress?"

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.190
That's a great question.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.570
&gt;&gt; And the answer is absolutely.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:55.040 position:64%
Many, many school groups come every year.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:01.100 position:67%
Christopher, if you are planning something,
I would say -- and want something formal,

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.430
our Visitor's Service Offices
do great tours for students.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:14.620 position:70%
They fill up fast, so if you know [inaudible]
planning to come, you should absolutely --

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.910 position:72%
I'm sorry, I'm getting distracted by the chat.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:23.710 position:73%
This is I averted my eyes, so I'm going to
avert my eyes from the chat again for a moment.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:30.110 position:61%
You should absolutely contact the
Visitor's Services as soon as you know.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.340
Oh, Iris, that is my favorite
question of the night.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.160
I'm hoping you're sitting down.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:41.770
I just -- the fee for these
online resources is nothing.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.730
We are your tax money at work.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:47.340
There are no added fees.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:55.710 position:72%
Please use them, please share them, please use
Ask a Librarian to find more that you can use.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:03.040 position:70%
Dana has posted the link -- the direct link,
if you want to explore a visit to the Library

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.310 position:66%
of Congress, Christopher, or anybody else.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:12.960 position:72%
It's a beautiful space, wonderful exhibitions.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:15.760
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Cheryl.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.310 position:69%
I agree, it's been a great session and thank
you so much for leading us through that,

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:22.870
and also for everybody in the
chat for your great ideas.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:27.890
And thank you, Dana, as well for
all your work in the chat, as well.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:34.220 position:73%

Other little items that you
might want to know going away.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:52.660 position:59%
In five business days you will be send
instructions to access a certificate.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:58.470 position:73%
The certificate will show that you've completed
one instructional hour for this webinar.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:03.780 position:73%
And depending upon your school district you may
be able to get continuing ed units for that.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:09.980 position:67%
I believe we've also mentioned this session
has been recorded, so next week check

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.540
out loc.gov/teachers, if you want
to watch the recording again,

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.080 position:63%
and even perhaps more importantly please
share that link with your colleagues

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.800
so you can introduce them
to these resources as well.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:29.840 position:72%
