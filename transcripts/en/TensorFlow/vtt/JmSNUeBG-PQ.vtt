00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.710
PAIGE BAILEY: TensorFlow
2.0 has arrived

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.740
with a focus on usability,
developer productivity,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.440
and simple, intuitive APIs.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.960
If you like Keras and
you like Eager Execution,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.240
you will love TF 2.0.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.000
And if you're a longtime fan
of the original TensorFlow,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.890
you'll still have
the low-level control

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.450
that you've come to expect.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.150
Over the last few years,
we've added a large number

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.920
of components to TensorFlow.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.990
And with TF 2.0,
these components

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.080
are packaged together into a
comprehensive platform that

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600
supports machine learning
workflows through training

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.860
and deployment.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.640
This TensorFlow 2.0 release
includes many API changes

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.020
such as argument reorders,
API symbol renames, and more.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.380
The TF upgrade V2 tool
helps the transition

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.530
by converting existing
TensorFlow 1.12 Python

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.740
scripts to TensorFlow
2.0 preview scripts.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.170
Let's dive into collab and
see how you would upgrade.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.220
To use the TensorFlow upgrade
V2 script, all you need to do

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.640
is PIP install the
TF nightly preview.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Once that's done, you
can preface your command

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.789
with an exclamation point.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.330
Here we can see that
we're specifying

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.100
an in file, text generation
dot PUI, and the name of an out

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.000
file, so text generation
upgrade dot PY.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.850
We hit Shift Enter,
and we're immediately

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.550
displayed output
code showing all

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.470
of the conversions
that have taken place

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.570
due to this upgrade script.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.900
We can take a look at
the report dot text,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.730
and we can also
check to make sure

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.620
that the original script has
been modified with compact V1

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.710
terms.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.700
That's it.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.720
You successfully upgraded
a TensorFlow model.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
Some warnings, do not
update parts of your code

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.660
manually before
running the script.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.410
In particular, functions that
have had reordered arguments,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.790
like TF dot argmax or
TF dot batch to space,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.220
cause the script to incorrectly
add keyword arguments,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.600
and they get mismapped.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.300
This script does not
reorder arguments.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.580
Instead, it adds
keyword arguments

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.580
to functions that have had
their arguments reordered.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.110
The conversion process is not
able to upgrade all functions.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.200
One notable example
is TF dot NN dot

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.420
com 2d, which no longer takes
they use cuDNN on GPU argument.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.250
If the script
detects this, it'll

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.620
report to standard
out and in the report,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.460
and you can fix it manually.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.090
For example, if you
have this, you'll

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.560
need to change it to this.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.850
Excellent work.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.670
You just learned how to
upgrade your legacy TensorFlow

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.020
code to TensorFlow 2.0 with
the TF 2.0 upgrade script.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.230
If you run into any snags while
doing your model conversions,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.050
please let us know by
filing an issue on GitHub.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.020
And if you have any
feedback on TensorFlow 2.0,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.630
make sure to let the team
know by sending an email

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.880
to testing@TensorFlow.org.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.730
You can find a link to that in
the video description below.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.040
We're excited to hear what you
think and happy engineering.
