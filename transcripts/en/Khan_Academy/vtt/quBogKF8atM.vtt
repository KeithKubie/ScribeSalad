00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.663
- Lynn Margulis's theory

00:00:02.663 --> 00:00:07.412
that evolution is a process
involving interdependency

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:11.638
rather than competition among organisms

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:15.278
differs dramatically from most biologists,

00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:16.723
or no error.

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.052
So this is a little interesting.

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:18.953
Let's just think about what

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:20.668
the sentence is comparing.

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:23.551
They're comparing Lynn Margulis's theory

00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.610
that evolution is a process
involving interdependency

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.436
rather than competition among organisms.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.048
They're saying that that theory

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:34.058
differs dramatically from most biologists.

00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:35.811
So this sentence

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.780
as it's constructed right over here,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.171
it's comparing a theory,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.811
it's comparing Lynn Margulis's theory,

00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.899
it's comparing that to,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.931
they're saying the theory
differs dramatically

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:48.734
from most biologists.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:49.767
Well this is weird.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.038
You're comparing a theory to people?

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:54.596
You're comparing a theory to biologists?

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:55.810
No, what you really want to do

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.339
is compare the theory

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.391
to the biologists' theory,

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.470
to the biologists' ideas.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.740
So if you wanted to make this

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.040
make sense,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.207
you would say, "differs dramatically from"

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:08.150
not "most biologists,"

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.542
you would want to say, "most biologists',

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.743
most biologists'"

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:17.134
and it's possessive,

00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:20.219
"most biologists' theories,"

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:22.819
or ideas,

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.151
so you would cross this out.

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.359
Notice, you're comparing
Lynn Margulis's theory to,

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.182
and you're saying, "Lynn Margulis's theory

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:32.850
differs dramatically from,"

00:01:33.173 --> 00:01:34.924
not most biologists,

00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:36.789
but "differs dramatically from

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.289
most biologists' theories."

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.175
You want to compare Lynn Margulis's theory

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:42.724
to the other biologists' theories.

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:43.634
You don't want to compare

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:45.351
a theory to the actual people.

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:45.966
That's just--

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.751
you're comparing weird--

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.082
you're comparing, well,
it doesn't make sense.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:51.002
You're comparing an idea

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:54.615
to actual physical, living human beings.

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:57.617
So, definitely error in Part D.
