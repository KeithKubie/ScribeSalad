00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:17.000
(Music)

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.400
OK, so I'm going to give you a tour of the setup here:

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.320
So, we've got a thirty round magazine of .22 bullets

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.560
and we've got my Ruger 10/22 rifle--that I always use--,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.760
I've got a controller

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.600
for a camera that's sitting at the other end of the garage.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
So that's how we're going to trigger the camera in the dark.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.940
We control the dark, here, by a little remote control...

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
...that flips a relay.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.360
So that's how we're doing this.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.720
So I am controlling:

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.740
the weapon,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.800
the light,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.720
the camera,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.660
the flash

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.900
-with this--,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.680
and... the delay generator.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.280
Let's check the aim...

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.720
... of the weapon.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.180
Aim on the weapon is good.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.540
...get the flash...

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.700
... centered.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.700
Test flash:

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.300
*snap*

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.080
Alright.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.800
I think everything is good!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.540
Let's load!

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.120
*sounds of shutter snap and gunshot*

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.880
*sounds of shutter snap and gunshot*
