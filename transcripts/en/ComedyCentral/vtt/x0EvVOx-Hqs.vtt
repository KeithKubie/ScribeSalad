00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.503
Like my dad used to say when
I asked if he was proud of me,

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.638
"Hey, let's talk about sports."

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.939
(laughter)

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:08.975
The NBA Finals started
on Thursday,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.677
and in game two last night,
the Golden State Warriors

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.846
beat the Cleveland LeBron James.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.281
-(laughter)
-Now...

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:18.985
I've been suspicious of the NBA
ever since I first learned

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:23.589
of their nefarious plot to force
Jazz on the people of Utah.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.325
But... the NBA is
now so progressive

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.628
that it's not just
one of my enemies,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.230
like fiber
and dogs with human names.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:34.967
No. The NBA deserves
an even more evil title:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.436
Nemesis.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.238 line:0%
(rock music playing)

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.274 line:0%
(cheering, applause)

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.544 line:0%
And I can't expose a threat
this big without a teammate,

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.547 line:0%
so let's bring in
citizen-journalist Tim Baltz.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.516
(cheering, applause)

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.919
-Would you stop...
-Thanks, Jordan.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.487
Shoot.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.722
-I...
-Thanks, Jordan.

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.658
Thanks, Jordan.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.961
So psyched to be on your squad.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.463
I... I said
don't bring the ball...

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.198
I said don't bring
the ball on set.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.033
-You need to put that away.
-Don't worry,

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.269
-I won't play with it, I swear.
-Put... put it away.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.271
-I won't...
-Fine. Now, Tim,

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:15.608
the NBA has become a...
a total abomination

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.478
to American values--
tell me I'm right.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.279 line:0%
Big time, J-dawg.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.281 line:0%
Instead of shutting up
and balling hard,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.350 line:0%
these rock pounders
have become mouthpieces

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.085 line:0%
of progressive politics.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.688
There are teams wearing
"I can't breathe" shirts,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.257
and players giving speeches
about police violence.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.926
Plus, LeBron James called
President Trump's views

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.429
"laughable and scary."

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:37.864
That's treason.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.266
The only two adjectives
acceptable for our president

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.302
are sexy, and-- oops,
I already said sexy.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.405
I guess it's just one adjective.

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:49.542
The NBA needs to respond
to these protests

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:52.378
the way the NFL is going to,
by fining teams.

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.580
And that will really sting
because NFL owners

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.350
are notoriously poor.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.486
But, of course, goody-two-shoes
Warriors coach, Steve Kerr,

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.956
had to stick his nose
in the NFL's business.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.042
Patriotism in America isn't
about protesting.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:25.845
Oh, no, no. It's about fireworks
and eagles,

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.881
and the EPA letting us use
fireworks to shoot down eagles.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.516
Yeah.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.418
They're a bunch of leggy
limousine liberals.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.487
Plus, they've been infiltrated
by globalists.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.055
Yeah, literally.

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:38.724
More than a fifth of the league
is now foreign born players

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.960
from 42 countries
and territories,

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.095
and they're avoiding
technical fouls

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:45.198
by swearing
in their native tongues.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.667
It's disgraceful.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.036
I mean, what's to stop
some French guy from saying:

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.039
(speaking French)

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.241
(laughter)

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:56.742
I have no clue what that means,

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:58.911
which makes it
even more offensive.

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:00.546
Yeah. Big time.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.548
It means go jerk off
at the grocery store,

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.318
you dirty asshole.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.987
(laughter)

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.325
Very long story behind
how I know that.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.160
Basically, I was standing
outside of a grocery store...

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.628
You got to move on.
You got to move on.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:17.029
Just move on. Move on.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.364
-Right. Okay.
-Keep it moving.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.600
The point is, the league
is trying to tell us

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.368
these foreigners are good
for the game,

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:24.437
but that's just globalist spin.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.771
No, don't. S-- Don't, Tim. No.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.240
-It's just globalist spin.
-No, no, no. Tim, no.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.975
-Hold on. It's globalist spin.
-Don't. No. Just hold--

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.476
You need to hold it
with two hands, Tim.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.844
-Ugh, I broke a-- yeah.
-Tim. Hold it, all right?

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.113
-I broke a nail. -Mo-- No.
Hold it. Hold-- Can you...?

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.849
Move on. Move on to women and
how they're ruining basketball.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.751
Oh, are they ever.

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:40.353
Great.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:43.456
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.425
Not only does the NBA have
the first female assistant coach

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.494
in major league sports,
Becky Hammon,

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.963
they also were the first
professional sport

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.633
with not one,
but three female referees.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.668
(whooping)

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.870
I mean,
besides major league soccer.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.172
Yes, so, yeah, they were
the first professional sport.

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.008
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.210
Female refs, Jordan,
think about it.

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:08.247
Women are whistling at men.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.183
They're stealing our
construction site moves.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:14.220
Yeah, female refs is a bad call.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.322
If I wanted a woman to tell me
I'd done something wrong,

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.358
I'd get married and expose her
to my personal habits.

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.360
(laughter)

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:25.264
Sorry, but these gals
aren't getting a pass.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:29.035
No. Don't. Don't pa-- Don't. No.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:32.571
-They're not getting a pass.
-No. Don't pa-- Don't. No.

00:04:32.604 --> 00:04:34.540
Don't. No. Don't.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.275
-On-On the issue of...
-No. Don't.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.843
Uh, being in--

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.412
-They're not getting a pass.
-Don't. Don't. Just...

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.913
You know what? Just-Just-Just...

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.648
Just go. Just do-- finish.

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.751
Just-Just finish
this (bleep) segment.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.820
Okay, all right.

00:04:47.853 --> 00:04:52.058
So the NBA actually stands for
National Beta Association,

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:55.895
because the players have gotten
softer than good toilet paper.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:58.898
I mean, take a look
at these cucks, Jordan.

Jesus. Kevin Love is about

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.960
Yeah, at the end of the finals,
the coach is gonna get showered

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:29.929
with a cooler full of kombucha.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.397
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.534
That's a yeast infection
just waiting to happen.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.870
Here's what's worse.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:39.739
That in spite of
all these namaste

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.674
and plants-chomping
wine-sniffers,

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:44.076
the NBA's ratings are now
at a four-year high.

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:45.511
And it doesn't track.

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:47.513
It's like the more progressive
the league gets,

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:49.415
the more popular it becomes.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:51.984
-Free thinkers... yeah.
-(whooping, applause)

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:54.687
We need to shut
this nemesis down.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.090
Yes. Then the other sports
can steal their viewers.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:00.693
No, don't. No. Don't.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.695
And then the networks
will block their games.

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.397
Don't. Stop it.
No, just-- No. Okay.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.165
So that Trump
can full-court press them.

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:07.600
-Okay. No. Stop it. Don't.
-Man-on-man,

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.001
-Please don't. No. No.
-One-on-one,

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.503
-until the advertisers
call foul. -No. No.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.937
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop hitting.
-Or a technical foul.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.672
-Tim Baltz. Stop it.
-Or a flagrant foul.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.841
The fight continues.
The fight -- Stop it. Stop it.

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.311
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
