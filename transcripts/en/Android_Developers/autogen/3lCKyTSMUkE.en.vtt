device that's without a sim card so it's

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:48.020
device that's without a sim card so it's
 

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.680
device that's without a sim card so it's
kind of not really a real scenario mom

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:52.690
kind of not really a real scenario mom
 

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.310
kind of not really a real scenario mom
so I guess I shoulders counter for that

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320

indicated it's just that yeah I think

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:01.470
indicated it's just that yeah I think
 

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.490
indicated it's just that yeah I think
it's abusing the the standard behavior

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500
it's abusing the the standard behavior
 

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.980
it's abusing the the standard behavior
because right now it's going up in the

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:06.990
because right now it's going up in the
 

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.840
because right now it's going up in the
hierarchy right oh and I mean you you

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:11.850
hierarchy right oh and I mean you you
 

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.770
hierarchy right oh and I mean you you
might argue that uh sliding in menu is

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780
might argue that uh sliding in menu is
 

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.490
might argue that uh sliding in menu is
the upper or the top-level node in your

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500
the upper or the top-level node in your
 

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.580
the upper or the top-level node in your
hierarchy but way it's not really is it

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:22.590
hierarchy but way it's not really is it
 

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:29.370
hierarchy but way it's not really is it
like nobody I've started

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:29.380
 

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.410
other than when people go sliding menu

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:31.420
other than when people go sliding menu
 

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.930
other than when people go sliding menu
from the left and from the right yeah

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:33.940
from the left and from the right yeah
 

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.690
from the left and from the right yeah
I'm what drinking doesn't the design

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:36.700
I'm what drinking doesn't the design
 

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.610
I'm what drinking doesn't the design

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:38.620
site say that the slide and men you can
 

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.880
site say that the slide and men you can
only be at the top level yeah it's like

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:41.890
only be at the top level yeah it's like
 

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:47.990
only be at the top level yeah it's like
an activity group of some sort because

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000
an activity group of some sort because
 

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.380
an activity group of some sort because
you can refer to it as the main holder

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:52.390
you can refer to it as the main holder
 

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:56.550
you can refer to it as the main holder
for all the as the root holder for all

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560
for all the as the root holder for all
 

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.270

the other actions you can do on on your

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280
the other actions you can do on on your
 

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.150
the other actions you can do on on your
application yeah and the other thing I

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160
application yeah and the other thing I
 

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.410
application yeah and the other thing I
kind of dislike about it is when you

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:07.420
kind of dislike about it is when you
 

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.580
kind of dislike about it is when you
have such a big space for options I

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:10.590
have such a big space for options I
 

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.560
have such a big space for options I
think people who tend to like overload

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:13.570
think people who tend to like overload
 

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.430
think people who tend to like overload
in terms of like uh options so you just

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440
in terms of like uh options so you just
 

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.380
in terms of like uh options so you just
have too many nodes you don't hierarchy

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:19.390
have too many nodes you don't hierarchy
 

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.690
have too many nodes you don't hierarchy
just because you have space for it right

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:21.700
just because you have space for it right
 

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.420
just because you have space for it right
and you see if you think see things like

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.430
and you see if you think see things like
 

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:27.090
and you see if you think see things like
Facebook like it has like huge thing

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:27.100
Facebook like it has like huge thing
 

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.150
Facebook like it has like huge thing
like Google+ has like uses it in a kind

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160
like Google+ has like uses it in a kind
 

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.310
like Google+ has like uses it in a kind
of a smarter way because it uses the

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320
of a smarter way because it uses the
 

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.860
of a smarter way because it uses the
space for showing more notifications so

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:34.870
space for showing more notifications so
 

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.620
space for showing more notifications so
that's fine but let steel is tempting

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:37.630
that's fine but let steel is tempting
 

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.450
that's fine but let steel is tempting
because you have this huge vertical

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:39.460
because you have this huge vertical
 

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.880
because you have this huge vertical
infinite vertical space for adding

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:41.890
infinite vertical space for adding
 

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:46.200
infinite vertical space for adding
options and in the case of mobile apps I

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.210
options and in the case of mobile apps I
 

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.270
options and in the case of mobile apps I
don't think that's a good thing to like

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280
don't think that's a good thing to like
 

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.870
don't think that's a good thing to like
to do so I don't know constraints are

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880
to do so I don't know constraints are
 

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.470
to do so I don't know constraints are
good thing in a mobile are in general I

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480
good thing in a mobile are in general I
 

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.280

think so oh yeah we dropped else we

00:38:59.280 --> 00:38:59.290
think so oh yeah we dropped else we
 

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.600

might miss some of the conversation but

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:00.610
might miss some of the conversation but
 

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.640
might miss some of the conversation but
we're by now and I think two things only

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:02.650
we're by now and I think two things only
 

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.460
we're by now and I think two things only
touch to that firstly I think it's a the

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:05.470
touch to that firstly I think it's a the
 

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.290
touch to that firstly I think it's a the
gesture is kind of like a power user

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:07.300
gesture is kind of like a power user
 

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.080
gesture is kind of like a power user
same that's how I think that I think you

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.090
same that's how I think that I think you
 

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.610
same that's how I think that I think you
need to have some on-screen affordance

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:11.620
need to have some on-screen affordance
 

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.930
need to have some on-screen affordance
that you're saying that you don't you

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:12.940
that you're saying that you don't you
 

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.220
that you're saying that you don't you
can't have this kind of you have to try

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:14.230
can't have this kind of you have to try
 

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.990
can't have this kind of you have to try
and see I think you need to have some

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000
and see I think you need to have some
 

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.580
and see I think you need to have some
on-screen forward and so our preference

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:17.590
on-screen forward and so our preference
 

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.350
on-screen forward and so our preference
would be to use the app carrot to

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:19.360
would be to use the app carrot to
 

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.680
would be to use the app carrot to
disclose it that's our guidelines and

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:21.690
disclose it that's our guidelines and
 

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.480
disclose it that's our guidelines and

all very much see the bezel swipe and
 

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.170
all very much see the bezel swipe and
all the swiping is a secondary way of

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:31.180
all the swiping is a secondary way of
 

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.760
all the swiping is a secondary way of
launching and so in that way I'm not so

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:35.770
launching and so in that way I'm not so
 

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.930
