00:00:00.677 --> 00:00:01.852
What I want to do in this video is

00:00:01.852 --> 00:00:04.224
focus a little bit more on the results of the last video.

00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:07.799
Make sure that they make intuitive and mathematical sense to us

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.307
because something slightly strange happened.

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:13.724
We had a linear demand curve right over here,

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.726
which means for any given change in price right over here.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.116
So in all of the examples,

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:22.149
whether we went from A to B or C to D or E to F,

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.349
we had a $1 drop in price.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.126
we had a $1 drop in price.....a $1 drop in price.

00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:32.228
And every time we had a $1 drop in price

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.188
we had a $2 increase, oh sorry,

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:37.362
we had a 2 unit increase in quantity demanded.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:40.734
So we had a 2 unit increase in quantity demanded.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.030
This is a linear demand curve.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.331
But despite the fact that for each dollar drop in price,

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.319
we had the same increase in quantity demanded.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.275
The slightly maybe un-intuitive thing that happened

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:55.598
was that we had a slight, we had a different -

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:58.740
actually very different elasticity of demand.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.177
And you might imagine that

00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:01.872
it probably had something to do with the fact that

00:01:01.872 --> 00:01:03.792
elasticity of demand is based on

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:09.407
% change in quantity relative to % change in prices,

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:12.168
instead of just change in quantity over change in price.

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:14.538
If it was just change in quantity over change in price,

00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:16.838
we would get something...it would be constant.

00:01:16.838 --> 00:01:19.468
But we saw very very different results.

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:21.337
When you look closely at these,

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:25.455
so let's focus on this region between A and B right over here,

00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:27.391
we had a $1 change in price.

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.669
Our $1 change in price was on a relatively large base,

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.087
our price was already high.

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:35.153
Remember we used to figure out the % change,

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.068
we use a dollar over the average,

00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:38.876
the average of our 2 points.

00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:40.464
so we don't do $1 over 9

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:42.700
because then we would have a different elasticity

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.584
when we went from A to B

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.150
then when we went from B to A.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.042
A dollar over 9 versus a dollar over 8

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.908
would give you 2 different percentages.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:52.090
Instead we say a dollar over eight and a half.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.547
So this per price % change was in the teens

00:01:55.547 --> 00:02:00.122
while this quantity % change is going to be with 67%

00:02:00.122 --> 00:02:03.698
2 over an average quantity of 3

00:02:03.698 --> 00:02:05.480
in this region right over here.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.557
So you had a relatively large,

00:02:07.557 --> 00:02:09.786
actually quite large % change in quantity

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:13.492
over relatively small % change in price.

00:02:13.492 --> 00:02:16.203
67% over something that's in,

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:19.171
roughly in the mid-teens percentage.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.933
And so that's why the absolute value of our elasticity of demand

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.651
was a relatively large number.

00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:26.426
If you don't think about the absolute value,

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:27.287
you get a negative number

00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:31.052
because this is a downward sloping line.

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:32.972
But if you focus on the absolute value,

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:35.926
it's a - the magnitude of it- is a relatively large number,

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.174
a relatively large % change in quantity

00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:41.635
relative to your % change in price.

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:43.713
And it all comes out of, your quantities are low here.

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:45.787
So if you move 2 on a low base,

00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:48.199
you are going to have a large % change in quantity

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.334
and your prices are relatively high here.

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:53.666
So a change in 1 isn't going to be that large of a percentage.

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:55.892
But what you have,

00:02:55.892 --> 00:02:58.831
when your absolute value of your elasticity of demand

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.693
is greater than 1, like it is right over here,

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:04.884
so when your absolute value of your elasticity of demand

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.542
is greater than 1,

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:09.791
it's usually called, at this point in the curve,

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:15.386
is ELASTIC or generally elastic. So this is elastic.

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:18.028
You get some nice % movements in quantity

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.830
for given % change in price.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.318
Then when you go over here, our prices have gone -

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:26.055
our prices are lower

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.407
when we are in this region between C and D.

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.536
So that dollar difference is going to be

00:03:30.536 --> 00:03:32.578
a larger % change in price

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.528
and our quantities are higher,

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:37.902
so that $2 change is going to be a lower change in quantity,

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:39.836
and actually end up being the same thing,

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:41.465
because you have a dollar change in price

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:44.094
over an average base of 5, right?

00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:46.758
The average between 5.50 and 4.50 is 5.

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:50.846
So if you have a 20% change in price, a 20% drop in price,

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:54.504
and you have a 20% increase in quantity -

00:03:54.504 --> 00:03:58.108
a 20% increase in quantity.

00:03:58.108 --> 00:04:00.365
So let me write, this isn't the teens over here,

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.926
my writing fitting is too small so I won't do that.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:04.785
So you have a 20% change in price

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.550
and a 20% increase in quantity.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.999
That's 20% because you have 2 over the average here.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.961
2 over 10, so 20% increase.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.423
So that's why your elasticity of demand or

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.793
the magnitude of your elasticity of demand is exactly 1.

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:23.303
And if your magnitude of your elasticity of demand is exactly 1,

00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:26.852
we say that you have UNIT ELASTICITY at that point,

00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:29.030
elasticity.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.980
And then finally if you go all the way down here,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.040
our prices end up being quite low -

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.496
our prices are quite low

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:39.948
so a dollar change is actually a huge % price change, right?

00:04:39.948 --> 00:04:44.700
Our average base here is $1.50 in this region right over here.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.191
And so a dollar over a $1.50.

00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:54.541
It's a huge, it's actually a 67% change in price.

00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:57.978
67, yep that's right. yeah $1 is a 2/3 change in price.

00:04:57.978 --> 00:04:59.970
it's a huge % change in price.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.909
But once again now our quantity is much larger

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.080
so $2 increase isn't that large of a change in quantity.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.100
So you have a smaller % change in quantity

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.387
over a large % change in price.

00:05:11.387 --> 00:05:14.154
So that just means you're relatively inelastic.

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:17.194
You are not getting a lot of change in quantity

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:20.617
for the magnitude of your change in price.

00:05:20.617 --> 00:05:21.782
So if your -

00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:25.004
If the magnitude of the elasticity of demand

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:27.138
is less than 1 over here,

00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:30.984
we call that either relatively inelastic or just inelastic.

00:05:30.984 --> 00:05:34.588
In...elas...tic.

00:05:34.588 --> 00:05:36.210
So I'll leave you there in this video,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.854
and just I want you to really kind of internalize

00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:40.581
what we're doing here, especially with the maths.

00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:43.804
And especially understanding why the elasticity is changed here.

00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:46.003
Get you thinking in terms of percentages.

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:48.585
And also make you, hopefully you'll appreciate

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:51.341
why we're taking the average of these 2 points.

00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:54.306
When we find the denominator for the percentages

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.600
instead of just taking 1 of the 2 points,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.405
we get the same elasticity of demand

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:01.000
either direction we go in.
