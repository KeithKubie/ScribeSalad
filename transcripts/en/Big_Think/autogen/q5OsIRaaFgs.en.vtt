we've talked about neural Anatomy we've

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
we've talked about neural Anatomy we've
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.679
we've talked about neural Anatomy we've
talked about neural chemistry the last

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689
talked about neural chemistry the last
 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:16.550

bit is neuro electricity so what we now

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
bit is neuro electricity so what we now
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.000
bit is neuro electricity so what we now
know happens in flow is our brain waves

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
know happens in flow is our brain waves
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.859
know happens in flow is our brain waves
which are kind of normally in waking

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869
which are kind of normally in waking
 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599
which are kind of normally in waking
consciousness up in beta this is a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
consciousness up in beta this is a
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.000
consciousness up in beta this is a
fast-moving wave it gets really excited

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
fast-moving wave it gets really excited
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620
fast-moving wave it gets really excited
and you go up to and kind of into stress

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
and you go up to and kind of into stress
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960
and you go up to and kind of into stress
responses right it moves down to alpha

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
responses right it moves down to alpha
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970
responses right it moves down to alpha
which is a daydreaming mode and then

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
which is a daydreaming mode and then
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.240
which is a daydreaming mode and then
below that is theta theta is only

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
below that is theta theta is only
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310
below that is theta theta is only
accessible in the hypnagogic status

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
accessible in the hypnagogic status
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.600
accessible in the hypnagogic status
we're starting to fall asleep or in

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
we're starting to fall asleep or in
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520
we're starting to fall asleep or in
dreaming and REM sleep flow takes place

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
dreaming and REM sleep flow takes place
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.340
dreaming and REM sleep flow takes place
on the border between alpha and theta it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
on the border between alpha and theta it
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170
on the border between alpha and theta it
just kind of hovers there so it's a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
just kind of hovers there so it's a
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299
just kind of hovers there so it's a
radical change in normal brain function

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
radical change in normal brain function
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639
radical change in normal brain function
but something else really really cool

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
but something else really really cool
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250
but something else really really cool
happens so we talked earlier about how

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
happens so we talked earlier about how
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
happens so we talked earlier about how
creativity is enhanced and flow one of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
creativity is enhanced and flow one of
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.479
creativity is enhanced and flow one of
the other ways that is enhanced is when

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
the other ways that is enhanced is when
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.830
the other ways that is enhanced is when
you're on the border between alpha and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
you're on the border between alpha and
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.139
you're on the border between alpha and
theta because you're in theta you can

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
theta because you're in theta you can
 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.330
theta because you're in theta you can
get a gamma spike gamma is coupled to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
get a gamma spike gamma is coupled to
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160
get a gamma spike gamma is coupled to
the theta wave it's a very fast-moving

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
the theta wave it's a very fast-moving
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010
the theta wave it's a very fast-moving
wave and it only shows up when ideas are

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
wave and it only shows up when ideas are
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.060
wave and it only shows up when ideas are
coming together when we have that aha

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
coming together when we have that aha
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.420
coming together when we have that aha
moment right that's a gamma spike gammas

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
moment right that's a gamma spike gammas
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520
moment right that's a gamma spike gammas
coupled the data so it can only show if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
coupled the data so it can only show if
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770
coupled the data so it can only show if
you could only get that aha moment if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
you could only get that aha moment if
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.350
you could only get that aha moment if
you're in data and flow by pushing us to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
you're in data and flow by pushing us to
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820
you're in data and flow by pushing us to
the borderline between alpha and theta

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
the borderline between alpha and theta
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.340
the borderline between alpha and theta
sort of sets us up to have massive

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
sort of sets us up to have massive
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.470
sort of sets us up to have massive
startling with insights

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480
startling with insights
 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.540
startling with insights
