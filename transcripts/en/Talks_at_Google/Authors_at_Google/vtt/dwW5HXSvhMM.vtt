[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.150
KERRY ANN KING: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.649
Welcome.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.480
If you don't know who I
am, I'm Kerry Ann King.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.150
I do fitness stuff
here in the office.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.440
And this is Will Dean.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.100
He is the founder and
CEO of Tough Mudder.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.490
I have to look at my notes here.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.300
$100 million in annual revenue,
$13 million for charity,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.820
Crain's 40 Under 40,
Fortune's 40 Under 40.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.460
150,000 Twitter followers
for Tough Mudder.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.650
2.5 million people have
signed up for these races.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.340
I had 3,000 people with the
logo tattooed on their bodies,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.450
but evidently it's a little
bit higher than that now.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.550
That's an amazing
thing to have built--

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.840
WILL DEAN: Thank you.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.910
KERRY ANN KING: --off of,
let's run around in the mud

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.610
and run over some obstacles.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.950
Now it's international.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.010
There's TV.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.260
I loved reading this book.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.090
The best way I can
describe it is it's

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.690
a moving business book,
or a motivational book

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.150
with incredible business advice.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.670
That's the only way
I can describe it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.530
It was actually quite touching.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.790
And one of the things that
amazed me about reading it

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.630
was how deep this
really goes for you.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.530
This concept might have come
to you at some point later

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.400
in life, but it really
begins with the beginning

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.960
of your story, kind of growing
up in something that I got

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.880
to experience
firsthand, which is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.205
a depressed post-industrial
town in northern England.

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:44.830
WILL DEAN: Yes.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.570
That's where I'm from.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.700
And writing a book, it is such
a fascinating journey to go on.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.324
And you start with
these ideas as

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:56.740
to what you're going to write
and you reflect a bit on it.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.860
And I think I always
knew that, for me,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.710
Tough Mudder was, as much as
it's a business and, of course,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.530
a money making entity,
it is this purpose-driven

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.220
organization.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.020
You're all fortunate
you also all work

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.440
at a purpose-driven organization
with a very clear mission,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.080
here at Google.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.050
But I think, as I
started to reflect

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.670
on the mission of
the company-- and we

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.560
talk about building
a global tribe that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.610
lives the values of teamwork,
camaraderie, courage,

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.370
personal
accomplishment, and fun.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.290
And you start asking
yourself the question--

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.820
which at the back of your mind
you already know the answer

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.903
to, but you start trying
to put it down on paper--

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:30.737
why did you do this?

00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:32.320
And one of the things
that I certainly

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.569
realized as I looked through
my entire life-- starting

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.850
as a child and my experiences
then through to undergraduate,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.650
five years in counterterrorism,
then the MBA program--

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.230
was this sense of always
being somewhere I didn't quite

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.885
feel like I fitted in.

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.260
And what's been
very interesting,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.552
the reaction to the book so
far is so many other people

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:51.134
have said that that
was something that

00:02:51.134 --> 00:02:52.269
really resonated with them.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.310
And perhaps not something
we're all conscious of.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.660
We spend our lives
walking around feeling

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.280
like we don't quite
fit in places,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.890
and most other people are
also feeling the same way.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.377
And to try and
answer your question,

00:03:03.377 --> 00:03:05.710
I grew up in a part of England
where you don't generally

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.730
meet that many people.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.646
Certainly if you're in
New York, you generally

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.930
don't meet many people who
are from South Yorkshire.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.430
And people say, oh,
where's it near?

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.620
And you say, um, Sheffield.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.020
And they go, never
heard of that.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.635
And they say, is it near London?

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:20.260
And you're sort of
like, well, no, it's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.800
the other end of the country.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.580
And it's funny because
when I'm in London,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.634
Brits will say, oh, your
family are from there.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:29.175
And they're surprised
to hear, here's

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:31.049
a guy with a company
who's got a Harvard MBA.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.790
And they say, oh, does your
family have land up there?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.230
Because in their mind, that's
the only kind of person

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.188
that would be a successful
person in London who

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:40.504
started there.

00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:42.670
I was fortunate my parents
were professional people,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.420
but they were--

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.700
my dad is the one lawyer
in this town, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.190
which is a former
pit mining town,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.150
and which has since
been quite decimated

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.660
with the loss of the mine.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.600
And so I think that was a
very personal part for me,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.530
this idea of a very, very tight
community kind of ripped apart

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.380
and what it means to be part
of something, a community,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.097
where people look
out for one another.

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:05.680
And what that means
when you lose that

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.011
was definitely something
that definitely

00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:09.010
in the back of my mind--

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.430
my parents still live there--

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.115
was part of what drove me
to create an event that

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:14.740
is very much about
community and people

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.714
coming together and
doing something together.

00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:17.589
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.680
I felt that very much
reading the book,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.010
that this kind of search
for solidarity that you

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.080
saw in yourself, that you also
saw in the world and decided

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.200
to create your own
solution for it.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.690
We'll go back a little bit
to the foreign service,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.130
but I just wanted to--

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.190
the moment where you realized
that that solidarity was

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.490
really necessary.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.562
I think you were in a
triathlon, and that was--

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:43.270
WILL DEAN: I was.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.090
I was getting my MBA.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.100
And so I was in this
business school,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.132
hyper-competitive
environment to start with,

00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:52.090
where everyone's on these
kind of forced curves

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.214
as to how you're all doing.

00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:55.916
And most people there are these
very Type A personalities.

00:04:55.916 --> 00:04:58.110
So you put all those
people together, it

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.554
creates a kind of crazy outcome.

00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:01.720
And I remember doing a
triathlon whilst I was there,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.660
with some HBS colleagues.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.920
And this was an event of
which there was absolutely

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.190
no danger I was going to win,
absolutely none whatsoever.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.970
And I finished the swim
section, about to start the bike

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.660
section.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.750
And you're in the
transition zone.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.340
And the zipper on my
wetsuit had jammed,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.385
and I just couldn't
get it undone myself.

00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.010
And I turned to the guy next to
me, as you are to me right now,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.750
and I said, can you
just pull on this?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.300
And transition times really
matter in triathlons.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.650
And the guy said no.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.360
I mean, I was probably
asking for three,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.110
five seconds of his time.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.720
And that happened to me twice
before somebody helped me.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.170
And I just found that so weird.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.330
Because I'm sure they
weren't bad people,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.190
but there was something about
the environment in which they

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.350
found themselves that just
frankly didn't bring out

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.550
the best in humanity.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.680
And I thought a bit about this.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.510
And for any of
you that have done

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.329
a marathon or a half
marathon, I don't

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:54.370
know if anyone in the room
has done one of those.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.640
Anyone done a-- OK, a couple.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.490
So when you do a marathon--

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.680
I've done a marathon--
the first question you

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.420
get when you've
done the marathon

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.760
is, oh, what time
did you do it in?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.386
First question.

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.218
And so you answer that
question, and you say

00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:09.530
whatever time you did it in.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.230
And in my case, I was
aiming for sub-four hours,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.290
and I achieved that.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.580
And so I was happy enough.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.130
And inevitably, someone then
says, oh, my brother-in-law

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.640
did it quicker.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.630
And you're like,
oh, that's good.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.190
And you feel like saying,
yeah, I know I didn't win.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.720
I know those Kenyans were
a long way ahead of me.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000
And that got me thinking.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
For most people, a
race isn't really

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.910
a race in the classic
sense of the word.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.660
It's not about where
do you place overall.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.940
It's much more about
personal achievement

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.850
and you have a goal in
mind, but it's not really

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.260
about other people.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.250
And I thought, is it possible
to create an event that you

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.660
yourself still
achieve something,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.600
but you're part of something
bigger than yourself,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.000
and you can have fun and you
can do it as part of a team,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.280
and you can also not take
yourself too seriously.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.380
And it seemed, certainly
in the triathlon,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.190
people were taking
themselves far too seriously

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.500
in what was an amateur event
of where the people next to me

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.415
were, by definition, also
midway down the field, as well.

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:14.715
And so that was certainly
the inspiration behind it.

00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:15.590
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.640
And I feel like that sounds
to me very much in line

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.560
with how you approach all of the
problems that you're solving.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.780
How do we use this tension
between personal achievement

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.960
and group achievement to
create the best outcome?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.390
Rather than just, I got
to the top of the pile.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.790
I hope you guys had fun, too.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.290
WILL DEAN: No, and look, it's
something I really believe in.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.460
I think a lot of our early
lives' education systems

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.600
tend to put very high emphasis
on individual achievement,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.120
very high.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.640
What mark did I get?

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.870
How did I do?

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.670
Are you smart, yes or no?

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.310
And the truth is,
in life, very few

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.790
of us can go and
be successful based

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.540
upon our individual
achievements.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.120
Maybe writing, it's actually
one of the few examples

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.340
where it is kind of
about one person.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.260
But even then, it's
not really just you.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.270
You still have a
team around you--

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.200
editors, publishers,
book agents, et cetera.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.030
But in a business environment,
it's very different.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.000
I can say I founded
Tough Mudder,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.130
but at best I'm 5%
of the equation--

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.312
at best, frankly far less.

00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:26.270
It's about all the other
people in the company.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.310
But far more than that,
it's about the community

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.870
and the tribe that's
kind of built up

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.790
around that, of
which now I'm frankly

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.370
a very small cog in
that bigger system.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.760
And I think far too many people
talk about their achievement--

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.770
or think that achievements
are about things

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.850
you do on your own.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.090
And some things in
life, that's true.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.590
But the vast majority of things,
including the vast majority

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.590
of obstacles at Tough
Mudder to kind of bring it

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.506
back to the event,
they do require

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:51.380
you to work with other
people to get through.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.030
And you can be proud of yourself
at the end of the course

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.130
that you did it, and you
got yourself through.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.360
No one else carried you.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.530
Or in most cases, no
one else carried you.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.530
But they probably helped
you up Everest and some

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.488
of the other obstacles.

00:09:01.488 --> 00:09:03.610
And I think there's something
in there about life,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.180
a lesson in life, and
being willing to ask

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.230
for help, which I think a
lot of people struggle with.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.660
KERRY ANN KING: So speaking of
being willing to ask for help,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.770
I'd love to talk about those
early days of Tough Mudder.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.600
It's this big international
organization now.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.170
But as you can imagine,
it did not start that way.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.495
Tell us about that first event.

00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:26.120
WILL DEAN: Yes.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.830
It was an amazing experience.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.250
My co-founder and I,
we both had $10,000.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.960
The total start-up
budget, $20,000.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.315
We spent about $10,000
driving around fields

00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:41.690
outside of New York trying to
figure out what the hell we

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.231
were looking for in
terms of a venue,

00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:45.540
mostly getting
laughed out of town.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.110
We eventually found a
ski hill just outside

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.474
of Allentown, Pennsylvania.

00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:51.140
And having not grown
up in this country,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.730
I genuinely thought Allentown
was a fictitious place only

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.240
in a Billy Joel song.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.770
And so we found this ski hill.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.320
We gave him a $1,000 deposit.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.025
I honestly think they thought
they'd never see us again.

00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.200
And we built this
very simple website,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.630
really just a landing page
linked to a registration

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.430
platform on the back end.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.980
And we were-- I don't know if
I'm allowed to use this word

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.120
whilst I'm over at Google--

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.610
but we were one of the first
advertisers on Facebook

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.280
back in 2010.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.930
And I remember two weeks in,
we hadn't sold any tickets,

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.430
not one.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.200
I think my sister had
bought one to test

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.170
the website was working for us.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.880
And we had a price rise.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.750
The first event, tickets
went from $50 to $60.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.885
And at about 8:00 that
evening-- the price rise

00:10:39.885 --> 00:10:42.010
was at midnight-- things
seemed to be slowing down.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.230
And we'd sold 200 tickets.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.809
And we were hoping to sell
500 for the first event.

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.850
And Guy, my co-founder,
and I, for the first time

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.640
in about three months, we went
for a beer on a Sunday evening.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.390
We were exhausted.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.660
We were working very hard.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.456
We were subletting two desks in
this really warehouse building,

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:58.830
whilst [INAUDIBLE]
was still kind

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.930
of a warehouse
area before Equinox

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.140
and all the condos arrived.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.920
And back then, I had
a BlackBerry Pearl.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.270
Do you remember those phones?

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.240
People remember that?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.180
It wasn't that long ago.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.039
And I used to get an email every
single time we sold a ticket.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.705
And I remember getting up-- we'd
only been in this bar for about

00:11:18.705 --> 00:11:20.380
an hour or so--

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.740
and going to the restroom.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.080
And I had over 1,000 emails.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.940
And I was looking at this.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.601
And every couple of
seconds, it was refreshing.

00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:31.850
And I was like, wow, another
20 people bought tickets.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.900
Wow, another 20
people bought tickets.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.240
And we got to midnight, and
we'd sold 2,000 tickets.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.340
And I remember my
heart was beating.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.215
Sorry, I'm going to
knock the microphone off.

00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:42.930
But my heart, it was so hard.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.280
And I was excited.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.740
At the time, I had
Citigroup badgering me

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.210
about paying back
my student loans

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.900
and getting quite
aggressive about that.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.900
And then I remember Guy and I
looking at each other saying,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.320
wow, we now actually have to put
on an event for 5,000 people.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.440
And I always tell people
the first event was

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.000
an A-plus in terms
of ticket sales

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.460
and kind of proving the concept
in terms of market demand.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.080
And Steph, who's
here-- was that?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.832
You were both at
the first event.

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:14.290
I think I would say it was a
D-minus in terms of logistics.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.080
AUDIENCE: That
sounds about right.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.185
WILL DEAN: Yeah.

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:15.685
All right.

00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:16.422
There we are.

00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:17.414
AUDIENCE: Well, compared to now.

00:12:17.414 --> 00:12:18.360
WILL DEAN: Yeah, no.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.129
No, I understand.

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:19.670
I understand.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.040
No, it was objectively
a D-minus by any stretch

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.146
of the imagination.

00:12:25.146 --> 00:12:26.520
But we just about
got through it.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.603
But it was-- I mean it
was-- everything that could

00:12:28.603 --> 00:12:30.180
have gone wrong went wrong.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.520
We totally failed to plan
the car parking correctly.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.890
The road got backed up.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.500
We ran out of water at the
water station within 20 minutes.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.540
Most of the obstacles were
closed within the first hour.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.860
The course which we thought
was seven miles long

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.640
turned out to only be four
and a half miles long.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.940
And I remember this
thing started and then

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:55.860
coming back down into the
base area of the event.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.130
And 35 minutes later, the first
person crossed the finish line.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.820
And I thought, oh, God we've
made a horrible mistake here.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.450
So we just about survived
that first event.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.294
But it was very, very stressful
and we had really no idea

00:13:09.294 --> 00:13:10.460
what we were getting in for.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.590
And certainly now when I look
at the events and this kind

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.860
of army of trucks and warehouses
and event professionals

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.110
that kind of seamlessly
move around the world.

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.940
Last weekend, we
had four events on.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.070
So a start wave was going
off with various time

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.960
zones across Europe and Asia
every 15 minutes for 48 hours.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.270
And yeah, quite a far
cry from Allentown,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.220
Pennsylvania only
seven years ago.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.780
KERRY ANN KING: Which
brings up the question,

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.640
given that it was a D-minus,
what made you say, OK,

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.260
let's do that again.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.219
That seems like a good--

00:13:45.219 --> 00:13:47.010
aside from all the
ticket sales, because it

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.130
had to be more than that,
based on what I read.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.630
WILL DEAN: I think
one of the things

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.260
to be successful-- certainly
in entrepreneurship,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.870
but I suspect in
anything you do--

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.030
is to have this kind
of balanced optimism.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.380
And I think sometimes
entrepreneurs have

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.060
this kind of wild optimism.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.260
And then they inevitably
become a bit disappointed

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
when things don't all go
exactly as they planned

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.970
and become quite despondent.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.399
But I think you
have to have this,

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:12.690
for want of a better term,
kind of balanced or cautious

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.630
optimism.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.460
That yes, things won't
always go perfectly.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.710
And yes, there'll be problems.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.950
And you have to accept that many
of those, you can't anticipate.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.750
But yet still have this kind of
belief that in the long term,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.540
it will all work out.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.090
And I think I do have that,
for better or for worse.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.574
And I think for me that
came from believing-- well,

00:14:31.574 --> 00:14:33.990
I had this data point that
showed there was market demand.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.650
But over and above that,
that this was something,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.339
I had this kind of gut
feeling, a hypothesis,

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:42.630
that this is something I
would do, my friends would do,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.140
and there are other people out
there that felt the same way.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.150
And none of the barriers
that I was coming to,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.140
although some of them
were scary, none of them

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.430
felt insurmountable.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.070
And I'm not going to tie
every single point back

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.599
to the obstacle
course, but I knew

00:14:54.599 --> 00:14:55.890
there were obstacles out there.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.848
I didn't quite know what
they were going to be.

00:14:57.848 --> 00:15:00.250
And yes, they scared me,
but they didn't petrify me.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.370
And I think that kind
of cautious optimism

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.215
is probably quite a key trait
when you're starting a company.

00:15:05.215 --> 00:15:06.090
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.460
One of the other
things that struck me

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.350
about those early
days, reading the book,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:15.440
is a sense of hunger,
sometimes literal,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.280
certainly a hunger
for achievement

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.230
as part of the driving force.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.810
WILL DEAN: I mean that
was certainly there.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.440
My career-- I had spent five
years in counterterrorism,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.450
which was really an
amazing five years.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.350
I had started that after
9/11 and had this amazing set

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.640
of experiences when,
certainly in the UK,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.830
the infrastructure in
place to at least deal

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.420
with Islamic terrorism
was very, very

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.090
limited back in 2001, 2002.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.310
And so it was a very
entrepreneurial environment.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.330
Funny thing to
say, but it really

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.355
was an entrepreneurial
environment.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.660
You had lots of new problems.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.160
You had all these people that
had spent their entire careers

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.960
thinking about the
Cold War and how

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.790
to deal with the Soviet threat.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.580
And all of a sudden, a
completely new set of problems.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.680
Old ways of working don't work.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.560
And so you had all these
kind of bright young things

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.269
coming in, challenging
conventional wisdom,

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.310
getting to do new things.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.290
And I remember going
to Gordon Brown when

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.540
he was the chancellor, our
finance minister, before he

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.040
became prime minister.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.530
And we were asking
for 10 million pounds

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.510
to go and do this
thing in Pakistan.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.750
And I remember him
saying, here's 12.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.960
I mean, that was the environment
which we were in at the time.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.100
Nowadays very, very different
in terms of budgets.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.590
But it was an
amazing experience.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.050
But I'd done that.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.930
I had a great time.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.200
I think concluded in the
long term it wasn't for me.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.530
Tough place to work
on a sustained basis.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.910
Also, as it was becoming
larger, becoming

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.185
a bit more bureaucratic.

00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:44.134
And I got it into my
head I'd go to Harvard.

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.050
I'd go and get an MBA.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.466
I'd learn about "business,"
whatever I thought that meant.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:49.900
Not quite sure if I could
have really defined it then.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.340
I certainly can't now.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.852
And I had this sort
of two years that--

00:16:54.852 --> 00:16:56.435
Harvard's not a bad
place, but it just

00:16:56.435 --> 00:16:57.280
wasn't the right place--

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.700
at least Harvard Business
School is not a bad place.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.770
It just really wasn't
the right place for me.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.490
And so I'd left this career.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.599
I've gone to this prestigious
university, which I kind of got

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.150
inside and didn't find quite
as prestigious or as impressive

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.147
as I thought I was going to.

00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:12.230
And then I kind of came
out the other end of that,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.329
and there's this kind
of, ugh, what now?

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.099
And I had this very clear
desire to build something

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.849
that, in my own small
way, I thought would

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.170
make a difference in the world.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.970
And we don't pretend
at Tough Mudder

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.900
that we're curing
cancer or bringing peace

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.060
to the Middle East.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.220
But we are getting
people to spend

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.020
time with their
friends-- at least

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.140
spend a few hours not
connected to their iPhones

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.705
or other smartphone devices that
run on other operating systems.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.590
But I'm proud of that.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.827
And I think--

00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:48.160
I was only aged-- what was I
when I started the company?

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.659
28.

00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:49.300
Yes, 28.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.710
There was a desire
to prove myself.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.849
I think there was a
kind of necessity.

00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:55.390
In the early days,
it's quite binary.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.781
It either fails, or it succeeds,
at least that's how it feels.

00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:01.280
And you run very hard and you
make quite a lot of sacrifices

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:01.780
to do that.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.988
KERRY ANN KING: But this is--

00:18:02.988 --> 00:18:04.880
I have to bring this
up because this was not

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.967
Will's first venture.

00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:07.550
WILL DEAN: No.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.180
KERRY ANN KING: I know that
you had something in university

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.846
with T-shirts.

00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:12.470
WILL DEAN: Yes.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.490
A few things, yes.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.860
KERRY ANN KING: And then you
sold bags for your school

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.355
in high school?

00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:18.563
WILL DEAN: That's what I
did for my high school, yes.

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:21.090
KERRY ANN KING: Isn't there
even something in junior high

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.700
where you actually had an
entrepreneurial project going

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.200
on?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.908
WILL DEAN: I did.

00:18:24.908 --> 00:18:27.650
Amazingly in England,
it's getting better,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.810
but it is not always the most
entrepreneurial of places.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.475
And my mother recently asked
me if I sold Tough Mudder,

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:37.100
did I think I could get myself
a job in management consulting

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.900
still?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.740
I suspect so.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.045
But it isn't always that.

00:18:42.045 --> 00:18:43.670
And I think people
probably think of it

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.419
differently about
risk and achievement

00:18:45.419 --> 00:18:46.460
and those sort of things.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.085
But one of the amazing
things in the UK

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:50.630
is if you're doing reasonably
well at school, age

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.970
16 you get to drop a subject.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.220
And the British government
creates a limited liability

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.277
company for you and
they give you a mentor.

00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:58.860
And there's about
six of you, and it's

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.050
called Young Enterprise.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.007
And you're allowed to go and
trade as a limited liability

00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:05.090
company, even though you're
a bunch of high school

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.070
kids, which was great.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.400
And in the mid-1990s,
we had a static website.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.580
And we kind of had
all these crazy ideas

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.830
of things we were going to do.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.620
I mean we were like
16-, 17-year-old kids.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.230
And I managed to convince a
company out of Minnesota that

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.630
made color changing
products--you remember

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.190
the Global Hypercolor T-shirts?

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.180
Some of you are old enough
to remember the early 1990s.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.700
Anyway, so one of
the products they had

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.439
was color changing
nail polish or nail--

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:34.480
what do you call it here?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:34.910
Varnish?

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:35.300
Nail polish?

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:35.900
KERRY ANN KING: Nail polish.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.220
WILL DEAN: Nail polish.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.386
I spend so much time between
Britain and the States,

00:19:39.386 --> 00:19:40.940
I forget which words we use.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.320
Nail polish in the States.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.480
And obviously, I don't
use either nail polish

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.460
or nail vanish, but
you get my point.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.419
And they were dealing with
these literally schoolboys.

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:54.710
And we had this static website
and we were calling them

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.504
from a payphone.

00:19:55.504 --> 00:19:57.170
And they gave us the
distribution rights

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.667
to this color
changing nail polish.

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:00.125
And it was really
quite successful.

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:02.000
And we sold it through
all these trade fairs.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.580
And I really think that's
probably where I got the bug.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.150
And then I did other
things in that kind of vein

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.000
through high school
and then undergraduate.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.859
So I really enjoyed that stuff.

00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:13.900
And I thought I might,
when I finished undergrad,

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.108
go and start my own business.

00:20:15.108 --> 00:20:18.010
But then I took the other
path that entrepreneurs

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.870
take and became a
counterterrorism officer,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.300
as you do.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.800
KERRY ANN KING: So
one of the things

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.470
that strikes me about
all of these endeavors,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.420
maybe except for
the nail polish--

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.330
but all of the other
endeavors really

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.900
ended up being about
a sense of community.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.670
Even the bags for
your high school,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.440
they were kids
getting a bag that

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.517
said where they went to school.

00:20:43.517 --> 00:20:45.100
It was really
interesting to me to see

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.657
that that was a running--

00:20:48.657 --> 00:20:50.740
the desire to build a
business is a running theme,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.520
but so is the desire
to create a tribe.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.810
And that's how you talk
about Tough Mudders.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.210
We have about-- how many
members of the tribe

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.545
are in the room today?

00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:05.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.410
WILL DEAN: It counts.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.310
It counts.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.790
KERRY ANN KING: So yeah,
Google is certainly

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.980
a tribe of a
certain type, but we

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.240
have a sub-tribe of Google
Tough Mudders, as well.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.090
But I think that's
such a key piece

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.410
of what a Tough Mudder means.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.618
WILL DEAN: Well, I think it--

00:21:26.624 --> 00:21:28.040
sometimes when I
say this, I worry

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.450
that people think
it sounds cynical,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.783
because certainly I don't
think the company is this way.

00:21:31.783 --> 00:21:37.330
But I think there is an unmet
human need for belonging.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.975
And I think Tough Mudder allows
people to feel several things.

00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:42.100
They feel part of something
bigger than themselves.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.454
It doesn't take
itself too seriously.

00:21:44.454 --> 00:21:46.120
There is an achievement
at the end of it

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.495
that you can tell all of your
friends on a Monday morning

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:52.930
that you did, post about it
on social media, et cetera.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.170
And I think when I was
at business school--

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.310
and I'm not by any stretch
of the imagination--

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.120
and I'm not just saying this
because I'm at Google today--

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.670
anti-people that are going
to start tech businesses.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.600
But I think when I was
at business school,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.880
it was kind of taught
that the only kind of way

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.440
you could start a company was
to find the angel investor.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.023
Well, it was-- if
you were at Harvard,

00:22:11.023 --> 00:22:14.950
find three geeks from MIT, pair
them up with an angel investor,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.620
then there's kind of five
steps of VC, and then your IPO.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.390
And there's just a
playbook, and that's

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.380
what a "Harvard
entrepreneur" does.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.744
And I'm not anti- that.

00:22:23.744 --> 00:22:24.910
I'm not saying that's wrong.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.430
But I reject the
notion that that's

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.660
the only way of doing it.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.450
And I think when I look at-- and
part of why I wrote the book--

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.450
and certainly when I
look at Tough Mudder,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:34.290
we didn't take outside capital.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.445
And we're not a
tech-enabled business.

00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:37.830
OK, we have a website.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.080
But my father was a provincial
lawyer, and he has a website.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.060
I'm not sure that makes
me a tech business.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.980
And I think this idea
of creating something--

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.420
and I think a lot
of smart marketers,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.630
product designers are good at
understanding the underlying

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.360
psychology of what people
want and they don't just

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.730
think about what are the
attributes of the product.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.830
I mean, maybe if you're selling
soap powder that you only

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.663
care about whether it
gets your shirt clean.

00:23:04.663 --> 00:23:07.330
But for Tough Mudder,
it's an experience.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.490
And so it's much more than
just a rational purchase.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.140
It taps into something
quite emotional.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.190
And I've always, I
think, to some extent

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.210
had an intuitive
understanding of that.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.540
But I've always found it
more interesting to operate

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.780
in that space, as well.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.363
KERRY ANN KING: And do you feel
like the physical aspect of it

00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:24.250
is part of--

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.260
could you create
community in that way

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.060
if it were a video game, a
concept that you actually

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.280
rejected at some point?

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.420
WILL DEAN: Yeah.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:40.120
So I think the underlying value,
the mindset of Tough Mudder

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.120
is around this idea that we
should all try and do things

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.200
that challenge ourselves.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.840
And those of you that have
come to a Tough Mudder, 15%,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.080
20% of people are in
very, very good shape.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.720
60% of people look
like most of the people

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.999
that you see walking around,
that you see in the gym

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:57.290
or walking around the streets
in a place like New York.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.670
And then 15% or 20% of
people, candidly, I'm

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.290
kind of surprised they signed
up for a 12-mile event.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.690
But good for them that they did.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.150
And we've always
tried to be anything

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.220
but elitist in our
approach to what

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.730
it means to challenge yourself.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.870
We don't have rules if you don't
complete one of the obstacles.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.450
And that was something that
we decided very early on.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.129
Because we were having people
with disabilities write to us

00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:24.670
and say, I want to
do a Tough Mudder,

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.960
but I can't do this obstacle.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.840
And I thought, if
life isn't hard enough

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.340
for you to start with, the fact
that you have to write to me

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.340
and ask for dispensation to
go around an obstacle, that's

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.010
just wrong.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.700
That isn't how it should be.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.400
Or the idea that you might be
punished or penalized for that

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.520
just seemed very wrong to me.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.917
And so I think
yes, the community

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:47.500
is born out of the
fact that everybody

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.010
has been through this
experience together.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.820
If you see another
Tough Mudder running

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.860
in the park in a
Tough Mudder shirt,

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.235
probably you will
high-five them.

00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:57.735
Certainly, if you see someone
in the World's Toughest Mudder

00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:58.240
gear--

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.952
this guy has done, if
you hadn't noticed,

00:25:01.952 --> 00:25:03.410
he's done a World's
Toughest, which

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.576
is the 24-hour
nonstop Tough Mudder.

00:25:05.576 --> 00:25:08.350
And that event literally
does go on for 24 hours.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.660
People do as many loops
of the course as they can.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.190
And that is definitely
a community.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.430
I think you'd agree, right?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:18.130
And that exists way beyond
the event weekend itself.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.315
And people get together.

00:25:19.315 --> 00:25:21.460
They make friends through it.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.190
And I do think it's
born out of the fact

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.740
that people have been through
something that challenged

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.680
them physically, some
more than others,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.375
but also scared them
a little in places.

00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:32.250
Some of the obstacles
are a bit intimidating,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.160
like Electroshock Therapy,
the wires you run through,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.560
or Arctic Enema, which is
the dumpster full of ice.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.940
And I think yes, that
kind of underpins it.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.610
But one of the things--

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.580
I know I'm giving you
quite a long answer here,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.500
but it's a really
important part of the book

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.120
and important part
of the company--

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.110
one of the things
I'm most proud of

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.651
is I remember being on the start
line of the first ever event

00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:53.370
in the UK back in 2012.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.430
And for better or
for worse in England,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.070
you can tell very, very
quickly where someone's from,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.666
both geographically, and
we have our class system.

00:26:02.666 --> 00:26:03.540
I'm not defending it.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.619
It just is what it is.

00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:06.660
You can tell where someone's
from geographically.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.504
You can tell very quickly
how much education they have.

00:26:09.504 --> 00:26:10.920
You can probably
infer quite a lot

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.210
about their socioeconomic
background, et cetera, really

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.560
within two or three seconds.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.170
And I remember being
on the start line

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.450
and just hearing all these very
different accents and thinking,

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.230
wow, I would have
never have guessed

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.780
that you would have such
a diverse group of people

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.860
who, when they all get in the
mud, are all just one group.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.060
And whether they arrived in
a 15-year-old beat-up truck

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.115
or a brand-new 7 Series
BMW is irrelevant.

00:26:39.115 --> 00:26:41.490
You're just all people helping
each other out in the mud.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.786
And I think there's something
about it, it's a leveler.

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:45.660
It's about something
that frankly strips away

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.480
some of the bullshit that we as
adults all surround ourselves

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.530
with.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.630
And I think it's a
lot of what explains

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.911
why we've been successful.

00:26:52.911 --> 00:26:54.660
KERRY ANN KING: And I
feel like you really

00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:00.150
tried to instantiate
a very similar ethos

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.820
inside the company, as well,
so that this is not something

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.550
that lives out
there for the users,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.790
but not inside the company.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.720
WILL DEAN: Completely.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.150
I think the best companies--

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.330
I think successful brands
have to ultimately practice

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.620
what they preach.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.280
And they have to believe in
their values and their mission.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.804
And sometimes
internally-- I'll say

00:27:21.804 --> 00:27:23.970
that's true even at Philip
Morris, which is probably

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.610
an organization that many of us
don't have very much time for.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.410
They have a value
of adult choice.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.150
That is something
they believe in.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.160
And you don't go and
work at Philip Morris

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.160
unless you believe that--

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.030
that or you have to have
some views of the world which

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.280
I perhaps wouldn't agree with.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.952
But I think most people
there do give that reason.

00:27:40.952 --> 00:27:42.660
In that way, and maybe
in that way alone,

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.368
Tough Mudder is similar
to Philip Morris,

00:27:44.368 --> 00:27:46.240
that people come
to Tough Mudder--

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.840
because they could get a better
paycheck somewhere else in New

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.952
York City, for sure--

00:27:49.952 --> 00:27:51.660
because they believe
in what we're doing.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.980
They believe in the mission.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.840
And we try to create a culture
that's consistent with that.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.130
And one of the things I always
say about company culture

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.530
is it has nothing to do with
cold beer in the fridge,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.472
or foosball tables, or any of
that stuff, which sometimes I

00:28:04.472 --> 00:28:05.930
think gets written
about when we're

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.340
talking about
entrepreneurial environments.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.480
It's very, very simple.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.370
Culture is about
how do people behave

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.100
when their boss isn't looking.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.520
It's behavioral norms.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.840
That's all it is.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.990
So what do people do when
their boss isn't looking?

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.190
When I walk by, people
quickly shut down Facebook.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.790
And I'm like, do
you really think

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.430
I don't believe
you check Facebook?

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.680
Why are you hiding it from me?

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.730
It's just silly.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.950
And mostly, most of the
people at Tough Mudder

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.110
aren't like that.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.485
And if they are, they
probably don't stay with us

00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:31.920
all that long.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.540
And here's the really
important point.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.360
You have to--

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.162
I get some flak from
the media from this.

00:28:36.162 --> 00:28:38.620
I say people who work at Tough
Mudder should do the events.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.530
And I don't mean
every single weekend.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.219
But they should do one probably
at least once a season,

00:28:43.219 --> 00:28:44.760
so they can see the
people out there.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.301
They can interact
with the community.

00:28:46.301 --> 00:28:48.250
They can understand
what it's all about.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.970
And some people say, well,
isn't that very elitist?

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.085
And I say, I'm not saying
they have to win an event.

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:53.640
I'm just saying they
should take part in it.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.973
And I really believe that stuff.

00:28:54.973 --> 00:28:56.922
And I do believe the
great companies have

00:28:56.922 --> 00:28:59.130
internal culture that are
consistent with their brand

00:28:59.130 --> 00:28:59.940
values.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.020
KERRY ANN KING: And
that's something

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.936
that I feel like you did
struggle a little bit

00:29:02.936 --> 00:29:08.760
with, in terms of scaling and
keeping that culture solid

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.554
and what you wanted it to be.

00:29:10.554 --> 00:29:11.470
WILL DEAN: Definitely.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:12.390
Yeah.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.850
We have something called
the Legionnaire program,

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.700
which is the program
for the repeat Mudders.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.008
And I wanted to call that
the Repeat Offenders.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:30.630
And we just hired somebody from
a very large, very, very large,

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.870
publicly traded company.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.560
She was very senior
in marketing there,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.475
and she'd come in to be our CMO.

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:38.350
And she really grandstanded
me on this point.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.766
She said, Will, people are
going to hear repeat offenders,

00:29:40.766 --> 00:29:42.610
they're going to think
violent offenders.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.490
People are going to go
to domestic violence,

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.310
and you're going to be
saying that Tough Mudders are

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.020
all these things.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.860
And I said, but I
just don't think

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.610
the vast majority of
people will go there.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:51.646
I just don't.

00:29:51.646 --> 00:29:52.770
She said, well, they could.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.030
I said, well, look, I
mean almost anything

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.360
is theoretically possible.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.810
But that can't be the standard
that we hold ourselves to.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.830
And she said, well,
someone might be offended.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.850
I mean look-- the name of
the company is Tough Mudder.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.660
We're clearly-- the whole
name is a play on words.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.050
And I remember this
being a situation where

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.000
I had lots of people kind of
trying to save me from myself,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.350
this kind of conventional wisdom
getting the better of things.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.160
And that's not to say
that I'm always right.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.890
In fact, often I'm
wrong on things.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.840
But we weren't having a
sensible, logical discussion.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.400
There was disagreement,
but people

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.620
weren't being
disagreeable in the way

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.970
they were approaching it.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.910
And yeah, that's a challenge.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.200
And I think maintaining
culture-- you don't build

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.450
a culture, and then it's done.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:39.533
It's not like a warehouse.

00:30:39.533 --> 00:30:41.900
You're like, OK, boom,
finished, that works.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.540
It's something that you have
to stay hyper vigilant of.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.630
And I also get flak
because I, as people here

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.710
who are from Tough
Mudder will know,

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.472
I get very, very
fussy about people

00:30:52.472 --> 00:30:54.680
doing things like washing
up dishes or turning lights

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.880
off in meeting rooms.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.380
Because it's those
small things that

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.421
are indicative of an
environment where everyone's

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:00.771
pulling together as a team.

00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:02.270
And if the event
is all about people

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.970
pulling together as a team
and you're not doing that

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.590
internally, it doesn't matter.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.686
Clearly, dishes are
not a strategic matter

00:31:08.686 --> 00:31:10.310
into themselves, but
I do think they're

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.555
indicative of something.

00:31:11.555 --> 00:31:12.500
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.410
And that was one
of the things that

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.330
was so interesting to read about
how your faith in your vision

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:26.840
allowed you to correct course
and really lead to an even

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.580
greater expansion of the brand.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.910
How do you keep the brand
authentic when it's on TV,

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.550
and on five continents,
and gyms and shoes and--

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.840
WILL DEAN: And it's
funny, because I

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.390
mean, this is, I'm sure, an
environment where people talk

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.510
about the importance of
failure and making mistakes

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.680
and learning from mistakes.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.380
And it can all be a bit
cliche if you're not careful.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.330
But lots of people have
come into Tough Mudder today

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.877
and they've been
very successful.

00:31:55.877 --> 00:31:57.210
They worked hard at high school.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.095
They got into a good university.

00:31:59.095 --> 00:32:01.220
They then worked hard
through that college program.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.386
They got into a great place.

00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:04.250
And they've really
only ever experienced

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:05.670
modicums of success.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.004
They haven't really ever dealt
with spectacular failure.

00:32:08.004 --> 00:32:09.795
And you can tell this
because they give you

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:12.870
interview answers of when their
boss didn't like a presentation

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.750
they gave or something.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.360
These are not the kind of
things that change someone's

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.070
worldview.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.047
These are kind of minor slaps on
the wrist are the worst of it.

00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:23.630
And I think it is hard to keep
pushing people to do new things

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.606
and taking risks.

00:32:24.606 --> 00:32:26.480
And I think one of the
values of Tough Mudder

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.700
is also being
somewhat irreverent,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.010
and challenging conventional
wisdom, and asking why.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.795
It's very central to the idea.

00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:36.170
Even the obstacle names, the
name of the company, I think

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.360
speak to that.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.250
And it's hard.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.150
And my role in the innovation
process I don't think

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.040
is to be the kind of
creative force, per se.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.284
Whether I'm creative or
not is just irrelevant.

00:32:50.284 --> 00:32:51.950
It's about creating
an environment where

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.750
it's permissive to
go and do things

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.660
that, in other environments,
people might not go and do

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.170
that.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.736
So Electroshock Therapy
is a great example.

00:32:59.736 --> 00:33:01.320
And I'll say, just go and do it.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.350
They're like, well,
well, well, well.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.030
Who else do you
want to check with?

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.041
I'm not saying this to brag,
but I control the Tough Mudder

00:33:08.041 --> 00:33:08.540
board.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.280
So I'll say, the
CEO has approved it.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.930
The board's approved it.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.210
Who else do you want to
approve this-- the pope?

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.420
I mean just please go and make
Electroshock Therapy work.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.420
And I think trying to
empower people to do that.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.040
They'll be like, well, what if?

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:22.770
What if it fails?

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.100
Well then, we won't do it again.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.310
That's what will happen.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.070
And things often don't work out.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.320
And I think trying to
get people to reflect

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.600
on failure in a way
that doesn't become

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.942
this kind of painful
exercise can be quite hard.

00:33:35.942 --> 00:33:38.400
And I think it's something you
either get or you don't get.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.080
We use the 5 Whys tool a lot.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.960
It's probably
something you use here

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.770
a lot to try and
understand what went wrong.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.120
You really kind of dig
into the root causes.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.590
Some people just hate that.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.960
They just turn
themselves in knots

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.850
to try and avoid doing it.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.580
And that person
probably isn't going

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.480
to enjoy Tough Mudder
in the long term.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.470
And I try and be very
honest with people.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.800
This is the Tough Mudder
employment satisfaction survey

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.620
results.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.850
Nine out of 10 people
are really happy.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.719
One in 10 people
are really unhappy.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:11.007
I'm not going to try and
fix those one in 10 people

00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:13.340
because they're not in the
six to seven out of 10 range.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.679
They're probably not going
to be back at eight or nine

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.670
very soon.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.170
In fact, they clearly
don't like it.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.170
We're not the right
place for them.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.544
Most people are
in New York City,

00:34:20.544 --> 00:34:23.570
and they have other,
alternative career

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.696
options that they can go after.

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.320
Let them go do that,
because we are not

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.940
all things to all people.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.610
And being very
comfortable with that,

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.110
and being very
comfortable with that

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.693
both in terms of a
hiring perspective,

00:34:33.693 --> 00:34:35.470
but also as a brand perspective.

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.219
Some people say, ugh,
I hate Tough Mudder.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:39.080
It's all about teamwork
and camaraderie.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.270
Sometimes people even tell
me, it's not competitive,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.679
it's un-American.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.422
Well, it's true.

00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:44.130
I'm not American.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.780
That's very astute.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.659
But it's funny.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.449
Some people really kind of
have this visceral dislike

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.080
of an event that isn't
about competition.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.889
There's something
wrong with it, that I'm

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.520
part of this movement of people
that gives all the kids medals

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.660
at high school, and I'm what's
wrong with American society.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.612
Some people say that.

00:35:03.612 --> 00:35:05.570
I'm like, OK, fine, don't
come and do my event.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.625
That's OK.

00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:07.500
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.260
Not that you need me to
jump to your defense,

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.620
but what's very clear
to me, as someone

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.550
who's never run a Tough Mudder,
is that this actually isn't

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.130
about not being competitive.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.000
There is something keenly
competitive about it.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.670
But it strikes a
beautiful balance

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.990
between competitive
and cooperative

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:38.830
that would be great if we could
strike it more in more places.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.460
WILL DEAN: I mean I
think that's right.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.990
And one of the
things I really do

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.900
miss from my time
in counterterrorism

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.480
was there was a very
deep sense of camaraderie

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.459
and never letting
other people fail.

00:35:50.459 --> 00:35:53.000
But it was also an environment
that had quite a lot of Type A

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.830
people in it.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.855
It absolutely did.

00:35:55.855 --> 00:35:58.355
And I think there was this sense
about who's doing the best.

00:35:58.355 --> 00:35:59.852
But there was this
sense as well,

00:35:59.852 --> 00:36:01.310
of you don't let
people fall behind

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.630
because it really matters.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.960
If things go horribly
wrong there, people die.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.840
And so there's this
kind of unwritten rule

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.190
that you helped each other out.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.000
And I miss that.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.970
Because my experience,
not to bash Harvard,

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.040
was there was none of
that at business school.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.831
And in fact, you were
very happy if someone

00:36:17.831 --> 00:36:20.390
was bottom of the pile because
they were kind of propping up

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.460
that false curve.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.640
Very, very different
from what I was used to.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.350
KERRY ANN KING: So I want
to leave time for questions.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.900
But I have to ask
you one last one.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.950
Because reading the book,
one of the questions

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:39.260
that I had about you was,
OK, this is who this guy is.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.440
This thing is so
deeply ingrained.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.400
If this hadn't worked, what do
you think you would have done?

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.610
Because it just seems like
such a perfect project.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.250
WILL DEAN: Well, look,
counterfactuals and hindsight

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.650
are wonderful things.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.180
When I was starting
Tough Mudder,

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.810
I had no idea whether it
would be successful or not.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.472
And I'm not sure that
ever completely goes away.

00:37:05.472 --> 00:37:07.805
Even when you kind of get to
a certain level of success,

00:37:07.805 --> 00:37:09.560
there's still this
question of, oh, well,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.050
will people still be doing
it in five or 10 years' time?

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.740
I don't know if that
ever quite leaves you.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.335
But when I started--

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.710
and I will answer
your question--

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.332
but the realization I came to
suddenly at age 28 was, look,

00:37:22.332 --> 00:37:24.040
I'm not married, I
don't have a mortgage,

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.270
I don't have any dependents.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:28.130
If I give this a year
or two of my life

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.090
and it doesn't work out, it's
unlikely when I'm 40 years old,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.320
I'm not going to have
the things that matter.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.130
And I think there's
something quite wrong in some

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.850
of what increasingly you do
see in elements of the culture

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.410
in Silicon Valley,
which is starting

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.130
to look in some ways quite
a lot like Wall Street.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.190
It's all about who's
raised the most money.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:56.255
It attracts a lot of
very Type A people.

00:37:56.255 --> 00:37:58.130
Some of the people, they
may talk a good game

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:59.720
about building the future.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.365
But I still have
people say to me, oh,

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:02.990
how much money has
Tough Mudder raised?

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.790
And I say, oh, we
haven't taken any money.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.410
And people still say to
me, it's going to be OK.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.360
And I'm like, yeah, I think
it will be, thank you.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.860
But it still happens.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.860
I promise you I am going
to answer the question.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:15.970
KERRY ANN KING: No, it's OK.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:17.640
WILL DEAN: But I
think it starts from--

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.681
for me, it really started
from saying, look, it's

00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:21.920
going to be OK financially,
the things I need in life

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.940
to be happy.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.720
I'm fortunate.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.830
Not everyone does in life.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:25.670
But I'm fortunate.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.990
I'm reasonably well-educated.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.185
I'm not unintelligent.

00:38:28.185 --> 00:38:29.900
I'm reasonably hard working.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.080
I'm going to check those
boxes one way or another.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.675
So what would I have done?

00:38:35.675 --> 00:38:37.739
I think one of
the obvious things

00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:40.280
to go and do when you've got an
MBA is to go and do something

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.780
kind of consultancy related.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.507
It pays the bills.

00:38:43.507 --> 00:38:44.590
I spent my summer at Bain.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:46.970
And I was always shocked by
how many people there said, I

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.560
really thought I was coming
to Bain for two years

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.362
and then I was going
to start my own thing.

00:38:50.362 --> 00:38:51.820
And I've been here
seven years now.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.530
I'm not quite sure
what happened there.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.180
So I suspect I'd
have kind of bounced

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.670
into some kind of relatively
well-paid, comfortable,

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.990
slightly dull job.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:01.400
And then within a year or
two, I'd have got bored

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.200
and started something
else, which probably

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.240
would have been about community
and doing things together,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.130
because those are the
things I find interesting.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.580
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.288
Having read the book,
I think that's what

00:39:09.288 --> 00:39:11.620
you would have done.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:18.740
And you actually got to one
of the key points for me

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:24.110
in the book, which is
the risk is worth taking.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:27.650
And maybe even when
you're not 28 and don't

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.360
have a mortgage,
maybe even when you

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:36.790
have a mortgage and a family,
that if the energy is there--

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.380
WILL DEAN: If you believe in
what you're doing, for sure.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.421
I think starting new
companies, your own company,

00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.960
is one of the most
rewarding things you can do.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.520
And it isn't always fun
and frankly, at times, it's

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.210
very lonely.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.930
And I try and touch
on that in the book.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.017
It's not for everyone.

00:39:50.017 --> 00:39:52.100
I sometimes see these books
that are called things

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.810
like "Anyone Can Do It."

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.310
Well, that's a bit like saying
anyone can have a six-pack.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.460
I mean it's technically
true, but most of us

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.880
don't really want to go
through the pain to achieve it.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.590
And I think I'm very proud
of what we've achieved.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.180
I'm very pleased I did it.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.951
It certainly wasn't
easy at times.

00:40:07.951 --> 00:40:10.450
But I'm not one of these people
that tells everyone, oh, you

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.450
should all go and start
your own companies, too.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.960
I think it's a very
personal choice.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.460
And I think you have to be
very clear why you're doing it

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.460
and what you hope to achieve.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.150
And you have to own your
own definition of success.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.930
The second you allow anybody
else to try and impose that

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.295
upon you, you're going
to have real problems.

00:40:29.295 --> 00:40:30.670
And I think that's
very important

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.930
when you're starting your own--

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.805
whatever the organization
does, but certainly

00:40:33.805 --> 00:40:35.376
if you're starting a company.

00:40:35.376 --> 00:40:38.610
KERRY ANN KING: So I would
love to open the floor up

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.410
for questions.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:40.451
And we have a microphone.

00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:42.055
Allen's there with the mic.

00:40:42.055 --> 00:40:43.990
Does anybody--

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.600
AUDIENCE: Hi, Will.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.350
Kerry may have told
you, but every year we

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.810
organize a little race
on the Hudson River.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:50.911
It's a little 5K.

00:40:50.911 --> 00:40:52.910
And there's something
that keeps me up all night

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.243
that I wonder how you deal with.

00:40:54.243 --> 00:40:56.440
Because we don't have
obstacles, but you can get

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.740
run over by a police tow truck.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.806
How do you deal with
that fear of someone

00:41:01.806 --> 00:41:02.930
might get hurt at my event?

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.596
WILL DEAN: Yeah.

00:41:03.596 --> 00:41:06.334
So let me give you the
kind of stock answer

00:41:06.334 --> 00:41:08.500
I give generally when I'm
asked this, which is true.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.480
The most dangerous part
of doing a Tough Mudder

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.100
is the drive to a Tough Mudder.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.170
You are far more likely
to injure yourself

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.070
getting yourself
to the start line

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.270
than what happens on course.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.760
I am proud of the safety
systems we have in place.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.320
All of the obstacles do have
medics and divers in place.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.730
But when I started the
business, I thought,

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:32.410
if we're moderately successful,
we will have injuries or worse.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.460
And that has happened.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.960
It's well-documented.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.080
And statistically,
it's just a given.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.130
We've now had over three
million people do the event.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.440
Things happen.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.050
If we took three million
days of people's lives,

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:49.279
statistically a certain
number have heart attacks

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:50.070
and other problems.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:52.836
It just happens.

00:41:52.836 --> 00:41:56.010
To give a very candid answer,
it's still very, very difficult

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.010
from the personal level.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.718
You'd be very proud
of what you've built.

00:41:58.718 --> 00:42:00.855
And you can look at
people who come to you

00:42:00.855 --> 00:42:04.680
and they say, I lost 50 pounds,
or I overcame alcoholism,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.307
or I beat depression
training for a Tough Mudder.

00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:09.140
And the book talks about
some of that stuff.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.110
But if somebody does your event
and they don't come back--

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.900
we've had a death
at our events--

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.220
it's very difficult. And I'm the
founder and CEO of the company.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.190
As the CEO, the insurers
understand it, statistically it

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.330
happens.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.290
Our rates are very, very
low because our events

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.873
are very safe.

00:42:30.873 --> 00:42:32.880
They're safer than a
marathon or a triathlon.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.963
But on a personal level,
it's very, very difficult

00:42:34.963 --> 00:42:37.910
when something happens.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.550
But I can sleep at night.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.520
And I think I can
because I genuinely

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.130
believe we have the right
systems and processes in place.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.620
And I believe people take
their responsibility--

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.420
and it is a responsibility--

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.960
very, very seriously.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.677
And I think when you look at
the Tough Mudder environment,

00:42:52.677 --> 00:42:54.510
we're trying to create
an environment that's

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:57.780
scary without being dangerous.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.970
I'm sure many of you have
been on a roller coaster.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.117
The whole idea of a roller
coaster is it's scary,

00:43:02.117 --> 00:43:03.700
but I don't think
anyone really thinks

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.790
of it as being dangerous--
at least if you do one

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:11.440
here in the United States or
in Western Europe or something.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.260
No, look, it's a serious point.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.520
And I think--

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.092
I don't think you should ever
stop worrying about that.

00:43:17.092 --> 00:43:18.300
We have events every weekend.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.655
And I get an email every
end of day, every Saturday

00:43:20.655 --> 00:43:23.280
and every Sunday, just to
say, yep, everyone got back.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.960
And there are, of
course, sprained

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.250
ankles and cuts and bruises.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.290
That's just a given
with an event.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.080
But it is difficult.
But I believe

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.310
we have the right
systems and processes.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.601
We have professionals in place.

00:43:33.601 --> 00:43:37.556
We work with third parties
that review what we're doing.

00:43:37.556 --> 00:43:39.930
But yeah, it's something you
have to take very seriously.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.888
Before the first event,
trying to get insurance

00:43:41.888 --> 00:43:42.850
was a challenge.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:43.440
It really was.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.630
It took a lot of
hard work and effort.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.152
But now it's pretty
straightforward.

00:43:47.152 --> 00:43:49.360
I still hear people say,
oh, that must be a liability

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.860
nightmare.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:50.900
But it's really not.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.570
I mean, you point to
three million data points

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.726
now to support your claim.

00:43:55.726 --> 00:43:56.600
KERRY ANN KING: Yeah.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.947
Ken and I spend a lot of
time worrying together.

00:43:59.947 --> 00:44:02.530
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering what's
your favorite obstacle and why?

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.220
WILL DEAN: Yeah.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.070
So it's a funny thing to say.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.160
My favorite obstacle is
one that we genuinely

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.900
invented by accident.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.780
So the head of my
obstacle innovation lab

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.620
refers to it as Tough Mudder's
equivalent of penicillin.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.677
We have an obstacle
called Block Ness Monster.

00:44:18.677 --> 00:44:20.510
These guys are all
nodding at the front row,

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.257
oh, yeah, Block Ness Monster.

00:44:22.257 --> 00:44:24.090
What Block Ness Monster
is, for those of you

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.766
that don't know it, is
it's a series of rotating--

00:44:27.766 --> 00:44:31.080
they kind of look
like giant Toblerones,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.540
and they spin around floating
on the surface of the water.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.300
And you have to grab hold of it.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.992
And then other people
spin it around,

00:44:37.992 --> 00:44:39.450
and they flip you
back over and you

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.514
kind of land headfirst
back in the water.

00:44:41.514 --> 00:44:42.180
It's really fun.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.638
It's actually
somewhat challenging.

00:44:43.638 --> 00:44:47.090
And it's almost impossible to do
on your own, almost impossible.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.750
And so I really enjoy that.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.040
I was doing it at the weekend.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.690
We were being filmed
for some TV out there.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.480
And it was just a great moment.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.770
Everyone was working together.

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.750
And the presenter
I was with kind of

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.860
fell off the back of it.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.020
And she was just laughing.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.978
And I wasn't sure she
was going to be laughing,

00:45:01.978 --> 00:45:03.910
so that was great.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.655
But we genuinely invented
it by accident, as I said.

00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:08.550
So Block Ness
Monster, the idea was

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.110
not that you kind
of climbed over it

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.352
and went down the other side.

00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:12.810
But originally,
the idea was it was

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.726
going to be a replacement
for our balance beam

00:45:14.726 --> 00:45:17.760
obstacle, Twinkle Toes, and you
were going to run across it.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.802
And so we built this
thing, and it didn't work.

00:45:20.802 --> 00:45:22.260
People just kept
falling off of it.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.540
They either got straight
across, or they came off it

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.710
straightaway.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.805
And people didn't
like it at all.

00:45:27.805 --> 00:45:29.430
And then we just
observed, in this kind

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.160
of anthropological way, the
thing people were really

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.620
enjoying was trying to
get back onto the obstacle

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:36.630
because it was rotating.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.172
And so we just
said, well, instead

00:45:38.172 --> 00:45:39.630
of trying to take
people across it,

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.160
let's take them
over it that way.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.550
And so it's become one of our
highest scoring obstacles.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.790
So it checks a lot
of the boxes for us.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:48.670
It's about teamwork.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.169
It is somewhat
physically demanding.

00:45:50.169 --> 00:45:51.750
You've got to really
hang on to it.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.490
In its own kind of
way, it's a bit scary

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.460
because you kind of get plunged
headfirst back into the water.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.330
But it's also fun.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.205
And those are the four
values of Tough Mudder

00:45:59.205 --> 00:46:00.600
all kind of combined into one.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.470
So that's probably
my favorite obstacle.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.250
AUDIENCE: You're in a
very competitive space.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.180
And it's often
been called a fad.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.730
How do you view
your competitors?

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.185
And what do you think gets
you to that next million Tough

00:46:13.185 --> 00:46:14.018
Mudder participants?

00:46:14.018 --> 00:46:14.900
WILL DEAN: Yes.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.630
So I think it's--

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.174
you're right.

00:46:19.174 --> 00:46:21.090
Since the first event,
people said, oh, great,

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.673
you did one event,
I'm not sure anyone

00:46:22.673 --> 00:46:24.345
will come to the second event.

00:46:24.345 --> 00:46:26.010
I will say in the
last year or two,

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:27.810
people have been
saying that a bit less.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.380
I think people have kind of
figured out it's here to stay.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.130
There is a community
that come back and do

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.420
these events every year.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.878
But there's also
lots of new people

00:46:34.878 --> 00:46:36.210
that come along and do them.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:40.350
I think what was true
three or four years ago is

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.060
there were lots of people
entering this space.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.120
And they said, oh,
I've got a farm.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.010
I know how to build
some obstacles.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:50.070
My brother-in-law can
build me a website.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.700
I'll use my barn
for the logistics.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.200
And some of these
things, frankly,

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.060
became glorified Ponzi schemes.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.460
Because they sold some
tickets for the first event.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.585
And then all the bills came
in for the first event.

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:03.340
They go, oh, I thought
I'd made money.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.950
I better open three events
to pay for the first event.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.490
And that kind of went
OK for a year or two.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.400
But like all these things,
it comes to an end.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.241
And I think Tough
Mudder as a company

00:47:14.241 --> 00:47:15.740
has to do three or
four things well.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.000
We now actually have quite a
large performance marketing

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.583
team that spend a
lot of time worrying

00:47:19.583 --> 00:47:21.450
about 12-month
campaigns leading up

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.490
to every single individual
event, first thing.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.865
Second, I think there's a
chicken and egg part to this.

00:47:27.865 --> 00:47:30.240
We have the biggest obstacles,
so we get the most people.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.698
Because we have
the most people, we

00:47:31.698 --> 00:47:33.810
can build the biggest
and the best obstacles.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.020
And there's something
of a flywheel effect

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.352
that happens there.

00:47:37.352 --> 00:47:38.310
We have great partners.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:44.840
We have three TV shows, CBS, CW,
Warner Brothers here in the US.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.490
And then we have a partnership
in the UK with Sky Sports

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.130
and then with a social media
company that have just launched

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.100
a competitor to YouTube.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.900
I believe it's called
Facebook Watch.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.540
And so we have a bunch
of them, as well.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.760
And so that helps increase
demand, engagement, brand

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.010
awareness, brand affinity.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.650
And then you have great
partners, as well.

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:09.930
Lucozade, which is kind
of a British [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.005
of Gatorade, we're on the side
of 50 million bottles in the UK

00:48:13.005 --> 00:48:15.130
this year-- which in a
country of 60 million people

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:15.940
is a huge number.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.129
So I think the end result is you
have to do several things well.

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:20.670
And I think if you
look at the space,

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.550
there's really us
and one other player.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:28.710
And Spartan, very much
about race, individual,

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:30.630
penalties if you fail.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.390
And it's not that I
think that's wrong.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.690
That's just not us.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.900
And minivans and Porsches
have something in common,

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.200
but they're not really
marketing to the same people.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.600
And I think in that regard--

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.760
and you can guess who I think
is the minivan in that equation,

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.770
but the truth is they are
quite different products.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.120
And in the main, they attract
very different people.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.450
There's actually a very low
level of customer overlap.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.505
So does that answer
your question?

00:48:59.505 --> 00:49:00.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:01.370
KERRY ANN KING: So one more.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.161
AUDIENCE: Hi, Will.

00:49:02.161 --> 00:49:03.010
Thanks for coming.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:07.320
I actually had pretty much the
same question, but I was just--

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.600
and I think it's all about--

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.980
it's an awesome experience.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.140
How do you get people to
come back a second time?

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:15.480
And I guess maybe a
follow-up question

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.300
to that would be events,
as most people know,

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.890
are very, very expensive.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.230
Your costs are very high
and ticket sales only

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:24.480
cover so much, so you
go into sponsorship.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.210
And you guys have gotten
some really great partners.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:32.250
What has been-- what to you
is a key in determining what's

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.620
worth a partnership or
a sponsorship versus you

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.792
never want that image of
selling yourself out just

00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:37.500
to get the money?

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.541
Because you need it, from
a business perspective.

00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:41.550
WILL DEAN: You do.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.301
So I think-- there's a
few things from that.

00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:46.050
So our repeat rate's
actually pretty high.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.450
So our year-on-year
repeat rate's about 50%.

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:51.910
And that compares with about 9%
for a marathon or a triathlon.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.450
So we're pretty happy with that.

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:58.530
And increasingly, our in-year
repeat rate's higher, as well.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.000
So customer lifetime
value is now

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.030
in the thousands
of dollars for us.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.017
Of course, we know our
customer acquisition costs.

00:50:06.017 --> 00:50:07.350
They're going up, unfortunately.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.951
You guys should
bear that in mind.

00:50:09.951 --> 00:50:12.450
But there's a serious point
that we really think about that.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.430
We have the Legionnaire program,
which for the repeaters,

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.710
you get different color
headbands, different obstacles.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.293
We have a series of
different events--

00:50:18.293 --> 00:50:21.600
5K, half, full, tougher,
toughest, world's toughest.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.530
So there's a kind of
progression there, as well.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.970
I think if you define us as an
events business in 2017, that's

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:31.760
half of our business.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.020
We're a sports, media,
entertainment, lifestyle

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.530
company.

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.840
And I feel comfortable calling
us a lifestyle company,

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.380
because now 20,000 people have
had the logo tattooed on them.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.460
And there aren't many
brands that can say that.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.490
So how does our business work?

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:48.656
Well, you put on the events.

00:50:48.656 --> 00:50:50.310
They have to break even.

00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:52.190
That's a given.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.190
And we kind of know how
many places in the world

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:55.170
you can go and do that.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.794
And we have a pretty good sense
of how many people will show up

00:50:57.794 --> 00:51:00.420
because we now have seven
years' worth of data.

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.160
You then have a media business
and a sponsorship business,

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.155
and those kind of coexist
and one fuels the other.

00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:09.530
And then we have the training
business, so just launching

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:10.170
the gyms now.

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:12.070
We're moving to the
boot camp space.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.330
And that really is the
kind of local community

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:20.130
hub to the event, mass
congregation of the tribe.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:23.040
And I think of those
as an ecosystem.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.802
And most businesses, you
start with one product.

00:51:25.802 --> 00:51:28.260
And hopefully that goes well,
and you get your lucky break.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.404
And I definitely got mine.

00:51:29.404 --> 00:51:31.320
But then you hopefully
move into other things,

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.736
as well, which I
think we've done.

00:51:32.736 --> 00:51:35.250
And we've tried to
create things that

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:36.750
reinforce the
underlying business

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:39.300
but are also consistent
with our values and mission

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.300
around building a tribe that
lives the values of teamwork

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:46.560
and camaraderie, fun, personal
accomplishments, and courage,

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.665
which I think we've tried
to do in everything.

00:51:49.665 --> 00:51:51.540
And there are sponsors
we wouldn't work with.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.377
And there are sponsors
that we do work

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:55.460
with that occasionally
want to go and do something

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.834
and we say, yeah,
no, we can't do

00:51:56.834 --> 00:51:58.730
that, that won't work for us.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.470
But I think the
partners that tend

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:03.610
to come with us are the
ones that understand

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:05.740
that in the long
term they don't win

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.840
if they piggyback
on our authenticity

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.830
rather than help build it.

recommend the book.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:24.020
It's an entertaining read
and almost has me ready

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:24.920
to do a Tough Mudder.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.150

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.690
Good to know.

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:29.190
All right.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.356
Well, look, thank you, guys.

00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:31.890
