00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.740
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
everybody to one more Authors

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.080
at Google Talk.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.590
Today with us is Hampton
Sides with his new book

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.910
"In the Kingdom of Ice."

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.050
In the late 19th
century, people were

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.490
obsessed by one of the
last unmapped areas

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.600
of the globe, the North Pole.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.770
No one knew what existed
beyond the fortress of ice

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.700
rimming the northern oceans.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.750
Well, the theories about
the foremost cartographer

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.920
of the world, a German
named August Petermann,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.680
believed that warm currents
sustained at green island

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.250
at the top of the world.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.730
National glory would
fall to whoever could

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.230
plant his flag upon its shores.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.270
James Gordon Bennett, the
eccentric and stupendously

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810
wealthy owner of
the New York Herald,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.010
had recently captured
the world's attention

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.380
by dispatching Stanley to Africa
to find Doctor Livingstone.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.290
Now he was keen to recreate that
sensation on an even more epic

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.110
scale.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.379
So he founded an official
US Naval expedition

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.220
to reach the Pole,
choosing as its captain

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.650
a young officer named
George Washington DeLong.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.520
On July 8, 1879,
the USS Jeanette

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.100
set sail from San Francisco.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.640
They faced everything from
snow blindness, polar bears,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.860
ferocious storms, frosted
labyrinths, madness,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.300
and starvation.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.510
This is a tale of
heroism and determination

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.900
in the most unforgiving
territory on Earth.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.580
Hampton Sides is an
award winning editor

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.870
of "Outside," a
frequent contributor

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.910
to "National Geographic,"
and the author of bestselling

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.260
histories "Hellbound on His
Trail," of "Blood and Thunder,"

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.670
and "Ghost Soldiers."

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.523
Please, join me in
welcoming Hampton to Google.

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:50.564
HAMPTON SIDES: All right.

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:55.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.110
It's good to be here.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.050
I had a bit of an adventure
just getting here.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.424
They dropped me
off at a building

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:03.250
about 12 or 13 buildings
over, and it was sort of

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.060
like wandering
around in the Arctic.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.410
But I got here.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.050
What an extraordinary,
extraordinary place to work.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.930
The paperback version of
"In the Kingdom of Ice"

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.110
just came out two days ago,
so I'm now on a book tour.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.440
I was in Seattle yesterday, but
I'm moving about the country.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.210
And I always ask
people when I first

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.100
begin to talk about the
Voyage of the Jeanette,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.460
barring those of you
who maybe already read

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.040
the book, how many
of you had heard

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.900
of the Voyage of the
Jeanette prior to this?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.720
Big goose egg.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.300
Yup.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.760
And that's exactly what I
encounter everywhere I go.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.670
And that's exactly the
reason why I wrote this book.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.060
When I first heard about this
while I was on an assignment

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.950
with "National Geographic"
to write about another Arctic

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.900
explorer in Oslo, the great
scientist and explorer Fridtjof

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.660
Nansen.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.870
I saw in the museum there in
Oslo all these references,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.390
continuing references to
the Jeanette expedition,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.090
the famous American voyage
from the Gilded Age.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.700
And I'm an American.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.450
I said, well, why
haven't I heard of this?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.560
What is the Jeanette?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.900
And sometimes it takes asking
just an obvious question

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.310
like that to begin
to bore into a story.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.480
And so I came home.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.800
I began to read the
primary documents

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.550
and got really, really
interested in this story.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.210
It took me three years to do it.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.170
I traveled all over Siberia, and
the high Arctic, and the Bering

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.630
Strait, and all over
America in pursuit of it.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.266
I had of ball doing
this story, and I'm

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.310
going to today talk
with you a little bit

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.890
about some of my travels in
pursuit of the Jeanette story

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.170
and give you some of the
background about what

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.620
the expedition was about.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.290
The men of the
Jeanette that survived,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.010
they returned home
as great heroes.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.200
They were household names.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.240
They were lauded and celebrated.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.519
There were blockbuster newspaper
stories and magazines stories.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.500
There were parades in Manhattan.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.370
There were monuments erected
to them all over the country.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.400
The survivors were
entertained by the Czar

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.030
of Russia, Alexander III.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.560
The story was the subject
of bestselling books.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.610
The journals and
diaries of the commander

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.940
became a bestselling book.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.700
But it's completely
obscure today

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.540
as the numbers here bear
it's a story that slipped

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.110
through the cracks of history.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.360
One place though where it is
quite well known is this place.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.060
This is the Jeanette Monument at
the Naval Academy in Annapolis

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.900
where George DeLong
and his men are

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.590
celebrated as part of the
Pantheon of great Navy explorer

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.320
heroes.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.519
And when I was on the book
tour, a former midshipman

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:30.310
came up to me at some
point and said, yeah,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.226
the Jeanette Memorial.

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:34.270
That's something that they
used to always require us,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.230
almost like a hazing ritual,
at midnight to go and count

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.370
the number of icicles
on the monument

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.390
and report back to the
authorities or whatever.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.445
I guess it's your
tax dollars at work.

00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:49.820
OK, so the Voyage
of the Jeanette

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.560
was really based on trying
to prove or disprove

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.860
an old, old idea,
an old theory that

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.190
goes back as far as the
Greeks and the Vikings

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.800
but really came
to be crystallized

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.590
in this map, a 1592 Mercator
map which showed very clearly

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.770
an open polar sea.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.880
Through the ice in
this symmetrical way,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.640
they believed there were portals
that led through the ice,

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.820
and that it was warm up there,
and that there was an iron

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.470
mountain in the center of
it, which of course explains

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.220
why compasses work.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.060
Obviously, a flawed
idea, but once you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.840
get an idea like that
enshrined in a map, especially

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.080
a beautiful map, and a widely
circulated and important map,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.260
it becomes increasingly
difficult to dislodge that idea

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.160
from the public imagination.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.930
So what you really had
was several centuries

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.400
of scientists, and
pseudoscientists, and sometimes

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.920
cranks, and various
authors and explorers

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.190
who tried to prove or
disprove the existence

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.090
of this fantastical
body of water.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.390
Open polar sea.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.840
Of course, the
Vikings had an idea.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.846
It was called Ultima Thule,
someplace beyond the ice where

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:17.980
it was warm year round.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.530
And there were various
tropical and exotic animals

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.440
believed to be there.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.470
The Greeks had Hyperborea, which
they talked about, and believed

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.750
that there was beyond
the ice, again,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.550
a mountain range where
the Griffons lived,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.760
half lion, half eagle.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.290
In the 1800s though,
you begin to get

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.170
a bunch of really bizarre ideas
coming out of particularly

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.790
the United States.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.410
John Cleves Symmes was
one of these cranks who

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.867
believed that at the
top of the world,

00:07:50.867 --> 00:07:53.200
there were these big holes
that led down into the Earth,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.590
and that there were people
who lived down there.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.200
And they were just dying
for us to go find them.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.510
And he was very influential.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.080
He sold out lecture
halls everywhere he went.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.180
Members of Congress were
taken with his idea.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.680
This is what it was
supposed to look

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.650
like from the pages of
"Harper's Magazine,"

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.915
Symmes's hole as it would appear
to a Lunarian with a telescope.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.420
The hollow Earth theory,
holes at the poles,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:31.950
this idea I thought a very
antiquarian, quixotic idea.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:38.070
But then I googled
holes at the poles.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.659
And lo and behold, there
is this large subculture.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.440
I mean, not large
but fairly intense

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.800
subculture of people who
still believe that there

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.430
are holes at the poles.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.850
And this is a supposedly
confiscated, censored NASA

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.154
photograph.

00:08:57.154 --> 00:08:58.320
There are people down there.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.790
They want us to find them,
but the administrators,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.510
particularly the
Obama administration,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.780
has done everything it can
to prevent us from knowing

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.900
about its existence.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.650
So the idea has been
very slow to die.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.770
And it seems to be fairly
deeply embedded in our psyche.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.530
Jules Verne had popularized
the notion of an open polar sea

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.870
further with the publication
of his book, "Journey

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.290
to the Center of the Earth,"
although he brought it

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.060
underground.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:33.510
There were subterranean
lakes that in his novel

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.670
figure into the story.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.020
Mary Shelley, of course, was
fascinated with the North Pole.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.300
Doctor Frankenstein pursues
his monster all the way

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.300
to the North Pole in the novel.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:57.220
Now, moving beyond scientific
theory to just fact,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.410
we know who lives
at the North Pole.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.040
We know what's there.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.150
Santa Clause is there.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.040
And I thought this must
be a pretty old idea,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.190
but when I was doing the
research for the book,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.160
I found out that really the
idea of Santa being at the North

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:18.590
Pole came from this cartoon from
Harper's from the 1860s which

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.690
shows him with his helpers
and his workshop up there.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:29.870
So during the 1860s
particularly, and 1870s,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.420
and into the 1880s, you get
this intense polar fever that

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.930
begins to build, particularly
in the United States--

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.960
this nagging,
gnawing, need to know

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.720
what was at the top
of the world, one

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.600
of the last unmapped areas.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.030
It drove people crazy.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.550
And it also had an
element of nationalism

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.110
for the United States.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.950
After the Civil War,
emerging from the devastation

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.720
of the Civil War, we
began to flex our muscles

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.970
around the world stage, wanting
to compete with the Brits who

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.290
had done most of exploring,
of the course the Russians

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.450
and some of the
Scandinavian countries.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.980
But we wanted to stake
our claim in the Arctic

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.660
and had recently purchased
from the Russians Alaska.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.690
And there was a real
curiosity about what

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.630
was north of our new territory.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.130
No one had been there.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.000
Some Arctic whalers had been
along the edges of the ice,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.167
but no one had ever really
seen what was north of Alaska.

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:31.750
Now, there were a
number of scientists

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.480
who were interested
in this question

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.000
but also very much interested
in the open polar sea theory.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.370
One of them was this
guy, Dr. August Petermann

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.190
who you alluded a to
in the introduction.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.440
Petermann was the
foremost mapmaker

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.550
in the world at that time.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.910
Google Maps had
nothing on this guy.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:57.100
He produced these absolutely
beautiful hand colored but mass

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.805
produced maps that brought
in the latest findings

00:12:00.805 --> 00:12:01.920
from explorers.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.040
And they came back from
Africa, or they came back

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.140
from the interior of Australia.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.620
He would pencil in
the new information.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.230
And so these were up to date
and highly sought after maps.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.620
And from this platform--
and he published

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.580
all these maps in Germany
in a place called Gotha.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.590
And he was widely sought after.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.130
He was popular in
the lecture circuit.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:34.160
And on this platform,
by virtue of his maps,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.470
he was able to promulgate his
various theories, almost all

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.390
of which were wrong, about what
was at the top of the world.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.220
But people believed him
because he was erudite,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.110
he was a German scholar, and he
also had excellent facial hair,

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.249
like a lot of the
characters in this book.

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:55.540
This is one of his master
works, "The Atlas of Physical

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.250
Geography."

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.020
His birthplace,
I went to Germany

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.900
and tried to begin to understand
his world and the power

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.580
of maps, the power especially
in that age when they were just

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.730
a few areas left
in the world that

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.190
had never been touched by man.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.790
The monument to
Petermann in Gotha.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.020
But this begins to show
a little of the theories

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.970
on which the Jeanette expedition
was based and Petermann's idea.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:28.440
We were beginning to learn
that the Gulf Stream was

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.900
a powerful current that
brought a lot of heat

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.640
from the tropics north
through the Atlantic Ocean

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.730
and past England, past Norway.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.610
No one knew precisely
where it went.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.140
And Petermann's
theory was that it

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.770
met the ice, tunneled
under the ice,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.710
softened the ice as it
went, and eventually went

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.639
to the North Pole.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.430
There's another current
that they were also

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.800
beginning to learn about
on the Pacific side--

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.260
I don't know if you can
see that-- called the Kuro

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.970
Siwo, which is indeed a
powerful current in the Pacific

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.510
that goes north towards
the Bering Strait.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.470
So his theory was
beautiful in its symmetry,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.530
somewhat grandiose.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:13.390
But it was that these two great
currents met at the North Pole

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.320
and it was part of a massive
thermo-regulation system

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.500
of the planet.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.010
And the key word here
being "supposed open sea,"

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.710
but again, you begin to
see all these ideas on maps

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:32.140
and it just becomes impossible
to get rid of the idea

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.790
until explorers
unfortunately have

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.840
to go and live or die,
suffer, at any rate

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.190
to prove the theory.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.880
Somebody who was captivated
by Petermann's ideas

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.950
was this guy, the third richest
man in New York at the time,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.150
the publisher and editor of the
largest newspaper in the world,

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.150
the New York Herald.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.350
This is James Gordon
Bennett Jr. who

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.690
was this Gilded Age
character, a spoiled brat,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.250
a guy who got pretty much
everything he wanted,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.240
a reckless adventurer
himself, a lover of spectacle.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.410
He was the youngest commodore
of the New York Yacht Club.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.440
He won the first
transatlantic yacht race.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.060
He was famous for
driving coaches

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.560
around Manhattan
nude at midnight.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.510
He publicly urinated
into a grand piano

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:34.360
at a party, a salon in New
York, which got him ostracized

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.450
from New York society.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.040
And so he said a plague
on all your houses.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.150
I'm moving to France.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.990
So he ran his newspaper by
transatlantic cable from Paris.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.690
Then he created
"The Paris Herald,"

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.340
which became "The
International Herald

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.120
Tribune," which
still exists and is

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.980
the last remnant of his empire.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.950
Anyway, you can't
invent a character

00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:00.000
as outsized or as
grand as Gordon Bennett

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.210
Jr. This was his newspaper,
a very influential paper,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.480
important paper also
because he believed

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.780
not only in reporting the
news but creating spectacles

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.320
that would generate more and
more news and big blockbuster

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.440
stories.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.760
He had all these fetishes.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.050
For example, he was
really into Pomeranians.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.510
He had hundreds of them.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.200
I've seen a lot of dogs
here on the Google campus,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.000
but he was in a particular
thing about Pomeranians

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.860
and consulted them for
various pieces of advice.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.630
He was also interested in owls.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.400
He had stuffed
owls, living owls.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.470
Owls were his personal symbol
and the symbol of the paper.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.230
This is the headquarters, which
shows owls on the eaves there.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.710
And it was interesting.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.460
The eyes of the owls
lit up with red lights,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.260
and then they would
wink at you at night.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.680
One of his many yachts,
this is the Lysistrata,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.840
which had a 200 seat theater.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.710
It had a Turkish bath.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.829
And it had padded stalls
for his dairy cows

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.329
so he could have fresh cream
every morning for breakfast.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.030
So this is the Gilded
Age, just tremendous sums

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.359
of money, certain
individuals who

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.950
had and were able to wield a
lot of power with this money.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.080
And he pretty much
got what he wanted.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.620
Now, my wife and I,
of course we felt we

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.380
had to go to Paris to
research Gordon Bennett.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.970
And this is one of
his mansions in Paris,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.120
a villa on the south
of France near Monaco

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.940
where he kept the Lysistrata.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.320
We barged our way into the
house and there's still

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.570
people living there.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.185
And they knew all about Bennett.

00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:57.810
There were signs of
Bennett everywhere,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.160
including owls all
over the place.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.510
Bennett's also
famous for bringing

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.290
international ballooning
to the forefront.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.770
He created this balloon
race which still exists,

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.350
the Bennett Cup.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.310
So that's one of his legacies.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.600
But he's most famous
for sending this guy--

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.540
this is Henry Morgan Stanley--
to Africa to find Livingston.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.070
Livingston, I presume.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.400
Livingston wasn't really lost.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.940
He didn't really
need to be found,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.340
but it made for a
great spectacle,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.850
and a great series of dispatches
in "The New York Herald."

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.190
So really, Bennett was
looking for an encore

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:46.910
to Stanley Livingston when he
began to cultivate this idea

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.220
bank rolling an expedition
to the North Pole

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.780
to test the theories
of August Petermann.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.620
He hired this guy to
lead the expedition.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.820
This is George Washington
DeLong, the commander

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.270
of the Jeanette, a graduate
of the Naval Academy,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.260
someone who had
been to Greenland,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.410
had devoted the rest of his
life to trying to figure out

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.480
this planetary enigma.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.210
What's at the North Pole?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.730
He wanted to be
the first to do it,

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.760
and to do it for his
country, and for his Navy,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.715
and for science.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.930
Bennett purchased
this vessel, renamed

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.070
it the Jeanette after his
sister Jeanette Bennett.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.770
And DeLong sailed
it around the Horn

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.430
from France to San
Francisco in 1878.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.200
And in San Francisco,
it was massively

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.820
reinforced for the ice,
practically rebuilt.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.640
And then they begin to stuff
it with all the latest American

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.780
inventions, including
Edison's lights, which

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.480
had just been designed.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.170
They were still being perfected.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.550
They weren't quite
ready as it turned out.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.250
Telephone equipment from
Alexander Graham Bell,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.740
telegraph equipment.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.710
They wanted to be able
to communicate over

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.630
vast expanses of the ice.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.510
Many, many, many kegs
of Budweiser beer.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.650
They had a state
of the art library.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.176
They had an organ.

00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:18.800
They knew they were
going into the ice,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.440
and this was going to
be a long, long voyage.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.530
They had enough food
for three years.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.450
And they left San Francisco
in the summer of 1879.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:34.344
20,000 people were there to
celebrate and to send them off

00:20:34.344 --> 00:20:35.010
into the Arctic.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.790
Yeah, you had a question?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.706
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just
wondering how many people

00:20:37.706 --> 00:20:39.020
were on the ship.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.450
HAMPTON SIDES: 33 men,
Captain DeLong and 32 men.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.310
They headed north past Alaska.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.350
That last stop was Alaska, where
they picked up 40 dogs and two

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.300
Inuit .

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.140
Hunters It was a very
international cast

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.560
of characters.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.100
There were five or
six Naval officers.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.230
There was a surgeon.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.880
There was a meteorologist.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.530
There was a naturalist.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.040
And there was an
ice pilot, someone

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:10.460
who had a career really
in the Arctic as a whaler.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.180
And there were two
Chinese cooks that

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.500
had been hired in
Chinatown in San Francisco.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.980
So it was a motley crew of
individuals heading north

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.280
to test Petermann's theories.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.390
Went through the Bering Strait,
through the Chukchi Sea,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.990
past Wrangel Island.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.240
They didn't find a
warm water current.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.530
They did not find
the open polar sea.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.650
What they found was
ice, a lot of it.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.100
They got stuck in the
ice in September of '79

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:58.680
and began to drift in the ice
in a northwesterly direction,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.940
and they drifted for
two years-- two years.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.320
About a mile a day.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.040
Every day is more or less like
the next, sort of a Groundhog

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.615
Day kind of thing.

00:22:10.615 --> 00:22:13.070
And it presented an interesting
dilemma for me as a writer

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.150
because I didn't know
exactly how to tackle

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.737
the problem of those two years.

00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:18.820
So I did something I didn't
think I would ever do,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.600
which is kind of
a cinematic thing.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.050
I had a little break at
the end of one chapter,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.770
had a next section and
just said "one year later."

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.390
Because every day was almost
identical to the next.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.700
So during these
two years, DeLong

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.810
had men out every day
measuring the ice,

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.090
taking lots of measurements
of barometric pressure,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:53.280
temperature, the specific
gravity-- all kinds of things.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.980
It was like floating or
drifting ice station, Arctic

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.430
ice station, really-- as
they worked their way north.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.290
During this two
year period, the men

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.240
really get to know each
other, a lot of togetherness.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.630
And some of the
characters really

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.900
emerge as real striking
characters in the book.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.440
And I grew to know
these men, to love them,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.007
sometimes to hate them
while I was writing them.

00:23:22.007 --> 00:23:23.590
Some of the ones
that really emerged--

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.940
this is Melville the engineer,
a distant relative of Herman

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.370
Melville the writer.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.880
An amazing man who
could fix anything.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.640
And believe me, everything went
wrong during this expedition

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.660
and he was called upon.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.270
For example, the
ship was constantly

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.900
leaking as the
ice was strangling

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.100
the whole of the vessel.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.710
And so he devised a
series of windmills

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.290
to bring up all
the excess water.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.642
Kept the ship afloat
for those two years.

00:23:51.642 --> 00:23:53.100
This is Melville
as an old man when

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.340
he became engineer of the
entire US Navy and ultimately

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.330
a Rear Admiral.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.230
There's Collins,
the Irishman, who

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:10.580
was the meteorologist and
the scientist onboard.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.470
Interesting man, brilliant
man, but unfortunately he

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.770
had a propensity
for delivering puns,

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.462
like really, really bad puns.

00:24:18.462 --> 00:24:19.670
And he couldn't help himself.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.617
Now that's fine.

00:24:20.617 --> 00:24:22.200
We've all been around
people like that

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.370
for two days or something.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.690
That might be fine.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.720
This was two years.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.420
Everyone wanted to kill Collins.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.310
There was Ambler
the surgeon, who

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.060
saw every kind of malady
you could imagine,

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.950
particularly vitamin
deficiencies.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.770
There was lead poisoning.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.050
There was polar bear
liver ingestion problems.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.040
I guess that's vitamin
A. He saw it all

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.500
and had to be quite
creative in treating

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.670
these various ailments.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.710
One of the ailments
that he had to treat

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.100
was Danenhower's
case of syphilis.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.550
Turns out that
Danenhower, who was

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.520
the navigator and a
brilliant man, also

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.500
a graduate of the Naval
Academy, it turned out

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.890
that he had syphilis.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.390
And it manifested itself in the
form of an eye condition called

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.620
syphilitic iritis,
which required

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.770
dozens and dozens of operations
without anesthesia down

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.460
in the ship.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.580
And he had he could not
tolerate any light whatsoever.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.290
So he had to wear these goggles
the entire voyage, somewhat

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.270
symbolizing this voyage, this
doomed voyage, that you have

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.618
essentially a blind navigator.

00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:40.202
Not a good thing.

00:25:40.202 --> 00:25:41.160
So they drifted though.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.700
The first year was kind of like
this, just all over the place.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.010
They circled back on
themselves many times, which

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.880
was extremely frustrating.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.310
But finally the
drift smoothed out

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.620
and they worked their
way to the Northwest.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.970
DeLong by this point
had completely given up

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.470
on the open polar sea theory.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.320
He was cursing
Petermann's name, but he

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.540
thought he might not
sail to the North Pole,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.660
but he might drift
there in the ice

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.782
if the ship, which had
been massively reinforced,

00:26:12.782 --> 00:26:14.490
if the ship could
withstand the pressure,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.390
he thought they might
drift to the North Pole

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.000
because they were heading
in the right direction.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.720
He had dogs.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.130
He thought maybe he
could get out on the ice

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.088
and make a dash for it.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.580
Every day, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.180
the men were out
on the ice taking

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.680
measurements of everything.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.150
And the log books, which ended
up in the National Archives

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.190
in Washington, they're very
heavy folio size books.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.820
When I was reading them,
I was just thinking, gosh.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.090
The journey that
these books took

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.340
to get into the
National Archives.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.940
They're heavy.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.780
They're cumbersome.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.080
DeLong had to make some
strategic decisions

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.760
about keeping them as
things go from bad to worse

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.609
during the expedition.

00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:54.400
But there they are.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.649
But when I was reading them,
I was thinking, you know,

00:26:56.649 --> 00:26:58.410
this is terrible.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.320
What a waste of all this energy,
all this data, just hundreds

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.310
and hundreds and
hundreds of pages

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.310
of data about the
condition of the Arctic.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.620
And I thought what a waste.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:15.500
But then I found out that NOAA,
in tandem with a group called

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.050
Old Weather, has been
taking the DeLong journals,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.550
and digitizing all this data,
and using it, ultimately,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.350
to study the condition
of the Arctic.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.410
Because when you talk
about global warming,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.090
one of the problems they've
always had is no one really

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:34.090
knows what the condition of
the ice was 150 years ago.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.110
Because to do that, you'd
have to go to a time machine

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.727
back to the 1800s.

00:27:39.727 --> 00:27:41.310
You'd have to ram
yourself in the ice.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.120
You'd have to drift for
two years in the ice

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.610
and take daily measurements,
even hourly measurements.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.732
No one would do that, right?

00:27:49.732 --> 00:27:51.940
Well someone did, and it's
George DeLong and his men.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.720
And this is a
stretch of the Arctic

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.280
no one had ever
been through before.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.000
And these the log books are
proving extremely valuable now

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.750
in these studies
that are going on.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.360
When I do these
narratives, I like

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.250
whenever possible to travel to
the places I'm writing about.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:18.020
This story mostly takes place in
the Arctic sections of Russia.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.720
So I got myself a
really bad haircut

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.950
and I went to Moscow first
to get a bunch of permits.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.870
Because unfortunately,
I couldn't just

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.460
go across from Alaska.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.940
I was going to a lot
restricted areas.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.050
So a "National
Geographic" fixer person

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.960
helped me get these
permits in Moscow.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.320
And then I flew-- what is it?

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.140
Eight, Nine time zones east?

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.520
All away to the east
coast of Siberia to Anadyr

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.310
where I picked up this
Russian ice breaker--

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.200
it's not quite fully
an ice breaker.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.964
It's a reinforced
vessel-- And headed north.

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.380
I thought it was
pretty ridiculous

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.000
that I had to travel
13,000 miles to look

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.850
at my own country, Alaska.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.670
Heading north,
waving at Sarah Palin

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:09.630
as I went along the
northeast coast of Siberia.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:10.550
Amazing place.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.750
Mostly uninhabited.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:16.880
We did stop at this one
village where they had just

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.530
killed a whale, and they were
having a summer festival,

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.230
and invited us ashore.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.210
And we stayed there
for a few hours.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.080
I took this with an iPhone.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.580
But there were soldiers with
Kalashnikovs that didn't really

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.760
want us to be there.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.670
They ushered us back
to the ship and we

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.830
headed north in the direction
of Wrangel Island, which

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.130
is where we were going.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.720
There was a French
documentary crew

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.820
that was doing something
about woolly mammoths.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.720
There were various
atmospheric scientists.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.720
And then there was just a
whole bunch of intense birders,

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.050
like really, really
into birding.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.810
Professional birders almost.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:58.450
As we headed north, we
encountered more and more ice

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.860
until we got through this place.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.410
This is looking straight down
from the bow of the ship.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.665
And I just took this
again with an iPhone.

00:30:06.665 --> 00:30:10.080
But it gives you some
sense of how quickly

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.242
the ice give can build up.

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:12.700
And this is in the
month of August.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.285
So that brought us
to a complete halt.

00:30:17.285 --> 00:30:19.700
We had to back up and
refigure our course.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.260
But we eventually
reach our destination,

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.830
which was Wrangel Island.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.630
Wrangel Island is a
very interesting place.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.950
It's been called the
Galapagos of the high north.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.290
It's got a huge amount
of wildlife-- Pacific

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:39.080
walrus, and snowy owls, and
snow geese, and Arctic fox,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.490
and polar bears-- lots
and lots of polar bear.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.070
August Petermann thought
that it was a continent.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.610
It had only been glimpsed
by some Arctic whalers,

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.140
and it looked pretty large.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.260
And he had this grand theory
that it was actually Greenland,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.360
that Greenland came
up over, not quite

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.750
the pole but near the pole, and
all the way to the other side.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.990
And that this was the
tip of Greenland--

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.880
another one of his
obviously wrong ideas,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.650
but an interesting
place nonetheless.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.530
It's uninhabited.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.980
There are four Russian
rangers who live

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.890
there, are stationed there.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.580
And when we came ashore in
these little Zodiac rafts,

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:23.320
these Russian rangers were
so happy to see us, so happy

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.170
to see fresh human life.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.960
And we were happy
that the two or three

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.830
cabins that there were all
reinforced on the windows

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.170
there with bear guards.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.950
Because there are
polar bears everywhere.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.210
They congregate in larger
and larger numbers there

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.280
because during the summer, the
ice is increasingly unreliable.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.970
And this is one of the only
scraps of land for thousands

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.500
of miles in any direction.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.590
So this is one of the
places that they go.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.840
I was there with a photographer
named Sergey [? Gorshkov ?]

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.510
who has been going to
Wrangel for over a decade,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.850
taking these amazing wildlife
pictures for "National

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.260
Geographic Magazine and
a story that I wrote

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:15.110
that came out in March of 2013.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:19.030
Arctic fox puppy.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.780
They're constantly battling
over these snow geese eggs.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.900
Sometimes, the geese win.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.435
Sometimes, the foxes win.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.550
Musk ox.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.580
Also excellent facial hair.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.400
So that's Wrangel Island.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.530
It's an extraordinary place
and was one of the goals

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.850
that DeLong was reaching for.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:45.190
When he realized that he was
going to be stuck in the ice,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.420
he then began to hope, well,
at least I can land on Wrangel

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.702
and explore Wrangel.

00:32:49.702 --> 00:32:50.910
But he was able to get there.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.920
The ice took him up, and over,
and around it too quickly.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.510
So he never landed on it.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.060
Another thing about
Wrangel is it's

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.750
believed to be the
last place on Earth

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.740
where woolly mammoths lived
some 3,000 years after they

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.480
became extinct on the mainland.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.510
So you see tusks all over the
island in riverbeds like this.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.134
And Sergey just took
this shot of me.

00:33:14.134 --> 00:33:15.800
I tried to fit it
into my overnight bag.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.017
It wouldn't fit.

00:33:18.017 --> 00:33:19.100
It's extraordinary though.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.180
You these just
everywhere you go.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.960
DeLong did not reach Wrangel,
but another American vessel

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.667
did reach it that
summer of 1881.

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:33.750
They were looking for the
Jeannette at that point.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.550
They wanted to get
some tidings of what

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.175
had happened to the
Jeanette because it

00:33:37.175 --> 00:33:39.450
had been gone for two years.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:41.710
Onboard that vessel
was the father

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.960
of the American environmental
movement, John Muir, who

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.980
then was a young newspaperman.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.390
And he wrote beautifully about
the search for the Jeanette

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.006
that summer of 1881.

00:33:53.006 --> 00:33:54.630
He becomes a pretty
important character

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.840
in the middle of the book.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.380
After Wrangel Island, I went
on to other parts of Russia,

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.150
including the Lena Delta,
which is by some counts

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.300
the largest delta in the world.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.500
The Lena River is
a massive river

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:14.730
that empties into the Arctic
Ocean in central Siberia.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.050
And I wanted to go to a place
called America Mountain.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.090
400 miles north of
the Arctic Circle,

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.480
in the middle of nowhere,
in the middle of this delta,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.230
is a place called America
Mountain, known there still

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.320
to this day as America mountain.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.357
It's a monument that was built
in the 1880s to the Jeanette.

00:34:34.357 --> 00:34:35.690
It took me forever to get there.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.909
I did a story for
"Outside Magazine"

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.659
that got me up the river.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:44.480
I had to get on riverboat,
and then a smaller boat,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.540
and then finally a raft.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.159
And then finally
at the end, I just

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.870
had to start wading
across all this water,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.575
swatting mosquitoes constantly.

00:34:53.575 --> 00:34:57.290
It was the most mosquito
infested place I've ever been.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.070
We finally found
America mountain

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.940
and got to the top of it, and
found the monument more or less

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.400
as it had been left
from the 1880s.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.510
That's taken about 2:00
or 3:00 in the morning,

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.550
that photograph.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.480
It doesn't get dark in
the middle of summer.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.410
Anyway, back to the
historical story.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:26.410
So all through 1880 and 1881,
the men of the Jeannette

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.470
are drifting in a
northwesterly direction.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:34.530
But finally in June of
1881, it becomes clear

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.930
that the ship is not going
to withstand the pressure.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.727
DeLong doesn't have much time.

00:35:39.727 --> 00:35:41.060
He can tell the ship is sinking.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:45.070
He gets all his
stuff out on the ice.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:49.060
And a lot of decisions
had to be made

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.430
about what to bring
because if he could tell

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.280
it was going fast.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.090
And finally it did sink to the
bottom of the Arctic Ocean.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.801
This is a French
painting that maybe

00:35:59.801 --> 00:36:02.050
makes it a little more
heroic-looking than it actually

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:02.850
was.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:08.280
But it sank to the bottom,
and DeLong and his 32 men

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.220
and 40 dogs are out on the ice
with their three open boats,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.220
small whale boats,
with no other choice

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.870
but to drag these boats
and their few belongings

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.780
south to the nearest landmass,
which was the central Arctic

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.645
coast of Siberia.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:33.040
Now, we know exactly
where the Jeanette sank.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.330
DeLong took exact
measurements when it sank,

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:42.170
and it's in Arctic waters,
not very far from the DeLong

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:48.110
Islands, because DeLong and his
men discovered three islands.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.160
And there's a group
of scientists,

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.670
both in Russia and in the
United States, NOAA scientists,

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:01.160
also the US Navy and a Russian
group of scientists as well

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.985
as the Russian
Geographical Society.

00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:06.060
They're all interested
in finding the wreck

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.490
and photographing it,
and maybe bringing up

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.520
some relics, including those
lights of Edison's that didn't

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.290
work, and also the photographs.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.880
All the photographs
that were taken

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.720
of this expedition on glass
plates went down with the ship.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.410
So there's a movement now.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.320
Even though our
relationship with Russia

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.030
officially is not
very good, there

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:29.510
is a movement to try to build
an expedition for next summer.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.340
So we'll see how that goes out.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.200
I'm very excited about
it and want to go.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.559
OK, so in the summer of
1881, back in America,

00:37:38.559 --> 00:37:39.350
what was happening?

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:43.010
Well, first thing, Bennett
had decided that summer it

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.760
was time to bring the
sport from England that

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.920
was known as tennis
to the United States

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.950
and introduce it to the country.

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.750
So he built this
enormous palace.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.930
It's called the Newport
Casino in Rhode Island.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.340
It's now the international
Hall of Fame for Tennis.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.620
So while the men are
out on the ice cap,

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.280
Bennett is back in
Rhode Island introducing

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.700
tennis to the United States
and not suffering so much.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.540
He invites DeLong's wife,
Emma DeLong, up to Newport

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.239
for some tennis and yachting.

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.280
The Gilded Age, you know?

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.360
It's a good time.

00:38:21.879 --> 00:38:23.670
And Emma deLong becomes
a pretty important,

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.128
I'd say a very
important character,

00:38:25.128 --> 00:38:29.050
in the middle and end of the
book for a variety of reasons.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:30.525
Mainly, she wrote beautifully.

00:38:30.525 --> 00:38:33.530
She wrote these beautiful,
beautiful letters,

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.980
and I had this rather
amazing experience, which

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.820
I think historians dream about.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.270
Historians dream
of this thing where

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.290
you find a descendant of
one of your main characters.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.920
And that descendant
tells you, hey, you know,

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.630
I just happen to have this trunk
full of letters in my attic.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.340
Would you please come
and take it off my hands?

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.850
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.000
I heard about-- actually
cold called this woman

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.957
Catherine DeLong in Connecticut.

00:39:04.957 --> 00:39:06.790
She said she had this
trunk full of letters,

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.680
and it was the personal
papers of Emma DeLong.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.240
Please take them.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.870
Give them-- donate them to a
library somewhere eventually.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.680
But this is me and Catherine
DeLong at the Explorers

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.250
Club in New York City, which is
an amazing place, the Explorers

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.190
Club.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.990
Lots of taxidermy.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.640
But she loaned me these papers.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.130
And in the papers were
all kinds of things,

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.580
love letters all from
the courtship days

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.300
of Emma and George.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.470
But also these
letters that she wrote

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.280
in the summer of 1880
and 1881 and sent

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.800
north by way of
these Arctic whalers

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.880
in the hope that
somehow, some way,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.460
they would reach her husband.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.330
And they're beautiful,
beautiful letters.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.530
And it really
becomes a love story

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.890
in the middle
portion of the book.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:57.700
One of those letters she
sent by way of Greenland.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.220
And it ended up in a hut in
far, far northern Greenland.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.260
And Robert Pearey on his way
to the North Pole found it.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.930
And he knew immediately
who it was from.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.900
And it still had the
red wax seal on it,

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.260
which you can see there.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.470
And he stuffed it in his furs,
and eventually got it back

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.760
to New York City, and hand
delivered it to Emma DeLong.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.280
So that letter is in that trove.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.650
So during the summer of
1881, DeLong and his men

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.990
struggle over the ice.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.860
They have just the
summer to do this.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.710
They know that
once winter comes,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.501
they're not going to survive it.

00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:41.000
They don't have
enough food, so they

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.080
have to constantly hunt
for polar bear, and walrus,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.410
and seal, which they prove
to be very successful at.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.260
You'll be glad to know that
the dogs are not eaten.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.820
They have plenty of
other things to eat.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.300
My editor wants us to
do a companion book that

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:04.230
would be the Jeanette
Cookbook, like permitted walrus

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.090
fetus, all kinds of good stuff.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.600
But they survive, and
in fact, they thrive.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.220
And in a weird way, this is
maybe the happiest period

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.080
of the expedition.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.621
Because they're
struggling every day.

00:41:14.621 --> 00:41:18.906
They're in excruciating
pain, but they're

00:41:18.906 --> 00:41:20.530
getting tremendous
exercise and they're

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.600
working for this common goal.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.780
DeLong organizes the
men extremely well

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.150
into these three teams.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.230
They compete against each
other, and they work their way

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.500
south over the ice.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.580
And they are on
the ice for 92 days

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.625
till they finally
come to open water.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.520
Most of these Arctic stories
have the perfect trifecta

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:57.000
of scurvy, mutiny, and
of course cannibalism.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.700
And this has none
of those, and I

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.270
think it's a testament to
the leadership of DeLong

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.910
and the camaraderie
of this group

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.400
that they held this thing
together for those 92 days.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.260
And it's an extraordinary
survival story, really,

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.030
in this part of the story.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.730
So this shows their
general path south.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.590
It starts out that
they are going south.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:23.830
You see here they go north.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.520
And that's not because
they didn't have a compass.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.940
It's because they
struggled south and had

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.590
a really productive
period of about two weeks

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.240
where DeLong thought they
were making great progress,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.910
but then he took a
positional reading,

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:44.450
and they realized that the
ice was drifting faster north

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.900
than they were moving south.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.220
The whole ice pack
was moving, and so it

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.680
was a Sisyphean effort.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.890
They were moving backwards.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.760
Then it evens out here, and
then they work their way south.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.490
They discover this
island right here,

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:04.079
Bennett Island, which they
declared American soil,

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:05.120
raised the American flag.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.140
And just as John
Muir's group, when

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.945
they landed on Wrangel Island,
they declared American soil.

00:43:14.945 --> 00:43:16.820
But the United States
didn't do much to press

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.105
their claim on that land, and
it's now Russian territory.

00:43:22.344 --> 00:43:24.260
So they worked their way
through these islands

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.970
that are called
the New Siberians,

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:32.110
working their way
towards the Lana Delta.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:35.200
When they finally
encounter open water,

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.740
they want to put their
whale boats in the water.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.660
But it turns out they
are not seaworthy.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.865
Dragging them all over the ice,
banging them up the whole time

00:43:44.865 --> 00:43:46.780
had created leaks.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.220
So Melville and his
carpenters rebuild these boats

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.890
using driftwood,
whalebone, walrus tusks,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.180
whatever they can find.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.860
They somehow patch them
together and they finally

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.780
set sail in late
August in open water

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:09.720
when they encounter a massive
gale, practically a hurricane.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:13.200
And the three boats are
separated from each other.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.010
And really that is where I end
my talk, because the last 150

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.510
pages, 200 pages of
the book are about what

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.472
happens to those three boats
and the very different fates

00:44:23.472 --> 00:44:25.180
of the three boats as
they work their way

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.380
toward land and toward safety.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.360
So that's the story
of the Jeanette

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.180
as they work their way, really,
towards this delta, a place

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:38.720
that is said to be about
the size of three Florida

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:44.680
Everglades, except a frozen
Everglades, a labyrinth.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.950
So these men are
trying to find safety

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:52.010
and trying to find each other
in incredibly tangled maze

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.660
and this incredible landscape.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.530
So that is the story
of the Jeanette.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.680
Don't Google it.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.410
This is Google, but
don't Google it.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.220
You can find out
what happens, but I

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.090
believe this story is much more
powerful, much more haunting,

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.680
and much more
beautiful if you don't

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.950
know the fate of these men
and what happens to them.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.410
Don't read the New
York Times Book

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.430
Review, which is a complete
plot summary of my book.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:23.550
I think you'll really find the
last 200 pages or so extremely

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.030
gripping.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.550
And it's a great survival story.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.300
It's a great story about
men who stick together

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.610
through incredible
strife and striving,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.640
and are incredibly
loyal to each other

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.071
as they try to
make it to safety.

00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:45.570
So that's the story
of the Jeanette.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.200
I'd love to hear from you.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.154
Any questions from
the audience about how

00:45:50.154 --> 00:45:52.570
I write these books, how I
research these books, narrative

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.360
history?

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.587
Any questions at all?

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.932
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:01.097 --> 00:46:03.180
AUDIENCE: Why do you think
this tale hasn't really

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.050
gotten the same kind of
publicity as like Franklin

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:10.260
or Shackleton or any of these
other disaster explorers?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.760
HAMPTON SIDES: It's
a good question,

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.093
and I've thought about it a lot.

00:46:13.093 --> 00:46:15.909
And I think that there's
a combination reasons.

00:46:15.909 --> 00:46:18.200
I mean, one is that I think
the British are much better

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.860
than the Americans
at celebrating

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.430
their noble failures.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.570
In fact, they love
those stories.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.510
In America, we like to win.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.680
We like we like to
achieve and succeed.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.220
And I think Perry, Perry reached
the North Pole although that's

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:37.590
contested in 1909 with Henson.

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.950
And we love that story.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:44.110
That's the story that we
focus on a little bit more.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.680
The Franklin Expedition
was a colossal failure.

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.280
Shackleton wasn't
exactly a failure

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.680
in the sense that no one died.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.610
But they didn't reach
their destination.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.240
I think that's one
of the reasons.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.550
Another thing is that all
the photographs went down

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:58.260
with the ship.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.432
We're a very visual culture.

00:47:00.432 --> 00:47:02.015
Those Shackleton
pictures are amazing.

00:47:02.015 --> 00:47:04.320
They are truly
amazing, and I think

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.410
one of the reasons why
Shackleton is so well known

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:10.280
is because of those
extraordinary images.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:12.890
I think it's also just
kind of a burnout thing.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.950
I mean, this was
so big in its time.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.300
It produced so many
different books.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:22.050
And all the survivors
had their own accounts.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.180
And Emma DeLong had her account.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.800
DeLong's journals were published
and became bestselling books.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.320
So it did have its day,
but it just burned out

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.030
and then tell
between the cracks.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:38.140
And then Pearey came
along, and other explorers

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.990
who took the story farther.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.570
So those are some
of the reasons.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:46.090
Maybe there wasn't a good writer
who came along to deal with it.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.680
And I hope I've begun
to make a dent in this.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.637
Because I do truly believe it
is one of the great survival

00:47:52.637 --> 00:47:54.970
stories, one of the great
adventure stories of all time.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.426
And it is sort of the American
Shackleton, if you will.

00:47:58.426 --> 00:48:00.550
AUDIENCE: So two very
different questions actually.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.861
What you had said made
me think of another one.

00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:05.360
What else would you put in the
Pantheon of great adventures?

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.990
And then the other
unrelated question

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.823
is how does the process
of writing this book

00:48:08.823 --> 00:48:10.410
compare to your other books?

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.534
HAMPTON SIDES: Pantheon of
great adventure stories?

00:48:12.534 --> 00:48:14.260
Wow, that's tough.

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:21.070
There's certainly Nansen, who
I mentioned at the beginning.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.010
What's extraordinary
about Nansen

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:30.070
is he tried to duplicate
the Voyage of the Jeanette

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:34.220
in a differently designed
vessel, the Fram, this boat

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:39.430
that he had built. And what
happened was with Nansen,

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.800
Fridtjof Nansen from
Norway, he found out

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.410
that some relics of the
Jeanette had washed up

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:49.590
on shore in Greenland about
five years after the Jeanette

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.390
voyage.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.510
And one of them was a
pair of seal skin pants

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.180
that had on the inseam a little
tag that said George Washington

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.090
DeLong.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.140
And he realized that
meant that these pants had

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.450
come up and over the
pole and had popped out

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.390
on the other side in Greenland.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.380
And so he surmised,
correctly as it turned out,

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.680
that that was the
prevailing pattern

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.780
of the wind and the drift
of the ice, the currents.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.300
And so George Washington DeLong
didn't make it the North Pole,

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.220
but his pants did.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.180
And he got to thinking,
well, why don't I

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.300
just ram myself in
the ice in exactly

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:33.889
the same place that DeLong's
men did, and drift in the ice?

00:49:33.889 --> 00:49:35.930
He wasn't looking for the
open polar sea anymore.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.300
Just use the ice, work with it.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.280
And that's what he did.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.390
And his adventure--
"Furthest North"

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:47.180
is the book that he wrote--
is an extraordinary story.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.760
They got very close
to the North Pole.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.860
realized he wasn't
going to reach it.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.430
And he got out on the ice
with his dogs and another guy.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:57.375
And they made a
dash for the pole.

00:49:57.375 --> 00:49:58.860
They didn't quite make it.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.927
They turned around,
couldn't find the Fram.

00:50:00.927 --> 00:50:02.510
MALE SPEAKER: He's
unofficially called

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:04.697
the Father of Oceanography
as well, Nansen.

00:50:04.697 --> 00:50:05.780
HAMPTON SIDES: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.860
I mean, he was a
brilliant scientist.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.360
He was a statesman,
and he ultimately

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.970
won the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:13.720
Extraordinary man.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.930
So I put Nansen's
adventures at the very top

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:22.050
of all the Arctic adventurers
that I've read about.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.760
Of course, there's Amundsen.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.740
The Scandinavians,
the Norwegians

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:31.990
are the best at this kind
of exploration, I think.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.860
The question is how did this
differ from my other books?

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.820
You know, the
biggest difference is

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.070
I had to go farther afield
than any of my other books.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.530
I like to travel to
wherever the story takes

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.020
place, but this one, it was
really hard to get to Russia.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.180
I mean, luckily there
was this little window

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.890
where our relationship with
Russia was pretty good.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.760
And I was able to
get those permits

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.182
and go to these
restricted areas.

00:50:57.182 --> 00:50:58.890
It was expensive
though, and complicated,

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.924
and logistically involved.

00:51:01.924 --> 00:51:02.840
But I love doing that.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.890
That's the fun part of
doing these stories.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:09.260
And it pays off in so many ways
in the way you write about ice,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.010
or you write about
the tundra, or any

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.570
of these passages I have.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.900
It gives you a confidence
about describing landscape

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.744
that you couldn't otherwise get.

00:51:22.744 --> 00:51:24.910
And I also just wanted to
understand the Gilded Age.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.110
It's just such a fascinating
period, you know?

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.510
America's beginning
to look familiar.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.280
It's not quite there yet.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.594
It's still a brawling
teenager that's trying

00:51:35.594 --> 00:51:36.510
to figure out what it.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.250
It has a lot of ambition.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:41.860
It has a lot of
technological prowess,

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.820
but it's still not
quite a mature country.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.760
And so you get
people like Bennett.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.300
You get people like Edison
and all these inventions

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.680
that are happening.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.890
And it's trying to flex its
muscles on the world stage.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.160
It's a really interesting time.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:57.780
All right.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.580
I'm going to sign some
books if you like.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.780
Thank you very much.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.840
Pleasure being here.
