LINDSAY METCALFE:
Hello, everyone,

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.210
and welcome to our talk
"Designing for Daydream."

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.640
How many people here
attended a VR talk yesterday?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.970
It's really great to see this.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.660
It's so nice to see so many
people who have been designing

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.760
VR for a while, and who are just
really excited about everything

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.790
we're doing here at IO, and
then people who are just getting

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.290
started.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.720
So for Daydream,
our goal here is

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.366
enabling very high
quality mobile VR,

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.490
all the way from like
hardware up through the stock

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.800
to the user experience.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.990
So we really want to make
sure that we're giving you

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.830
everything that you need to
create really compelling VR

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.029
immersive experiences.

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:38.070
And we've talked a lot
this week about everything

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.640
from hardware optimizations
to developer tools.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.510
And we had some great
talks yesterday too.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.640
So yesterday we talked
about VR filmmaking.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.610
We had a really
great talk on lessons

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.060
learned from design labs from
our rapid prototyping team.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.150
And you can watch all
of this on YouTube

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.450
if you missed any of this.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.830
And so today we want to go
a bit deeper in designing

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.520
for Daydream and talk all
about the key ingredients

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.019
and considerations for
designing for Daydream.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.470
So really, what's
important for creating

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.740
great VR content
that's comfortable,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.495
engaging but also unique?

00:01:10.495 --> 00:01:12.620
And to do this we're going
to walk you through four

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.720
different lightning talks.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:18.860
So the first of these, at
the center of the experience,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.700
we're going to take a
look at your audience.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.230
So who are you designing for ?

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.300
What do we know
about them already?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.260
And what of that
can help you create

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.102
the very best content for them?

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:30.310
And then we're going to take
a look at the ergonomics

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.770
of that user in VR.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.390
So what are the important
considerations and constraints

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.600
that can give you a
starting point for designing

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.460
and prototyping.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.780
In VR?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.586
Next, creating a
feeling of presence

00:01:41.586 --> 00:01:43.960
and being able to transport
people to different realities

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.714
is really key to grafting VR.

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:47.130
So we're going to
talk you through

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.260
why crafting the right
environment is important,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.209
and also how to get it right.

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:53.250
And then finally, we're
to explore something else

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.180
that's also really important
for presence, which is input,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.060
and how you can use a
world of interactions

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.357
that are made possible with
our Daydream controller.

00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:02.190
And now I'm going to
hand this over to Dave,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.140
and he's going to talk to
you about your audience.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.000
Thank you so much.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.180
DAVID DEARMAN: Thanks, Lindsay.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.070
So over the past
year, Google's VR team

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.330
has been doing a lot of
research to better understand

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.150
how people are using
high end mobile devices.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.410
Whoops.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.300
I skipped ahead.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.840
How people are using
high end mobile devices,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560
but also how we can make VR
a part of our daily life.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.784
And today I want to
share three insights

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.200
from that research
with you that I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.030
think will help us build
better experiences.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.370
And the first insight from
the research that we took away

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.970
was that VR is really compelling
to a broad number of people

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.720
and for many, many
different reasons.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.600
There's a large audience of
people who want to get into VR.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.140
And what they told
us when we talked

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.880
to them was that VR is
really this great gateway

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.090
to enable them to have
new experiences, new forms

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.900
of entertainment, also
change their perspective

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.010
and how they might see
things, but also give them

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.650
new abilities-- whether
it be superhuman abilities

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.960
or super powers-- to do
things they couldn't actually

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.830
do in real life.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.850
And I want to go through
a couple of these.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.700
So the first is gaming.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.920
Gaming is a powerful
opportunity for VR,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.350
and not just hardcore gaming.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.760
All types of gaming.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800
So let's take an example
here: my golf game.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.060
I love to play golf.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610
Traditionally, a
golf game, you would

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.360
have sort of the third
person perspective.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.480
You'd see the person
swinging their club,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.400
you control it
with a controller.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.120
But with VR, the controller
can become your putter.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.680
You can take on the
perspective of that golfer.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.560
So you can line
up over that putt.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.980
You can actually make it and
see the ball go in the hole.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.605
That's a really
compelling perspective.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.800
Next, personal cinema.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.880
VR can become your
own personal cinema.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.710
If you're watching a video,
a movie, binging on TV shows,

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.090
you don't need to be constrained
to a small little screen

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.589
anymore.

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.250
Whether your screen is
30 inches, 60 inches,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.664
even 100 inches.

00:03:56.664 --> 00:03:59.600
VR can immerse people
in that content.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.490
So rather than seeing
those raindrops sort

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.960
of trickling down on your
screen 10 feet in front of you,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.770
you can actually feel
those raindrops are

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.480
going to hit that leaf
and sort of bounce

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.290
off and hit you, because you're
kind of in the content itself.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.660
VR can also take people to
new places, places that we

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.899
kind of only dream about.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.110
I would love to become
an astronaut, tour space,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.810
find a new places.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.690
Probably not going to
happen in my lifetime.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.790
Maybe it will.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.450
But in VR, we can all
become that space explorer.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.762
We can all go to Mars.

00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:33.220
In sort of the snap
of our fingers,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.345
we can be teleported there.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:36.190
We could be standing
next to the Rover,

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.900
or even exploring other planets
that maybe we haven't even

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.570
discovered yet.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.090
VR also provides a more intimate
way to bring people together.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.150
More so than say traditional
communication technologies.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.369
You know, daily life doesn't
afford us the ability

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:54.160
to be around the people
that we care about,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.240
whether it's our loved
ones, friends, colleagues,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.380
acquaintances.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.640
VR can bring people together
across distance and time.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.490
And it could put us in
that virtual coffee shop

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.080
where we could
interact with objects.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.930
We could sit side by side.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.020
It could be the next
best thing to actually

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.950
having that face to face
conversation that real life may

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.730
not afford us at that time.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.230
There's also huge
learning opportunities.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.680
VR can be sort of
the premier place

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.380
to learn and also to sort
of have personal growth.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.110
Imagine this engine here.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.900
In VR, I could take that engine
apart with a wave in my hand.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.440
I could see how all the
pieces come together.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.300
I could see all the steps
and how I might assemble it.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.310
That might be really
difficult in real life.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.427
And it's also, if
I make a mistake,

00:05:41.427 --> 00:05:43.510
it could be really effortful
to undo that mistake.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.010
But in VR, you could
undo that really easy.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.810
Try again.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.620
It didn't work.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.050
I could undo it and try again.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.270
You could make experiential
learning really easy.

00:05:54.884 --> 00:05:56.300
And on the flip
side of that coin,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.230
there's also
experiential creation.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.160
VR can become the premier
place for self-expression

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.810
or creativity.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.601
It's a place where I
could create and craft

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.130
my masterpiece.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.850
You have control over the
palette, the color, the tools,

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.221
the perspective, the size.

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.470
If I want to make my thing
small, I can make it small.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.849
But I could very easily then
grow it and make it larger.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.890
That's something you really
can't do in real life

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.230
very easily.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.720
But in VR you can.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.900
The only limitation
really here is the tools

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.042
that we provide people
and their imagination.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.530
And finally, access to
professional services

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.390
and professionals themselves.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.540
Throughout our
life, we need access

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.340
to people who can
help us do things.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.510
For example, buying a home.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.490
You typically reach out to
a real estate professional

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.260
to help you do that task.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.000
They can guide you
through the process,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.690
help you understand
all the rules,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.640
take you from place to place.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.270
But doing that in real life,
that can be quite effortful.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.990
It takes a full
afternoon, a weekend

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.899
to go visit five
different homes, five

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.190
different rentals that you're
thinking of getting into.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.960
But with a snap
of a finger in VR,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.600
the real estate agent
could take you from A to B

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.300
to C. They could take you to
20 places in the same time

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.920
that you could drive
between three or four.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.210
What's also interesting
about this case,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.200
sort of looking
at AR VR together,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.860
is that I could visit
this blank home.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.280
And they could change all
the content in that space

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.640
to match my style.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.510
Rather than walking
into a staged home that

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.310
doesn't meet what I would
typically want to move into,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.370
so it doesn't really
resonate with me.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.060
Or just an empty space.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.560
An agent could take that space
and put all my stuff in it.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.059
And be like, this
actually does feel

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:35.580
like a space I could live in.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.070
So beyond motivations and sort
of aspirational expectations,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.240
we also learned a little
bit about how people

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.230
are using these devices today.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.290
And one of the things that
we found inspirational

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.770
is that people are using a
lot of these devices not just

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.830
for snackable moments.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.540
Snackable moments typically you
might associate with a phone.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.165
You pull your phone
out of your pocket,

00:07:55.165 --> 00:07:57.250
you respond to a text
message, you read an e-mail,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.340
check a stock quote.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.340
And then you put it back
in your pocket and move

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.850
on with your day.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.058
You keep sipping your coffee.

00:08:02.058 --> 00:08:03.550
That's a snackable moment.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.390
But VR can be like a really
good compelling book.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.760
As long as the content
is good and entertaining,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.580
it can really keep people's
attention drawn into it.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.700
So for example, if
someone's playing a game

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.530
or visiting new places,
and that content really

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.000
has them attached,
people have told us

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.180
that they can be in a session
for 30 or more minutes.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.121
If they're binging on TV shows
or they're watching a movie,

00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:28.620
what people told
us is that sessions

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.390
can be 90 minutes or longer.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.289
What's really important here
is the quality of that content,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.270
the content itself,
and that's what's

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.840
going to keep people engaged.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.320
And also their comfort
during that experience.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.850
Finally, the third
point, speaking

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.910
of comfort, what we learned from
people when we talked to them

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.940
was that most of the time,
even though these devices

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.860
are portable-- our
phone's portable.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.920
Our headset's portable.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.230
You can put it in a bag or
purse and take it with you.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.730
A lot of people are using
these devices primarily

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.240
in their home,
seated comfortably.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.254
So when we did in home visits
with people, what a lot of them

00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:03.670
actually showed
us is they kind of

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.560
have a comfy spot, a comfy
spot where they sort of use

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.760
their VR headset.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.310
Whether that company spot
was a couch, a favorite seat,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.336
or laying on their bed, what
was clear from the conversations

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:15.710
with them and what
they showed us

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.790
was that standing
really wasn't something

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.940
that they did a lot of.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.110
It gets tiring to stand
up for 30 minutes.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.870
It especially gets
tiring standing up

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.371
trying to watch a
90 minute video.

00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:26.370
It's something they would
do sort of comfortably

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.107
relaxed laying down.

00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:29.690
And I think this is
an important point

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.582
to bring up because a
lot of the experiences

00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:33.040
that we're going
to be building, we

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.890
need to recognize that
people aren't necessarily

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.890
going to be standing up
and moving around a lot.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.810
They're probably going
to be seated comfortably.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.520
And that's something we need
to take into account when

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.312
we're actually building
something for them.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:44.936
And on that note,
I'm going to hand off

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.437
to Mike who will
talk about building

00:09:46.437 --> 00:09:47.770
comfortable virtual experiences.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:53.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.950
MIKE ALGER: So VR can seem
like an intimidating medium

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.480
to design for, because
you can do so much.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.470
So constraints can be nice
to use as starting points.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.160
The limits of your body is
one of those constraints

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.800
to start with.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.820
Digital designers are
used to thinking about

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.850
how the eye is guided
through things,

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.310
or how the thumb can reach where
easily on a phone, for example.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.880
When you're designing
for Daydream,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.960
you can think about how
someone's moving their head,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.890
how much of the
scene they can see,

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.309
and how far away things are.

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:25.350
Since you're probably used
to working with an art

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.230
board or canvas, you can
think about how much they

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.685
move as your new boundaries.

00:10:30.685 --> 00:10:33.060
If it's a standing thing, they
can go all the way around.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.010
They just can see a
certain amount at a time.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.300
What they see kind of looks
like a cone from the side.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.160
But if we look at it from their
point of view, it's a circle.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.240
If you have a UI panel
covering more than 70 degrees

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.490
of that field of view,
or 35 to each side,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.770
then it starts to feel like
the theater screen is as

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.570
much as you could even look at.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.940
For reference an IMAX
screen from the middle seat

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.970
is 70 degrees.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.990
If the user is sitting
in a stationary chair,

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.110
like their couch, then there's
boundaries to how far they'll

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.830
comfortably move their neck.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.870
They can easily go all the way
to 80 degrees to each side,

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.100
but 30 was kind of a comfortable
center point left and right.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.550
If you really stretch,
you can put stuff further,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.130
but remember that they'll
have to strain their neck

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.720
or change their posture and
turn their shoulders if it's

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.320
too far, and they're
sitting on a couch.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.170
Vertically, you tend
to look down a little,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.130
like 15 degrees
from the horizon.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.740
But it depends more
on your posture.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.080
Like reclining in a seat,
you can't look down as far

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.610
because your neck is there.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.660
So with those constraints,
you've got a field of view

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.630
and a range of motion.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.220
And that's one way to think
about what you're canvass is.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.050
Things can be placed all
over the range of motion,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.030
but the user will only
be able to see what's

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.540
in the field of view at a time.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.060
We also add depth to that.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.020
Too close in, like a half meter,
for too long is uncomfortable

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.229
because it feels like
it's up in your face.

00:11:57.229 --> 00:11:59.020
You might think that
you want to put things

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.660
right next to your
face, like a helmet,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.160
but you'll find
pretty quick that it

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.670
makes you have to go
cross-eyed to even see it.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.550
Too far, past 20 meters,
and you can't really

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.460
see the difference
in depth very easily.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.870
So most of your main
content and UI stuff

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.130
will fall within
this zone here where

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.349
depth is meaningful
and comfortable to see.

00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:20.890
By the way, to help
people understand

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.890
the depth between objects,
shadows and imperfections

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.390
in the texture are
really important.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.190
So if you have subtle
noise in your textures

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.180
and represent light
realistically,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.160
it will really help give
your users more cues

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.050
to understand depth in the
way that their brains were

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.690
wired to automatically.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.180
The reason is the imperfections
give your eyes something

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.430
to converge on.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.310
Without them, a large
flat color might

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.860
look like an infinite
void of that color.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.000
Watching this, you can
see the little specks

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.340
on your screen surface,
and you perceive its depth.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.285
But in VR, you don't have that.

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:55.660
So the importance of shadows
is something that we already

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.200
knew from material design.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.840
But the necessity of subtle
texture noise is unique to VR.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.560
If you're creating UI, it's also
helpful to know that resolution

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.990
is a major constraint.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.940
As they said at
the last IO, it's

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.520
more useful to talk
about resolution

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.720
in terms of pixels per degree.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.930
You can approximate how
many pixels on the screen

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.932
fit in one degree of your
field of view near the center.

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:20.640
It's reasonable to
expect that resolution

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.090
will increase over time.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.140
But for now we
have the situation

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.120
where aliasing makes hard
edges and thin lines dance

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.850
and sparkle distractingly.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.680
More anti-aliasing looks better,
but can hurt your performance.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.490
So that's an interesting
design constraint

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.050
to give yourself, trying
to avoid high contrast

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.940
edges and thin lines.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.490
That also begs the question
of how big to make text

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.970
so that you can still read it.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.750
How small is too small?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.957
As time goes on and more
pixels get packed in,

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:51.290
you'll be able to read smaller
text until you eventually

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.590
get to 20/20 vision.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.950
Which, you could say
is in the ballpark

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.820
of 60 pixels per degree.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.640
But current VR headsets
are only around 10

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.510
to maybe 13 pixels per degree.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.850
As pixels per degree increases,
your text can be smaller.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.490
There's barely readable and then
there's comfortably readable.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.020
Right now your starting
point is about 1.5 degrees

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.640
of that field of view.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.120
Of course, it'll
be smaller later

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.850
as companies smash
more pixels in,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.600
and VR approaches,
hopefully, 20/20 vision.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.770
But that's the
end of this graph.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.520
But for now, this is kind of a
lot of information to take in.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.510
So it's easier to just say
that basically text needs

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.630
to be more than 14 pixels
tall on the display

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.720
before your brain can even
tell what letters the pixels

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.460
are making.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.810
And at around 20
pixels is comfortable,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.040
regardless of the device.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.310
So this was gotten using rubato
at the center of the view

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.090
and with a text rendering method
called signed distance field.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.090
Different contrast ratios,
optics, rendering methods,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.100
font weights, and type faces
will be a little different.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.270
But saying 20 pixels
tall is an easy way

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.790
to give designers a ballpark
baseline to start with.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.430
In a game engine, you don't
really think in pixels, though.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.990
You measure in terms of
meters and millimeters.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.810
So this is a
developer conference,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.290
so I'll feel a little more safe
in throwing out this equation

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.590
and saying that you can figure
out the text height in the game

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.390
engine as a relationship
between the distance

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.160
to the virtual text, the number
of pixels tall you want it,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.410
and the pixels per
degree of the device.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.250
So if you want text 20
pixels high on a device

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.330
with 13 pixels per degree,
you can take the distance

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.660
to the text and
multiply it by 0.027

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.130
to get its starting height.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.142
That's about 1.5 degrees
tall from that graph earlier.

00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:50.600
And for those of
you who don't want

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.100
to bother with an equation,
it's fine to just ignore

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.860
that and take the
distance and multiply it

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.700
by 0.027 to get its height.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.760
And then just look at it in the
headset and see what you think.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.910
So now you have a base text
size in a basic canvas of field

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.670
of view and range of motion.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.500
These numbers are pretty
conservative and rounded

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.000
because the purpose is to give
designers a baseline for VR.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160
It's like when you
open a new document,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.900
and you have the default paper
dimensions and font size.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.790
With those things
put together, you

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.290
can start imagining the types of
interfaces you can make in VR.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.260
You can change the canvas, and
you can change the text size,

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.450
but hopefully it's helpful to at
least have that starting point

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.160
to begin working with.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.820
And it makes sense
because it's based

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.140
on the constraints
of the system, which

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.440
are properties of the device and
properties of the humans using

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.630
them.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.250
So I've given you some
suggestions for the user

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.700
interface, but there's also the
environment that it lives in.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.970
Brian will explain his
thoughts on designing

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.640
beautiful environments for VR.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:05.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.460
BRIAN PULLEN: Thanks, Mike.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.099
Every VR application needs
at least one environment.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.859
And that might seem
obvious for VR games,

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.690
but it's not as obvious
for other non-game types

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.630
of applications.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.240
Today I want to tell you why
these environments are still

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.329
very important,
and really give you

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.020
some advice on how
to create them.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.520
Now, in addition
to just being cool,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.990
a great environment is actually
central to a user's sense

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.360
of presence.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.810
Maintaining presence
in your applications

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.750
really should always
be a top priority.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.170
If done right, an environment
helps your users better

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.070
understand your application.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.720
It engages them more, and
it makes your product more

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.087
memorable and more shareable.

00:17:52.087 --> 00:17:53.670
Now there's already
been a lot written

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.804
on presence and the value
of it, so if you're not

00:17:55.804 --> 00:17:58.220
familiar with that concept, I
encourage you to look it up.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.540
Now the primary value of VR is
the ability to take you places.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.140
So I'm advocating for taking
your users to amazing places.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.150
Create destinations that
your users want to visit

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.960
and want to show to others.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.570
You've got to make
it remarkable.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.480
Now your environment is often
the first thing your user sees.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.270
It takes up the
majority of their field

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.970
of view at all times.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.570
And it's a key
part of how they're

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.445
going to think of your
app, how they're going

00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:32.720
to remember it and describe it.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.360
It's also a physical embodiment
of your company's brand.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.369
So you have to consider
how it represents you.

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.910
Don't think of the
environment simply

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.350
as a wallpaper or a background.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.340
Think of it as the destination
that your users are going to.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.700
Now I see a lot of
applications creating

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.760
these void style environments.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760
Now I understand why.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.550
They're fast.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.800
They're easy to make.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.240
They have great performance.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.390
And if you don't
have an obvious idea,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.720
they might seem like
a good fallback.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.250
In my opinion, I think
that you should not make

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.520
a void your main environment.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.450
I think it's a missed
opportunity to create something

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.480
memorable and sharable.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.700
I wouldn't want all my memories
of being in your application

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.490
to be in this
strange void space.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.370
Now if you are out of ideas,
and maybe low on 3D skills,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.800
or concerned about
performance, maybe

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.340
think about creating an
abstract environment.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.720
It's a step up from a
void, and it can still

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.010
be branded and memorable.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.012
Now there is no place
I have ever been

00:19:36.012 --> 00:19:37.220
that is completely soundless.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.810
And in fact, much of the
experience of any environment

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.230
is its sounds.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.950
Your sound design should start
right along your visual design,

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.260
right at the beginning.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.230
And one can even
influence the other.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.760
You could decide to put
something into the audio

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.310
that you decide
not to visualize.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.340
Maybe you can only
hear the birds

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.480
but not actually see
them, or vice versa.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.340
It's also the easiest way to
annoy your users if done wrong.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.640
So be careful with
repetitive sounds or things

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.190
that sound fake
or volume levels.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.390
And in fact, getting
sound right in VR

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.520
is really quite challenging
and not obvious at all.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.390
There's been a lot said
about sound in VR recently,

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.860
particularly this year at GDC.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.730
So I encourage you to look that
up if you haven't seen it yet.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.980
It's surprisingly easy to make
people feel uncomfortable in VR

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.240
environments.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.060
Little things like a room
that is a little messy

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.190
or has things out
of place can make

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.360
users feel powerless and really
annoyed by your environment.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.360
More obviously, you should
try not to scare people.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.640
Elements like dark hallways
with this mist coming out of it,

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.080
or partly open doors that
you don't know what's

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.850
behind them, or
heights, things like

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.060
that-- they can all
make users uncomfortable

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.660
and not want to spend
time in your app.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.060
But it can be worse than that.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.880
You need to really
be aware of phobias.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.530
This underwater environment
might seem really cool,

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.216
but there are some users
so terrified of water

00:21:04.216 --> 00:21:06.090
that the second they
come to this app they'll

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.420
rip the headset off
and never come back.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:08.920
Right?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.670
So this is something you
really need to watch out for.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.610
Now your environment should
be designed with your UI,

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.400
with your content, in mind.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.590
It should frame it
not fight against it.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.920
Now a detailed environment
is really great,

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.040
but don't let it hurt the
usability of your application.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.120
Avoid noisy edges
or busy content

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.030
getting in the way
of the readability

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.560
or making it clear
to see the content.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.360
Now think about how
your UI might even

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.320
scroll or animate and make
sure it doesn't conflict

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.640
with the environment, you
know, clip through things

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.730
or become obscured.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.880
In this mock up,
I used this rock

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.010
to actually frame
the navigation.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.500
It protects the text.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.980
It creates some
visual hierarchy.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.780
It also-- I allow the
light and the clearing

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.860
to frame the background
content and make it the focus.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.700
And it's got that
kind of difference

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.700
in lighting to say this
is where the content is.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.940
This is a navigation.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.460
So you can design
your environments

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.010
to really showcase your content.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.000
And I don't like to think of
the UI and environment as two

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.540
separate elements, conceptually.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.170
Make them feel connected.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.260
Make them feel like
they live in one world,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.640
like it's plausibly
existing together.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.430
Use things like colors
and lighting, shadows,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.100
even reflections, animations,
physics-- all of these things

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.210
allow you to connect your
UI to your environment more.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.950
And you can even
allow the environment

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.310
to occlude, sometimes hide parts
the environment or the content,

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.810
while you're scrolling perhaps.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.820
Now a living environment is much
more interesting and much more

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.630
believable than a static one.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.790
There's a lot of things
that you can bring to life.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:55.410
Think of wind, water, animals,
plants, the dust in the air,

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.350
the light coming
through the trees,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.710
clouds, people, machines--
the opportunities

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.230
are endless for animation.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.990
And it's about more
than just animation.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.340
It's about giving
users the ability

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.620
to interact and to
affect to the world.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.370
They need to feel like
they exist in that world.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.200
Maybe if they have a
little laser pointer

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.510
that they used to
touch the UI, maybe

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.540
they can use that to
create ripples in a pond

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.287
or to move the leaves or
scare away a squirrel.

00:23:20.287 --> 00:23:22.620
Something like that would
actually be really delightful,

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.250
and it makes the user feel
present in that virtual world.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.530
Now creating detailed animations
can be really hard, really

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.780
time consuming, if you
don't have those skills.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.220
An easy way to get
that experience

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.440
is to use particle effects.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.670
Things like dust
motes, falling leaves,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.050
fireflies-- these things are
cheap and easy to create.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.180
One of these effects
might take two or three

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.650
minutes to create, even
for an experienced person.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.080
And it does a lot to
bring the scene to life.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.440
It also gives you a
strong sense of stereo 3D

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.750
as these things move in
and out of your near field.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.710
Where practical, I use particle
effects in every environment.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.500
Now details in
the foreground are

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.160
the ones that really
stand out because

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.940
of that sense of stereo 3D.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.390
As such, I usually
try to ensure that I

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.224
have a good amount
of details up close,

00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:14.890
and that I build them
at a real geometry

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:19.200
so they have some substance,
that they feel solid and real.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.600
Of course, beyond 20 meters,
you really lose that effect.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.140
And so I encourage you
to down res everything.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.300
Get rid of the polygons to
really save on performance.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.350
You should also be careful
about creating environments

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.890
that are going to alias poorly.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.600
In fact, this jungle here has
all those very fine leaves.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.120
This is going to
alias like crazy.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.130
In fact, when you look
at this in a VR headset,

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.450
it's just going to sparkle.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.419
The whole thing will be
sparkling at all times.

00:24:44.419 --> 00:24:46.210
And it's going to be
extremely distracting,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.510
maybe even uncomfortable.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.720
The most important thing you
can do for your environment

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.990
is ensure that it performs well.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.390
A fluctuating frame weight
will make people sick.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.330
And a detailed environment
is almost always

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.740
challenging to optimize.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.430
Now if I'm going to give you
one piece of advice on designing

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.790
your environment, remember
that your mobile phone

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.210
is fill bound.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.820
Try not to do too much
overdraw or transparency.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.410
That is the thing that's
going to kill you first.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.070
But keep your draw calls low.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.560
Keep your poly count low.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.560
And try not to max
out the performance

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.912
of the phone at all times.

00:25:21.912 --> 00:25:24.120
If you're an app where you
want people to watch video

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.470
for two hours, but your
environment is so detailed

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.930
that it's running the phone
at maximum performance,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.180
that's going to be challenging.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.680
Now an interesting fallback
is a concept called ODS,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.110
Omni-directional stereo images.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.550
Now it's basically a
panoramic image in stereo 3D

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.300
that can simulate
a full environment.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.990
Now they don't have
any real time geometry,

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.920
and they can have
really great performance

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.530
and be easy to create, but
they have some problems.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.480
For one, when you put
your UI into that,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.010
it kind of feels dropped on top.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.270
It just does become
that wallpaper.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.160
It's really hard to
create that connection.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.640
In fact, it's really hard to use
any of the advice I just gave.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.850
You can't animate them.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.790
You can't really
frame things well.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.050
So they're not perfect.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.630
And you also have
to keep in mind

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.270
that if you have an application
where users are going

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.061
to be turning their
head to the side a lot,

00:26:15.061 --> 00:26:17.970
maybe to investigate something,
or for long sessions,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.381
that the stereo effect
actually breaks down

00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:21.380
when you tilt your head.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.580
So it might not be
right for everyone.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.020
Now I look forward to visiting
the amazing worlds you create.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.290
It's actually the part of
VR I'm most excited about.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.650
Up next, I want to let Alex
talk about input for Daydream.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:39.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.500
ALEX FAABORG: Thanks, Brian.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:44.190
All right.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.082
The Daydream controller.

00:26:47.082 --> 00:26:48.540
The Daydream
controller is actually

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.110
included with every
headset, which

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.520
we're really excited about.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.290
And also, users have to
use the Daydream controller

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.220
as they're interacting
with the home screen.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.762
So as a developer,
you know that when

00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:59.303
they launch your
application, they're

00:26:59.303 --> 00:27:01.560
going to have this specific
controller in their hand,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.480
so you can design
directly for it.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.854
So let's take a look at it.

00:27:10.522 --> 00:27:12.230
It has an internal
IMU, so you can use it

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.355
for gesturing and pointing.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.450
And then in terms
of direct input,

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.716
you have a two dimensional touch
pad which is also clickable.

00:27:22.716 --> 00:27:24.090
It has a sort of
a physical click

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.920
in, like a mouse
button would click in.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.720
And then application
developers get an app button.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.130
You can use this for
really whatever you want.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.344
Pause screen, saving your
game, an action inside a game

00:27:37.344 --> 00:27:39.010
or inside the application
they're doing.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.510
It's really entirely
up to you how

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.349
you want to use the app button.

00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:43.640
And then there's a Home button.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.750
And this is reserved by the
system for system actions

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.695
like going back to the
launcher, things like that.

00:27:49.695 --> 00:27:51.570
And additionally, there's
some volume buttons

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.020
on the side that are
reserved by the system.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.160
So, obviously, the first
thing you can do with this

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.900
is point and click.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.870
Your users will
initially experience this

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.703
as they're interacting
with the home screen.

00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:04.160
So as you move the
controller around,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.690
you'll see it actually
activate things

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.990
that they're hovering on.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.410
And it sort of behaves
like a laser pointer.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.870
And this is great.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.720
It's very usable.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.280
People can be seated and relaxed
and just by moving their wrist

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.920
around they can select things.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.420
But there's really a lot more
you can do with the controller

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:22.160
as well.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.160
And we wanted to be able
to communicate this out

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.400
to developers just how
broad the range of things

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.760
this controller supports
is and how big that gesture

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.170
vocabulary is.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.030
So to do that, we created the
Daydream Design Playground.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.730
This is going to
be open sourced.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.970
Probably in about a week,
after watching this online,

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.810
it's likely already
open sourced.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.180
And it has 16 controller
demos, plus or minus a few.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.180
We're still working on it.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.190
So I want to go through
what those demos are

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.930
and what you can do
with this controller.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.410
The goal of the Daydream
Design Playground

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.620
is to inspire developers to
create entire applications

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.250
around these types
of activities.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.850
Maybe not literally
the same thing,

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:01.510
but around these
types of gestures

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.610
that are possible
with the controller.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.790
So the first thing you can
do is swinging an object.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.331
That object could
be a tennis racket.

00:29:07.331 --> 00:29:14.555
[GLASS TINKLING]

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.710
Or that object could
be, say, maybe a really

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.688
big hammer in front of
a massive xylophone.

00:29:32.688 --> 00:29:35.580
[XYLOPHONE TONES]

00:29:39.782 --> 00:29:40.990
Or that object to be a sword.

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:54.540
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.540
That's, of course, pretty
exciting for the user,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.331
but if they wanted
something more relaxing,

00:29:58.331 --> 00:29:59.460
it could be a fishing rod.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.356
[REEL SOUNDS]

00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:07.739
[BEEP]

[TRIUMPHANT MUSIC]

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.160
The next gesture is
flicking your wrist.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.950
Instead of a full swing, just
a quick motion of your wrist.

00:30:19.394 --> 00:30:22.838
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.750

[EXPLOSION]

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.210
One of the seems to be the
most popular demos we've shown

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.000
so far is, of course, pancakes.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.750
That remains, an open question
is, can the user actually do

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.940
6 pancakes, both flipped
and correctly delivered

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.690
onto the plate.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:49.690
Let's see.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.825
Come on.

00:30:58.276 --> 00:30:58.775
Yes!

00:30:58.775 --> 00:30:59.557
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.890
But they have them on the plate!

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:06.980
Oh no, they dropped on--
Oh, let's try again.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.654
All right.

00:31:08.654 --> 00:31:09.570
It can be a boomerang.

00:31:24.504 --> 00:31:26.170
Inspecting an object
is very interesting

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.626
with the controller.

00:31:27.626 --> 00:31:29.750
In the next example, we
see the controller actually

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.722
become the object.

00:31:33.787 --> 00:31:35.370
So it starts out
with a quick gesture.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:42.510
[BRUSHING SOUNDS]

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.490
But at this point, the
object and the control

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.494
are the same thing.

00:31:45.494 --> 00:31:46.910
So as you move the
controller, you

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.487
can turn the object in your
hand and see every side of it.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.100
We found this also
works for gameplay.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.230
In this case, the marble
maze and the controller

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.740
are the same object.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.510
And as you tilt the
controller, of course,

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:04.051
the marble maze is tilting and
you're controlling the marble.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.512
What's exciting about
this demo is you sort of

00:32:14.512 --> 00:32:16.970
even forget you're holding a
controller as you're doing it.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.920
You're just completely
focused on the maze.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.461
And the maze and the controller
really become the same thing.

00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:23.240
And you're just
thinking about the goal.

00:32:26.169 --> 00:32:28.210
You can also use the
controller to move an object

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.710
for environments that
you're creating, if you're

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.380
doing user generated content.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.100
Example of that.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.880
Here we're doing laser
points to select.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.540
And then once the object
is picked up with a click,

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.630
you can use the touch pad to
actually rotate that object.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.290
You can use the
touch pad to rotate,

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.530
to bring it towards you.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.630
In this case, the
user is rotating it

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.820
and they're trying to
assemble sort of a 3D puzzle.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.500
So they bring it over here.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.970
Rotate it into the
correct position

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.645
as they're trying
to figure it out.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:03.020
This one is actually a little
bit too hard to start with.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.470
We had to make an
easier puzzle for people

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.490
because 3D puzzles are hard.

00:33:09.811 --> 00:33:11.185
I'm going to pick
up another one.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.117
I tried another example.

00:33:19.117 --> 00:33:21.200
To have a better sense of
sort of scale and power,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.810
here the user is actually
inside a very large crane.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.470
And they're using the
controller to bring the arm out.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.671
Tilt on the controller is
the joystick on the crane.

00:33:30.671 --> 00:33:32.170
The touchpad, in
this case, is being

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.920
used to operate how close or
far away the statue is from you.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.930
As they bring it over, and then
they push the controller down

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:44.540
to drop the object.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.780
So that was moving objects.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.250
We can also see a lot
of interesting use

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.841
in creating objects.

00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:51.840
So you could use the
controller to carve things.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.820
Now all those examples
were first person.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.929
But third person is also a
really interesting case for VR.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.370
Real time strategy games.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.699
God games.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:39.360
Simulations as you look
down upon a game board.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.170
So we wanted to look into
third person character control.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.530
And just as interesting
as first person is for VR,

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.840
third person can be really
interesting as well.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.239
So we tried a simple
adventure game,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.280
where you'd go down
and pick up coins.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.290
In this case, the
touchpad on the controller

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.714
is being used as kind of a
traditional joystick or D pad

00:34:55.714 --> 00:34:56.630
to move the character.

00:35:05.994 --> 00:35:07.160
This is one of my favorites.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.560
We also tried a real
time strategy game.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.150
I released the mechanics
around real time strategy game.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.440
So you can click on a
character and then point

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.790
and click to move
that character around,

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.870
just like you would in a
normal real time strategy game.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.080
A gesture on the controller
is used for an action

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.360
there, to make the dragon sing.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.000
Then here is the
touchpad is actually

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.360
being used to create a
drag rectangle to select

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.900
multiple characters and
then move them around.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.890
And they go back to
selecting one at a time

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.620
as they try to solve the puzzle.

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:53.190
Another thing the
controller is great at

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.280
is flying, where the
controller maps to the objects

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.000
that you're having fly around.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.370
This is also a good example
of keeping the user grounded.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.260
So if the camera
was flying forward,

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.450
that can be some
somewhat disorienting.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.380
But because they're
controlling the kite,

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.880
and user still
stands on the ground,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.709
and we have these big
pillars next to them,

00:36:27.709 --> 00:36:29.250
they don't have as
much of an effect.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.210
And they can still
have all the fun

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.911
of flying while feeling like
they're grouted themselves.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.950
So trying a little
kite was interesting.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:42.060
And this is also, the
kite itself is on a plane.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.890
But we wanted to explore
flying more in 3D space, still

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.900
with the same notion of control.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.920
And this next one
is actually inspired

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.510
by how kids play with toys.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.685
As you sort of gesture with
the toy, and toy flies around.

00:36:57.685 --> 00:36:59.310
Where here, as you
move the controller,

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.730
you're controlling
this massive dragon.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.310
And especially in
VR, as you look up

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.408
you get a really interesting
sense of scale here.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.060
All right, so in
conclusion, when

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.990
you're thinking about users,
thinking about 30 minute plus

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.530
sessions of using
your application.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.930
This is not snackable as
much as it's a full meal.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.180
And what we're finding in
terms of these actual play

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.230
sessions in our
market research is

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.400
it's really how engaging an
immersive the content that

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.250
dictates how long the
user's playing the session.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.940
Whereas with mobile
phones, usually something

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.950
else distracts them.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.183
They need to get off the
subway, or their friend

00:37:45.183 --> 00:37:47.620
has just come back, if
you're seated in a cafe.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.360
In VR, there's nothing
to distract them.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.700
It's more like they're
in their reading nook,

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.110
and they're fully
engaged and immersed

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.260
in what you're creating.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.630
So if you create a long
form, story, narrative

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.999
driven content, users
are going to love that.

00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:03.040
And they're going to be
really lost in the worlds

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.260
that you make.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.990
Or if you have
incredibly engaging

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:10.690
gameplay, really good sword
gameplay mechanics, or a really

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.780
fun tennis game.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.340
Users can equally
be just as immersed

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.860
in that for very
long periods of time.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.410
In terms of ergonomics,
think about all the things

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.629
that Mike presented in
terms of constraints.

00:38:21.629 --> 00:38:23.670
Also do a lot of testing
on your own applications

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.760
to make sure that
everything's working.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.390
And you really want to base
your design around these metrics

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.040
so that the user's as
comfortable as possible.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.490
For the environment, think
about what emotion you

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.300
want to evoke in your users.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.710
How that emotion sort
of ties into your brand.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.280
You can take the users
anywhere, so there's really

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.127
an infinite canvas of
what you can create,

00:38:42.127 --> 00:38:44.710
in terms of the experience that
you want users to have as they

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.060
engage with your applications.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.020
Then finally, with
the controller,

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.489
there's an incredibly
broad gesture vocabulary.

00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:53.530
This is just some of the
things that we've shown.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.613
We hope you find them
inspiring as you craft apps.

00:38:55.613 --> 00:38:58.380
And everything's open sourced,
so if you build your own dev

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.140
kit, and then when
you download this,

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.140
you can actually try out
all those applications.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.610
There's a few additional ones
that I didn't show as well.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.972
But as you explore the
capabilities of the controller,

00:39:06.972 --> 00:39:09.180
we're also really excited
to see what the development

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.257
community comes up.

00:39:10.257 --> 00:39:12.590
Because there's really a lot
packed into this controller

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.010
as to how you can use it.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.510
All right.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.899
So with that, thank you.

00:39:15.899 --> 00:39:18.190
And we'll be happy to take
questions after the session.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:26.940
