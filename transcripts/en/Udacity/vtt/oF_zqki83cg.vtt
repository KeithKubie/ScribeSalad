00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.240
For the purposes of the Sunshine app,
this information is purely theoretical.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.700
In fact, you'll really only need 
to consider this later,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.728
when you're adding things like Sensor
or LocationListeners.

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:15.251
Until then, the default components
will handle much of this behavior for you.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.960
In any case, now that you understand
the lifecycle and the way

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.110
the system handles exiting your app, 
when it needs its resources,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.985
you should hopefully understand why Exit
or Quit buttons in Android apps

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:28.094
serve no practical purpose.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.899
At most, you can call "Finish"
on an activity

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.741
and it will get torn down instantly.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.318
That's actually exactly what happens
when the user simply hits "Back"

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:38.030
from within their activity.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.450
If you're still not convinced,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.010
check out the video 
in the Instructor Notes

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.389
where I explain my reasoning 
with a little more, color.
