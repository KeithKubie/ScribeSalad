00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
going to hand it over

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.690
to Carolyn and to Matt.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.371
Welcome.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.370
CAROLYN JUNG: Thank you.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.390
This is my baby,
which I did last year.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.290
And I was lucky enough to get
Craig Lee to do the photos.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.190
This is a compilation
of about 54

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.900
of the Bay Area's top
chefs-- their stories

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.190
and their recipes.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.790
And of course, it includes the
gentleman standing right here.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.500
Chef Matt Accarrino of SPQR.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.385
So I know that you
guys know that Matt

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.360
is an incredible cook.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.100
But what you might not
know is exactly how

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.430
he came to be cooking as a chef.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.200
He's a very sporty guy.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640
And when you were
a teenager, you

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.130
had an accident playing sports.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.530
And it was actually
a fortuitous thing,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.550
because they discovered
a tumor in your leg

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010
that was the benign.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.240
But had you not
had the accident,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.020
they probably would have
never discovered it.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.980
He had surgery and it was a
really long ordeal to recover.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.910
It basically-- you had to
learn to walk over two years.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.740
And I want you to tell everybody
how Emeril Lagasse changed

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.480
the path of your life
during all of this.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Sure.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.950
Well, first of
all, you glorify it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.320
by calling it a sports accident.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.420
Because it-- I actually wanted
to be a professional cyclist.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.340
So I was thinking
in my mind, this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.010
is what I'm going to be doing.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.070
I'm going to ride 500
miles a week on my bicycle.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.360
I'm going to go to France.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm going to race in
the Tour de France.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.800
I'm playing Frisbee
outside of high school.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800
Jump up.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.360
Catch it.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.390
Land.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.940
And this benign tumor
that had been growing

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.110
in my femur since
birth-- so I get taller,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830
it gets bigger-- breaks.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.140
Next thing I know,
I'm on the ground,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.590
on the way to the hospital.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.245
The worst pain I've ever felt
my life, the whole ordeal.

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:05.370
I remember right before
they put me out, they said,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.640
so there's like a 60%
chance that you'll wake up

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.101
and your leg won't be there.

00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:10.100
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh my God.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.729
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I'm
thinking, I'm 16-years-old.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.854
What are you talking about?

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:14.550
I wake up, thank God,
leg's still there.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.700
Can't walk for two years.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.774
So all I do is sit around
the house and watch TV.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:21.940
What am I going to eat next?

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.398
I basically had
nothing else to do.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.974
So I got interested in cooking.

00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:30.140
It was something I could do.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.010
It was something
I could actually

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.200
do without leaving the house,
without going somewhere else.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.970
CAROLYN JUNG: Because you're
watching a lot of cooking shows

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.529
on TV.

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.570
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: So
Jacques Pepin, Julia Child.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.330
And of course, this is
right around the early '90s,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.110
the birth of the Food Network.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.670
Emeril Lagasse is on there,
doing whatever he was doing.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.360
And I go, wow, this guy
is pretty interesting.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.350
I'll write him a letter and see.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.710
Maybe he'll get back to me.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.700
Gets back to me immediately,
which is amazing.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.122
And something that I
always keep to heart now,

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:55.580
when I get letters and things
like that from young students

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.163
and people that want
to learn to cook.

00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:00.030
And I've oftentimes opened
up my kitchen to people

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.199
because he immediately said,
why don't you come down

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.990
to New Orleans and hang
out in the kitchen.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.170
So next thing you know,
I'm in New Orleans

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.530
cooking with Emeril Lagasse.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.200
CAROLYN JUNG: And
you were how old?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.116
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: 18.

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:11.180
CAROLYN JUNG: Wow.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.156
So what sorts of things did he
have you doing in his kitchen?

00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:16.030
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Well,
he turned me-- there

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.270
was this guy Mr. B who used to
make these banana cream pies,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.960
like the best banana cream pie
I'm ever had in my entire life.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.770
All these ever different guys.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.270
There's so many different
things going on.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.850
I was so new to
cooking at the time

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.270
that it was-- what I
always tell the people that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.580
work for me now, is that
when you first start cooking,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.690
the learning is
absolutely exponential.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.740
You don't know anything.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.790
So every day you're
learning this crazy amount

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.540
of information.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.565
And then as you begin to
get more experience doing

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.690
something, you get a little
higher on the mountain.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.990
And you're not learning--
you're learning

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.440
how to do the same
things better.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.190
Or how to do something
in a different way.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.720
And maybe you're not learning
something completely new.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.471
But what happened in that
kitchen was eventually,

00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.220
Emeril kind of came
around to me and said,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.970
hey, you know, you're
pretty good at this.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.380
You should really go see my
friend Charlie in Chicago.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.910
And I'm like, OK.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.460
CAROLYN JUNG: And that
would be Charlie Trotter.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.751
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah, that
would be Charlie Trotter.

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.320
I walk into the kitchen of
Charlie Trotter, this sort

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.070
of famous, very high end
restaurant in Chicago.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.480
And everybody's got
the French toques on,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.540
and all these things.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.610
And I walk in, and I go to
thank him, and there's a locker

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.250
and it says, Matthew
Accarrino on the locker.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.000
CAROLYN JUNG: Wow.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.329
That's pretty cool.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.162
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Pretty amazing experience

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:23.490
at all of about 18
or 19-years-old.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.450
My cooking career
just moved from there.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.640
I never stopped.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.860
I tried to go back to cycling
for a couple of years,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.770
but I figured out that I
sort of lost the momentum.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.170
You look at the great
races-- and actually I'm

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.670
friends with a
number of people that

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.450
are professional cyclists today.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.580
It's like a lot of sports.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.830
Your peak years are
between like 20--

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.250
I mean I would be
retired already.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.252
I'm 36.

00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:50.960
They talk about somebody
being really old

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.740
and they're 40 if
they're cycling.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.720
CAROLYN JUNG: So had not
all of this happened,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.420
would you have considered
cooking as a career?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.420
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.720
I always-- even
when I was a kid,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.840
I always said I either
wanted to-- well,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.965
I think I had three things.

00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.880
I wanted to drive a
train, when I was five.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.740
CAROLYN JUNG: Like every boy.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.760
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: And then
I wanted to ride bicycles.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.010
And I wanted to cook.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.050
So those are always my
three things somehow.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.480
CAROLYN JUNG: So I'm
assuming that you

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.150
have seen Emeril in the
years that have passed.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.604
What does he think now,
seeing what you do?

00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:25.020
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I mean, I think

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.150
he would think just
like any other mentor.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.420
I've worked for so many chefs.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.490
Thomas Keller, Tom Coliccio.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.420
A variety of people.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.253
So I just won "Food and
Wine" Best New Chef.

00:05:33.253 --> 00:05:36.250
And so I was in New York
and I saw Tom Coliccio.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.950
And they're very proud.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.090
Because those are people
that remember you back

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.340
at that time when
you did know nothing.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.340
And as you begin
to know a bit more,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.810
I think they're
proud to see you.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.870
And certainly they've
all-- Emeril included--

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.170
conveyed that kind of message.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.670
CAROLYN JUNG: Has
he eaten your Food

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.160
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Emeril?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.820
CAROLYN JUNG: Yes.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.010
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I don't think so.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.350
CAROLYN JUNG: What?

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.770
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Not
here in San Francisco.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.590
CAROLYN JUNG: OK.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.400
You've got to do
something about that.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.830
Got to invite him
in or something.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.200
So today, you're going
to make something out

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.951
of your own cookbook.

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:07.322
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Well, it's a variation.

00:06:07.322 --> 00:06:08.530
CAROLYN JUNG: For springtime.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.946
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
For springtime.

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:13.280
And I wanted to share
with you all a couple

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.870
of different
techniques and to cover

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.920
what to me might be
more basic things.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.000
To you they might be
completely brand new things.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.590
I don't know how experienced
a cooking group we have here.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.630
So I have an acre
up in Napa that I

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.440
grow on for the
restaurant, and grow

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.750
a lot of my own vegetables.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.812
Having been born in the Midwest,
grew up on the east coast,

00:06:34.812 --> 00:06:37.020
and then eventually came
out to California about six,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.730
seven years ago, I'm
very taken with that farm

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.170
to table, but beyond that
to the next generation.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.600
So you're looking at how
can I grow my ingredients.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.810
What, for instance, like
this thing that I brought.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.100
I have all these Calcot
onions which are the onions

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.180
that they grow in Spain.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.722
And they bury them in coal.

00:06:56.722 --> 00:06:59.180
If you've ever seen this, they
cook and they peel the onion

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.690
and eat it with romesco sauce.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.400
So it's very Tony
Bourdain kind of thing.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.290
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, so
you're growing those?

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.880
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
But they eventually

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.129
go to flower like this and
the flowers are incredible.

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.960
So I'll use those a little
bit for a garnish today.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.720
And then we have some
vegetables over here.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.960
I kept it pretty simple as
far as spring vegetables go.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.610
So some pearl onions.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.880
Right here are some peas.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.140
I've got some tarragon and
parsley from the garden.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.559
Asparagus.

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:33.475
And then some carrots.

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.330
One of the first
things-- so we're

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.910
going to do some of the
vegetable prep first.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.570
If that's OK.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.240
One of the first things
about vegetable cooking,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.140
or cooking vegetables
like carrots--

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.610
so ideally, we're going to make
this gnocchi in a little bit.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.530
And the gnocchi are all sort
of uniformly the same size.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.590
And then, you have this
carrot, and it's a lot fatter

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.680
up here than it is down here.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.267
And so it's how
you deal with that.

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:10.850
One of the first
things they teach you

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.800
in the French kitchen, or
really, just about any kitchen,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.290
is a called the oblique cut.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.330
And what that cut
does is it's actually

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:27.520
designed to even this
whole situation out.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.750
So what you do, is you
start and peel the carrot.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.200
And you make a cut.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.620
Turn it slightly.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.100
Cut again.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.809
Slightly.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.179
Cut again.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.409
And every time, I'm kind
of rolling it towards me

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.130
and making a cut.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.220
I'm producing something.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.717
But the diameter of this
carrot is actually changing.

00:08:46.717 --> 00:08:48.800
So you'll see, that for
something that started out

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.000
fat at the top, and
slim at the bottom,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.530
if I now take this-- and
let's see if we have one

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:01.990
of those glass-- all
these cuts are now

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.685
basically essentially
the same size.

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:04.185
Right?

00:09:04.185 --> 00:09:06.550
So you guys can see that here.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.050
And this is a really
important thing

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.180
as far as vegetable cookery
goes, because if all of these

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.430
are going to be
the same size, that

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.850
means they'll all cook the same.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.440
They'll all cook
at the same time.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.731
So no matter what I do with
them, whether I roast them,

00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:23.910
or I boil them, they're all
going to come out the same way.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.510
And it always amazes me to see
those little things like that.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.870
Because somebody had to
think of that at some point.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.550
And decided that
was a good idea.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.400
And I don't know who that was.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.580
Yeah, it was Paul
Bocuse probably.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.080
Who knows.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.110
So that's that.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.400
So we have the carrots.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.155
And so I've done
that to some already.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.650
Asparagus is another thing.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.800
So what I like to
do with my asparagus

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.007
is actually take all
these little eyes off.

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:49.590
And I don't know if
you guys have ever

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.770
had asparagus and eaten
them and found dirt in them,

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.780
but especially when it
rains, it makes sense.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.435
If this thing grows out
from the ground like this,

00:09:58.435 --> 00:10:00.810
if you get a rainstorm halfway
through this thing's life,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.410
and it's only this tall, the
water drops hit the dirt.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.650
And the dirt jumps
into these eyes.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.750
And then it grows
the rest of the way.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.680
By time it's this big, if
you just cook this thing,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.437
almost uniformly
you'll find dirt.

00:10:13.437 --> 00:10:15.020
CAROLYN JUNG: Wow,
I didn't know that.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.760
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: So
if you like the grit,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.635
don't worry about it.

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.717
But for me, I'll go ahead
and pick all these off.

00:10:19.717 --> 00:10:21.300
I can actually see
little bits of dirt

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.350
in these from when we had some
rain not a terribly long time

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.850
ago.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.190
But we were pretty drought
starved for a while.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.523
CAROLYN JUNG: Do you do the
thing too, where you snap it

00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:32.300
and where it breaks
is the natural--

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.560
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.976
And it's always
good to know that.

00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:37.474
I And we can tell, because I
never let them grow that big.

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:38.890
They only ever get
about this big.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.290
But eventually, they'll
get rather large.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:52.080
So for these, we're just going
to do these one inch cuts.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.770
And end up again,
with something that's

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.810
relatively the same
size as the carrots.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.360
The other one we have
are some pearl onions.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.300
Pearl onion is just a
nice, small, soft onion.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.294
I've already peeled these.

00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:08.210
I'll cut them in half.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.990
And then what I like to do,
is just pull the stem end out.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.240
And then you can pop all
the different layers out.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.980
CAROLYN JUNG: By the way,
if you have Matt's cookbook,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.140
you know, and if you've
eaten at his restaurant,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.460
you know he's very meticulous
about his techniques.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.740
In fact, I always
give him a hard time

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.040
and he gives me a hard time
back, because I made this pasta

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.950
dish from his book, and
I was balking at the fact

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.410
that it required
peeling cherry tomatoes.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.770
Which you can imagine the
undertaking that requires.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.270
I'm

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.103
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: A
glutton for punishment.

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:50.910
Then we have some peas.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.120
So I have all that stuff ready.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.030
Other things we're going to
use-- some burrata cheese

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.387
made with cow's milk
here in California.

00:11:59.387 --> 00:12:00.970
Burrata cheese is
kind of a pull, what

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.260
they call pasta filata,
a pulled cheese.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.770
Kind of a pulled mozzarella.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.800
And then usually encased
in a very thin layer

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.730
of mozzarella cheese.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.290
But it has a nice
creamy aspect to it.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.010
My family still live
in Puglia in Italy.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.290
And it's interesting,
because the first time

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.240
I went to go work in Italy,
I worked in the north,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.210
up in Milan.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:25.750
So I thought I was doing this
amazing thing by bringing them

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.200
this beautiful parmigiano that
had been aged for five years.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.817
And only the red
cows were the ones

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:32.150
they milked to make this cheese.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.140
It was the most special thing.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.870
I want to Peck Market
in Milan, which

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.461
is an incredible
gastronomic market in Milan.

00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:40.960
Bought this thing,
got on the train.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.170
Take the train down Puglia.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.670
Show up.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.260
Hey, look what I got for you.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.745
And they go, that is garbage.

00:12:48.647 --> 00:12:50.230
And it's because it
wasn't from there.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.853
They said it's
from too far away.

00:12:51.853 --> 00:12:52.820
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, yes.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.760
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
We don't eat that.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.800
We don't really like it.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.750
But we do have this.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.410
And then they showed me burrata.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.670
This was 15 years ago.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.140
So interesting.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.790
CAROLYN JUNG: So
it was actually--

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.385
it was the ingredients
in California.

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:08.760
And that was one reason that
brought you to the Bay Area?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.218
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Well, I actually

00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:11.340
worked for Thomas Keller.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.200
CAROLYN JUNG: At Per Se?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.910
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: It
was about 10 years ago.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.400
CAROLYN JUNG: You were
opening sous chef there?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.020
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Opening sous chef.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.850
And they closed
the French Laundry

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.610
to bring all of the
French Laundry staff

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.570
here from California to New
York to open that restaurant.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.790
And so I got to basically
spent my entire day hearing

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.490
all these French
Laundry guys go,

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.990
yeah that's a nice artichoke,
but if you were in California,

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.330
you would see that
would be much nicer.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.610
It got relatively
annoying after a while

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.830
for an east coaster like me.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.664
CAROLYN JUNG: I bet.

00:13:34.664 --> 00:13:36.330
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
It definitely planted

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.470
a seed, where at some
certain point I thought,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.800
I might want to go take a look
and see what that's all about.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.144
I was working for Tom
Coliccio at the time,

00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:45.810
running restaurants
for him in New York.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.650
And he came to me
one day, and said,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.770
I'm opening a restaurant in
Los Angeles, what do you think?

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.110
I said, sure.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.090
Next thing I know,
I'm in Los Angeles.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.530
And then eventually, up to here.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.190
Up to the San Francisco.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.580
All right.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.600
Gnocchi.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.330
Gnocchi to-- well, I would
imagine, to a lot of people

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.450
is potatoes, flour, egg.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:16.670
And something you try to
avoid making where it's heavy.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.200
This gnocchi is something
completely different.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.070
This is a semolina gnocchi.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.025
We use semolina flour.

00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:24.600
It's one of the flours
that I use to make pasta.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.360
All of the pasta that I serve at
SPQR we make in the restaurant.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.010
It's kind of a coarser,
Durham wheat flour.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.120
We use that.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.140
There's no potatoes in it.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.750
There's eggs.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.340
Somebody noticed there
is butter in it before.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.220
And it's basically a
pas de choux style.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.720
So the same thing
that you would use

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.670
to make an eclair, or
the same base they've

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.940
used to make an eclair is
what this base essentially is.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.382
But we add things like cheese
and the semolina to it.

00:14:51.382 --> 00:14:52.340
That's a bit different.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.550
There's no sugar in it.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.550
CAROLYN JUNG: Is it a
little bit more forgiving?

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.990
Because I know sometimes
with potatoes--

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.656
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
It's completely more.

00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:03.050
Not only is it more forgiving,
but it's-- beyond a certain few

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.490
things, it's actually
very difficult to mess up,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.350
I would assert.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.949
So I have some flour.

00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:10.490
I have flour.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.490
Some water and some butter
that's been brought to a boil

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.570
here in this pot.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.940
And what I'm going to do,
is this is regular flour.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.510
And then you can
see the color here,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.420
the difference between
the white-- this

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.695
is the semolina flour.

00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:26.070
So it has a much
coarser texture.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.454
If you guys want to
pass this around.

00:15:32.454 --> 00:15:34.120
Hopefully this won't
mess up the recipe.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.440
If you want to start
that down there.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.790
And they can see the
difference between--

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.730
and really, it has to do with
the milling of the flour.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.416
So this is very,
very finely milled.

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.040
And this is a bit
more coarsely milled.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.170
But they're in some
ways similar, as

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.660
far as being flours.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.980
I've just added the regular
flour to this as it's boiling.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.840
And then I'm going to
add now the semolina.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.007
CAROLYN JUNG: Are you getting
your flour from Italy?

00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:08.714
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Some of it from Italy.

00:16:08.714 --> 00:16:09.295
Yes?

00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:11.247
AUDIENCE: What kind of flour?

00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:13.080
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: We
use double zero flour.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.230
But double zero really
refers to a grind.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.610
So it's a very fine flour.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.460
But any all purpose
flour will be fine.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.111
And really, when they're
talking about all purpose flour,

00:16:22.111 --> 00:16:23.610
they're talking
about a flour that's

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.360
been balanced in terms
of the gluten content

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.020
and the amount of protein in it.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.820
So that you can do a lot of
different things, which means

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.736
you could make biscuits
with it, and pancakes.

00:16:31.736 --> 00:16:34.000
But you could also
make bread which it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.100
So you'll notice that because
the water was boiling,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.570
this begins to thicken up.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.260
And it turns into
this sort of paste.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.134
And that's exactly what we want.

00:16:43.134 --> 00:16:46.100
AUDIENCE: How high
is your heat turned?

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.670
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: This one
is all the way at the highest.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.170
But it has to be enough--
the crucial element is

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.714
that it's enough
to boil the water.

00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:57.130
Because it really requires--
and what's happening in this,

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.830
is that the starch has jelled.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.330
The same way if
you make polenta.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.830
This is that same
kind of technique.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.480
So what's happened
is the starch that's

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.740
there in the flour
has jelled because

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.000
of the temperature
of the water boiling.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.400
And that's created a structure.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.983
And that structure
is what we're going

00:17:12.983 --> 00:17:14.560
to harness to make the gnocchi.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.260
And that's why they won't fall
apart when we go in the water.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.270
I turned it off now.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.811
And I just cooked
it until it started

00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:23.599
to get a little bit shiny.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.849
And it's obviously very thick.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.589
AUDIENCE: I love your
attention to detail, chef.

00:17:29.589 --> 00:17:31.145
You won't even
allow the tape to be

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:32.910
on the outside of the
container that you bought--

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.610
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Oh yeah.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:34.070
Sorry

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.903
AUDIENCE: --for more
than a second after you

00:17:35.903 --> 00:17:37.685
empty out the contents.

00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:40.390
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
It's a force of habit.

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:45.540
I really stressed that a
lot with the people that

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.460
cooked for me, is that
level of attention

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.180
to detail and organization.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.517
Because if you're
always doing that,

00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:53.850
then we'll tend to run these
containers through the dish

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.349
machine.

00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:56.447
And then they're all
back in one location.

00:17:56.447 --> 00:17:58.780
And so if I ever go back there
and see the tape on them,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.950
it's like-- I
literally, physically

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.856
can't walk past it without
taking the tape off.

00:18:07.856 --> 00:18:09.230
But then eventually,
they all get

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.480
to be the same way,
which is helpful.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.410
This is now ready.

00:18:17.906 --> 00:18:19.530
What I'm going to
do, is transfer this.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.390
And this dough is pretty
hot at this point.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.130
We're going to put
it onto the mixer

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.510
and let it cool
down a little bit.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.094
Carolyn, why don't you
tell them about the process

00:18:35.094 --> 00:18:37.593
of writing your book and working
with those all those chefs.

00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:39.260
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, my God.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.990
Well, it was quite the
process, because I was only

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.930
given three months
to do the book.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.890
And so I really relied
on chefs like Matthew

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.150
to meet a deadline that
I forced upon them.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.641
And thankfully, I didn't
nag you too much, right?

00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.640
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I don't
remember any nagging.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.970
CAROLYN JUNG: OK that's good.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:08.180
It was great that he was very
clear on what he wanted to do.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.950
And the fact that I wanted
recipes that were home

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.650
cook friendly, which most of
his recipes thankfully are.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:20.150
Because you know what
can be done at home.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.087
And you know what is best
done in a restaurant kitchen.

00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:25.920
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I
always find that that's

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.810
a difficult balance.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.290
Because people are always
asking me to give them

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.510
recipes that are
home cook friendly.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.810
Like this one, I tried to
make as friendly for you guys

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.210
as it could be, so that
actually you might make this.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.690
But my job as a
chef, in my eyes,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.300
is to make something
you can't make.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.740
CAROLYN JUNG: Exactly.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.240
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Otherwise,
why would you come out to eat?

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.720
CAROLYN JUNG: Right?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.690
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: What
good would I be to you?

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.240
CAROLYN JUNG: It's got to be
worth the money of going out,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.951
right?

00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:50.659
AUDIENCE: If we don't
have a Kitchen Aid,

00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:53.870
what else could we use?

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.730
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
You do by hand even.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.544
You'll be tired
at the end, but--

00:19:58.544 --> 00:19:59.960
CAROLYN JUNG: Don't
go to the gym.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.440
Just make this instead.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.220
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:You notice I'm
just pausing to let this cool

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.820
a little bit.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.310
And then these are some of
carrots and the peas and things

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.450
that I talked about before.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.185
And they've all just
quickly blanched.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.080
CAROLYN JUNG: So you come from
a long line, I'm assuming,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.890
of very good Italian cooks?

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:23.890
As far as your heritage?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.890
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.720
It was amazing.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.060
For my 26th birthday I
went to visit my family.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.460
My Aunt Columbina
has this olive ranch

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.979
up in the hills outside of
a town called Manfredonia.

00:20:36.979 --> 00:20:37.770
And it's beautiful.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.750
It's like the absolute
most picturesque place--

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.750
that you're looking
out over the ocean,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.110
Manfredonia is a town
of about 60,000 people.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.270
Or a small city of
about 60,000 people.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.900
And they literally
have the stone wheel

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.050
with the donkey for the olives.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.830
And then, we're going
to make the oil.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.490
And so there's
like a carob tree.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.300
And wild capers, wild
fennel, wild arugula.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.579
My-- somebody made
potato donuts.

00:21:05.579 --> 00:21:06.745
CAROLYN JUNG: Potato donuts?

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:07.250
Wow.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.125
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Ciambella, they call them.

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.000
Ciambella.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.670
It was a pretty
unique experience.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.540
But it also was--
basically everything

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.000
that I had for my 26th
birthday was sourced

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.260
from within five miles
of that location.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.100
So that was an interesting
birthday, to say the least.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:28.850
CAROLYN JUNG: So at SPQR, people
call it an Italian restaurant.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:34.100
But what you do is very unlike
Italian recipes and dishes

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.390
anywhere else.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.094
How would you describe
what you do there?

00:21:38.094 --> 00:21:39.510
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I would say I'm

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.560
making American
food at this point.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.810
One of the things
that I think, at least

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.930
from my historical
perspective, what it may be,

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.100
is that there was a
period where if you wanted

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.090
to learn about cooking, the
idea was-- and you can rewind

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.380
it back to Paul Bocuses
is the sort of father,

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.570
French father, of modern
cooking, let's say, right?

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.750
So then all these other
people, like Freddy Girardet,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.520
worked for Paul Bocuse.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.020
And then when all
of the people that

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.900
were mentors to me, the Thomas
Kellers, Tom Coliccios--

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.240
CAROLYN JUNG: Rick Moonen--

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.823
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
--all these people.

00:22:15.823 --> 00:22:17.290
They all went to
France and worked

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.974
for that second
generation of guys

00:22:18.974 --> 00:22:20.140
that worked for Paul Bocuse.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.990
And brought back
those kind of recipes.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.940
But a lot of them, in
the very beginning,

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.020
were learning to
make French food.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.166
Because that's what we
thought the best food was.

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:31.290
And at some certain point,
there were enough chefs,

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.340
people like Thomas Keller,
that said, wait a second.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.450
I can honor French
food, but I'm American.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.850
So I'll make this.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.990
And I kind of am
the next generation

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.330
of that chef, at least in
my eyes, that now says,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.750
I have this Italian
heritage, I embrace it.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.400
I'm inspired by it.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.410
But I'm American.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.730
I live in California.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.300
And nothing will make
my food more Italian

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.920
than growing some
of my own food,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.680
being involved with
those ingredients,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.170
learning how to make as
many things as-- making them

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.350
in-house, and all of those
things at the restaurant.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.280
That makes my food more
Italian than bringing

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.488
all of my cheeses and
condiments and all those things

00:23:06.488 --> 00:23:07.600
from Italy.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.170
Because just cause you
import it doesn't mean it

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.640
that you get the right to
call yourself authentic.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.090
I want to be authentically
myself and authentically

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.520
American.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.072
I think I kind of
get away with it,

00:23:20.072 --> 00:23:22.030
whether people call that
an Italian restaurant.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.071
And I think there's all
these-- it's interesting,

00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:26.290
when you look at the
Zagat, or everyone's

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.150
trying to classify restaurants.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.600
And it used to be Italian.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.990
And then it was like
Italian North and South.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.760
Which I don't really
know what that meant.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.730
And now we get dubbed
Modern Italian.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.560
So whatever that means.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.260
It's actually-- the fact that
people are grasping for terms

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.700
to describe it is a
good thing, because it

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.110
means that we're doing
something different.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.920
CAROLYN JUNG: You're
pushing the envelope.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.610
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: And
I think that that's

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.376
what good cooking
is really about.

00:23:51.376 --> 00:23:53.250
And that's what I want
to be doing every day.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.041
And I want to be doing
with the people that

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:56.610
are working with me.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.720
CAROLYN JUNG: Was it a
lot of pressure for you

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.850
to step into the shoes
of Chef Nate Appleman

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.760
at SPQR, who was
a huge name when

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.599
he was manning the restaurant?

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.140
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I was lucky enough

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.610
to be somewhat
insulated from it.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.550
I moved to San Francisco
in 2009 and Nate

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.950
had left six months prior to
my arrival at the restaurant.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.085
And had been the opening
chef of the restaurant.

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:22.460
And so when I got
there, I really

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.334
didn't know anything
about it and immediately

00:24:24.334 --> 00:24:27.970
just proceeded to do whatever
it is that I was going to do.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.890
I've never, never really
looked back at that.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.920
For me, it didn't
make a difference.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.430
I've always just
guided myself off

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.150
of doing what it was that I
thought was important to me.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.090
And then I think
for the people that

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.440
knew the restaurant
before, I guess

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.070
it really bears no resemblance.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.230
CAROLYN JUNG: No, not at all.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.280
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Which was probably

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.730
as indicative of his
style as it is of mine.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.600
Chefs have very different
styles and can completely

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.480
find our way of changing
just about everything.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.220
I've let this cool
off a little bit.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.284
And then, you'll see
that as I start it,

00:25:01.284 --> 00:25:02.950
a little bit of the
steam will come out.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.250
And then, I have some eggs here.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.600
Now, to add the eggs in, I'm
going to do one at a time.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.390
And there's two reasons
you want to do that.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.620
It will come out as a thicker
batter, somehow miraculously,

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.500
if you incorporate the
eggs one at a time.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.450
Secondly, if you put them all
in at once, you'll wear it.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.616
Because it'll be everywhere.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:26.720
We'll just start one at a time.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.660
Every egg that goes in
will get incorporated.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.368
It gets a little bit
looser for a second,

00:25:34.368 --> 00:25:36.380
and then it'll tighten back up.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.290
Now we're harnessing
this gluten structure

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.060
that we created by boiling it.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.589
CAROLYN JUNG: It's a
lot of eggs in this.

00:25:46.589 --> 00:25:48.880
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: What
happens is, when the eggs poach

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.039
in the water, between that
gluten structure and the egg,

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.080
it souffles a little bit.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.920
And that souffle makes
really, really very fluffy

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.762
and very light.

00:25:57.762 --> 00:25:59.220
CAROLYN JUNG:
There's nothing worse

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.057
than a very heavy
gnocchi, right?

00:26:01.057 --> 00:26:03.390
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: So these
are sort of impossibly light

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:03.900
gnocchi.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:07.070
And the thing I
like about this is,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.875
this batter-- once
we make the batter,

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:12.330
I'll actually invite you guys
come up, anyone who wants to,

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.850
and pipe.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:15.150
It's kind of a fun thing.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.120
It's a good technique to learn.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.370
CAROLYN JUNG: You didn't
know you get to do that, huh?

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.902
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: But you can
make the gnocchi-- so today,

00:26:22.902 --> 00:26:23.860
we're going to make it.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.530
And I'm going to pull it.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.710
And we're going to serve it.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.010
It's kind of poached,
right from the water.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.650
You could actually make
them ahead, let them cool,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.020
and then you can saute them.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.340
And they'll take color
really, really nicely.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.390
So if you wanted
to-- I actually have

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.580
a recipe for this
in my cookbook,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.369
where they're sauteed,
and there's a lamb ragout

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.410
that they're served with.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.275
So something that would be
maybe a little heartier.

00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:51.400
CAROLYN JUNG: So how far
ahead could you make them?

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.860
Could you make them
the day before?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.410
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: You could
make them the day before.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.290
CAROLYN JUNG: Could
you freeze them?

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.010
And then cook them later?

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.760
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I've never frozen them,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.799
but I'm sure you could.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.840
And see how it comes out.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.766
If you like, you like it.

00:27:01.766 --> 00:27:03.660
CAROLYN JUNG: That's true.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.870
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Now all
the eggs are incorporated.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.220
And then I have a little bit
of a cheese that we'll add.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.510
This is Parmesan.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:13.450
Same reason, I'll shut
it off for a second.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.606
Otherwise we'll--

00:27:14.606 --> 00:27:15.980
CAROLYN JUNG: So
how old were you

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.990
when you made pasta for
the first time by yourself?

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.490
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: By myself?

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.800
I had to be in my teens.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.730
But I remember, actually,
my third grade birthday

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.870
party, my grandmother came
from Boston and made pizza,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:33.490
and pasta.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:34.090
And all this stuff.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.506
And I had to make
it all with her,

00:27:35.506 --> 00:27:37.150
which I thought was
a horrible chore.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.197
And then I cried the whole
day, because I wanted Domino's.

00:27:40.197 --> 00:27:41.030
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh no.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.405
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Because that's

00:27:42.405 --> 00:27:45.210
what everybody else had
their pizza parties.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.914
Little did I realize I had,
basically, a master making my--

00:27:49.914 --> 00:27:50.830
CAROLYN JUNG: Exactly.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.470
We should all be so
lucky for our birthdays.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.720
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
That's what we

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.136
get when we're
young little brats.

00:27:54.136 --> 00:27:55.180
Right?

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.807
We don't know any better.

00:27:56.807 --> 00:27:59.291
AUDIENCE: Chef, do you ever
add any seasoning into that?

00:27:59.291 --> 00:28:01.290
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: The
cheese is sort of enough.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:02.770
And then I have
seasoning in the water.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.800
So you guys will taste it.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.300
You'll see.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.140
But to me, you can add
a bit more seasoning.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.045
I put a pinch of salt
in the water before.

00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:10.150
I don't know if you guys--

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:15.410
AUDIENCE: What would be classic
seasoning [INAUDIBLE] salt?

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.200
Herbs?

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.491
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah, herbs.

00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:20.120
You could add the chopped
herbs right into the gnocchi.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.230
Any seasoning you want.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.680
Dried herbs, fennel pollen
would be great in there.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.130
Truffle.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.990
Anything that tastes good.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.340
Actually, we-- have you guys
seen black garlic before?

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.580
This black fermented garlic?

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.746
It's kind of everywhere now.

00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:39.592
I'm remember when the--
Fanny from La Sanctuaire

00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.300
showed it to me seven
or eight years ago.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.710
And I was like, oh my
God, this is amazing.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:43.280
And now--

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.430
CAROLYN JUNG: Now you
get it at supermarkets.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.337
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: It's
at Whole Foods, yeah.

00:28:46.337 --> 00:28:47.920
What I've actually
figured out-- and I

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.890
was going to show
you guys, but I

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.370
figured it would take a little
long, and you need quite a bit

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:51.869
to do it.

00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:53.790
But if you peel all
the black garlic

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.990
when it comes in the
skins, we save the skins

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.840
and put a hot water
over it, and make

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.545
kind of a black garlic tea.

00:28:59.545 --> 00:29:01.800
It seems wasteful
to throw it out.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.010
And then we actually use
that water, that infusion

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.287
with a black garlic
and make a puree.

00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:10.370
That really reinforces it.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.661
So I have a little bit of that.

00:29:11.661 --> 00:29:14.440
And then summer truffle
season just started,

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.880
so I brought a little summer
truffle for you guys today.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.130
So those are some garnishes
that are optional.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.335
But yeah, a lot of things
will work as fold ins

00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:24.190
to this batter.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.010
And because you
have this structure,

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:33.010
you could do-- you
could put together

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.257
any combination of
seasoning that work for you.

00:29:35.257 --> 00:29:37.090
And I think there's
probably a lot of things

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.406
that this batter could
actually hold within itself.

00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:42.780
And this is just--
I actually had

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.690
a German intern my restaurant.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.067
And if you guys have ever
seen this in gnocchi,

00:29:48.067 --> 00:29:50.650
where they have it on a board,
and they use a spatula and they

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.340
scape the gnocchi
into the water.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.140
You could actually do
that with this dough.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.500
And that would be
another way to do it.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.020
But I would imagine you could
put little baby shrimp into it

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.061
or something and do that.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.430
CAROLYN JUNG: So chef, lot
of your mentors-- Coliccio,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.060
Moonen, even Thomas
Keller a little bit,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.910
have had a TV presence.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.460
Would you ever consider
doing Top Chef?

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.452
Top Chef Masters,
anything like that?

00:30:25.452 --> 00:30:27.160
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I've thought about it.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.210
I've sort of been asked
a couple of times.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.919
But maybe it's not my thing.

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:33.460
I don't know.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.120
I really like the aspect
of being in the restaurant

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.940
and being with the customers.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.587
And I'm lucky enough that SPQR
is a fairly small restaurant.

00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:48.170
And the kitchen is basically in
the middle of the dining room,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.360
for those of you
who have been there.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.943
CAROLYN JUNG: It's
a tiny kitchen too.

00:30:50.943 --> 00:30:54.250
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: And I
actually like that aspect

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.440
where I'm really interacting
with my customers.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.170
And we have-- one of my great
regulars is an older gentleman.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.920
He comes in every
Saturday night.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.290
And I say every Saturday
night, but he-- I think it's

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.400
his 300th visit.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh my God.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:11.900
Wow.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.525
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Something like that.

00:31:13.525 --> 00:31:14.390
To the restaurant.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.870
This Saturday.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.921
So I'm getting something
special ready for him.

00:31:18.921 --> 00:31:21.420
Those are the things that make
me really excited about being

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.550
a chef and what I'm doing.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.830
Because you think about
that-- that person

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.710
that comes in-- he's literally
there every Saturday.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.410
And he brings me either a the
New York Times or a New Yorker

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.110
article to read.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.230
The so the only reason that I
have any culture whatsoever,

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:38.660
or know what's going on
anywhere with anything

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.660
will be because he
brings me those articles.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.642
And I read them.

00:31:42.642 --> 00:31:45.100
But those are the-- to me,
those are the great experiences.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.092
And another thing about
cooking that has really

00:31:49.092 --> 00:31:50.550
been important to
me is the ability

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.240
to travel and to do things
like being here today that

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.930
add a life experience
dimension to what I do.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.130
I pretty much have-- not
seen the entire world,

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.609
but I've seen a lot of
the world because I cook.

00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:07.400
To me, that's been a
really important thing

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.110
and a really worthwhile thing.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.630
CAROLYN JUNG: What's the best
thing about being a chef?

00:32:14.425 --> 00:32:16.050
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I don't have to wear

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.360
a suit when I go to work.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360
I have the same uniform.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360
I never have to worry
about what I wear to work.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.735
I just put on the
same chef coat.

00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:24.818
CAROLYN JUNG: That's true.

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.010
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Right?

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.520
I remember being younger
and thinking wow,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.050
I never really want to have to--

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.850
CAROLYN JUNG: Put a tie on.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:31.220
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.803
Worried about going
to work like that.

00:32:32.803 --> 00:32:34.550
So it kind of worked
out perfectly.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.400
But I think honestly, some of
the best things about being

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.660
a chef is every
day I'm creative.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:45.460
And every day, I see that
creativity fulfilled.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.110
Because every day
I'm making a dish.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.651
And even though
there are things that

00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:52.770
take days and days to prepare,
every day I finish something.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.630
Every day-- and we actually
finish a lot of things.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.580
It's a much faster
cycle than say,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.710
going and looking at a
piece of ground and saying,

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.793
I'm going to build a
building here in seven years.

00:33:01.793 --> 00:33:04.590
In seven years, I'll be able to
look at my complete building.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.470
I can make that building-- I can
make this dish in half an hour.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.720
So I think that
instant gratification

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.500
is a great part about cooking.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.374
And also, being able to
work with all of the people

00:33:15.374 --> 00:33:17.540
that work in my restaurant
with me, all of my staff.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.110
And being able to be a leader to
people and a mentor to people.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.651
And to return some
of the favors that

00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:26.780
were shown to me when I
first started cooking.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.120
Seeing somebody go through and
know nothing, and eventually

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.420
something.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.590
That's pretty gratifying.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.090
CAROLYN JUNG: So
conversely, what's

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.889
the worst thing
about being a chef?

00:33:38.889 --> 00:33:41.305
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: The opposite
of everything I just said.

00:33:41.305 --> 00:33:43.457
CAROLYN JUNG: The
opposite of everything.

00:33:43.457 --> 00:33:45.040
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
The hours are long.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.870
And the task is always arduous.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.490
So I think it's one of those
things where sometimes-- it's

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.080
one of those careers that--
people say the restaurant

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.460
industry is very difficult.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.710
It's because it demands a lot.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.900
And you always have
to put into it.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.316
I think there are
a lot of careers

00:33:59.316 --> 00:34:01.250
that are actually like that.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.330
But you're only as
good as your last meal.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:08.460
So you can never
really-- go this way.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:15.860
You can never really rest
on your laurels as it were.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.580
The batter I
transferred to the bag.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.580
And then, I don't know
if you guys noticed that,

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.782
but this is a little
trick that I do.

00:34:21.782 --> 00:34:23.323
When I first started
cooking, we used

00:34:23.323 --> 00:34:24.900
to have these
canvas bags that you

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.280
could use over and over again.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.550
We never use those anymore.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.550
We always use this.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.132
And actually, we'll rinse
these out and reuse them.

00:34:32.132 --> 00:34:34.340
Because I feel pretty terrible
about throwing plastic

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.250
in the garbage.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:39.865
Cause it basically goes nowhere.

00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:41.399
It goes to some
landfill somewhere.

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:43.440
CAROLYN JUNG: So if someone
doesn't have the tip,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.560
could they just use a Ziploc
bag and cut the end off?

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.537
But these kind of
tips are inexpensive.

00:34:49.537 --> 00:34:50.870
They only cost a couple dollars.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.820
They're a really
good investment.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.530
As is this thing, which I use
to flip things over in a pan.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.527
And you're going to see me
use it to cut the gnocchi.

00:35:00.527 --> 00:35:02.860
Things like little-- these
are actually sewing scissors.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.087
Joyce Chen, right?

00:35:04.087 --> 00:35:05.420
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh my God, really?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.390
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: We
use these in the kitchen

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.950
for a lot of things like that.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.830
CAROLYN JUNG: Are you
a big tweezer guy too?

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.796
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I
left them at home today.

00:35:12.796 --> 00:35:15.320
For you guys.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.920
What's funny is
that the tweezers--

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.590
that whole thing
is really about,

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.730
if I'm trying to place a garnish
into a dish and my fat little

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.160
fingers are going
to mess it up--

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.951
CAROLYN JUNG: Or if
you're shaking at all--

00:35:26.951 --> 00:35:29.112
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: --it's
better to use a tweezer

00:35:29.112 --> 00:35:29.820
to do that thing.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.770
And so if you're
really trying to make

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.610
these elaborate presentations
or elaborate constructions,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:34.750
sure that thing is helpful.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.280
But I don't feel compelled to
put every single thing that I

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.742
touch on the plate
with a tweezer.

00:35:38.742 --> 00:35:40.200
But it's definitely
a helpful tool.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.408
It's just like anything else.

00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:47.281
Having the right tool for
the job is a huge benefit.

00:35:47.281 --> 00:35:48.780
If there's anything
that you've ever

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.779
tried to do where you
didn't have the right tool

00:35:50.779 --> 00:35:53.130
and took about 10 times
longer because you didn't have

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.516
that tool, you appreciate that.

00:35:56.516 --> 00:35:58.140
CAROLYN JUNG: I'm
sure they can relate.

00:36:01.862 --> 00:36:03.570
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Transfer this to here.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.560
And then, if you got
up to this point,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.260
and you wanted to serve this,
and it was dinner party,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.670
you just come back later.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.330
As long as you have
the water ready,

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.735
this is-- I mean eventually,
there's eggs in here.

00:36:18.095 --> 00:36:20.220
You don't want to leave it
out for a couple of days

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.094
or probably some kind
of fermentation project

00:36:22.094 --> 00:36:23.505
would start in there.

00:36:23.505 --> 00:36:25.880
CAROLYN JUNG: Fermented gnocchi,
it could be a new thing.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.588
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
For an hour it's fine.

00:36:27.588 --> 00:36:29.360
And so it's just lightly warm.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.740
And then, basically
I'm going to bring

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.120
this over the simmering water.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.040
There's salt in here.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.190
And then, what I
figured out is, you'll

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.690
see, if I'm tapping--
I'll just start.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:43.369
Gentle pressure on this.

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:44.910
Then you could sit
here and just tap.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:51.150
What's actually happening is I'm
aiming for the tip of the bag.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:56.780
But they handle of the
wood is hitting the pot.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.000
So that's what's stopping it.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.375
You'll notice if it's like
this, it's a little bit harder

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.880
to hit this target for me.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.330
CAROLYN JUNG: Is there
an ideal size for these?

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.480
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
About two inches.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.990
And eventually you can stop
and reassess where you're at.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.180
I'll do a few more
and then we'll

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.265
open it up for
somebody else to try.

00:37:23.265 --> 00:37:26.660
AUDIENCE: Will the gnocchi
shrink quite a bit?

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.660
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Nope.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.550
They'll stay just like this.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.102
Whatever size they go in
here as, they'll stay.

00:37:34.102 --> 00:37:36.219
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:36.219 --> 00:37:38.760
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: This batter
would be too loose to do that.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.019
So this is that totally
different style of gnocchi.

00:37:42.019 --> 00:37:43.810
If you wanted it to be
a little bit bigger,

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.520
you could change the tip
to a larger pastry tip.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.270
And that would give
you a different style,

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.120
or a different size.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.640
Who wants to try?

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.510
Come on around.

00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:03.890
CAROLYN JUNG: So have
you done this before?

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.580
WOMAN: No.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.242
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
You can't mess it up.

00:38:09.242 --> 00:38:10.140
WOMAN: Like this?

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.890
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Turn this one this way.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.430
Are you left-handed?

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.550
WOMAN: I'm right-handed.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.603
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: You
might want to switch.

00:38:14.603 --> 00:38:15.006
WOMAN: Yeah.

00:38:15.006 --> 00:38:15.505
I was like--

00:38:15.505 --> 00:38:17.850
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I'm left-handed.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.070
I won't handicap you.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.670
Yes, a gentle pressure
and then whatever

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.820
it looks long enough--
if you start to get--

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.070
see how you have this on here?

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.200
Just dip this in the water.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:30.893
Go like that.

00:38:30.893 --> 00:38:31.684
And it'll clean it.

00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:41.990
CAROLYN JUNG: So
what do you think?

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.258
Should we hire her to do
this here every lunch time?

00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:45.258
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:38:45.258 --> 00:38:45.757
For sure.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.380
It's a fun little thing.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.576
And like I said, you can flavor
it a lot of different ways.

00:38:54.576 --> 00:38:56.910
WOMAN: If they get
all around, should I--

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.285
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I'm going fish

00:38:58.285 --> 00:39:01.270
them-- I'm going to go fishing
for you in two seconds.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.537
And that's what I
like to use this for.

00:39:03.537 --> 00:39:04.620
I can actually go in here.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.203
And all the ones
that have floated now

00:39:06.203 --> 00:39:09.420
for a minute they're
all ready to come out.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:17.062
And you'll see that
they have-- this

00:39:17.062 --> 00:39:18.520
is what I was
talking about before.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.800
Where you could actually make
them to this stage and then

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.430
pull them and leave
them like this.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.530
And that's what I have.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.100
I prepared some this morning
for you guys already.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.375
For after this.

00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:34.860
WOMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.199
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Yeah, of course.

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:39.490
And these are some of the
ones that I made this morning

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:43.470
so you could see-- very similar.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.121
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:46.120
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Nope.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.670
Yeah.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.670
And that's the
great part about it.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.670
So if these-- I didn't
add anything to these,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.960
but if I go and I touch
them-- and actually,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.910
you guys want to--

00:39:58.311 --> 00:40:00.280
WOMAN: Mine aren't
as good as yours.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.480
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I have
a little bit of practice.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.430
You guys want to
check these out.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.140
Those were the
ones that are made.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.190
And so they have a
certain density to them.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.230
And a certain texture, but you
could eve eat them like that,

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.190
but you'll see that
they're pretty light.

00:40:22.037 --> 00:40:23.120
This is a good chef trick.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.300
I'm going to steal some of
your seasoned cooking water.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.392
CAROLYN JUNG: So is this
on the menu a lot at SPQR?

00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:38.100
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: We
have it on the menu

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.700
with the lamb ragout right now.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.140
And we do different
variations of this

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.360
throughout the-- but
one of my favorites

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.320
is to do just fresh
out of the water.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.960
And then during
truffle season, we just

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.650
do truffles over that
and Parmesan cheese.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.066
CAROLYN JUNG: That
sounds amazing.

00:40:57.062 --> 00:40:58.520
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
She's tenacious.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.300
CAROLYN JUNG: I know she's--
I think you should hire her.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.950
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I already did.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.464
You're fast.

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:10.200
WOMAN: Why'd you say
that, I screwed up.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.650
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I
won't say anything.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.340
CAROLYN JUNG: Don't
listen to him.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.640
WOMAN: You're just like my mom.

00:41:17.487 --> 00:41:19.320
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I
added just a little bit

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.200
of the cooking water
here and some butter.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.479
I'm going to warm all these.

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:24.645
And then we'll add in-- I
have some chopped tarragon

00:41:24.645 --> 00:41:26.194
and chopped parsley.

00:41:26.194 --> 00:41:27.860
And then we're going
to do a few-- we're

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.210
going to use your nice gnocchis
for the plate up today.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.355
CAROLYN JUNG: So what's the best
advice a chef ever gave you,

00:41:38.355 --> 00:41:41.174
and who was that gave it to you?

00:41:41.174 --> 00:41:43.090
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I've
gotten so much advice.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.120
We call it feedback.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:44.380
CAROLYN JUNG: Feedback.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.880
OK.

00:41:47.012 --> 00:41:48.220
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Who knows.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.510
I feel like a good chef will
give you advice every day.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.360
I always tell my guys that I
see somebody-- so last night,

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.990
I asked one of my cooks
to take something upstairs

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:04.750
and lay it out flat on a tray
like this and then come back.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.720
And so he went upstairs
to get the tray

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.620
to bring it down for the stuff
so that he can then go back.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.330
And so you just decided to
make two trips for something

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.160
that required one.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.480
If you do that 100
times a day, you

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.530
will have just wasted an
hour of your day running

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.520
back and forth,
getting nothing done.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.104
So if you apply that across your
entire career, at this point,

00:42:25.104 --> 00:42:26.270
that's a lot of wasted time.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.480
CAROLYN JUNG: That is.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:27.980
It adds up.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.320
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: That
little kind of stuff

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.170
about something
that's constant--

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:31.900
CAROLYN JUNG: Being efficient.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.360
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Good job.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:32.890
Thank you.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:33.598
What's your name?

00:42:33.598 --> 00:42:34.160
WOMAN: Katia.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.201
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Katia?

00:42:35.201 --> 00:42:36.460
Thank you.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.090
Anybody else?

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:38.480
I can refill this thing.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.193
CAROLYN JUNG: Anybody
else want to try?

00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:41.526
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah, please.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:45.682
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:45.682 --> 00:42:47.890
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah, we
print the menu every day.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:51.420
And I always liken it to
the tracks of a caterpillar.

00:42:54.367 --> 00:42:56.700
Half of them are on the road
and the other half are not.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.600
So there's probably
40 or 50 menu items

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.410
and then we're
running 25 of those.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.440
So we're always coming
up with new menu items.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.380
Let me turn this up
a little for you.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:17.220
And then those new menu
items, some are new,

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.990
some were on three days ago.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.210
And we bring them back.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.070
We're always doing
different things

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.760
and bringing in-- a lot
of what is important to me

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.620
in the restaurant
is things like,

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.530
pretty much all the
animals that we buy,

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.574
with the exception of
beef, we buy whole.

00:43:31.574 --> 00:43:32.990
So that means if
I get a duck, I'm

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.460
going to get duck fat
and a duck tureen,

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.010
and duck breast, and duck legs.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:39.390
And all these different things.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.390
And then we use all the
bones and we make broth,

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.370
so that begets four
or five dishes.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.910
But once we run out
of duck breasts,

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.809
we're working with duck
leg to do something else.

00:43:48.809 --> 00:43:50.600
And so there's always
new dishes and always

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.780
new things coming because of
that search for ingredients.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:58.490
Or if I go and all these
onions are flowering right now,

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.060
but in two weeks, they won't be.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.600
So in two weeks, we couldn't
even use that as an ingredient

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.020
if we wanted to.

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.332
That kind of change in things.

00:44:06.332 --> 00:44:08.040
CAROLYN JUNG: Is there
any new ingredient

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.470
that you've discovered lately
that you just love and can't

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.308
get enough of?

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.390
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
It's hard to discover--

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:21.060
I wish I could discover new
ingredients more often than I

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:21.790
do.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:24.760
But it was interesting because
I went to this great trouble

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.810
to get this certain
type of ice lettuce,

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.030
or some type of ice plant.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.810
I had to go, and think I
got it from a guy on eBay.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:32.990
And it was a little--

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.380
CAROLYN JUNG: A guy on eBay?

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.120
OK.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.661
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
--kind of sketchy.

00:44:37.786 --> 00:44:39.160
And then I went
around the corner

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.563
from where I'm growing in Napa,
and it's on somebody's lawn.

00:44:42.563 --> 00:44:44.730
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh, jeez.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.230
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: And somebody
planted it as an ornamental.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:48.590
It was edible.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:49.971
And so I kept
thinking, I'm going

00:44:49.971 --> 00:44:52.095
to go back to that guys
yard in the middle of night

00:44:52.095 --> 00:44:54.206
and cut that stuff.

00:44:54.206 --> 00:44:57.360
See, you're good.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.080
But I think you're
always looking

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:06.350
for new ingredients and
new ways to use things.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:09.023
I think that's also one
of the great joys of being

00:45:09.023 --> 00:45:12.220
a chef is that you're
bound to come back

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.130
to stuff over and over again.

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.700
Because every year, corn
comes, and tomatoes come.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.200
I've started to
actually consider

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.872
tomatoes in the last two weeks.

00:45:21.872 --> 00:45:23.330
They're not really
ready yet, but--

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:24.715
CAROLYN JUNG: Everything
is coming early this year.

00:45:24.715 --> 00:45:25.715
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Yeah.

00:45:25.715 --> 00:45:27.580
But all of the tomatoes
that I have growing

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.930
are all starting to get there.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.050
But first, we'll think
about green tomatoes.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.580
And then we actually
make a tomato leaf pasta

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.330
at the restaurant.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:37.110
CAROLYN JUNG: Tomato leaf pasta.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.160
Wow.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.993
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I
asked one of my farmers

00:45:39.993 --> 00:45:43.140
one year to pick me 20
pounds of green tomatoes.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.749
And his guys picked 20 pounds
of green tomato leaves.

00:45:47.749 --> 00:45:48.790
And they sent them to us.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.365
Which, I don't know if you--
but 20 pounds is a lot.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.190
I kind of felt badly.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.690
And we had a long talk about
it and then eventually decided,

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.670
you know, it'd be
better to figure out

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.490
what to do with these
than throw them away.

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.230
So that came out of that.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.480
But I think a lot of times
that's another great thing,

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.704
is that a lot of times
mistakes become the ideas.

00:46:11.704 --> 00:46:13.370
If you learned something
from a mistake,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.450
it becomes the next new idea.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:21.780
Looking for new uses or new
ways to use an ingredient

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.700
is just as beneficial as knowing
what you did the year before

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.270
and trying to do something
different based on that.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.575
CAROLYN JUNG: That's looking
beautiful, by the way.

00:46:30.575 --> 00:46:32.075
AUDIENCE: How much
time do you spend

00:46:32.075 --> 00:46:34.220
on creating brand new recipes?

00:46:37.031 --> 00:46:38.780
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: We
call them paradigms.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.852
So it's like adding something
to the vernacular in my kitchen.

00:46:43.852 --> 00:46:45.310
We'll have this
thing and it's wow,

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:49.872
I have this idea about--
so we make lasagna.

00:46:49.872 --> 00:46:51.330
And so I can't make
lasagna the way

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:52.746
that everybody
else makes lasagna,

00:46:52.746 --> 00:46:55.710
so I have to do this 27
layer, where we bake it

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:58.020
in this special tureen mold
that had a stainless steel

00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.700
guy make for me.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.420
So that we can lift
the mold off and then

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.650
it has all these layers.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.900
So we've done that with all
these different variations

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.890
of the dough and the filling.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:09.400
But then at one point, we wanted
to do something different.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.140
And so I was like, all
right, well, what is lasagna?

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.550
Lasagna is this layered thing.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.740
What is lasagnette?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.160
And lasagnette is a thin
lasagna noodle in Italy

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.525
that is usually something
that's eaten as a noodle pasta.

00:47:21.525 --> 00:47:23.650
And I don't know why they
would call it lasagnette,

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.733
but so it's like, all
right, so what if lasagnette

00:47:25.733 --> 00:47:26.930
was a thin lasagna?

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:28.460
And so we took
this sheet of dough

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.556
and we fill it and
fold it and bake it.

00:47:30.556 --> 00:47:31.930
Right now, we're
doing one that's

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.906
filled with ricotta and saffron.

00:47:33.906 --> 00:47:34.780
It's a saffron dough.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.860
And it looks like
a little envelope.

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.387
And then on top, we do a
mushroom bolognese with it.

00:47:39.387 --> 00:47:40.970
Those kind of things,
where you just--

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.629
CAROLYN JUNG: How long did
it take you to perfect that?

00:47:44.629 --> 00:47:45.670
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: A day.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:46.503
CAROLYN JUNG: A day?

00:47:46.503 --> 00:47:48.192
That's it?

00:47:48.192 --> 00:47:49.650
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
But then what'll

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:54.120
happen from there is, we'll
change that lasagnette--

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.180
the filling, the
dough, the topping, all

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.070
the different accompaniments.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:01.437
And it now has-- Good job.

00:48:01.437 --> 00:48:02.520
CAROLYN JUNG: Look at you.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.181
You're like a
machine over there.

00:48:05.181 --> 00:48:07.180
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Zero
supervision, by the way.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:07.896
If you guys noticed that.

00:48:07.896 --> 00:48:08.870
CAROLYN JUNG: Pretty good.

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:10.286
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
But now that'll

00:48:10.286 --> 00:48:13.330
beget 25 different
iterations of that same idea.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.460
And so adding that new idea to
the thing, where at one point,

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.000
we buy a certain
bread for the tables.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.660
And then as a restauranteur,
even if you're buying bread

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.120
for the tables, no one's--
they were talking about loaves

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.490
of bread that nobody cuts.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.970
So we have it.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.450
We buy it for a day.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.070
Nobody even asked to eat it.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:32.620
So you would just throw
it away, because what am I

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.994
going to do with
it the next day.

00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:36.890
So at some certain point,
we're like oh, what can we do?

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:38.780
How can we not
waste this product?

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.030
Because somebody lovingly
prepared that product.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.430
So as a chef, you're really
trying to make the best out

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.690
of everything that you buy.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.180
We came up with
this idea for what

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.640
we call the budin de pane,
which is bread pudding.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.500
So again, here comes into play
this sort of mold like this.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.870
And we take brioche that we
make and run it on a slicer.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:00.170
So you get these long
planks of brioche dough

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.110
and put that in the bottom.

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.280
Take all these loaves.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.430
Cut all the crusts off.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.230
Use all of that.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.385
And right now we're
doing it with apricots

00:49:07.385 --> 00:49:08.560
and white chocolate.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.480
We make a white
chocolate custard

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.710
and soak that whole thing.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.844
Put this layer of
cubed bread in there.

00:49:13.844 --> 00:49:16.260
Press it down, and then take
another layer of that brioche

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.310
and put it on top.

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.560
We bake that whole thing.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.950
I had a plastic maker cut
these perfect plastic weights

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.270
so I could perfectly
weigh the thing down.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.910
So we get this insanely
perfect huge block

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.855
that we can then portion
into bread puddings.

00:49:32.855 --> 00:49:35.230
CAROLYN JUNG: That's the most
refined bread pudding ever.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.945
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Dip it in sugar

00:49:35.945 --> 00:49:38.090
and the we caramelize
it one more time.

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:41.480
And it has a crunchy sugar
exterior, like a creme brulee,

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.390
on a bread pudding.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:43.390
And it's made with that.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:44.931
But that's basically
made out of what

00:49:44.931 --> 00:49:47.640
we would call trim for the
interior part, which is bread

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.315
that we didn't use
from the day before.

00:49:50.315 --> 00:49:51.690
Those kind of
things we're always

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:53.460
looking at, and trying
to put innovation

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.900
into something that
you already have.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.050
Those kind of new
ideas is what's

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.460
really important in a kitchen.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.670
So I'm always trying
to instill that

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:02.253
in the people that
are working for me.

00:50:02.253 --> 00:50:04.270
Because it is one
thing to go and look

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.175
for a completely brand new
thing that you have to acquire.

00:50:08.175 --> 00:50:10.550
But what if you could do more
with what you already have?

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:13.540
And so I think that's a
really important concept

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.290
across, I think, a lot of
disciplines, especially

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.790
cooking.

00:50:21.702 --> 00:50:24.989
AUDIENCE: I know that the major
part of a lot chefs' careers

00:50:24.989 --> 00:50:25.614
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:30.066 --> 00:50:31.482
Do you still have
time to do that?

00:50:31.482 --> 00:50:33.712
Or is that something [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:33.712 --> 00:50:35.920
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Regrettably,
as you become a chef,

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.860
it's more difficult,
I would say.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.320
I always say to the guy-- I
have cooks that one day want

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.506
to become a sous
chef, and they say,

00:50:43.506 --> 00:50:45.020
well chef, I've cooked
for you a couple years,

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.851
I'd like to become a
sous chef and move up.

00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:49.350
And I say, I just want you to
understand that the shift will

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:53.070
go from where you're learning
all the time to you're now

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:54.970
learning a lot of the
time, but you're also

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.914
teaching a lot of your time.

00:50:56.914 --> 00:50:58.580
And then you get the
point where I'm at,

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.720
and I spend more time
teaching than I do learning.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.860
So it's really difficult
for me to get--

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.440
and actually Google
is a big help,

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.580
because every time we're
looking for-- if I have an idea,

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.630
I can actually Google
the ingredients and see.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.480
And you'll see what
other stuff comes up.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.850
And then you try not to copy
that or do those things.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:19.900
But it gives you
some inspiration.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.020
And so I think in
the real world,

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.800
where I'm doing
that is I'm going

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.680
and I'm spending a day here.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.250
Or I'm going, I'm traveling
and cooking with other chefs,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:31.000
or doing other events and seeing
what other people are doing.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.952
And you're trying to soak
up the world around you

00:51:33.952 --> 00:51:37.566
to re-purpose that
experience for inspiration

00:51:37.566 --> 00:51:39.190
in your own realm,
in your own kitchen.

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:44.410
I think it becomes certainly
much more closed off

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:48.306
the more you are chef in
charge, at that point.

00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:50.430
Because nobody is going to
come tell you, hey chef,

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:51.721
I've got this brand new recipe.

00:51:51.721 --> 00:51:54.670
I'm going to give it to you for
you to put in your cookbook.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:59.440
It like, no, you better
figure out your own stuff.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.350
That's definitely
an aspect of it.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.730
CAROLYN JUNG: So
if you could choose

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.310
to stage with any chef living
or dead, who would it be?

00:52:09.955 --> 00:52:11.496
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
God, I don't know.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.420
I guess going back to that
thing-- I would have liked

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.480
to have gone back to--
both of my grandmothers

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.630
were incredible cooks.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:26.762
And I was too young
and too foolish to know

00:52:26.762 --> 00:52:28.470
that I should have
spent more time trying

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.020
to figure out what they knew.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.350
And my grandmother
actually gave me

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:36.390
one of her cookbooks, which
was like the Farmer's Almanac

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.935
Cookbook from the '40s, but
she had made all of her recipes

00:52:38.935 --> 00:52:41.649
and all of her notes in that.

00:52:41.649 --> 00:52:43.190
It was in my father's
basement and it

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:44.969
was destroyed in
Hurricane Sandy.

00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:46.635
It was the one thing
that I was probably

00:52:46.635 --> 00:52:48.520
the most upset about losing.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.632
And we really tried--
we stayed in hotel room.

00:52:50.632 --> 00:52:52.840
We traveled there, because
I live here in California,

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.339
obviously.

00:52:53.339 --> 00:52:56.650
So when that happened in New
Jersey in my father's house,

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.320
we traveled and spent three
days with hair dryers and irons,

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.810
trying to dry stuff
like that out.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:05.200
Whatever the water was, there
was something not right.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.520
So we ended up saying,
got to get rid of it.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.610
But I tried to take pictures
and document what I could

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:15.020
before we got rid of things.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.209
It would've been
a good experience

00:53:17.209 --> 00:53:18.250
to have spent that stuff.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.940
And like I said, it goes back
to that third grade birthday

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.481
party where I should
have been paying

00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:24.120
a little more
attention to the pizza.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:28.220
Because I would have benefited.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.225
This is another
little handy tool.

00:53:30.225 --> 00:53:31.600
I don't know why
it has a mirror.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.900
I would love it if sometime
somebody would tell me.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.099
I can't possibly figure it out.

00:53:36.099 --> 00:53:38.390
CAROLYN JUNG: So you can
check your makeup in between--

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:39.550
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
I mean, is that?

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:40.680
It makes no sense to me.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:44.310
But it seems an odd-- so
have you seen these before?

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.344
They're-- you can get them at
Dyso or one of $0.99 store.

00:53:47.344 --> 00:53:48.760
CAROLYN JUNG: The
Japanese Stores.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:51.093
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: We go by
Clement Street and buy them.

00:53:51.093 --> 00:53:53.680
And they're like $1.00.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.680
This is perfect for little
a la minute garnishes.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.470
This is just a little
bit of truffle.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.796
So These are summer truffles.

00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:04.420
And usually they have
a black exterior.

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.717
And I really like to
peel the outside off.

00:54:06.717 --> 00:54:08.300
And we use the outside
and chop it up.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.440
And then we lightly cooked
this in mushroom stock.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.060
A little bit of summer truffle.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.910
And then this is that black
garlic puree to just finish it.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.660
AUDIENCE: Chef, what
is one thing that you

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:19.262
can eat for the
rest of your life?

00:54:19.262 --> 00:54:20.720
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
One thing that I

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.870
could eat for the
rest of my life?

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.585
Cereal.

00:54:25.585 --> 00:54:26.460
CAROLYN JUNG: Cereal?

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.660
Any particular kind?

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.201
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Cereal and yogurt.

00:54:32.201 --> 00:54:35.020
No, we actually make
granola at home.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:40.290
And I hit the bulk
bins at Rainbow Grocery

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:41.510
and Whole Foods and things.

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:46.640
And then we use-- my girlfriend
has a little bit of a gluten

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.500
thing that she's
trying to work through.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.714
And so we're using
coconut sugar and maple

00:54:51.714 --> 00:54:54.130
syrup and all these other
things to make different things,

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.331
and experimenting with
the different tastes.

00:54:56.331 --> 00:54:57.580
But I actually really like it.

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.590
And we eat a lot of fruit,
yogurt, and granola.

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:02.230
CAROLYN JUNG: That's
pretty healthy.

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:03.688
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
It's what it is.

00:55:03.688 --> 00:55:05.440
But this is what you guys made.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.990
CAROLYN JUNG: Pretty good, huh?

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.650
So I know you still cycle a lot.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:18.120
In fact, you are doing a ride
with Chef Chris Cosentino

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.480
later this year?

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.896
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I'm actually
doing a couple different--

00:55:21.896 --> 00:55:24.240
so I'm still on the
bicycle quite often.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.740
I'm going to Aspen Food and
Wine because I have the Best New

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.750
Chef Award this year.

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:32.160
And so I will be riding
from Leadville, Colorado

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.859
70 miles over a mountain pass.

00:55:33.859 --> 00:55:35.150
CAROLYN JUNG: At high altitude.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.730
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: At
12,000 feet or something.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:38.376
So I'll be--

00:55:38.376 --> 00:55:40.042
CAROLYN JUNG: Have
you done this before?

00:55:40.042 --> 00:55:42.430
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: No.

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.190
I haven't ridden over
this pass before.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.175
I think we start at
around 7000 feet elevation

00:55:46.175 --> 00:55:50.560
and head up to 13-- 12 or 13,000
to get to Aspen Food and Wine.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.052
There's a couple of pro-cyclists
and a few other riders

00:55:53.052 --> 00:55:54.510
that are coming
that will certainly

00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:55.690
attempt to challenge me.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:57.520
I have no doubt.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.190
But then also in the
fall, the Sonoma Century

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.940
with Chris King, who is a
bicycle component manufacturer,

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.540
used to be based here in
California, is now in Portland.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.937
Chris Cosentino and myself, a
chef from the Glen Ellen Star,

00:56:09.937 --> 00:56:12.270
and a few other people are
going to be cooking for that.

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:14.989
So I get to make
lunch for 450 people.

00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:15.780
That should be fun.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.670
CAROLYN JUNG: I know
Chris also had dreams,

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.420
at one point, of becoming
a professional cyclist.

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.890
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: And he did
mountain bike race for a while.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:23.765
CAROLYN JUNG: He did.

00:56:23.765 --> 00:56:25.770
24 hour ones, too.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:28.570
So any rivalries
there on the bike?

00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:30.060
Any side bets happening?

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.440
At who's going to win?

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.180
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I think
it's all friendly competition.

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.440
I think we'll all
just have a good time.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.500
And I'm also headed to
Greenville, South Carolina

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.530
later this year for--
George Hincapie used

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.820
to ride with Lance Armstrong
on the Tour de France and all

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.200
these other things, now
has his own company,

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.134
Hincapie Sportswear in Carolina.

00:56:51.134 --> 00:56:52.550
And he does a big
ride every year.

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:54.424
So I'll be going down
there to cook and ride.

00:56:54.424 --> 00:56:57.610
I think, again,
life is about trying

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.700
to find the things that you
love to do and get paid for it.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.290
So if-- get paid for doing them.

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:09.130
So if I can combine cycling
and cooking together,

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:10.810
that's the best of
both worlds for me.

00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:12.900
Anytime I can do
that, I'm fair game.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.389
I'm game for it.

00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:16.680
CAROLYN JUNG: So before I
let you guys all sample this,

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:18.352
cause we're going to
have samples later.

00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:20.560
And we're also going to do
a book signing afterwards.

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.340
I always like to close the
interview by doing a little fun

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.730
word association with the chefs.

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.320
I'm going to say
something and I want

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.330
you to answer with the first
word or phrase or thought that

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.220
comes into your head.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:32.950
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: I can't wait.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:33.658
CAROLYN JUNG: OK.

00:57:33.658 --> 00:57:35.230
You're a good sport.

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:37.537
Chefs on social media.

00:57:37.537 --> 00:57:39.120
MATTHEW ACCARRINO:
Too much free time.

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:44.001
CAROLYN JUNG:
Restaurant critics.

00:57:44.001 --> 00:57:45.042
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Uh oh.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.780
CAROLYN JUNG: The feeling
of fresh pasta dough

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.830
in your hands.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.790
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Supple.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.430
CAROLYN JUNG:
Italian restaurants

00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:59.580
that can't be bothered with
making their own pasta.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.500
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Lazy.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.339
CAROLYN JUNG: The
James Beard Awards.

00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:04.630
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Prestigious.

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.400
CAROLYN JUNG: The
Tour de France.

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.320
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Difficult.

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.440
CAROLYN JUNG: Thomas Keller.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.780
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Hero.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.200
CAROLYN JUNG: Julia
Child Cooking Shows.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.800
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Entertaining.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.720
CAROLYN JUNG: Lydia Bastianich.

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.270
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Mama.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.160
CAROLYN JUNG: And
last, but not least.

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:21.750
Chef Boyardee.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:26.300
MATTHEW ACCARRINO: Do not open.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.780
CAROLYN JUNG: Oh!

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.780
Well, thank you so much.

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.950
And you guys have any questions,
please jump, feel free.

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.700
[APPLAUSE]
