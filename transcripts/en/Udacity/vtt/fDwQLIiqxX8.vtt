00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's see. I have a right triangle here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I need to know now how can I figure out what this width is?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, the side I know is the opposite side.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The side I want to know is this one here--the width.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, that's the adjacent side to this angle. It's not the hypotenuse.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, so which trig function relates opposite and adjacent?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, that's the tangent.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, I'm going to be using the tangent of this angle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm going to calculate that, because I know that it has to equal the opposite side

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
over the adjacent side, which is the width.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Okay, not so bad.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now I have to solve this for width, which means I have to bring this over here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and put this guy down there, which gives me width equals 25 m/tan(1.3Â°).

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
When I plug that in, I like to use Google's calculator,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I get a length of 1100 meters.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, this is really an incredible tool.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We use basic trigonometry to make a real calculation.

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is truly how you could have calculated the width of the mouth of the bay of Syracuse. Good work.
