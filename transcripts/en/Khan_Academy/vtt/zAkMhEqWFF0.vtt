00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.770
I think we know enough about
shorting now that we can start

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.390
thinking about whether it's a
good or bad thing to have in

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.290
financial markets.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.040
And what I've done here is
I've drawn a hypothetical

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.310
stock chart for a company.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.790
This time right here.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.980
This is the price
of the company.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.860
And let's just say that this is
a chart in a universe that

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.810
doesn't have short
sellers in it.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.920
So this is all-- here a lot of
people are buying the stock,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.140
then over here some people,
maybe they get freaked out or

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.510
whatever, they start selling.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.780
And then more people buy.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.880
So demands a little higher
than supply, so

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.290
the price goes up.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.940
And that just generally
drives the volatility.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.140
Now in a short selling world,
what would happen?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.980
Let's let's think about two
scenarios, a short seller who

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.290
makes money, and a short
seller who loses money.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.400
So a short seller
making money.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.890
What would a short seller making
money have to do if

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.900
this is the stock chart.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.960
Obviously, they don't see the
stock chart beyond the day

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.170
that they're actually making
the trade, but in order to

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.820
make money they'll actually--
they'll have to short at the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.670
local peaks.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.209
And they would have to
cover their shorts

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.940
at the local minimum.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.260
So a good short seller-- or
you can even say a perfect

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.940
short seller would maybe short
here-- let me make it a

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.100
different color so you can see
where he's acting-- would

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.970
short here and then
cover there.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.310
And he would make that much
money on that move.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.190
And then he would wait a little
bit, wait for the stock

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.880
to get expensive again
in his mind.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.820
And he would short here, and
then he would cover here.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.010
This would kind of be--
obviously it's very unlikely

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.905
that someone could so well pick
tops and bottoms. But

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.640
let's say they're just really
good at their analysis and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.900
figuring out market psychology
and things like that.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.120
And they would just
keep doing it.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.210
They would short here
and cover here.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.450
What would that actually
do to the stock?

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.170
The green line was a
reality where you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.740
had no short sellers.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.700
Now if all of a sudden you
allowed short selling, and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.940
they had these guys come into
the market who know how to

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.360
make money shorting.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.780
He's shorting up here.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.990
So what would shorting do?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.390
Shorting is you're borrowing
the stock and selling it.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.360
So he's creating extra supply
for the stock, right?

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.760
So what he would be doing at
this point, by shorting, is he

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.870
would actually be lowering
the price at this point.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.940
So let me draw the curve.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.690
So if there's a bunch of short
sellers acting in this range,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.360
it would actually
lower the peak.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.620
Because you have a bunch--
you have some

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.250
more aggregate sellers.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520
So the price wouldn't
go as high.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.200
And then on the other hand,
these short sellers have to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.860
cover right here, right?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.670
They're going to cover
their position.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.200
So at the low point you have
more aggregate buyers covering

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.420
a short position, is just you're
buying the stock to pay

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.460
it back, because you borrowed
it earlier.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.330
So here you would have more
aggregate buyers.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.450
And then at this point, once
again you have more aggregate

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.680
sellers, so the price
won't go as high.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.490
You have more aggregate buyers
here, because the short

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.790
sellers need to cover, so the
price won't go as low.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.630
And so forth and so on.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.020
And the bottom line is, a short
seller who's making

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.480
money on the stock market, so
they're shorting the stock at

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.850
peaks and covering the stock
at troughs, is actually

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.840
reducing the volatility
of the stock.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.900
And that's good for everybody.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.300
That's good for the company's
management.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.050
That's good for the actual
shareholders of the company.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.780
And obviously it's good for the
short sellers because they

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.950
are actually making money.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.830
And this is actually true for
anyone making money in the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.390
stock market.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.570
That they're reducing
volatility.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.620
What is a long-- just a regular
investor-- or I guess

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.440
you could call them a trader
since they're buying and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.700
selling-- a regular trader would
make money by buying

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.640
here and selling here.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.570
So really a regular trader
is not any different.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.670
A regular long trader is no
different than a short seller,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.870
it's just the order in which
they're buying or selling.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.750
But anyone making money is
buying at low points and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.070
selling at high points.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.820
And anyone doing that is
helping to reduce the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.170
volatility in the stock.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.130
And even if you're a long term
buy and hold player, you would

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.470
rather sit and hold a stock--
you would rather be a holder

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.460
of a stock that does this,
than a holder of a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.710
stock that does this.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.899
Now there are a lot of players
both on-- you could call them

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.070
traders because they're buying
and selling on a regular

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.450
basis-- that aren't kind
of doing this.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.210
Maybe they're piling on the
shorts at a low point and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.490
they're causing the stock
to go down even more.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.980
And then, when the stock starts
to move up they get

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.160
scared and they buy it, and
it causes the stock to

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.350
move up even more.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.180
And it increases the volatility
of the stock.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.020
But these guys are being
penalized because they're

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.020
losing money.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.630
The people who sell at low
points and then buy at high

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.590
points, and increase
the volatility,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.600
they're getting killed.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.020
They're falling every day.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.350
So it's not like you
have to create some

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.420
penalty for those guys.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.980
Their penalty is that
they're just bad

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.710
traders, they're bad investors.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.570
And they're just going
to lose their shirts.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.430
So if you're assuming that none
of these traders in any

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.400
way manipulating the markets
or spreading false rumors.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.790
Anyone making money on a stock,
as long as they're not

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.700
manipulating it, on either the
short or the long side, is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.290
actually a net asset
for the stock.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.540
That they're actually reducing
the volatility

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.970
of the stock price.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.160
I guess another thing to think
about and this is just from

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.490
a-- it's good.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.500
They're reducing the volatility,
so from that point

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.270
sorting doesn't seem too
bad, for me, or in

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.820
general to the market.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.150
But another way to think about
it is, kind of where are all

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.490
the incentives in the markets?

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.530
Who has an incentive to be
positive on a stock?

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.710
And who has an incentive to
be a negative on a stock?

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.960
Or to scrutinize a stocks?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.950
Well, the biggest, I guess
cheerleaders, for a stock, and

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.800
it depends on their degree of
kind of credibility or ethics,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.300
would be the company's
management, right?

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:08.180
These are people-- it would
be company's management.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.520
These are people who obviously
run the company, but they have

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.890
the best transparency into the
financials of a company, and

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.190
they tend to be shareholders
of the company or get

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.160
compensated based on
how the stock does.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.190
So these guys have every
incentive to be positive.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.000
And, as we've seen multiple
examples of, whether you're

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.450
talking about the investment
banks, or Enron, or Accenture,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.470
they'll often kind of hide the
truth when things get bad.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.410
So these guys are definitely big
time positive on stocks.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.300
Then, let's see, who are the
other players or the

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.950
influencers on financial
markets?

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.130
Well, a big one is the
financial press.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.740
And I'll write it out here so we
can have a discussion about

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.340
whether they are pumpers of
stock or whether they tend to

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.120
be more-- whether they tend
to scrutinize things

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.480
a little bit more.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.350
An important thing to think
about with the financial

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.130
press, and next time you watch
CNBC-- and I don't want to

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.600
just pick on them-- is how
do they make money?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.560
Do they make money by
finding things that

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.820
are wrong with companies?

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.260
Do they make money by
making you money?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.950
No, they make money
by selling ads.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.640
And then the next question,
obviously, is who are they

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.000
selling ads to?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.600
Are they selling ads for mops?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.430
Are they selling ads
for bicycles?

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.485
No, they're selling ads to
financial services companies.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.180
So people who want to manage
your wealth, stock brokers,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.890
mutual fund companies, anyone
who can advertise.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.210
And this is key, too, because--
I don't know, you're

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.700
probably not aware of it but
hedge funds can't advertise,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.080
so they're not consumers of the
financial-- or they're not

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.500
customers of the financial
press.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.180
The only people who are
customers of the financial

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.510
press are money managers,
financial planners, and things

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:05.600
like that-- brokers,
mutual funds.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.320
And all of these guys benefit
when stock markets go up.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.530
Obviously mutual fund managers
will-- they tend to be long

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.850
only, so they only want
things to go up.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.530
Stock brokers-- you might say,
oh you know, a stock broker

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.790
can advise you to go long or
short and they just care about

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.870
how many transactions
you make.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.110
But in general, more and more
people put money into the

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.160
stock market in rising
markets.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.590
In a market like you're seeing
right now over the last year,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.010
people are pulling out-- you
could say oh, maybe people

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.789
aren't doing more transactions,
but the general

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.190
net effect is, people
are pulling

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.240
money out of the markets.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.100
So when they're pulling money
out of the markets, brokers

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.220
are getting less transactions,
they're managing less money.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.340
And that's also true of
the money managers.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.010
And there's also just another
ancillary side effect, is when

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.760
markets go down and people
become less excited about the

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.220
stock market, people stop
watching CNBC and CNNfn.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.200
And so even those few ads that
are for mops and for bicycles

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.940
and for cars will get
fewer viewers.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.120
So in general the financial
press, at least in my opinion,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.600
is squarely in this camp.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.700
And then we can talk more, you
know, sell side analysts.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.910
You've probably heard the term
sell side and buy side.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.170
But sell side analysts are the
analysts that work for the

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.780
major brokerages and investment
banks, who publish

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.280
those reports that you see in
those ratings, a buy rating on

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.680
IBM, or whatever.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.860
And the reason why they call
them sell side analysts is

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.150
because they work for the people
who are essentially, on

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.720
some level, selling-- you could
either view them as they

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.460
often offer securities, or they
offer financial services

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.860
to, often the companies
themselves, or to potential

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.210
acquirers of the companies.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.070
Or they're selling their
services-- I mean, usually--

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.150
they're brokerage services, so
they're trying to get people

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.980
to transact, they're actually
brokers on some level.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.800
But clearly these guys, their
incentive, since their

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.790
customer tends to be the
management of companies, is to

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.840
be very, very, very positive.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.670
And you should say oh, there
are other people who, their

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.950
whole job is to scrutinize
these people.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.930
Like, the government.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.470
But if you think about it once
again, the government likes a

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.580
rising stock market.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.130
It takes-- when people's 401k's
are rising, the economy

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.450
does better, the government
doesn't have to worry as much

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.250
about other types of social
benefits, and unemployment,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.450
and things like that.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.770
So in general, and if you want
to be more, I guess, if you

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.000
want to be more critical of the
government, you could also

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.210
say that they are, to some
degree, very close to the

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.550
management of these firms and
to financial companies.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.170
And to some degree, these guys
have significant clout in

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.940
terms of lobbyists-- and, well
actually, I would even say the

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.180
bankers, too.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.490
They have significant clout in
terms of lobbying, and just

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.940
access to government,
generally.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.330
And government drives the
regulators, so these guys are

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.490
also on the positive camp.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.120
And then finally you have
the ratings agencies.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.680
And the ratings agencies mainly

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.870
operate in the debt world.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.400
And we'll talk more
about that.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.050
But, if you can scrutinize a
company on the debt level, and

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.250
you say oh wow, this company
really isn't that good,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.050
they're not going to be
able pay off its debt.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.100
That kills the stock.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.940
But once again you have to
realize that the rating

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.640
agencies are also paid by the
bankers, so the rating

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.770
agencies are also-- have the
incentive to kind of not see

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.270
things when things are bad.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.860
So out of everyone in the
financial services, or the

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.170
financial world, that we've
talked about right now, they

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.670
all benefit when stocks
continue to go up.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.350
Even when they go up beyond what
they really should go up.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.340
And even if they all kind of
know that things are a little

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.350
bit too expensive.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.040
Or this management team might
be a little shady, or they

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.530
might be covering
up something.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.060
None of these people
really have an

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.980
incentive to expose it.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.310
And the only people who do
are the short sellers.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.870
These are the only people who
really have, arguably the

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.040
sophistication and the time and
the monetary incentive to

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.450
really look and scrutinize
what management is doing.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.960
To really look in the books
and kind of put a puzzle

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.565
together, or put a bunch of
pieces together to come to the

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:16.900
conclusion, wait, the numbers
that management is spouting

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.960
really don't add up.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.250
And because of x, y and z,
this company really is

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.480
overvalued.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.090
So to a large degree they are
kind of on society's side in

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.670
preventing management from kind
of being overly bullish.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.800
And I don't want to sound like
someone who just broadly is

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.760
defending short sellers.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.400
There is a class of short
sellers that I think would be

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.600
bad, and that's the people who
are spreading false rumors,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.140
and being market manipulators.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.200
So there's just the
general market

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:55.380
manipulation, or rumor mongering.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.000
And that definitely is bad, and
to some degree, if you can

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.370
show someone is doing that,
there should be some type of

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.600
penalty for doing it.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.380
But even there, and just it in
my experience participating in

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.990
public markets, if I had to
pick-- if I had to pick

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.200
between the left side of that
chart, between this side of

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.890
this charge and this side of
this chart-- and if I had to

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.290
say who does spread
false information

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.760
when it does get spread?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.410
I think often times management
is a little bit more guilty of

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.730
it than the short sellers.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.130
In fact there's very few times
that I've seen where the short

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.670
sellers are-- there's some
negative thesis on the stock

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.630
and where it really comes out
to be completely untrue.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.660
Although, there are examples,
and those short sellers, I

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.380
don't think are really in the
mainstream Anyway, I don't

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.330
want to meander too much.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.460
I realize that this video
has already gotten long.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.200
But I thought it's a nice,
useful discussion to maybe

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.280
think a little bit about whether
short selling really

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.230
is all that bad, even if you
are a long investor.
