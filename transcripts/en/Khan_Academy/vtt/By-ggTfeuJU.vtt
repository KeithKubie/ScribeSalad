00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
 

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.960
We're now ready for Newton's
third law of motion.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.480
And something, once again,
you've probably heard,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.302
people talk about.

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.760
But in this video, I want to
make sure we really understand

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.810
what Newton is talking
about when he says--

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.059
this is a translation of
the Latin version of it--

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.150
to every action, there's
always-- and just

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.940
to be clear--
Newton was English,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.300
but he wrote it in Latin
because at that point in time,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.925
people wrote things
in Latin because it

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.830
was viewed as a more
serious language.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.910
But anyway-- to every
action, there is always

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.360
an equal and opposite
reaction, or the forces

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.210
of two bodies on each
other are always equal

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.910
and are directed in
opposite directions.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.310
So what Newton is saying
is that you can't just

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.930
have a force acting
on some object

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.350
without that object also
having an opposite force acting

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.400
on the thing that's
trying to act on it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.290
And just to make it clear,
let's say that we have a--

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.640
and we'll talk about these
examples in the second.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.680
Let's say that I have some
type of block right over here.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.700
And that I move, and
I press on the block

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.580
and I try to push it forward.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.320
So this is my hand.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.620
This is my hand trying
to press on the block

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.720
and exert a force, a net
force in that direction.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.880
So that the block
moves to the right.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.576
Maybe this block is
sitting on some type of ice

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.480
so that it can move.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.390
So let's say that I have some--
that doesn't look like ice--

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450
I'll give it a more
ice-like color.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.190
So the block is sitting on,
maybe, some ice like that.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.150
So Newton's third law
is saying, look, I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.310
can press on this
block, and sure,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.070
I'll exert a net
force on this block

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.920
and that net force will
accelerate the block assuming

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.100
that I can overcome
friction, and if it's on ice

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.320
I can do that.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
But that block is going to exert
an equal and opposite force

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.560
on me.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.230
 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.074
And for direct evidence--
this is something,

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:56.990
even though it might not
be so intuitive, when

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.260
it's said-- this equal
and opposite force.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.000
But direct evidence that it's
exerting an equal and opposite

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.250
force-- is that my hand
will get compressed.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.330
I could actually feel the
block exerting pressure on me.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.740
Take your hand right now and
push it against your desk

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.420
or whatever you have
nearby and you are clearly

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.340
exerting a force on the desk.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.920
So let me draw-- so let's
say I have a desk right here.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.270
And if I try to push on the
desk-- so once again that's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.696
my hand right here,
pushing on the desk.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.320
If I push on the
desk, and I'm actually

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120
doing it right now while
I record this video.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.940
You'll see.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.000
So I'm clearly exerting
a force on the desk,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.500
if I do it hard
enough, I might even

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500
get the desk to shake
or tilt a little bit.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.100
And I'm actually
doing that right now.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.060
But at the same time, you'll
see that your hand is getting

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.210
compressed, the palm of your
hand is being pressed down.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.040
And that's because
the desk is exerting

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.120
an equal and opposite
force on you.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.100
If it wasn't, you
actually wouldn't even

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.890
feel it, because you wouldn't
even feel the pressure.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.570
Your hand would be
completely uncompressed.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.020
Another example of that-- say
you're walking in the beach,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.280
and you have some
sand right here.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.450
If you were to step on the sand.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.880
So let's say that
this is your shoe.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.420
I'll do my best
attempt to draw a shoe.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.370
So this is the shoe.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.970
If you were to step on
the sand, clearly you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.340
are exerting a
force on the sand.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.120
The force that you're
exerting on the sand

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.870
is the force of your weight.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.520
The gravitational attraction
between you and the Earth.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.710
You are exerting
that on the sand.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.900
The sand is also-- and
another evidence of that

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.822
is that the sand is
going to be displaced.

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:41.280
You're going to
create a footprint.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.700
The sand is going to
move out of the way

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.510
because it's being
pushed down so hard.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.470
So clearly you are exerting
a force on the sand.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.070
But the sand is also exerting
an equal and opposite force

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.710
on you.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.490
 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.380
And what's the evidence of that?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.890
Well, if you believe,
Newton's second law--

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.930
if you have this
gravitational force on you,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.450
you should be
accelerating downwards

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.180
unless there is some other
force that balances it out.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.680
And the force that
balances it out

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.029
is the force that the beach,
or the sand is exerting on you

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.980
upwards.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.190
And so when you
net them out there

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.510
is a zero net force on you.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.350
And that's why you
get to stay there.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.500
Why you don't start
accelerating down

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.650
towards the center of the Earth.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.585
Other examples of this- this is
maybe the most famous example

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:37.240
of Newton's third law--
is just how rockets work.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.130
When you're in a
rocket, either trying

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.700
to escape the atmosphere,
or maybe you're in space,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.280
there's nothing to push off
of, nothing to push off,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.090
that lets you accelerate.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.400
So what you do is you keep stuff
to push off in your fuel tanks,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.090
and when you allow the
proper chemical reactions

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.860
or the proper combustion
to take place,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.390
what it does is it expels gases
at ultra high velocities out

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.500
the back of your rockets.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.450
And each of those
particles you're

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.954
exerting a force on them.

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:09.370
Enough force even though they're
super small mass for each

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.286
of them, they're going
at super high velocity.

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:14.040
So they're being
accelerated tremendously.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.010
So there's an equal
and opposite force

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.610
on the rocket, the thing that
is actually expelling the gas.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.120
And so that's what
allows a rocket

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.690
to accelerate even when there's
nothing in this direct vicinity

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.640
to push off of.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.210
It just expels a bunch
of things or accelerates

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.300
a bunch of things at
a super fast rate.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.740
It exerts a force on
all these particles,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.820
and that allows an
equal and opposite force

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.460
to accelerate the rocket ahead.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.580
And another example of
this is, if you ever

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.035
find yourself drifting in space.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:45.660
And this is an actually
useful example,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.280
so that you don't end up
drifting in space forever.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.330
Let's say, we don't ever
want this to happen.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.230
This astronaut,
by some chance he

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.840
loses his connection
to this little tool arm

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.600
right here in the space shuttle,
and he starts drifting away.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.330
What can that
astronaut do to change

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.150
the direction of his motion
so that he drifts back

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.830
to the space shuttle?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.390
Well you look around, there's
nothing to push off of.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.057
He doesn't have any
wall to push off of.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:16.098
Let's just assume he
doesn't have any rocket jets

00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:17.130
or anything like that.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.615
What could he do?

00:06:18.615 --> 00:06:19.990
Well the one thing
you could do--

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.510
and this is the situation if
you're ever drifting in space--

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.235
is you should find
the heaviest or I

00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:28.410
should say the most
massive thing on you--

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.330
and we'll explain the difference
between mass and weight

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.560
in a future video-- but
you should find the most

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.090
massive thing that you can
carry, that you can take off

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.580
of you, that you could throw.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.270
And you should throw it in a
direction opposite yourself.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.790
So let me put it this way.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.280
If I throw-- let's say I'm
in space and I'm floating.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.590
I'll make it look like the glove
of a-- so let's say that this

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.870
the glove of the astronaut.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.970
 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.580
There you go.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.290
That's his hand, that's
the astronaut's hand

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.500
right over here.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.320
And let's say he find some
piece of equipment on his,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.600
or she finds some piece
of equipment on them

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.470
that they can throw.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.150
They can take off
of their tool set.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.230
And they could find
the most massive object

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.009
that they could throw.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.300
So what's going to happen
is-- for some period of time,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.300
while they push
this object away,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.720
they will be exerting a force
on that object for some period

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.410
of time while they have
contact with the object.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.590
And that entire
time, that object,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.090
while it is accelerating--
while the astronaut is exerting

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.120
a force on it-- will be exerting
an equal and opposite force

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.740
on the hand of the astronaut,
or on the astronaut itself.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.600
So the object will
accelerate in that direction,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.230
and while the
astronaut is pushing,

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.910
the astronaut will
accelerate in this direction.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.190
So what you do is you throw
in the opposite direction

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.410
and that'll allow the astronaut
to accelerate towards the space

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.010
shuttle and hopefully
grab on to something.
