BUT BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, I WANT
TO KEEP IT 100, BUT I'M NOT

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:06.505 size:84% position:42% line:85%
GOING TO ANSWER A QUESTION.

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:08.408 line:91%
I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A QUICK
STATEMENT ABOUT THE RIOTS AND

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOTING GOING ON IN BALTIMORE
TODAY.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.812 line:91%
THERE'S A LOT OF ANGER AND A LOT
OF FRUSTRATION IN THE COMMUNITY

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.747 line:91%
OVER WHAT SEEMS TO BE A RASH OF
POLICE KILLING UNARMED BLACK

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.516 align:start position:0% line:85%
MEN.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.117 line:91%
BUT THE ANSWER IS NOT LOOTING
AND RIOTING OR RANDOM ACTS OF

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.653 align:start position:0% line:85%
VIOLENCE.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.155 line:91%
LET'S NOT FORGET, IT WAS ACTS OF
VIOLENCE THAT GOT US HERE IN THE

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.090 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIRST PLACE.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:27.393 line:91%
THE EVENTS ARE STILL UNFOLDING,
SO I CAN'T GET TOO SPECIFIC.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.796 line:91%
BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT I
KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHEN IT COMES

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.697 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO FREDDIE GRAY -- THIS IS NOT
THE WAY TO HONOR THIS YOUNG

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.499 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN'S LIFE, ESPECIALLY ON THE
DAY OF HIS FUNERAL.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:34.865 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOODNIGHTLY EVERYONE
