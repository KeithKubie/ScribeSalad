00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[James]: We're gonna talk about e!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.160
The big, famous constant, e! Okay, it's one of the famous mathematical constants,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.620
One of the most important, goes along with pi, and I don't know, golden ratio, and square root of two,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.800
Constants in maths that are the most important constants, and e is one of those constants.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.060
So e is an irrational number, and it's equal to... 2.718281828, something, something, ...

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.300
The problem with e, is it's not defined by geometry.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.180
Now pi, is a something that is defined by geometry, right, it's the ratio of a circle's circumference and it's diameter.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.100
And it's something the ancient Greeks knew about. And a lot of mathematical constants go back to the ancient Greeks,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800
but e is different. e is not based on a shape, it's not based on geometry.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.820
It's a mathematical constant that is related to growth, and rate of change, but why is it related to growth and rate of change?

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.760
So let's look at the original problem where e was first used.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.340
So we're going to go back to the seventeenth century, and this is Jacob Bernoulli, and he was interested in compound interest, so, earning interest on your money.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.980
So imagine you've got one pound in the bank. And you have a very generous bank and they're gonna offer you 100 percent interest every year.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.500
Wow, thanks alot, bank!

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.820
So, 100 percent interest, so it means after one year,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.240
you'll have two pounds.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.520
So you've earned one pound interest and you've got your original pound.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.900
So, you now have two pounds.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
What if I offered you instead fifty percent interest, every six months?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Now is that better or worse?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.860
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.560
Ok, you're starting with one pound and then I'm going to offer you fifty percent interest every six months.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.780
So after six months, you now have one pound, fifty

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.180
and then you wait another six months and you're earning fifty percent interest on your total,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.240
which is another seventy-five p.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
and you add that on to what you had so it's two pounds twenty-five

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.060
Better!

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.720
It's better. So what happens if I do this more regularly?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.180
What if I do it every month?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.800
I offer you one-twelfth interest every month

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.240
Is that better?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.140
So, let's think about that.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.180
So after the first month, it's gonna be multiplied by this.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.640
One plus one-twelfth.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.840
So one-twelfth, that's your interest and then you're adding that onto the original pound that you've got.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.160
So, you do that, that's your first month,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.280
then for your second month

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.040
you take that and multiply it again

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.060
by the same value.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
and your third month you would multiply it again,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.780
and again.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780
you actually do that twelve times in a year.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.980
So in a year,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320
you'd raise that to a power twelve,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.600
and you would get two pounds sixty-one.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.700
So it's actually better. In fact, the more frequent your interest is

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.200
the better the results.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.840
Let's start with every week. So if we do it for every week, how much better is that?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.780
What I'm saying is you're earning one over fifty two interest every week. And then after the end of the year

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.460
you got fifty two weeks and you would have two pounds sixty nine.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.060
So it's getting better and better and better.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.180
In general, you might be able to see a pattern happening here. In general it would look like this:

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.720
You'd be multiplying by one plus one over n, to the power n. Hopefully you can see that pattern happening.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.460
So here n is equal to twelve if you do it every month, fifty two if you do it every week.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.500
If you did it every day, it'd be one pound multiplied by [one plus] one over three hundred and sixty five

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.620
to the power three hundred and sixty five. And that's equal to two pounds, seventy one.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.660
Right, and so it would get better if you did it every second, or every nanosecond.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.560
What if I could do it continuously?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.520
Every instant I'm earning interest. Continuous interest. What does that look like?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.920
That means if I take this formula here

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.240
one plus one over n to the n, I'm gonna n tend to infinity.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.780
That would be continuous interest. Now what is that? What is that value?

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.240
And that's what Bernoulli wanted to know.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.100
He didn't work it out. He knew it was between two and three. So fifty years later, Euler worked it out.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.240
Euler, he works everything out.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560
[Brady]: Him or Gauss?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.180
[James]: It's either Euler or Gauss. Say Euler or Gauss, you're probably going to be right.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.020
And the value was 2.718281828459... and so on.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.540
[Brady]: We were pretty close when we were doing it daily, weren't we? It was already two seventy one at daily.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.040
[James]: You're right, You're right. We were getting closer, weren't we?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.560
We were getting close and closer to this value. So already we're quite close to it.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.020
If you did it forever though, of course you would have this irrational number.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.080
Now Euler called this e. He didn't name it after himself, although it is now known as the Euler constant.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.600
[Brady]: Why'd he call it e then?

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.440
[James]: It was just a letter. He might've used a, b, c, and d already for something else.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.000
Right? So you use the next one.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.580
[Brady]: Bit of a coincidence!

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.680
[James]: It's a lovely coincidence! I fully believe that he's not being a jerk here, naming it after himself.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.960
But it's a lovely coincidence that it's e for Euler's number.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.920
[Brady]: Would you have called it g if you discovered it?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.600
[James]: I would not have called it g. No, I would've hoped somebody else would've called it g

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.340
and then I would have accepted that.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.180
Euler proved that this was irrational.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.440
He found a formula for e which was a new formula. Not this one here, a different formula.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.000
And it showed that it was irrational. I'll quickly show you that.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.500
He found that e was equal to two plus one over

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:57.480
one plus one over two plus one over one plus one over one plus one over four plus one over one plus one over

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.320
one plus one over six... and this goes on forever.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.940
This is a fraction that goes on forever, continuous fraction. But you can see it goes on forever

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.520
Because there's a pattern, and that pattern does hold.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.660
You got two, one one four, one one six, one one eight.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.560
So you can see that pattern goes on forever, and if the fraction goes on forever

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.700
it means it's an irrational number.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.160
If it didn't go on forever, it would terminate, and if you terminate you can write it as a fraction.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.160
And he also worked out the value for e. He did it up to eighteen decimal places.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.580
To do that, he had a different formula to do that, I'll show you that one.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.240
And this time, he worked out e was equal to one plus

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.180
one over one factorial plus one over two factorial plus one over three factorial

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.400
plus one over four factorial... and this is something that's going on forever.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.780
It's a nice formula, if you're happy with factorials. Factorials means you're multiplying all the numbers

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.580
up to that value. So if it was four factorial, it'd be four times three times two times one.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.040
Okay, why is e a big deal? It's because e is the natural language of growth.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.660
And I'll show why. Okay, let's draw a graph y equals e to the x.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.560
So we're taking powers of e. So over here at zero, this would cross at one.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:21.860
So if you took a point on this graph, the value at that point is e to the power x.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.800
And this is why it's important. The gradient at that point, the gradient of the curve

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.860
at that point is e to the x. And the area under the curve which means the area under the curve

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.980
all the way down to minus infinity is e to the x.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.580
And it's the only function that has that property.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.520
So it has the same value, gradient, and area at every point along the line.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.920
So at one, the value is e because it's e to the power one. The value is 2.718, the gradient is 2.718

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.840
and the area under the curve is 2.718. The reason this is important then, because it's unique

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.780
in having this property as well, it becomes the natural language of calculus.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.840
And calculus is the maths of rate of change and growth and areas, maths like that.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:26.960
And if you're interested in those things, if you write it in terms of e, then the maths becomes much simpler.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.560
Because if you don't write it in terms of e, you get lots of nasty constants

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.400
and the maths is really messy. If you're trying to deliberately avoid using e,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.020
you're making it hard for yourself. It's the natural language of growth.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:49.700
And of course e is famous for bringing together all the famous mathematical constants with this formula,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:57.700
Euler's formula, which is e to the i pi plus one equals zero.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.500
So there we have all the big mathematical constants in one formula brought together.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:11.240
We've got e, we've got i, square root of minus one, we've got pi of course, we've got one and zero

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140
and they bring them all together in one formula

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.380
which is often voted as the most beautiful formula in mathematics.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.160
I've seen it so often, I'm kinda jaded to it, don't put that in the video.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.100
[Brady]: Sometimes here on Numberphile we can make more videos than we'd otherwise be able to
