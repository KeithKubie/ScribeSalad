00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.380
The government created the
following stem-and-leaf plot

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.200
showing the number of turtles at
each major zoo in the country.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.630
How many zoos have
fewer than 46 turtles?

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.900
So what the
stem-and-leaf plot does

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.150
is it gives us the first
digit in each number

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.600
and essentially you could
call this the tens place.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.100
And then it gives
us the ones place.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.570
So there was only one zoo
that had four turtles.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.130
So you could view this
as 0, 0, 4, or 4 turtles.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
Then everything here,
the tens place, is a 1.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.160
So this number right
here is really an 11.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.800
This is a 14.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.790
This right over
here would be a 16.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.510
That's a 16, and
so forth and so on.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.160
This would be 17, 18.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.350
All of this is 23.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.060
This is 23.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.660
This is 26 because we have our
tens place right over here.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.120
This is the first digit.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.350
So let's answer the question.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.940
How many zoos have
fewer than 46 turtles?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.670
So there are no zoos that
had 40 anything turtles.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.770
And so all of these zoos
here-- so all of these

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.990
had 30 something turtles,
these had 20 something turtles,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.519
these have in the teens,
this has single digits.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.190
So it's literally as many
zoos as we have listed here.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.164
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:19.610
17 zoos have fewer
than 46 turtles.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.700
Let's do another one.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.384
The buyer for a
chain of supermarkets

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.050
created the following
stem-and-leaf plot

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.060
showing the number of coconuts
at each of the stores.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.370
What was the smallest number
of coconuts at any one grocery

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.274
store?

00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:34.940
So the buyer for a
chain of supermarkets

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.606
created the following
stem-and-leaf plot

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:39.580
showing the number of coconuts
at each of the stores.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.750
So at any one grocery store
the smallest number-- well,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.710
that's this one right over here.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.835
And remember, it's not two.

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.501
We have our tens
places right over here.

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:48.100
It's a one.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.516
So this right over
here represents

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:51.380
12 coconuts at that store.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.940
So we'll put 12 right over here.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.770
Let's try another one.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.344
A statistician for a
chain of department stores

00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.010
created the following
stem-and-leaf plot

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.950
showing the number of watches
at each of the stores.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.830
How many department stores
have exactly seven watches?

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.210
Well that's only this one
right over here-- 07 watches.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.770
This one, this, this,
and that one are not 7.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.910
This is representing 17
because it's in the row with 1

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.950
at the beginning.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.560
This right over
here represents 27

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.730
because it's in the row
with the 2 at the beginning.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.100
So there's only one store that
has exactly seven watches.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.890
Let's do one more.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.390
This is kind of fun.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.910
A zookeeper created the
following stem-and-leaf plot

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.520
showing the number of tigers at
each major zoo in the country.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.790
How many zoos have
more than 24 tigers?

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.840
So we can ignore the
zeros and the teens

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.110
and we get in the 20s.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.200
This is 25.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.460
So that meets the criteria.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.880
And then you go to 28, 29.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.810
So all of these in the 30s and
all of these right over here.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.720
This 3, 0-- this
doesn't mean 0 tigers.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.870
This is 30 tigers.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.520
This is 40 tigers.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.480
So we count 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.420
zoos have more than 24 tigers.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.650
9 zoos.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.400
And we're done.
