00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The answer that I got is 42.98 and that's in degrees.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can see this is very close to the 43 degrees that we saw before but there actually

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
some rounding errors going on here--so this is a more precised answer.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The angle whose tangent is 0.932 is 42.98 degrees.
