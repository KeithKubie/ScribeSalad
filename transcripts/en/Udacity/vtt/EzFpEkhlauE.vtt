00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.794
Just to quickly recap, what is the definition

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:05.897
of a non-parametric test? A non-parametric test is

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:08.381
a statistical test that assumes the data is

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:12.474
drawn from a non-parametric probability distribution? Assumes the

00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:15.925
data is drawn from a non-Gaussian probability distribution?

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:17.785
Does not assume the data is drawn from

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.840
any particular underlying probability distribution? Or is the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.620
same as Welch's t-test? Check the correct answer.
