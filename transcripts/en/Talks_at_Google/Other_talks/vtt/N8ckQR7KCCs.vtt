00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:03.760
DR. JORDAN METZL:
It's a pleasure

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.360
to be back again to speak to
you all about the medicine

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.100
of exercise.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.590
And there were a
couple things that

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.423
made me psyched about
coming back to Google.

00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:13.190
A, I take care of
a lot of you guys,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.620
and you're always just
a pleasure to be around

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.450
and to see.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.856
B, the ice cream truck.

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:20.730
I was like, dude, I love
the ice cream truck.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.809
Is that still here?

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.760
DR. JORDAN METZL: All right.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.050
Good.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.925
I was like, all right,
definitely I'm coming,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.050
and I'm coming for the ice
cream truck, among other things.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.850
So what I'm here to do today is
to talk about something which

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.080
intuitively makes
a lot of sense.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.180
You guys are great at
addressing problems,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.620
and I want to talk to
you about a problem

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.804
of the next decade, two decades.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:46.220
And I want you to
think about what

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.110
I'm saying not only from
a medical point of view

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.443
but from a policy point of view.

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.810
Because I think what you've done
is given the world the ability

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.890
to communicate in so
many different ways here,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.640
and so I want you
to put your brains

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.015
to the problem I'm going
to throw at you today,

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.310
which is some of the problems
we're going to be facing

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.610
and we're going to be
facing the next 10, 20, 30

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.910
years going forward.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.969
A couple things just about me.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.260
I'm going to talk about the
medicine of exercise today.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.780
I have a website here.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780
I have a signup, if you're
interested in getting

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.321
our newsletters on
preventive health,

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:16.120
and I send out
about four a year.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.830
Also I'm pretty
active in Twitter

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.000
and send out different
information on that.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.920
What I'm here to tell
you guys and what

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.165
I'm going to be pushing today
is what we call get off your,

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:31.990
I guess, couch, we'll say,
get off your couch medicine.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.600
You guys are going to help
me get this message out

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.492
on the importance of activity
and exercise as a medicine.

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:41.450
And it's an interesting
kind of paradigm shift.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.300
"The Exercise Cure" is
a book which, I think,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.225
really it was an interesting
way to pitch this.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.100
I did it with Rodale.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.444
Because the "Home Remedies" book
was very successful and kind

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.610
of, all right, I'm a runner,
and I have a hurt knee,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.810
and I need to do these
exercises to fix my knee.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.830
This is a conceptual book
about looking and changing

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.890
the way people think
about exercise.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.720
I gave a lecture last
month at Cornell Med School

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.590
to the second year med
students on exercise.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.229
Now you'd think that this
being, as I'll go through,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.652
a very powerful
drug people would

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:12.860
hear about this all the time.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.750
In the 200-plus history of
Cornell Med School, that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.147
was the first lecture they'd
ever had on exercise ever.

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:21.980
As I'll talk about, the
whole medical system

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.870
is set up to treat disease,
and it's very poorly

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.450
set up to encourage wellness.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.380
And so number one
is-- and I want

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.040
to make sure that nobody
in your guys' world

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.980
is this person who is basically
so focused on whatever

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.240
it is they're doing
they're not moving.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.450
And the concept here is
that across the spectrum

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.970
of the human condition there's
no more powerful, potent,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.650
and effective medicine
than exercise.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.699
And so I'm just going
to go through relatively

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:49.740
quickly some information.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.940
This study published this
year just a couple months ago

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.314
in a journal called
"Circulation"

00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:55.460
from the American
Heart Association,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.310
looking at men greater
than 45 years of age,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.040
a prospective study, which
is the best kind in medicine,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.990
looking at the effects of heart
failure and what causes that.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.160
And not surprisingly,
sitting around on your butt

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.087
all the time and not
moving correlates

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.920
to a much higher incidence
of heart failure.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.378
So it's not good for your heart,
and this is the number one

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:13.950
killer in the United States.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.580
Now the concept of movement
for activity and for health

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.000
and for just a better
balanced life is nothing new.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.800
The ancient Greeks
and the ancient Romans

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.270
knew that to be sound in mind
and body those things work

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.770
together.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.514
So the concept of dumb jock,
it's not really true, in fact.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.680
In fact, even from the high
school and middle school

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.840
levels, people who are
active and involved in sports

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.880
have everything from higher
self-esteem to higher health

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.088
profiles as they go into
adolescence and young adult.

00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:40.602
So basically activity is
something that starts young.

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:42.560
We do a lot of preventive
strengthening classes

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.140
with kids, and getting kids
interested and involved

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.590
in athletics at a
young age it correlates

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.111
to a number of good
things as they go forward.

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.860
So there's a big study
published last year

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.680
in the "Journal of American
Medical Association,"

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.570
called "JAMA," and in
this study they looked

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.257
at the anatomy of the
health care system.

00:03:58.257 --> 00:03:59.090
Now a couple things.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.070
Number one, we've more
than doubled the money

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.650
we're spending as
a product of GDP.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.810
We spend about 18% of our GDP,
about $2.7 to $2.8 trillion

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.582
a year.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.040
Just to put that
in context, that's

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.830
more than the GDP of most
every country in the world,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.130
so it's a lot of money we're
spending on health care.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.579
Government funding has
increased to about 42%

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.370
of health care costs,
about $325 billion of which

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.520
are spent on
prescription medications.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.350
And surprisingly
people think that it's

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.950
old people that cost the system
money, but it's really not.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.880
It's overweight
people, inactive people

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.416
cost the system by
far the most money.

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:37.540
And it's also young people.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.390
So 85% of the medical
costs are under 65,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.480
and a large majority
of that, about 60%,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.600
are related to the effects
of inactivity, obesity,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.760
heart disease, diabetes, et
cetera, so 65% of that spending

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.260
costs.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.810
So basically, our
country needs to move.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.640
And as we'll get talking
about technology,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.280
you guys have been
helpful in starting

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.910
to get different apps and
things that encourage and track

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.630
movement.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.450
I want to bring those
into the discussion

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.734
on encouraging
movement as policy.

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:07.150
So we have this
health care system

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.910
which throws huge amounts of
money at disease treatment.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.120
The concept is that basically
the worse the medical problem

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.240
the more the system pays.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.906
So if you're somebody
that goes into see

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:20.132
or your parents go see
somebody for their heart exam

00:05:20.132 --> 00:05:22.590
and the doctor says, all right,
you should exercise and eat

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.580
well, that's a
normal office visit.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.830
But if you're put on
medication, then somebody

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.930
in some drug company
somewhere in New Jersey

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.330
is going to make a profit.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.670
If you have an
echocardiogram or an EKG

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.914
or a catheterization, the
more things that are done,

00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:37.955
the more the system is
reimbursed, all the way up

00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:39.050
to open heart surgery.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.780
And so the system is basically
financially incentivizing

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.140
disease, and it's for every
disease, every problem.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.050
And wellness, which
makes the most sense

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.490
that we should be thinking
about encouraging,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.550
really isn't incentivized
in the same way disease is.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.000
And so we basically
wait until it's broken.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.800
And so the concept
I've been pushing

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.810
is getting America to go.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.980
Now this is the United States
on the far left-hand side

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.139
the graph here.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.430
Every other Western country
averaged out is in the red.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.040
So we're spending more
than double every country

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.300
in the world on health
care expenditure.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.220
So with that, I
would think we would

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.330
have the healthiest country
in the world, right?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.180
How about 28th in
life expectancy?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.150
So we're spending more
than double everybody,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.000
we're ranked 28th
in life expectancy,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.356
and we're just throwing
money at this problem.

00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:29.730
And even all these different
discussions about Affordable

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.410
Care, et cetera, are a lot about
reducing spending in some way,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.070
but they're not
about the main issue,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.640
in my opinion, which is
preventing disease, which

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.620
is what we're really
not focusing on.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.750
This is the United
States in 1985.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.550
States reporting less than
10% obesity are in light blue,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.010
10% to 15% are in
the darker blue.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.490
And let's look what happened,
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.364
'91-- now 15% to 19%
obesity-- '92, '93,

00:06:56.364 --> 00:07:01.980
'94, '95, '96, '97-- now
greater than 20% obesity-- '98,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.050
'99, 2000, 2001-- greater
than 25% obesity-- 2002,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.540
2003, 2004, 2005--
greater than 30%

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.110
obesity-- 2006,
2007, 2008, 2009.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.100
So basically, if you want to
be skinny move to Colorado

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.010
is the answer here.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.890
But we have this
kind of growing issue

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.940
of the cost of inactivity
in our society.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.040
And as much as I love all the
computer-based everything,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.250
it basically is another way
where people sit at home

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.000
and do whatever.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.780
So getting people up and moving
is a huge piece, I think,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.140
of the equation of
fixing the problem.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.900
So I'm going to talk
to you guys about what

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.160
you can do individually,
what you can do as a company,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.535
and what I think we can start
thinking about as a society

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:51.210
to try and deal with some of
these issues as we go forth.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.080
So what you can do as an
individual is find something

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.830
you like to do.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.830
If you like to bike in a
group, bike in a group.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.871
If you like to go run in
a group, run in a group.

00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.450
If you're somebody
that says, listen,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.230
I'm so stressed out
at my place and I

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.350
want to go run by
myself, that's fine too.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.007
Whatever it is that
will motivate you,

00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:07.090
that's what you got to do.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.757
So number one is
finding a way to do it.

00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:11.173
And I'm going to talk about
New York City is a great place

00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:13.405
to do that, because we
have a great opportunity

00:08:13.405 --> 00:08:16.240
to increase what's called
our NEAT profiles here.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.819
Now I think nothing
is as helpful as some

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.235
of the different people I see
in my life and take care of.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:24.192
I met a guy yesterday
who I'd seen about three

00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:26.650
months before who'd had really
bad back pain and knee pain,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.210
and he'd gotten opinions
about getting surgery

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.270
on different stuff.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.669
And I said, listen, you are
getting a lot of this problem

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.450
because you're just
completely inactive.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.490
And if you want to see
somebody's torn meniscus,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.429
get an MRI.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.200
If you want to see their
herniated disc, get an MRI.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.960
As technology has improved, the
quality of pictures, about half

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.460
of you in this room have a torn
meniscus or a herniated disc

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.740
in your back that you
don't even know about

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.640
and I don't care about because
it's not bothering you.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.990
But the problem is if you start
getting tests things start

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.573
showing up, and then
people get things

00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:57.120
done based on those findings,
and it's not good for people.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.411
This guy, we just got him
working on some strengthening

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:01.570
and exercise stuff, and
I saw him yesterday.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.680
He's doing great.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.630
I think that puts a lot of these
things in a better context.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.210
Because somebody like that that
shows up at a psychiatrist's

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.750
office is probably going
to put on some kind

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.910
of antidepressant medication,
in a cardiologist's office

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.493
some kind of blood
pressure medication

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:16.170
or cholesterol-lowering
medication.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.920
And there's a lot of medicines.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.840
We live in this society where
if you're having sleep problems

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.617
your immediate thought is open
the window and that butterfly

00:09:23.617 --> 00:09:25.200
is going to fly and
land on your head,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.616
and you're going have the best
night's sleep of your life.

00:09:27.616 --> 00:09:29.360
Or if you're having
erectile dysfunction,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.380
you just take this medicine.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.213
You can throw the
football through the tire,

00:09:32.213 --> 00:09:34.550
and life is great
and life is perfect.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.940
The problem is these
medicines cost a lot of money,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.460
they have a lot of side
effects, and they're

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.730
often not the best
first-line treatment.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.955
So getting doctors and
health care professionals

00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:46.360
to start thinking about
prescribing exercise

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.996
is a big part of the mission
of what I'm after with this.

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:49.870
And it's interesting.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.080
As I mentioned, there's
not a lot of movement

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.663
or there hasn't been
a lot of movement

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:55.950
traditionally in that
direction, despite the fact

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.122
that we had great evidence
on the role of exercise

00:09:59.122 --> 00:10:00.580
for a number of
different problems.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.746
So what I've tried to do
in "Exercise Cure" is start

00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:05.007
with the brain and go down
and look at, all right,

00:10:05.007 --> 00:10:07.090
what's the best study for
depression and exercise?

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.730
There's a big study
done in Norway

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.532
where they took one group of
people in a prospective study

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:13.740
and they looked at their
symptoms of mild to moderate

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.820
depression with
exercise versus drugs,

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.950
and the exercise
guys did better.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.050
So things like anxiety, sleep
problems, self-esteem, memory--

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.707
exercise is the only
drug which works

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.540
for Alzheimer's and
dementia, the only drug.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.740
Despite the billions
of dollars that

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.323
have been put towards research,
it's the only drug that works.

00:10:30.323 --> 00:10:32.970
So I think there's a
lot of information that

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.187
needs to get out on
this, and part of that

00:10:35.187 --> 00:10:37.270
definitely starts with the
health care profession,

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.680
so trying to get physicians and
nurses and nurse practitioners

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.880
to start thinking about
prescribing exercise

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.690
as part of what
they do and trying

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.040
to get wellness programs to
move outside of the realm

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.380
of companies, which are great,
and into the realm of insurance

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.319
companies.

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:53.360
Incentivizing, which I'll
talk about in a second,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.950
is something which is part of
the policy discussion, which

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.950
I think really definitely
needs to happen.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.989
Unfortunately, less
than a third of doctors

00:10:59.989 --> 00:11:02.280
talk to their patients about
exercise, and those who do

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.571
don't really know how to do it.

00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:05.330
So in the second half
of "Exercise Cure,"

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.329
I've talked about how to
set up fitness programs

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:08.720
at home for yourselves.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.560
And that's important for
docs, because they just

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.852
say exercise a half hour a day.

00:11:12.852 --> 00:11:14.268
Well, all right,
that sounds good.

00:11:14.268 --> 00:11:14.860
What do I do?

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.049
How do I do that?

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:17.465
That's been a neat
space with some

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:19.881
of the different great new
apps about setting up programs,

00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:22.710
by the way, too, which I love,
and that's exciting as well.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.010
Nutrition.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.400
Nutrition is part of the deal.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.830
So I have in both my
books some information

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.470
at the back on nutrition.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.470
I'm more about exercise.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.865
I think the data on exercise
is far more compelling

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:35.240
than it is straight
on nutrition.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.680
So I think what you eat
makes a difference for sure,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.450
but after this
talk you are going

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.200
to see me hit the ice
cream cart for sure.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.150
And I'm going to do that because
I worked out this morning

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.480
and I like ice cream.

00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:49.920
I'm an absolutist when
it comes exercise.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.753
I'm not an absolutist
when it comes to food.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.800
I feel like you can drive
yourself nuts with food,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.067
and many people do.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:11:58.150
And I think to me the
health benefits, by the way,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.550
of exercise trump mild
to moderate obesity.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.980
I'd much rather you be mild
to moderately overweight

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.810
and exercising every
day than super skinny

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.420
and not exercising at all.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.630
So the concept of what drug
works for everything from some

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.280
of the brain issues
I talked about,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.380
reduction in the frequency
of the common cold,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.910
reduction of blood pressure,
reduction of cholesterol

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.710
levels, treatment of diabetes,
treatment and prevention

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.320
of osteoarthritis
and osteoporosis,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.070
even certain types of
cancer, particularly

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.670
colon cancer, which is about
40% less common in people who

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.100
exercise four to five
times a week is exercise.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.930
So this is definitely
a medicine.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.680
And you can think
about it in everything

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.570
from the kind of
life people live

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.261
to the duration of
life people live.

00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:42.510
Every hour you put in of
exercise-- and because you're

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.300
exercising, you live longer--
correlates to about five

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.950
and a half hours
of life expectancy

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.991
if you're going vigorous.

00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:50.530
By the way, I'm a big
fan of vigorous activity.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.000
So if you have a
half hour-- and I

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.890
talk about the different
zones of exertion.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.430
Zone one is what I'm in
right now, just talking,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.230
and you could exercise and walk.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.420
Zone two is when it's a
little bit uncomfortable,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.503
and zone three is when
you're huffing and puffing,

00:13:03.503 --> 00:13:05.485
like Sunday you'll be
in zone three some.

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.060
You'll be in zone
three some Sunday.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.460
So I want people to
be for their workouts

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.650
about 25% in zone three, 25% in
zone two and 50% in zone one.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.405
So if you're just going for
a slow jog, that's great,

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:19.320
or a slow walk, that's fine.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.170
But try and push your zones
up for at least a quarter

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.120
of every workout up to
zone three, if you can.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.870
Not only does it help
profuse your organs,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.750
like your brain et cetera,
it's just generally much better

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.250
for your heart
muscle, which is also

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.740
a muscle that needs
to be exercised.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.151
And since women live longer,
exercise has very favorable--

00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:38.650
but again, it's the
intensity, which

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.720
is a big piece of this, in terms
of looking at what that means.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.420
This was a big study that
was published this past year

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.215
in the "British Medical
Journal" and got a lot of play

00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:47.740
in the media.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.073
It actually came out of the
week before my book came out

00:13:50.073 --> 00:13:51.710
in December, which
I didn't even know.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.600
But I was like, wow,
that was good luck.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.260
And what these guys
did is they looked

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.700
at basically 16 meta-analyses,
four on exercise

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.560
and 12 on drug trials,
looking at four conditions,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.510
prevention of coronary
artery disease,

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.279
prevention of diabetes,
rehabilitation of stroke,

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.570
and treatment of heart failure.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.060
And they compared exercise
to drugs, all right?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.040
Straight comparisons,
exercise to drugs.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.490
What they found was in about
almost 400,000 participants

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.299
there was no difference
in exercise versus drug

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:22.590
groups in the prevention of
heart disease and diabetes.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.360
What that means is that
all these people that

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.735
go to their doctor,
all right, go

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:29.460
take Crestor, Lipitor, whatever
it is as part of what you're

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.260
doing in a preventive
way, exercise

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.650
was just as effective with much
less cost and much less side

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.150
effect.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.680
I see every week 200, 300
people in my office coming

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.340
in with Lipitor or
Crestor-induced myalgia.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.550
Their muscles are super sore.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.780
Their joints get achy
because of these medicines.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.370
There is no such thing
as a perfectly safe drug.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.720
Even the Tylenol you
get at CVS or the Advil

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.140
you get at the bodega around
the corner has a side effect.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.890
Now normally that
doesn't cause a problem,

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.340
but there's no such thing
as a perfectly safe drug.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.055
The only drug, basically, with
no side effects is this one.

00:15:00.055 --> 00:15:01.830
And it was more
effective than medicine

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.746
in the treatment of stroke
but was less effective

00:15:04.746 --> 00:15:06.620
than drugs in the
treatment of heart failure.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.060
So I'm not anti
Western medicine.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.371
I'm pro getting doctors
and health professionals

00:15:11.371 --> 00:15:13.870
to start thinking about this
as part of the paradigm of what

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.040
they do when they see people.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.230
Now part of what I
do is to keep people

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.482
from doing stupid things.

00:15:19.482 --> 00:15:21.440
So if you show up in my
office and you're like,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.300
I'm on the Google Running
Team, which is a great group.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.886
I'm going to run the marathon,
but it's two months away,

00:15:26.886 --> 00:15:28.010
and I've not done anything.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.480
I'm like, dude, that's
not a very good idea.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.910
So part of what I do
is encouraging people

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.800
to do smart things
in a smart way.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.690
I see some of you recognize
yourselves in that comment.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.470
So looking at the
CDC here, the CDC

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.190
did a big all-cause
morbidity study in 2000

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.340
looking at what gets
people sick and ill.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.280
And people think, oh,
it's just my genetics.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.890
Genetics are about 20%
of their conclusion.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.990
The biggest factor was basically
exercise, smoking, and diet,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.539
which are the big factors which
seem to affect how people-- I'm

00:15:58.539 --> 00:15:59.830
just going to say it right now.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.410
I'm a big fan of
former Mayor Bloomberg.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.993
You look at some of
the things he did,

00:16:02.993 --> 00:16:05.700
including getting smoking out
of a lot of places in New York

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.210
City, getting bike
lanes in place

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.660
for people to start
moving around,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.076
starting to talk
about restricting

00:16:10.076 --> 00:16:12.544
different kinds of
foods, big sugary foods,

00:16:12.544 --> 00:16:14.210
as part of the thing,
I think that makes

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.410
a ton of sense from
this equation of what

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.180
are some things to
start to think about,

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.470
particularly because
of the following thing.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.660
If you were inactive in your 60s
in this red line on the left,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.790
you have a higher
chance of dying

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.882
than if you're very
active in your mid 80s.

00:16:30.882 --> 00:16:33.090
Pretty impressive, and so
if you think about it, also

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.631
for the treatment
of disease as well.

00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:37.460
So basically the important
thing about all this

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.720
is that we want
people to be active,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.127
and we want to in our
health care system

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.710
keep them out of
this kind of end zone

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.480
where they're having
a really tough time.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.563
We want to keep them active
until the last-- I had

00:16:47.563 --> 00:16:49.870
an 82-year-old lady run
the marathon this year,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.930
and I think goal setting
is a big piece of that

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.520
as well as some of the stuff
to think about in terms

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.970
of what you want to do.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.730
And the goal is to basically
die young as late as possible.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.670
I made the comment before
about fitness versus fatness.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.339
And again, I would much rather
you be overweight and active

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.660
than skinny and inactive.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.030
The benefits of
health and exercise

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.760
kick in not with your
body shape or size.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.339
It has to do with
what you're doing.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.390
And so it's better be fat and
fit than skinny and unfit.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.140
Low levels of fitness is
a much bigger risk factor

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.109
than it is activity.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.607
So it's what you're doing
that becomes the key thing.

00:17:25.607 --> 00:17:27.940
And you're going to be hearing
a lot more of this coming

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.720
up in the next five years or so,
something called interleukin 6.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.719
So interleukins basically
tell cells what to do.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.260
They're kind of like
the quarterbacks

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.510
of telling different
cells what to do.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.350
Interleukin 6 is
made in two places.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.600
It's made in your muscles,
and it's made in your fats.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.400
If you're sitting around
not doing anything,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.750
your fat makes IL-6, which
is pro-inflammatory so pretty

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.536
much every chronic disease
we see, asthma, arthritis,

00:17:53.536 --> 00:17:55.160
you name it, most
every chronic disease

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.250
is affected by levels of
circulating inflammation.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.339
And when you're making this fat
IL-6, it's a pro-inflammatory.

00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:03.130
So you basically get
these increased levels

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:06.030
of different markers of
general body inflammation.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.190
When IL-6 is made by muscle, it
has the exact opposite effect.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.820
It basically is completely
anti-inflammatory.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.610
So the idea here is that
chronic disease is basically

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.280
prevented and treated with
higher circulating IL-6

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.600
from muscle.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.140
And so we're just discovering
this and applying this.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.300
That's why things like colon
cancer or things that might not

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.900
make a lot of sense-- why would
I exercise and that would help

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.566
that?-- I think there's a lot of
chronic disease models that are

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:35.059
to be affected by this concept
of IL-6 as we go forth.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.100
You'll hear more about
this in the years to come.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.683
But it's a super
interesting, I think,

00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:41.000
field that we're
just recognizing

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.230
the benefits of this
beyond the scope of it just

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.021
makes me feel good.

00:18:45.021 --> 00:18:45.520
All right.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.420
So by this point of my talk,
you're like, all right, dude,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:48.920
I got it.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.057
Exercise is good for me.

00:18:50.057 --> 00:18:50.890
That's why I'm here.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.000
That's why I came to hear
you in the first place.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.540
I got it.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.160
All right.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.660
Good.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.750
So now the question is, how
do I put this into my life?

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.650
I get it.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.410
I should do it.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.230
How do I do it,
and how do I make

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.589
my parents, who are
home in Indiana, do it?

00:19:03.589 --> 00:19:06.130
Because I'm doing it here in
New York City, but they're home,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.500
and they're sitting around
watching TV every night.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.440
How do they do it?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.380
And so that's where we're
going to talk about next.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.630
So basically what I did in the
second half of "Exercise Cure"

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.350
is to divide up fitness levels
into bronze, silver, and gold,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.660
meaning inactive, moderately
active, and very active.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.070
And here are some formulas
for all those guys.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.040
So my bronze level guys are
people who don't do anything.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.070
Show of hands.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.410
Who here has a FuelBelt
or a Jawbone or something

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.490
like that on their
wrist or person?

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.240
One, two, three, four,
five, six of you guys.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.920
I think that's
been really great.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.480
I think it helps
keep people honest.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.490
I don't know if you've
had that experience,

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:42.482
but all of a sudden
you're like all right,

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:44.650
I took this number of steps
today, I got to do more,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.510
or I took this number of
steps today, I got to do more.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.040
And I think that's been really
great for my bronze guys

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.960
in trying to give you a
goal and a social network,

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.280
that, listen, all right,
my sister in Toledo

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.610
she took this amount of steps.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.650
I want to keep up with her.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.108
And that's been
very helpful, and I

00:19:58.108 --> 00:19:59.942
think we'll see more
of that as we go forth.

00:19:59.942 --> 00:20:01.400
I want you to think
about something

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.860
which you guys do
great at Google.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.720
You guys still have the
scooters here and everything?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.219
All right.

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:07.110
So what you guys
do here at Google

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.900
is you're actively
increasing your NEAT profile.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.020
What's that?

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.890
Non Exercise Active
Thermogenesis,

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.992
or just burning calories
from cruising around.

00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:18.450
Every time you
scooter up and down,

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.280
go up and down the
pole-- you guys got

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.970
that pole thing,
the slide thing?

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.837
Is that still here?

00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:24.670
All right, cool-- you
do that kind of stuff,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.390
you're increasing
your NEAT profile.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.300
And as you do that, you're just
basically burning calories.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.500
What that does is think
about that first slide

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.410
I showed you from that
journal "Circulation."

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.190
You're reducing your
risk of chronic disease.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.330
I think of it this way.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.820
Basically, we had this
huge public health campaign

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.840
against smoking, because
smoking was correlated

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.230
to all kinds of things,
heart disease, diabetes,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.950
certain types of cancer.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.855
Sitting is a new smoking.

00:20:49.855 --> 00:20:50.577
All right?

00:20:50.577 --> 00:20:52.160
Straight up, sitting
is a new smoking.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.070
Inactivity and the health
problems from inactivity

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.880
are almost identical
to the health problems

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.780
from smoking,
which is why I want

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.996
to get going on public
health campaigns

00:21:01.996 --> 00:21:03.870
to encourage activity
much in the way we used

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.390
those same things to get
rid of many of the smokers

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.190
we used to see, because the
profiles are almost identical.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.990
Silver workouters,
we have to start

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.010
thinking about increasing
your kinetic chain.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.468
And then golds are
the guys who are

00:21:15.468 --> 00:21:16.900
going to come to
class on Sunday,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.990
and I'll talk about
some of the stuff

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.780
you can do online
on your own at home

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.782
to start building
your gold profile.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:23.770
All right.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.730
So what's our
current system doing?

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.160
Some health care
companies, some companies

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.350
give you a discount
if you join a gym.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.060
That's great.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.544
But all right, so
you join a gym.

00:21:33.544 --> 00:21:34.960
Does that mean
you're going to go?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.520
I don't know.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.070
The truth is less than 5%
of Americans are active.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.350
There was a big study published
of 11 different studies 2012,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.050
2013.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.860
Motivation came
through incentives.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.484
If we incentivize people
to move, they moved.

00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:53.900
This is the best study I'm
going to show you in this talk.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.824
This guy published in "JAMA,"
and he's got a dual appointment

00:21:56.824 --> 00:21:58.240
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.520
He's at Wharton and
at the Medical School.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.710
And his whole thing is
looking at financial models

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.470
to incentivize behavior.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.430
And he took 56 guys who
were very overweight.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.340
Now they were between
the ages of 40 and 60.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.390
The truth is if you want
to get either gender

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.190
to change what
they're doing, try

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.690
getting a guy to
change his behavior?

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.330
Good luck.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.830
All right?

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.400
So baseline, it's tough to get
guys to change their behavior.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:22.899
Fair?

00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:23.690
Fair.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.677
Now in that we had
these guys that

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:27.260
had these really
unhealthy health care

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.750
behaviors for a long time.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.500
They were very sedentary.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.200
And what he did was he set up a
model where basically everybody

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.500
got the same intake
information, diet and exercise.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.110
Now in that, one group they
were weighed every week

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.000
for 16 weeks, and
that's all they got.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.640
One group, he said, listen,
if you lose a pound a week

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.070
for 16 weeks, we're going
to give you $5 a week.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.950
And one group said,
you're going to come in,

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.800
we're going to weigh
you once a week,

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.610
and you get a scratch-off,
like a lottery.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.568
And if you basically are
at your target weight,

00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:58.180
if you lost a pound
a week, then you

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:58.960
win what's underneath the thing.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.335
It was everything
from $5 to $50.

00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:02.820
So some weeks you do good,
and some weeks you do bad.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.914
At the end of four months, the
guys that got the information

00:23:05.914 --> 00:23:07.330
but didn't get
anything else, they

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.840
were just weighed,
exactly the same weight.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.620
Both the financial models lost
on average about 17 pounds,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.960
and everybody made
their target goal.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.350
Now the average diabetic
who has diabetes

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.790
because they're overweight and
takes insulin cost about $350

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.724
per month on medicine.

00:23:24.724 --> 00:23:26.140
These guys were
paid at an average

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.520
of $250 over a four-month
period of time.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.669
It doesn't take much money.

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:31.460
It just takes a little
incentive structure.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.570
So different companies are
doing different things,

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.710
everything from using--

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:35.751
Some of you have Fitbits.

00:23:35.751 --> 00:23:37.360
If you join Humana
Insurance, they

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.360
have this Vitality program
where you can sign up

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.122
for the Vitality program
and you get a Fitbit.

00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:44.330
Then they calculate what's
called your Vitality score

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.380
and your Vitality age.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.920
So you're 35, and your
health care behavior is such

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.496
that you may be only
31, or you may be 40.

00:23:52.496 --> 00:23:53.870
And they calculate
how many steps

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.090
you need per day and per week.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.820
And if you meet
your target goals,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.780
you pay a little bit less in
your health insurance premium.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.665
Because why should you
pay more than somebody

00:24:01.665 --> 00:24:02.790
else who's really inactive?

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:03.610
It doesn't make any sense.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.200
Plus it'll incentivize
you to do more.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.350
So there's a lot we're going
to be seeing in this space

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.130
to encourage people
to do the right thing.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.479
And we do it already.

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:13.520
Why do people buy houses?

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.820
And why do people do
all kinds of things?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.750
We incentivize marriage
and having kids

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.600
and going into
debt in some ways.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.090
So our system
already incentivizes

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.366
all these behaviors.

00:24:22.366 --> 00:24:24.240
We're spending so much
money on this problem,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.000
we should be incentivizing
activity and wellness.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.700
And so that's I think that is.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.100
So with you, your baseline note
for you and for your parents

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.780
is I need 150 minutes
a week of exercise.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.640
All right?

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.544
Everything beyond that's gravy.

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.960
30 minutes a day, 150 minutes
a week, that's what we need.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.280
And so let's talk
about our bronze guys.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.321
Our bronze guys are guys
that are sitting around.

00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.450
We want them to increase
their NEAT profile,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.110
meaning we want
them to just burn

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.640
more calories
throughout the day.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.730
As we get to our
silvers, we start

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.980
thinking about now
increasing their strength

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.700
and their cardio.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.940
So as I get to my silvers, I
start thinking about increasing

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.060
what's called your
kinetic chain.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.270
If you're active
here or if you've

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.710
been to see me at some point
or have been to my classes,

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.126
you hopefully woke
up this morning

00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:12.270
and said I love
my kinetic chain.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.490
If you didn't,
think about it now.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.650
I love my kinetic chain.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:15.890
All right.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.820
That sounds good, dude, but
what's the kinetic chain?

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.486
The kinetic chain is
how all the muscles

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:21.720
are connected in the
body, tip to toe.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.050
And for a kinetic chain to
work, it needs to be flexible

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.240
and it needs to be strong.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.120
So if you come in to see me with
an achy knee or an achy shin

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.030
or an achy hamstring, what
I'm going to tell you is--

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.540
or a herniated disc in your
back or whatever it is--

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.860
I can't fix your anatomy.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.860
If you have some arthritis
in your knee, you do.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.950
If you have a
herniated disc, you do.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.680
But if you make your
kinetic chain more

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.030
effective through strength
training and flexibility,

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.640
those things are going
to feel a ton better.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.740
So number one,
flexibility, huge fan.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.111
Who here owns a foam roller?

00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:53.610
Good.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.109
All right.

00:25:54.109 --> 00:25:57.884
So hopefully not only do you
own it but you're using it,

00:25:57.884 --> 00:25:59.550
which is the other
part about having it.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.830
Sometimes people just
have it, and it's

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.420
like a clothes
stand in the corner.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:08.040
And so what I say is using
this roller is hugely valuable.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.760
In both this book and in
the "Home Remedies" book,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.597
I have a full foam
roller workout to do,

00:26:12.597 --> 00:26:14.180
and you can kind of
see that in there,

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.720
what to do with your
roller so it's not just

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.890
sitting in the corner.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:17.654
I say every day.

00:26:17.654 --> 00:26:20.070
But realistically, three times
a week for about 15 minutes

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.240
will really help
your flexibility.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.560
The other piece is strength.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.290
So these functional strength
training classes are a blast.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.250
If your i-whatever
device is close to you,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.960
if you just yank it out and
text in the number 22828

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.250
and put in the one
word IRONSTRENGTH,

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.710
you will automatically
be signed up

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.340
to be on our strength
training list.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.950
And by that you'll get
emails every couple weeks

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.324
talking about our
different classes.

00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:44.990
I'll leave this up
for a sec, if anybody

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.170
wants to register for that.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.480
And it will automatically
sign you up,

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.520
and you'll be part
of our class list.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.200
These classes are always free.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.130
Every fourth class,
we do a fundraiser

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.130
for different nonprofit.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.680
So for example,
this Sunday we're

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.720
doing a fundraiser for
a great nonprofit called

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.690
Girls on the Run, which
takes at-risk girls

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.530
and teaches them about
running and running

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.261
programs to help them build
self-esteem and good health

00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:06.760
behaviors.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.849
So we try and do a different
nonprofit every couple months.

00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:10.890
But they're a ton of fun.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.710
We do them in the winter
mostly indoors at Equinox

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:14.476
at Rock Center.

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:16.350
In the summer, we do
them all over the place.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.640
I usually do a couple down here
on Pier 25 right near you guys,

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.065
basically across the street,
after work in the summer.

00:27:23.065 --> 00:27:25.190
We're going to one this
summer on Governors Island,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:26.530
which will be a lot of fun.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.170
And I'm going to throw
this out there right now,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.360
but I definitely
would be psyched

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.651
if you guys would be psyched
I would come down here one

00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.450
morning and lead a 7:00
AM on the terrace workout

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.184
and kick some Google butt,
if you guys want to do that.

00:27:37.184 --> 00:27:38.850
If there's interest,
yes, we'll do that.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:39.130
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.520
DR. JORDAN METZL: So we'll
set it up this summer.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.895
We'll try an IronStrength
workout this summer down here.

00:27:42.895 --> 00:27:45.311
If you can pop open the ice
cream truck after the workout,

00:27:45.311 --> 00:27:46.495
that'd be great.

00:27:46.495 --> 00:27:48.140
But that'd be great.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.480
So these are really fun ways.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.210
If you live wherever and
you want to try this online,

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.677
if you go to
runnersworld.com just

00:27:53.677 --> 00:27:55.260
put in my name or
IronStrength, you'll

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.654
find this streaming video.

00:27:56.654 --> 00:27:58.570
It's free, and you can
try this stuff at home.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.820
Now finally we're at our gold.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.820
Those are the advanced guys.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.320
So those are the guys who
are doing plyometrics.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.470
And a plyometric is a
very rapid elongation,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.260
contraction, cycle the muscle.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.500
IronStrength is a very
plyometric-based workout.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.980
And I think you can really
train that stuff at home.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.740
That's what our
class is all about.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.020
And basically, people have
different distributions

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.950
of slow and fast switch fibers
in their genetic anatomy.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.684
That's why some people are
naturally faster than others.

00:28:20.684 --> 00:28:22.850
But even within that, you
can do a lot with yourself

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.350
with plyometric-based
strengthening.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.280
You can really make you a much
better athletic version of you

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.250
with that.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.000
So in conclusion,
I would just say

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
that I hope that this message
of exercise as medicine

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.450
is one that resonates.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.370
And I look forward to seeing
you at one of my classes soon.

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.910
Maybe I'll see you here when
we do a boot camp up here.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.630
And I hope you think about this
message and kind of push it

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:51.860
forth in whatever way you have.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.790
To me, this is the fundamental--

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.147
Oh, that's fine.

00:28:55.147 --> 00:28:55.980
That's the last one.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.646
That's this one.

00:28:56.646 --> 00:28:58.450
But just resources I
hope help keep people

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.430
thinking about this dialogue of
getting people out and moving

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.420
and active.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.210
Because I would
much rather think

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.260
about preventing disease
rather than spending

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.022
all these billions
of dollars paying

00:29:10.022 --> 00:29:11.230
for the treatment of disease.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:16.180
I'm happy to answer any
questions in the room.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:16.950
Yeah.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:17.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks
so much for coming.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.808
DR. JORDAN METZL: Sure.

00:29:18.808 --> 00:29:20.120
AUDIENCE: It's really fun.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.870
So you talked a little bit about
NEAT profiles and the things

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:26.260
Google does to
help us raise them.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.800
One of the things we
have are standing desks.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.790
And when I try to stand all day
long, it's really exhausting.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.800
So what would you put as a
benchmark for using that?

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.020
And I have a second
question, which

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.790
is in your book I was
flipping through it

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:43.170
and you said something about
exercising seven days a week,

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.110
which is a lot.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.840
I usually find that by day
six I'm pretty tired and sore.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.350
So what sort of
exercises would you

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.090
recommend doing over
those seven days

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.610
so that we're still energized
to keep going on day eight?

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:56.610
DR. JORDAN METZL: Great.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:57.776
So two good questions.

00:29:57.776 --> 00:29:59.150
I'll answer the
second one first.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.240
Exercising seven days a
week I'm a big fan of,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.200
but it doesn't mean you have to
do the same intensity or thing

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.800
or even close.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.885
So whatever it is, if it's
gentle stretching, a swim,

00:30:07.885 --> 00:30:12.350
a yoga class, or maybe nothing,
but I think basically doing

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.910
something daily just helps for
a number of different reasons.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.660
Obviously you don't
need the reinforcement

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.270
because your lifestyle behaviors
are already deeply entrenched

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.400
with exercise, but I think
doing something every day,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.250
physiologically, mentally is
most helpful for most people.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.050
But it doesn't have to be the
same intensity, for sure not.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.950
Incidentally, we did our
office outing last night.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.795
We did a hot yoga
class last night.

00:30:36.795 --> 00:30:39.170
I was like, dude, we're not
doing this again, but anyway.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:39.360
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.230
DR. JORDAN METZL:
But it was good.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.188
Now it was pretty good.

00:30:41.188 --> 00:30:42.300
I'm kidding.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.190
So that was good.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.290
And then the
standing desk issue,

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.470
I love those things
if you like them.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.760
Now much like training
for a marathon,

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.547
your marathon wouldn't
be your first race.

00:30:52.547 --> 00:30:54.380
And so doing a full day
of standing probably

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.890
shouldn't be your first
exposure to a standing desk.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.610
So to go from a seated desk
to a full standing desk

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.945
is like going from
running a 5K to running

00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:05.470
the marathon without taking
the 10K and half marathon

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.567
steps in between.

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:08.400
So I think trying things,
like at our office

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.233
we have those little
ball seats where people

00:31:10.233 --> 00:31:12.910
sit on a ball as an intermediary
step to getting to a standing

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.920
desk or doing lots of planks
and building up to it,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.110
but I wouldn't go whole hog.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.420
I would try and build
up to it over time

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.807
and see how that goes,
if that's a possibility.

00:31:23.807 --> 00:31:25.390
But if it's still
bugging you, I think

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.160
building your core strength
through a lot of planks

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.670
and stuff will help you be
able to do it for longer.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.930
And I like those desk,
if you like them.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.230
There's also a
treadmill desk too.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.050
Do you guys have those here?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:33.966
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we do.

00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:35.879
DR. JORDAN METZL:
That's pretty cool.

00:31:35.879 --> 00:31:36.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:36.919
Thank you.

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:38.140
I had a quick question.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.910
So you talked about
150 minutes a week.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:44.160
Unfortunately, I'm a little
bit of a weekend warrior,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.190
and I do a competitive
race class on a spin bike

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.670
where they capture
your heart rate.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.590
And I find that my
heart rate is often

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.780
for prolonged periods of time
above the 100%, like well

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.220
into the red.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.800
And then it's
impossible to recover

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.330
for the rest of the day.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.700
Is it because you should not
be exercising at that intensity

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.550
for so long?

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.650
Or are there other
things that you

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.535
can do so-- I can sustain
it, but I'm a disaster.

00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:14.660
DR. JORDAN METZL: It's a
great physiology question.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.486
So what you're
telling me, though you

00:32:16.486 --> 00:32:18.110
don't know you're
telling me, is you're

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.100
finding your lactate threshold.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.710
So let me give you two terms.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.590
One is called VO2 Max.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.220
And so VO2 Max is the
maximum amount of oxygen

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.319
you can take out of your blood.

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:29.860
And so that's why
if you're at a race

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.985
and there's some woman
ahead of you and you're like

00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:34.150
I want to catch her but
I just can't catch her,

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.240
and every race she's
ahead of you by whatever,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.907
she physiologically probably
has a better VO2 Max.

00:32:40.907 --> 00:32:43.240
Basically, the more oxygen
you take in, the more ATP you

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.990
can use, the better
your muscle will work.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.920
And that tends to be
genetic more than anything,

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.210
which is what I always say.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:50.990
You can marry whoever
you want, but if you

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.970
want to have fast progeny you
should reproduce with somebody

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:56.950
who's got a high VO2 Max
is my general comment.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.550
Now that being
said-- that's a joke.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.670
All right-- the key that
you're not recognizing

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.650
is what's called your
lactate threshold.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.430
So lactate threshold
is the level

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.810
where lactic acid builds up
and starts to basically make

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.010
muscles acidic and not work
very well and unpleasant to do

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:12.510
stuff.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.134
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:13.134 --> 00:33:15.510
DR. JORDAN METZL: Lactate
threshold is hugely trainable.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.606
VO2 Max is not.

00:33:16.606 --> 00:33:17.480
Lactate threshold is.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.520
So you can go for
longer periods of time

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.670
and not feel like you just
got shot the rest of the day

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.170
if you train your
lactate threshold.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:24.890
How do I do that?

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.681
And that is interval
training, so the stuff

00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:27.560
like in IronStrength.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.339
You should do my
workout on your phone

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:30.880
twice a week for a
half hour at home.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.550
If you start meeting our
good friend Lord Admiral

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.353
Burpee from the British Navy--

00:33:35.353 --> 00:33:36.320
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.320
DR. JORDAN METZL: Burpees
are great because they

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.180
start building
cardiovascular strength.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.677
Interval training pushes
that lactate threshold,

00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:44.510
and then your weekend
won't kill you as bad.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.690
So there's a lot of
ways to make that

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.450
better so you don't
have to stop doing that.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:48.880
DR. JORDAN METZL: All right?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.713
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:49.713 --> 00:33:51.040
DR. JORDAN METZL: Sure.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:51.960
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.010
So it's not a
marathon, but Emily

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.932
knows I'm going to this
hiking retreat in a month.

00:33:56.932 --> 00:33:57.890
DR. JORDAN METZL: Cool.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.400
AUDIENCE: And I
haven't worked out

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.300
regularly in about a year for
various reasons, mostly just

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.950
New York.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.250
So I've got a month to get
in shape to hike every day up

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:10.520
to 17 miles in the last day
with two yoga classes a day plus

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.460
some sort of barre class.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.739
What should I do-- as a
pretty not even bronze.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.560
I say I'm like a copper--
in the next four weeks?

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.810
DR. JORDAN METZL: Well, first
of all come get my card.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.480
No, I'm kidding.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.020
No.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.020
So you have a month,
and your month

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.042
needs to focus on
building strength.

00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:30.250
Are you an established hiker,
or are you a new hiker?

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:30.850
AUDIENCE: I used to be.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.360
I used to live in
northern California.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.770
DR. JORDAN METZL: Got ya.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:33.670
AUDIENCE: So it's
been hard here.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.030
DR. JORDAN METZL: All right.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.679
It can be done.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.179
All right.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:35.850
Fair enough.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.090
So you have to think
about, number one,

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.050
building some strength.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.940
So you have a month.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.772
You can definitely make great
strength gains in a month.

00:34:43.772 --> 00:34:45.730
Do that some of the online
strengthening stuff.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.469
It would be great for you.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.052
Start building some
baseline strength.

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:48.780
That will help.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.820
You have a foam roller?

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:50.840
DR. JORDAN METZL: OK.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.384
So if you have the small one,
you can bring it to California.

00:34:53.384 --> 00:34:54.550
Is that where you're hiking?

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.560
AUDIENCE: I am, yeah.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.560
DR. JORDAN METZL: So bring
your roller with you.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.600
Because every day
when you get back,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.324
I want you to make
sure you roll.

00:35:00.324 --> 00:35:02.490
So building strength and
increasing your flexibility

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.447
will help your kinetic
chain work better.

00:35:04.447 --> 00:35:06.280
And then there's some
sport-specific things.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.910
So we don't have a lot of great
hiking super close to here,

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:10.830
but we do pretty
easy to get away to.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.410
But we've got a lot of stairs.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.701
So we have a lot of buildings
with a lot of big stairs.

00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:16.750
And that can really help
for hikers, particularly

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.250
mountain climbers
that want to build

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.083
those particular glute
muscles and all that.

00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:22.460
So a combination
of stair climbing,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.340
plyometric strengthening
online, rolling,

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.100
that will definitely
help make a big dent.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.110
And you can go from copper--
we can get you up to silver,

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.860
I bet, in a month.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.560
AUDIENCE: OK, great.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.059
Thank you.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:33.191
DR. JORDAN METZL: Sure.

00:35:33.191 --> 00:35:34.190
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dr. Metzl.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.120
DR. JORDAN METZL: Hi.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.942
AUDIENCE: So talking about
the bronze, cop-- no, silver--

00:35:38.942 --> 00:35:39.900
DR. JORDAN METZL: Yeah.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:40.760
I like copper, though.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.145
That was good.

00:35:41.145 --> 00:35:41.644
Yeah.

00:35:41.644 --> 00:35:43.230
AUDIENCE: --levels,
and this is kind

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.040
of a running-specific question.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.170
With regard to your easy days,
your normal running days,

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.850
however long you run, just
at a moderate to easy effort,

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:55.550
where does that fall in
your mind in that standing?

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.880
And you mentioned how
with each day, I guess,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.810
you want to hit at least
silver or gold for 25%

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:03.970
of that portion.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.740
So would that involve
running your easy runs

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.050
with a portion of it being
picked up, et cetera?

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.080
DR. JORDAN METZL:
That's a good question.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.996
So it kind of depends
on what level you're at.

00:36:11.996 --> 00:36:14.220
But there is such a thing
as just a straight recovery

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.334
day, recovery run, and
those I think you just

00:36:16.334 --> 00:36:18.750
do a straight recovery run
independent of the other stuff.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.624
I'm kind of speaking in
the workout structure

00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:23.340
more just when you're actually
doing a pretty active heart--

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.230
if it's just a slight recovery
thing and how you're training,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.999
and obviously you're more
advanced to ask that question,

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:30.790
I think your recovery
run should still just

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.350
be recovery if you're
doing that kind of stuff.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:37.500
But I don't love-- recovery
run isn't for everybody.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.800
I think recovery swim
or recovery yoga class

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.980
or whatever is great too.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.674
So I wouldn't be fully locked
into the straight recovery.

00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:46.090
And then the other
comment I would

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:49.510
make for you is runners are
my most delinquent strength

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.385
trainers, in general.

00:36:50.385 --> 00:36:52.426
I don't know if you fall
in that category or not,

00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:53.240
but I hope not.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.940
AUDIENCE: I try not to.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:54.400
DR. JORDAN METZL: What?

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.040
AUDIENCE: I try not to.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.165
DR. JORDAN METZL: OK, good.

00:36:56.165 --> 00:36:58.730
But runners tend to
think, oh, I'm running,

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.480
so I don't need to--
in fact, since you're

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.896
running you need
to really do more

00:37:01.896 --> 00:37:03.501
to build that kinetic
chain strength.

00:37:03.501 --> 00:37:04.000
All right?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.300
Sure.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.050
AUDIENCE: So I actually
had two questions.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:12.122
The first one is I'm probably
a little atypical for Google,

00:37:12.122 --> 00:37:13.580
as I probably have
a few more miles

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.020
on me than the average Googler.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.630
And with that comes
assorted injuries

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.900
that you accumulate over time.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.620
So I was just wondering
in terms of just

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.540
as a general matter in
strength conditioning,

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.570
do you think it's advisable to
sort of target the areas where

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.160
you've had problems in the past?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.470
Or is it just more of an
overall conditioning thing?

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.780
And my second question is you
didn't talk much about sleep.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.130
And I'm just wondering how sleep
figures as a dynamic, because--

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:42.130
DR. JORDAN METZL: Great.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:42.350
Thanks.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.270
Two good questions.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.690
AUDIENCE: --sometimes the choice
is either exercise or sleep.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.140
DR. JORDAN METZL:
Two great questions.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.840
The workout stuff I
talk about and tech

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.131
is all about what's called
kinetic chain strengthening,

00:37:51.131 --> 00:37:53.006
so a chain is only as
strong as its weakness.

00:37:53.006 --> 00:37:55.255
So if you have a little bit
of arthritis in your knee,

00:37:55.255 --> 00:37:56.730
by making that
whole chain stronger

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.189
it puts less load on the knee.

00:37:58.189 --> 00:37:59.980
There also are some
injury-specific things.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.050
I'm actually working
on my next book

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.520
now with "Runner's World,"
which is another Rodale thing

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.782
and then a whole series
of 20 of these videos

00:38:07.782 --> 00:38:09.240
called "Inside the
Doctor's Office"

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.550
where you can click
on your iPhone

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.799
and watch the video in
combination with the paperback.

00:38:12.799 --> 00:38:14.680
It's to be really cool, I think.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.430
In that I have a
whole thing on sleep

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.600
and the importance of sleep.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.220
And it's a fine line between
am I sleeping enough for me

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.240
and do I skip the
workout and sleep.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.962
And it can be a
day-to-day decision,

00:38:27.962 --> 00:38:29.670
and I don't have an
exact number for you.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.920
It depends on how you're
feeling and what you've done.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.520
So I think, basically, you got
to listen to your own body.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.620
And I would rather sleep
than do a bad workout,

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.750
but I tend to function a lot
better if I do something.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.150
So I think it's a
very individual thing.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.540
There's not an absolute number
I can give you for that.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.998
But it's certainly something
to think about, and definitely

00:38:46.998 --> 00:38:49.310
in terms of performance as well.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:49.810
All right.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.720
I'm happy to sign any
books you guys have.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.990
Thank you so much for
having me, and I'll

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.770
see you see you soon in class.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.270
Bye bye.
