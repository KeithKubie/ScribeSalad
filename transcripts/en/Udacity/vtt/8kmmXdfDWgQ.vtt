00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we talked about, you know, HTML

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.960
talks, talks about where these different things are on

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.780
the page, or actually what's on the page. CSS

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.320
is the where and the how does it look?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.760
&gt;&gt; And the JavaScript just, like, how does this whole thing fit together. How

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.840
does, when I click this, what machinery does that enact to make that happen?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.330
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah. So, if you wanted a static page you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.090
could just have the HTML and CSS, and you wouldn't need JavaScript.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt; Like a blog or something?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410
&gt;&gt; But if you actually want to be able to interact

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.760
with things. I mean, you can have some interactions with HTML alone.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.772
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:36.700
&gt;&gt; But if, especially if you want things to, to move without reloading the page.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.480
&gt;&gt; You basically want it.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.269
&gt;&gt; You want to use some JavaScript.

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.982
&gt;&gt; All right. And this together, I mean, I've heard the terms, you

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:44.342
know, front end, back end. This is the front end of a webpage.

00:00:44.342 --> 00:00:46.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, so this really doesn't really have a back end.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.734
There's no sending information back to a central server or anything like that.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:50.810
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.040
&gt;&gt; This is all run on the client computer.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, which means me if I'm working it.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, when, when you load the page all of these all of

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.430
these assets get loaded into your browser.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.396
You, you basically download all of these files.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:02.647
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:04.209
&gt;&gt; And then it just goes on your computer.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.612
&gt;&gt; There's

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:08.620
&gt;&gt; There's no talking back and fourth. It's all, it's all there.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.410
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.897
&gt;&gt; So, good. It's helpful [LAUGH]. I've never had anyone

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:16.320
just to explain this to me before. So, with the index

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170
like HTML. I did have a hard time when I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.140
was, you know, browsing this at first. I don't know

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.788
HTML and it was, it was confusing. So, maybe we

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:27.180
can talk a bit about how to, how to read this.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.460
&gt;&gt; Sure.
