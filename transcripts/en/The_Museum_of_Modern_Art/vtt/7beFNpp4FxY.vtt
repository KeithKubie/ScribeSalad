00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:09.665
We're in front of Jackson Pollock's
&lt;i&gt;One: Number 31, 1950&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:12.704
We're working on this painting
to restore it

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:15.604
and there will be several
steps to that restoration.

00:00:15.613 --> 00:00:18.483
The first steps are the cleaning
of the surface.

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:22.006
This has included dry cleaning
with dry sponges.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:23.696
We're now at a stage in the process

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:28.466
where we are surface cleaning it
with moistened swabs.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:32.026
&lt;i&gt;One: Number 31&lt;/i&gt; came into
the collection in 1968

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:35.096
and this is the first time
that it will be surface cleaned

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:38.546
so there is a good bit of embedded grime
on the paint layer.

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:43.129
In 1998 when the museum had a
significant Jackson Pollock retrospective

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.185
we were able to look at this painting

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:47.315
in the context of others from 1950.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.675
There were some differences in the way
this painting looked

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.222
and we wanted to understand more
about his materials and techniques.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:58.243
We used X-radiography
to look at detail shots

00:00:58.243 --> 00:01:00.803
of areas of paint
that looked very different

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:04.552
from what we're typically seeing
across Pollack's surface.

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.402
We found areas of cracking

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:09.032
that revealed some restoration
had taken place,

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:11.641
covering over original paint.

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.871
We looked at the painting
under ultraviolet light

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.835
in order to distinguish original
paint media from restoration media.

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:23.012
In this case we took samples
from the original painting

00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:26.512
to find out what the medium was
that Pollock was using

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:29.072
and then samples from
what we deemed to be 'overpaint'

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:32.122
to see what the medium
of those passages of paint were.

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:35.222
The Overpaint passages were
a completely different paint.

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:36.994
They were made from 
a different resin,

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:41.954
and thus further confirmed the fact
that these were added at a later date.

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:46.794
The final piece of evidence was the 
discovery of some photographs from 1962

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.520
when the painting was on tour in the US.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.520
Those photographs show
certain passages where, in fact,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.360
the painting has been changed.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.050
Those changes correspond to areas
that we find to be the Overpaint,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.230
that are different
both in ultraviolet light

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.550
and the medium analysis that we did.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.260
The restoration paint and Pollock's paint
are two very different resins,

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.233
and because they are,
we are fortunately able to

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.843
chemically separate these two layers

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:22.233
without causing damage
to the original layer.

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.423
As you go across the surface inch-by-inch
and get to know all the different textures

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:30.763
and the different ways that Pollock
manipulated the paint.

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:34.216
You understand how well this artist
knew his materials

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.189
and how to manipulate his materials.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.549
It gives you a real appreciation
for what he was working on.
