00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.001
So one thing I knew we really wanted to do after the 101 course

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:04.090
is have a course on building web applications.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.023
The cool thing about web application is instead of

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:08.096
just writing a program that you can use,

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:11.011
you can write a program that you can put on the web,

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.075
and then everyone on the world can also use it.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.075
I wanted to find someone to teach the course who really

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:18.031
knows a lot about building web applications and I'm delighted that

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:20.056
we found Steve Huffman to be that. So, Steve, tell us

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:21.074
what the course is going to be about.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:25.031
[Steve] Ok, so I started reddit.com as lead engineer about seven years ago

00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.030
and more recently I started hipmunk.com a new travel site.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.071
This course is basically going to cover the things I wish I had known

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.093
starting those websites.

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:36.011
Seven years ago getting into this business I had no idea what I was doing

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:38.060
and I learned most of what I know now through trial and error

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.055
and many lessons learned the hard way.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:43.036
We're going to start with the internet and browsers and how they work.

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:48.040
We'll do form validation, databases, APIs to integrate with other websites

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040
and we'll touch up some scaling issues as well.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.036
So by the time you're done you'll have a blog that's online for you to use.

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.082
It will support multiple accounts and multiple blogs.

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:59.052
[David] Well, that sounds really cool. The class is going to start on April 16th.

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:01.042
[Steve] We'll see you there!

00:01:01.042 --> 99:59:59.000
