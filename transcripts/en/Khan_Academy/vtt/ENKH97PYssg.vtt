00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:08.119
Use the commutative law of
multiplication to write 2

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.130
times 34 in a different way.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.550
Simplify both expressions
to show that they

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.420
have identical results.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.250
So once again, this commutative
law just means

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.540
that order doesn't matter.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.760
It sounds very fancy.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.910
Commutative law of
multiplication.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.000
But all that says is that it
doesn't matter whether we do 2

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.439
times 34 or whether
we do 34 times 2.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.990
The order does not matter.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.590
We can commute the two terms.
Both of these are going to get

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.510
you the same exact answer.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.340
So let's try it out.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.060
What is 2 times 34?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.540
And we could write it like
this, literally.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.230
You'll almost never see it
written like this, but it is

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.020
literally 2 times 34.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.340
Almost always people write the
larger digit on top, or the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.690
digit with more digits,
or the number with

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.415
more digits on top.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:00:59.970
But let's do it this way.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.300
4 times 2 is 8, and then
we'll put a 0.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.510
3 times 2 is 6, or you can view
it as 30 times 2 is 60.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.640
Add them together.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.710
8 plus 0 is 8.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.450
6, bring it down.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.560
It's not being added
to anything.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810
You get 68.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.930
So 2 times 34 is 68.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:31.080
Now, if you do 34 times 2, 2
times 4 is 8, 2 times 3 is 6.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.100
That's why it's always nicer to
write the number with more

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.280
digits on top.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.150
It also is equal to 68.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.150
So it doesn't matter whether you
have two groups of 34 or

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.870
thirty-four groups of 2,
in either case, you're

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.000
going to have 68.
