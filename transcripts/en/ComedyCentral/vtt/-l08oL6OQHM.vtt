00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.538
- Salam. I'm Jamsheed
Al-Jamsheedi, and this

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.906
is a Mideast Minute.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.743
(orchestra music)

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.713
Villagers, thank you
for tuning in as always

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:15.014
from the middle east today,

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.517
as we broadcast to
you live from Omaha,

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.620 align:start size:88% position:13%
the hometown of a
number of peacekeepers.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
With Donald Trump's election
win leading to worries

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.357
our borders will close,

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.692 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's time for the
middle east to realize

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.863 align:start size:97% position:3%
that immigrating to the
United States, is overrated.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.065
(dramatic music)

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
The United States, a
nation built by immigrants.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.704 align:start size:88% position:13%
When making it was as
easy as boarding a ship,

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.105
but no more.

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.608
Making it in modern
America is hard,

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.110
so hard in-fact that
immigrating to America

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.880
is the last thing you'd want.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
First of all, according
to The Economist,

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.215
housing prices in
the United States

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:51.885
are nearing an all-time high.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.386 align:start size:84% position:16%
And if you can't
afford to buy a house

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.653
what are you gonna do?

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.322
As Fox's David Asman explains,

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's not as if people are
trying to just give them away.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.162 align:start position:0%
- Houses in Detroit were
literally being sold for $1 each

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.433 align:start size:84% position:16%
and now they can't
even give houses away.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.734
- Yes, exactly.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.671
People are trying to
just give them away.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.573 align:start size:88% position:13%
But what good is a house
if you have no job?

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.942 align:start size:88% position:13%
According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:20.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
the unemployment rate in
the United States is at 4.6%

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.147
which sounds very low,

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.918
but is actually 84%
higher than 1953

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.988
which means jobs are
difficult to come by.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
Just listen to this
business owner on KCRA.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.658
- [Interviewer] Could
you use more workers?

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:35.161
- Definitely. There's a
real shortage right now,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.495
especially skilled workers.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:37.596
- Yes.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.098
Exactly.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.968
There is an urgent
need for workers.

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:43.803
But what good is
a job and a house

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.271
without food on your plate?

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:47.674
According to the US government's

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.109 align:start size:97% position:3%
National Integrated Drought
Information Systems,

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.013 align:start position:0%
droughts are currently affecting
26% of the United States,

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:58.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
devastating farmland and
making food hard to come by.

00:01:58.016 --> 00:02:00.219
Allison Aubrey of PBS reports.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.822 align:start size:97% position:3%
- 40% of all the food
produced in the United States

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.558
never gets eaten.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.126
- Yes.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:07.961
Exactly.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.696
The United States
has so much food

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.465
even droughts aren't an issue.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.869 align:start position:0%
But is that the kind of
country you wanna immigrate to?

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.839 align:start size:88% position:13%
One with houses to
give, jobs in abundance

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.908 align:start size:88% position:13%
and so much food we
throw tons in the trash?

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:25.077
(laughs)

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:27.347
That sounds awful.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:30.049 align:start size:94% position:6%
And regardless villagers,
we barely have space.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.718
We're packed to the gills.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.487
You'd last a week in New York
before you wished you'd never

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:37.490
left the wide open
vistas you call home.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm Jamsheed
Al-Jamsheedi and this

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.594
has been a Mideast Minute.
