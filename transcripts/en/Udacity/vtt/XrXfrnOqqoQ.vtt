00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here comes one idea about how to test the implementation of a differential equation solver.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We provide the solver that we've never covered before that looks pretty complex.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The question is what's the order of that solver. Enter that order here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The problem that we're using is again the satellite the takes 24 hours to orbit the earth

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and we are comparing its final position to its start position and plot the arrow.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
From that graph, determine the order of that solver.
