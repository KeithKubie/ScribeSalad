00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.810
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Wang:
I'm Jeffrey Wang.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.990
Chinese reference librarian.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
On behalf of Asian division,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.650
welcome you all to
attend this talk.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.460
Today's speaker is
Dr. Burkus-Chasson.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.720
She is a professor of art
and east-Asian languages

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.090
and the cultures
at the University

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.500
of Illinois Urbana-Champagne.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.970
She is currently a senior fellow
at the Center for Advanced Study

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.160
in the Visual Arts, National
Gallery of Arts, Washington,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.850
D.C. So, for the last several
months she has been doing

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.720
research on Chinese classic
art [inaudible] Asian Division.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.810
So, where I know here in the
Asian Division reading room.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.770
So, I invited her
to give us a talk,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.980
presenting her research
achievement.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.290
So, the topic of today's talk
is sentimental history depicting

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.850
emotion in Chinese art.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.150
I'm not going to say more.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.510
Just welcome Professor
Burkus-Chasson.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.440
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: Thank
you, Jeffrey, very much,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.210
for a generous introduction.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.260
It is my honor here to
be here this afternoon,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.560
in this splendid building.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.890
And I hope you all take
this opportunity to tour --

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.290
to take a tour if
you haven't already.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.210
I want to thank all the people

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.660
who helped make possible
my visit today.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.280
As well as the librarians,
including Jeffrey

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.340
and many others, in the Asian
division, who made my stay

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.310
in Washington so profitable.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.970
And so, I must add,
difficult to leave.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.120
My subject today is emotion.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.050
And its depiction
in Chinese art.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070
I have time to focus
only a few of the moments

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.560
in what I have called
a sentimental history.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.170
Before I begin, let me tell
you what motivated me to look

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.990
into this history, for few
Chinese art historians have.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.140
Since the 1980s anthropologists
and historians

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.460
of Europe have examined
the nature

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.240
of human of human emotion.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.120
It was only in the early
years of the new millennium

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.160
that sinologists, especially
literary historians began

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.250
to look seriously
into the subject.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.360
A number of these
scholars argued

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.120
that words are the
best means by which

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.630
to investigate how an
historical society understood

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.470
human emotion.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.240
As an art historian, I took
note of this, of course,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.520
wondering why the
pictorial representation

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.450
of emotion had been dismissed.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.350
Moreover, during the past
eight months I've worked

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.490
at the National Gallery of
Art where I was immersed

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.860
in European art history.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.670
My research in 17th
century Chinese painting

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.680
and illustrated books was
perceived as sharing a space

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.940
with that of early modernists.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.590
But the many contrasts I
saw, between the visual arts

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.550
of early modern Europe and those

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.780
of late Imperial China were
simply too striking to ignore.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.590
So, I was compelled
not only to look

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.090
into the pictorial
representation of emotion

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.130
in Chinese art but also
to use contrasting cases

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.110
and the visual arts
of early modern Europe

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.410
to highlight the distinguishing
features of the Chinese case.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.780
The latter project may seem
hopelessly old fashioned.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.910
But the work of an historian
in this age of global studies,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.830
necessitates to my mind,
the acknowledgement

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.540
that a composite often fractures

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.030
and that distinctions
are still worth noticing.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.000
For example, in this print

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
by the German artist Albrecht
Durer, two lovers strolling

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
in a filed are haunted
by the figure of death,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.410
which lurks behind a tree.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.060
Their solemnity is unsurprising.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.220
For death hold an hour
glass above it's skull,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.600
as if to remind us that
the joys of love are brief

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.930
and even pose a distraction

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.570
from the more serious
contemplation of mortality.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.480
By contrast, these two lovers
exhibit only excitement

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.890
at the prospect of
their rendezvous.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.440
In a scene taken from the
popular operatic play,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.070
Story of the Western Wing,
or [foreign language].

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.740
The male lead student Zhang
[assumed spelling] hurls his

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.220
boots over a garden wall that
separated him from his lover,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.520
Oriole [assumed spelling].

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.530
As he scrambles bare-footed
over the wall,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.740
the female lead encourages
him with her fan.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.520
And gestures toward a place out
of view where they may comingle.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.700
Death does not preside
over their meeting.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.820
Instead symbols of Daoist
transcendence practitioners

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.500
of the art of prolonging life,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.980
surround the couple along
the plates in the rim.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.380
But before I move beyond
this isolated example,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.670
let me clarify what I mean when
I speak of sentiment or ching,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.280
the Chinese word that
denotes feeling or emotion.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.900
The emotions named in ancient
Confucian text and considered

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.840
to be inherent in all human
beings, that is delight, anger,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.040
grief, and joy may seem
familiar to all of us.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.270
None of the less, it is commonly
agreed that the expression

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.750
of feeling is condition by
cultural norms and beliefs,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.420
as well as by social
expectations defined

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.420
by gender and class.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.110
In general, emotions
are not conceived

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.430
as universal dispositions
or states of mind.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.860
Nor are they seen
outside of history.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.240
Indeed, we have learned that
the very meaning and usage

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.720
of the word ching
was not static.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.710
Therefore, I do not conceive
of an emotion as a spontaneous

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.830
and natural expression
of feeling.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.100
I assume that conscious
manipulation

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.180
and even deception
can play a role

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.380
in the embodiment of an emotion.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.930
And that the power of
social institutions

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.550
and social relations inform the
discourse on emotion in China

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.150
as much as it did in Europe.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.900
With all of this in mind,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.240
let me begin my brief
sentimental history

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.010
of Chinese art.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.920
My talk is divided
into three parts.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.430
I begin with a pictorial
representation of grief.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.660
Next, look at two different
traditions of secular painting

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.780
that emerged in 16th
century China, both of which,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.080
nonetheless were concerned

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.660
with the dilemma of
depicting emotion.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.780
I conclude in part 3 with
the work of Chen Hongshou.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.440
A 17th century painter
and print designer

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.870
who transformed Chinese
figure painting, in part,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.170
through his depiction
of emotion.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.410
Part one, death and
the depiction of grief.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.680
The contrast between a 15th
century Italian representation

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.800
of the death of Christ and a 9th
century Chinese representation

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.630
of the death of the Buddha
brings forward an issue

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.300
that I have already
acknowledged in my introduction,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.290
that is the cultural specificity

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.140
of pictorial delineation
on emotion.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:45.710
Here in Bellini's Pieta, Mary
embraces the dead Christ.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.640
As she supports the corpse,
she peers into the ashen face

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.290
as though to comfort him.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.660
But also to confirm the
absence of his breath.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.780
By contrast, St. John is
discomforted looks away.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.200
Moreover, the hand of the dead
Christ rests on a marble ledge,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.570
from which hangs a small tablet.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.150
The tablet bears an inscription,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.600
when these swelling
eyes can produce groans,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.150
the work of Giovanni
Bellini could have wept.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.860
These words signify
not only that paintings

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.370
such as this were intended
to move viewers but also

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.520
that the interactions
between viewer

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.650
and image were highly
emotional and even magical.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.030
Will Mary break down before us

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.630
when we notice her
tentative look?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.750
Or will the painting itself,
shed tears when we, too,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.870
grieve the death of Christ?

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.610
Mourners also attend Buddha's
death in this 9th century cave,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.230
which was carved
out from the face

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.940
of a cliff [foreign
language] a site

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.650
in north western China situated
along trade routes that led

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.330
through central Asia and beyond.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.890
Set against a wall of
the cave, the clay figure

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.730
of the reclining Buddha is
surrounded by mourners painted

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.800
onto the cave's whitewashed
walls.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.930
The figures include weeping
r hots [phonetic spelling]

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.190
or wisemen, the early
followers of the Buddha.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.860
They gnash their teeth,
open their mouths to wail,

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.270
shake their fists in the air,
or beat their chest, close,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.820
shut their eyes and
knit their brows.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.080
One desperate, darkened
figure appears ready

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.190
to throw itself upon the corpse.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.440
Bodhisattvas stand
upright behind the grieving

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.380
and agitated r hots,
they are impassive.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.010
The bodhisattvas,
enlightened beings dedicated

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.730
to the salvation of all sentient
beings instruct viewers how

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.060
to respond to the
Buddha's death.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.760
Their serenity mirrors their
understanding that in death,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.620
the teacher Shakyamuni
had escaped samsara,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.970
the world of illusion, which
only brought suffering.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.450
Thus we observe our cultural

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.050
and religious difference
affected a difference

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.560
in the understanding of emotion.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.940
Whereas Mary encouraged
viewers to weep with her.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.720
The enlightened among the
Buddha's followers encouraged

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.920
instead quietude in the face of
their teacher's transformation.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.900
Part two. The dilemma of
representing an expressive body.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.870
Although highly stylized in
schematic, the expression

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:30.460
of grief in the 9th century
cave painting was persuasive.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.960
However, in the centuries that
succeeded, figure painting

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.550
of all genres gradually
lost favor among painters

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.770
and art writers in China.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.620
Attention focused instead
on the genre of landscape,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.470
how to render an
expressive body,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.330
ultimately became a dilemma.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.860
For example, the 16th century
scholars Xie Zhaozhe claimed

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.340
that only eunuchs and women
were curious about the stories

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.600
that painters illustrated.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.490
For this they were ridiculed.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.800
But their detractors,
[inaudible] pointed out,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.100
were ignorant of the fact

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.010
that pictorial narratives
were traditionally held

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.520
in high regard if
only for the skill

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.700
and knowledge required
to produce them.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.340
[inaudible] derided
the painters of his day

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.110
who merely followed a whim and
carelessly sketched an idea.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.650
For this practice,
served not only

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.230
to highlight their
deficiencies but also

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.960
to demonstrate their
technical inability

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.070
to depict a human figure.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.400
Thus, 16th century figure
painters faced a dilemma.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.170
Under these circumstances
how could they reanimate

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.290
pictorial narratives.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.150
The indifference to painted
stories among the cognoscenti is

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.600
surprising, for the popularity

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.840
of sentimental fiction among
contemporary readers has been

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.570
amply demonstrated and devotees

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.860
of operatic plays regularly
watched performances during

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.780
which skilled actors moved
their audiences to tears.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.950
But the visual representation
of emotion

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.170
in narrative figure
painting had been stifled.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.610
Why was that?

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.160
Can it be that the
problem lay merely

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.300
in the technical incompetence
of contemporary painters?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.600
Or were other issues at play?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.830
An illustrated treatise which
is in the Library of Congress,

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.160
by the way, on figure painting
from the late 16th century

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.840
and titled [inaudible]
or Shapes of Heaven,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.110
Appearance of the Way,
illuminates several aspects

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.350
of the dilemma that confronted
painters at this time.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.900
Here an illustrated
leaf from the treatise

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.180
which shows two men looking at
water flowing from a spring.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.040
Written by the scholar
Zhou Lujing,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.630
the treatise records
the prescriptions

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.280
that govern the representation
of the human figure

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.840
and in particular
the elite male.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.040
Among the 40 illustrations
that accompanied the treatise,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.780
only four were dedicated
to the female figure.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.590
And only three among the four
sketches included laborers.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.600
The rest portrayed
cultivated gentlemen in pursuit

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.900
of various activities,

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.110
especially drinking,
such as this one.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.570
In prefatory remarks,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.940
Zhou addressed diverse
issues relevant

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.630
to figure painting
pertinent to our discussion

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.320
about emotion is Zhou's emphasis
on the necessity to distinguish

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.620
between the appearance

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.160
of the high born
figure and the low born.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.820
But he concentrated in his text

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.700
on identifying the
characteristics

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.970
of the aristocratic male figure.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.900
Defining a range of activities

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.060
in which this figure
would be suitably engaged,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.500
as well the emotions that the
activities would have aroused.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.540
This is what Zhou had to
say, sometimes they step

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.700
in a leisurely manner along the
edge of a waterway or they look

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.530
into the distance
at rugged peaks.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.750
In each case, it is necessary
that the figure be at ease

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.580
with itself, neither tangled
thoughts nor chaotic flourishes

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.410
are present.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.400
Sometimes facing a great hall

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.400
in the mountains he will assume
an attitude of bitter struggle

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.660
or drinking in a relaxed
manner inside of a pavilion,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.960
he will assume the appearance

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.580
of happy shouting
and tumbling over.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.340
In this passage, Zhou thus
discouraged figure painters

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.740
from depicting a gentleman with
his arms waving about because

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.090
such a gesture might
suggest an agitated mind.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.390
On the other hand he did not
hesitate to describe in words,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.630
and I emphasize that, in
words he did not hesitate

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.510
to describe how a drunken
gentleman might fall

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.650
over himself in laughter.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.110
Unsurprising, the figural images
that illustrate Zhou's treatise,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.650
evidence no signs of emotion.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.900
Impassive, unchanging, subdued.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.860
The figures point to things
or bend toward one another

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.270
in conversation but their
faces show no feeling.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.980
Why did such blandness
govern the betrayal

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.750
of the elite male figure?

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.740
First, I think it is
important to recognize

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.250
that the figural illustrations

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:14.900
of Tianxing daomao represented
paradigmatic models of behavior.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.690
They possessed a
power of persuasion,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.130
such as the power once
believed to have been exerted

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.490
by the imagined portraits of
sagely men and virtuous women

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.410
of the past, that customarily
embellished the walls

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.640
of royal palaces.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.300
The late 16th century
writer [inaudible] confirmed

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.840
this point.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.720
He once interpreted a portrait
as a laudatory art form

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.130
and chided his contemporaries
for refusing

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.260
to paint the portraits
of the men they admired

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.770
and sought to emulate.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.720
Nonetheless, the
delineation of emotion itself,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.460
seems to have played little
if any part in the power

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.950
of the portrait to
move a viewer.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.190
As this portrait of the painter
Wang Shimin demonstrates.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.390
Indeed, like Wang Shimin, the
virtuous figures of the past

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.030
in all likelihood were
pictured in accord

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.140
with Confucian rules of decorum.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.120
These rules or disciplines
such as smoothing the face,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.640
quieting the voice, measuring
the step, were all intended

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.940
to subdue the expression
of excessive emotions.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.300
For strong feelings were
believed to cloud the mind,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.300
making it impossible to
respond in a proper way

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.670
to situations in the world.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.980
Moreover, a smooth impassive
face also enabled the viewer

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.080
of a portrait to scan the
features of its subject,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.460
in particular the
nose, the brow,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.690
the lips for physiognomic
signs of a subject's destiny.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.720
These points are indisputable.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.180
And I have no intention
of disputing these points

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.650
as being important
in the impassivity

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.100
of the elite male figure.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.790
Nonetheless, I want to return
to the incongruence between word

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.890
and image in Tianxing
daomao as an additional way

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.320
to explain the bland,
unchanging features

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.620
of the elite male figure.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.990
The illustrations in Zhou's
treatise were each labeled

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.010
with two-character phrases.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.520
These phrases often
allude to other text --

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.270
I'm used to walking around, but
I'm not allowed to walk around.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.010
So, anyway, I think you can
see that the Chinese characters

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.160
that are in the corner
of the picture.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.010
In a scene [inaudible].

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.380
That is looking toward the moon.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.460
Two men turn their
heads to look upward.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.760
Unlabeled, the scene
would be curious.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.020
Illustrating little more
than the articulation

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.550
of the figures heads
and shoulders.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.990
But the two character labeled
brought to mind countless poems

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.370
about men admiring the moon.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.800
The recollecting emotion

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.380
of their words imbued the
picture with sentiment.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.170
The gentlemen in Zhou's
encyclopedia, I argue,

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.900
refrained from conveying
emotion in part

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.350
because it was unnecessary.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.740
The figures were embedded
in the language of poetry.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.650
Let me further demonstrate
this point with two paintings

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.970
that illustrate the well-known
narrative poem, Pipa xing,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.490
The Ballad of the Pipa.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.180
Here excerpts from the poem.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.030
Very few excerpts.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.000
Written in the early 9th century
by the renowned poet Bai Juyi,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.130
The Ballad of the
Pipa recounts an event

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.630
that occurred during the
poet's exile in the south.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.110
While parting with a
friend, Bai Juyi chanced

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.910
to hear a woman strumming
a pipa.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.610
He invited her to play
for him and his companion.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.460
They learned that she had
once studied and performed

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.010
in a norther capital and, like
the poet, was now stranded

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.650
in the south as the wife
of a traveling merchant.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.890
In his poem, Bai describes
the sounds of the pipa.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.120
They were like rain,
appropriate for today,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.700
like pearls dropping on a plate.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.350
He described his melancholy
response to the music

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.450
and his personal
identification with the forlorn

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.860
and aging pipa player.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.890
For although they were
previously unacquainted

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.360
with one another, they
could still empathize

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.350
with one another's
distress in exile.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:16.780
They were both strangers in
a place where the only music

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.560
that ordinarily could be heard
was the sound of wild animals.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.190
Missing his life in the capital,

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.640
the poet wept while
the woman played.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.850
That such an emotional
poem would become popular,

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.330
a very popular subject it was,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.290
amongst certain 16th century
painter may come as a surprise,

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.420
for as a lead protagonist should
not have been shown unsettled

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.000
by sentiment.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.760
But as we shall see,
painters tend to stray

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.710
from Bai Juyi's text,
shifting attention away

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.740
from the poem's tearful
conclusion.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.290
Nonetheless for their viewers,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.090
the painters were
still entangled

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.210
with the recollected
of the poem.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.720
Obliquely, the painters thus
imbued their illustrations

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.140
with sorrow.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:08.470
For example, the figure painter
Guo Xu inscribed the entire text

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.750
of Bai Juyi's poem at the
head of this hanging scroll.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.540
The delicate figures of the poet

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.780
and the pipa player
appear beneath it.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.060
But Guo portrayed neither
figure with the emotion

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.360
that Bai Juyi described
in his poem.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.890
Indeed Guo portrayed an event

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.130
that does not even
occur in the poem.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.380
Here the poet, pictured
as a gentleman at leisure,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.670
looks down upon the musician.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.340
The performer lavishly dressed
bows her head as though prepared

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.550
to answer a command to take
her instrument out of its bag.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.080
The poet does not identify
with the performer.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.350
Rather he is the master
and she the servant.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.090
The story about an emotional
encounter that took place

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.160
under the extraordinary
circumstances

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.380
of exile is set right
and made proper

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.060
through a pictorial
representation

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.880
of what their encounter
would have been

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.010
under ordinary circumstances.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:08.380
In his illustration
of Bai Juyi's poem,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.030
Wen Boren shifter attention to
the farewell between the poet

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.230
and his friend, which is
indicated in the title,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.620
in the far left part
of the painting.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.070
This he made explicit
through the title,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.500
Saying, Farewell at Xunyang.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.480
The full moon, the moored boats,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.260
these elements elude
to Bai's poem.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.140
The desolate landscape enveloped

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.910
in mist evokes the
isolation of exile.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.520
Bai's poem recollected

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.900
by viewers may have
conjured the presence

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.460
of the forlorn pipa player
but Wen Boren refrained

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.170
from depicting either her

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:49.690
or the poet's sleeves
wet with his tears.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.480
By contrast other 16th century
painters, unlike [inaudible]

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.260
and Wen Boren, did not depend
upon elusions to poetry

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.060
to convey sentiments that
were deemed inappropriate

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.550
to be seen or visualized.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.570
A group of painters, many
of whom were associated

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.370
with the Imperial Court
of Nanjing chose not only

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.550
to represent a range of
emotion in their work but also

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.830
to depict the low born.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.930
In this example, an exorcism
occurs at New Year with the help

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.790
of an iconic image of Jong
Qua [assumed spelling] the

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.090
demon caller.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.580
The owners of the house

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.840
from which malevolent spirits
are chased exhibit a variety

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.140
of emotions.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.100
A fearful woman covers
her eyes but looks partway

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.900
through at the same time.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.140
One solemn man prays.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.190
Another looks on in wonder
with his mouth agape,

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.460
while he constrains
one excited child

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.050
and tries to protect another.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.640
Thus it appears that the
pictorial representation

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.960
of emotion was determined
in part by social class.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.840
Rustics and illiterate men
and women could be shown

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.620
with emotion on their faces.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.210
Elite men should not.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.260
In this work, Studying
a Painting, Zhang Lu,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.060
a highly regarded painter
who gave up a career

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.500
in the government slyly
demonstrated how the

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.020
expectations of class and
gender determine the pictorial

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.260
depictions of emotion.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.720
A group of rustics have
unrolled a handscroll.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.990
Aping elite connoisseurs,
each man

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.730
and child exhibits a
solemnity not expected of them.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.000
The highborn owner
of the painting,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.030
just waking from a drunken
sleep is indifferent

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.400
to the marvel of the painting.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:42.020
But his wife stops working at
her loom to lean in for a look.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.500
In this very unusual painting,

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.230
Zhang Lu turned the
social world upside down.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.300
The peasants, merchants,
and artisans, foolish woman

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.280
and eunuchs whom his
contemporaries derided

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.550
for copying the pictures and
illustrated books, or for asking

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.280
about the stories in a painting,
these figures he positioned

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.390
on a par with an elite male.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.110
Indeed, considered from
Zhang Lu's perspective,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.310
we might consider that the
norm for emotional restraint

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.720
in figure painting established

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.130
in the 16th century
was a response

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.630
to the increasingly
diverse audiences

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.580
that painting attracted
at that time.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.970
Money had come to define
the value of things,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.480
including esteemed
collectibles such as paintings.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.990
But money was promiscuous.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.630
It could be had by anyone.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.970
To distinguish clearly
between the common

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.280
and the refined acquired
an urgency

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.980
that it did not have
in previous eras.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.400
In figure painting quietude
identified therefore a specific

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.300
social distinction.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.210
Now, this ideological bias
would change in the work

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.620
of the innovative 17th
century figure painter

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.940
and print designer [foreign
name] to whom I now turn.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.270
Part three, Chen
Hongshou laments.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.730
Early in his career, Chen
Hongshou dedicated himself

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.420
to the portrayal of
the human figure.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.310
His dedication was both
stimulated and shaped

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.380
by the media revolution
of his time.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.970
This revolution saw
the final ascendency

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.040
of the woodblock printed
book over the manuscript.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.280
Along with an unprecedented
increase

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.270
in the production of
illustrated books.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.890
The consequences of book
illustration were manifold.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.880
I focus on only one, that is how
it sparked artistic experiments

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.560
at the intersection
of print and painting.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.640
Few artists worked
in these two mediums

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.440
with as much wit
as Chen Hongshou.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.150
Indeed, the unusual and
startling compositions

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.670
for which he was noted during
his lifetime derived largely

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.990
from the calculated
juxtaposition

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.460
of disparate genres
and manners of drawing

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.110
in a single pictorial space.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.980
His appropriation
of the conventions

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.790
of narrative print was
just one of several ways

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.760
by which Chen unsettled
his paintings.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.640
In this instance, Chen's
depiction of scenes

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.710
from the life of the
renowned poet Tao Yuanming,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.480
exemplifies his propensity

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.570
to disguise his paintings
as prints.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.130
Signs of print encompass
the poet's emphatic gesture

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.870
of refusal, the hand.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:27.860
And the presence of a
collateral figure not engaged

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.260
in the narrative.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.990
The collateral figure in this
case a woman witnesses the

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.420
actions of the poet
who adamantly preferred

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:39.100
to use stored rice to make wine
rather than to use if for food.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.070
Similarly, emphatic gestures
appear in illustrations

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.670
from an early 17th
century imprint

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.720
of [foreign language] The
Tales of the Water Margin.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.400
Here the illustration that opens
the first chapter shows people

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.740
fleeing the violent escape
of malevolent star spirits

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.290
that would transform into
the rebellious protagonist

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.880
of the fictive narrative.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.020
As bystanders shout, tumble,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.190
and fall they raise their
arms in defense or alarm.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:11.230
In a later chapter, a
female warrior puts a stop

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.980
to the rumblings among her
guests who question the contents

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.780
of her dumplings and
indeed they should.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.990
They were composed of
human meat in the story.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.230
But she does so with
an outstretched arm,

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.560
palm held upright.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.880
Collateral figures that
peer from behind screens

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.770
or curtains appear in the
following two illustrations,

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.050
witnesses to private or
clandestine meetings.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.160
Now, an important part of my
argument is that the demands

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.460
of the book market,

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.570
which favored illustration had
transformed readers expectations

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.540
of pictorial story telling.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.480
For an inspiring figure
painter such as Chen Hongshou,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.220
illustrated books
presented a way

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.150
to reanimate figure painting.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.310
And yet, as we shall
see, Chen also depended

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.230
on his viewers recollection
of poetic and prose text

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.780
to sanction the unusual way in
which he resolved the dilemma

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.130
of representing an
expressive body.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.210
Let me explain.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.830
This work appears in an
early album of paintings

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.620
that Chen produced
between 1618 and 1622.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.300
Each pictorial leaf
faces an inscribed leaf

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.360
which contains commentary on the
painting that it accompanies.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.020
Chen Hongshou wrote six
of the inscriptions,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.510
in this case the famous and
erudite write Chen Jiru,

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.970
an acquaintance of
Hongshou's father wrote the

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.840
supplementary inscription.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.960
I shall return to its
contents in a moment.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:43.050
In this painting, Chen portrays
a solitary woman at the edge

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.530
of a wood under a full moon.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.800
Seated at a stone table, where
a wooden mallet lies she pauses

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.520
from the labor of pounding silk.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.440
Women pounded raw silk
to soften its fibers

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.400
and to loosen the gummy
substance that adhered to them,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.560
thus preparing the silk to
be spun and woven into cloth.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.980
An established poetic
subject scenes

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.170
of women pounding cloth
-- pounding silk, rather,

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.590
tended to highlight the erotic
connotations of the act,

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.490
which are clear enough.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.820
Enhancing its sensuality many
poets observed the sweet sweat

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.460
that showed on a women's face
while she pounded the silk.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.790
But Chen, I think,
concentrated instead

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.370
on portraying the
woman's sorrow.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.390
She looks up through tangled
branches of bamboo to glance

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.130
at desiccated leaves rendered
large which fall to the ground.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:40.040
It is autumn, a season that
was traditionally identified

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.340
with feelings of sorrow.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.270
A full moon shows itself
through wisps of cloud.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.170
It, too, identified the season.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.400
Uncharacteristically,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.120
Chen supplemented this
painting with a poem.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.060
The first two lines of the
quatrain read as follows,

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.990
pressing this silk cloth
in residence with autumn,

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.470
sister pinched and drew
together her moth eyebrows.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.830
In the last two lines Chen
abruptly changed the subject.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.720
He described the rapidity with
which soldiers had gathered

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.900
and then traveled north
to outlying garrisons.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.380
Thereby identifying the
cause of the women's sorrow.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.350
Her husband had been
conscripted into the army.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.970
What is striking about Chen's
illustration is his portrayal

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.760
of the woman's face.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.410
Both in the inscribed
poem and in the painting,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.000
Chen delineated the upward
tilt of the woman's eyebrows,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.270
which in his words were
pinched and drawn together.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.950
In contemporary fiction, sorrow
was most often manifested

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.050
on a character's face,
especially through its eyebrows,

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.830
which were portrayed
as tilting upward.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.890
This sign appears as well

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.970
in 16th century printed
illustration.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.210
For instance in this
scene from Ti hong ji.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.580
Story about inscribing
a red a leaf,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.940
the print designer showed
each of the female figures

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.270
at the right, with their
eyebrows gathered together

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.860
and tilted upward.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.170
Their sorrow at parting is
further enhanced by the gesture

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.800
of lifting their arms, covered

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.830
in their sleeves
toward their faces.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.940
Admittedly, this graphic
sign of sorrow is subtle.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.090
It took me a long time to
admit this, so bear with me.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:28.820
Nonetheless, the face of Chen's
character evidences more feeling

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.800
than other 16th century
depictions

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.130
of women pounding silk.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.940
Qiu Ying figures evidences no
sign of feeling on her face.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.160
And a scene of pounding
cloth included

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.750
in Tianxing daomao shows an
old woman bent over her work,

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.450
her face is wrinkled
but she has no --

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.500
she has not pinched
her brow in sorrow.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.880
By contrast Chen
followed the example

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.780
of contemporary print
designer rendering emotion

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:05.040
in a small sign on the
surface of the face.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.270
Nonetheless, I am compelled
to wonder why the delineation

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.810
of sorrow was so subtle.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.970
Why it was created with a simple
mark on the surface of the face?

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.700
Why this mark was
rarely accompanied

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.560
by other facial markings?

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.020
The superficiality of
the Chinese technique

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.900
of delineating emotion becomes
yet more apparent in contrast

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.590
with the techniques demonstrated

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.010
in Charles Le Brun's
famous book on the passions.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.480
Here a woman's face
demonstrates sadness.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.570
In the caption beneath
the image,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.850
Le Brun described
how the muscles

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:45.000
of the face move
the brows upward

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.740
and turned the mouth downward.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.510
Similarly, muscular
contractions cause the neck

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.380
to bend onto the shoulder.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.110
It has been noted
that the preoccupation

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.980
with the musculature of the body

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.860
in European medical
theory was inseparable

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.760
from the preoccupation with
the conception of selfhood

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.850
that encompassed the
agency of the self.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:12.000
In traditional Chinese
medical theory, however,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.030
there was no distinction
drawn among muscle,

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.550
flesh, tendon, and sinew.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.660
Hence, I want to suggest
the pictorial representation

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.540
of emotion in late
Imperial China was based

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.740
on a limited repertoire
of graphic marks,

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:30.700
signs that manifested only
on the surface of the face.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.980
The slanted brow was not
conceived as the result

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.630
of a contraction of a
facial muscle in response

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.930
to an intangible feeling.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.140
Before leaving this
painting, let me return

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.310
to Chen Jiru's commentary.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.480
He praised Chen Hongshou's
rendition

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.600
of the familiar composition,
which he traced back

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.140
to a 12th century prototype.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.490
He observed the emaciation
of the female figure,

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.350
which had moved him
to feel pity for her.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.210
In this way, Chen Jiru brought
other images and other text

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.790
to bear on his response
to Hongshou's painting.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:12.740
What else can explain why
he saw an emaciated figure

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.320
in Chen Hongshou's painting
where there is none.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.850
And yet, Chen Jiru overlooked
the figure's pinched brow,

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.940
a sign of print through
which Chen Hongshou, I argue,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.430
had conveyed the woman's sorrow.

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.010
A question thus arises.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.140
Did Chen anticipate
that his daring,

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.110
and I'll repeat daring
innovation in the depiction

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.310
of emotion would be sanctioned.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.360
And the print conventioncy
[phonetic spelling] appropriated

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.010
overlooked if they were
embedded in a poetic subject.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.460
I think the answer to
this question is yes.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.920
In the last painting I want
to show this afternoon,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.380
some of you will be
familiar with this.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.680
A drunkard who rests

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.850
on overlapped banana palms has
toppled a cup with his arm.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:04.270
The lid of the wine jug
was precariously replaced,

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.100
voluminous folds of drapery
undulate in different directions

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.660
to enhance the discord
of this composition.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.610
But it is the figure's
face, in particular,

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.730
to which I want to
draw attention.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:19.320
The sharply tilted eyebrows
and the furrowed brow,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.030
the frown just visible beneath
the mustache, all betray

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.980
and inconsolable distress.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.860
Comparable faces
expressive a distress appear

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.090
in illustrated books
such as this one.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.780
Here under fierce attack,

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.070
a man tries to protect
himself with his arm.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.850
His fear and distress
vividly marked on his face.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.500
However, Chen's drunkard is
not under any obvious threat.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.210
Indeed, ordinarily drinkers
rather delineated in paint

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.130
or in print were
portrayed unconscious

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.510
or in a state of undress.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:59.880
Two drinkers that appear in
Tianxing daomao are typical.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.630
The picture labeled,
Helplessly Drunk, shows a figure

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.020
that appears to be unconscious.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.650
Another illustration
labeled, Extremely Drunk,

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:14.270
presents the drunkard stretching
his arms as his robe falls open.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.160
So, the question then is
what did Chen gain then

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.580
by drawing instead upon printed
images of men in distress?

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.630
To answer this question let me
turn to Chen's illustration --

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.460
I'm sorry, to his inscription.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.910
It reads in part as
follows, "once again,

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.390
we have lost several
thousand miles of land.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.610
Shall we have to speak
of this business again?

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.310
I feel lucky to have some
land to farm as an outsider,

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.600
unconnected with this situation.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.840
But I worry that armed
rebels rising up in the Wu

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.930
and Yue regions will
plunder my granaries.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.600
In the meanwhile, there
is still time to drink

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600
to our heart's content.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.030
. . to my learned
brotherly friend Ping,

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.050
I am Hongshou, younger brother."

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.650
This inscription
is highly unusual.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.710
For it was written in
the form of a letter

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.240
by [foreign language]
was first to point out.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.500
Letter writing constituted a
daily preoccupation of members

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.700
of the elite in 17th
century China.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.970
Letters were collected
for publication,

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.430
fragmentary letters written

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.650
by famous calligraphers
had circulated

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.550
in rubbing collections
for centuries

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.990
to be copied by students.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.620
The first audience for Chen's
painting could not have

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.140
discounted the epistolary
form of his inscription.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.560
The rhetoric of Chen's inscribed
letter compliments the drunkards

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:41.300
emotional appeal as
a figure in distress.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.870
Furthermore, the contents of the
letter alter the significance

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:47.330
of the drunkard's
expressive body.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.560
Through it's focus on the
deteriorating military situation

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.430
of the country in the 1630s,
the Manchus were invading parts

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.580
of China at this time.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.250
And the threat of
internal uprisings.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:04.630
The inscribed letter is not
merely about personal distress.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.810
It is about the drunkard's
concern for the country.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.750
The letter calls to mind
a revered text entitled,

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.800
Yueyang lou ji, Record of
the Pavilion at Yueyang,

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.190
written in 1046 by the scholar

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:21.840
and distinguished
official Fan Zhongyan.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.060
Fan's essay commemorated the
renovation of the pavilion

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.470
at Yueyang, which was
accomplished by a man

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.440
who had been slandered
at court and demoted

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.600
to a remote area,
Southcentral China.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.580
There in the face of
adversity he devoted himself

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.550
to the citizens of his district
and renovated the pavilion.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.680
At the end of his essay,
Fan admonished his readers

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.930
to follow ancient paragons,
who like his acquaintance,

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:52.990
"first feel concern, or you,
for the concerns of the world.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.010
Defer pleasure until the
world can take pleasure."

00:38:56.010 --> 00:39:00.990
So, first feel concern or you
for the concerns of the world,

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.170
defer pleasure until the
world can take pleasure.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.250
This, I argue, is the melancholy
that afflicts Chen's drunkard,

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.740
a worry or concern for
the state of the country.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.590
Within this remarkable
album leaf, diverse

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.390
and contending genres
and manners

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.470
of representation are at play.

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.100
Perhaps most striking to Chen's
original audience was the

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.500
drunkard's facial expression,
appropriated from the repertoire

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.250
of print illustrators.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.270
Surely it upset the expectation

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.070
that gentleman be shown
indecorous impassivity.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.880
But Chen embedded his
picture into a story

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.370
about the hallowed Confucian
tradition of public service,

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.760
which to all accounts sanctioned
his irreverent painting

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.350
of an emotionally
distressed gentleman.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.070
And this brings me to
the end of my brief,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.870
but sentimental history.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.670
Thank you for listening.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:40:02.250
[ Applause ]

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.550
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Wang:
Thank you, Professor.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.850
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson:
Thank you.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.150
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Wang: Your
questions please.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.050
&gt;&gt; In some way this is
a predictable question.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.350
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson:
That's okay.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:47.090
&gt;&gt; But, so you started out your
talk mentioning the difference

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:58.180
that you noticed between
European expression of emotions

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:12.120
and the Chinese in this
moments 16th and 17th century.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:16.070
I wonder if you had thought
about, if it's just come

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:20.220
up in your [inaudible]
because the idea of affect

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.140
and emotion is like, you
can't get away from it

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.150
in contemporary writing
American-European,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.800
not just painting but
[inaudible] maybe.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.580
I was just wondering
if you're like --

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.830
if you thought about
mythologically,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.850
like how those concerns
of affect, will they too

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.290
or don't play to, how you're
viewing emotion and [inaudible]?

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.730
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: In
truth, I have read affect theory

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.390
but I have not -- this is a
recent discovery, frankly.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:48.200
I only in the last month
connected Chen Hongshou's

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.390
drunkard with that
very famous prose text.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.690
And so, I in fact, no.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.090
In short. No I have
not connected it

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.580
with other writings on affect.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.960
I was very behind in
the readings on emotion.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.380
And there has been just
recently, as I mentioned,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:04.010
quite a bit of work on
emotion on Chinese literature.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:08.790
And it was actually through
that reading that I, of course,

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.330
it's text of Fan Zhongyan
is extremely famous.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:12.950
So, there've been
multiple essays written

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.020
about how melancholy
is defined in China.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.510
And it was always
referred to that text.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.540
And then when I thought
about Chen's the letter

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.280
and his concern about the
bandits and the invasions,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.890
incursions into the
Chinese territory,

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:27.190
I went in that direction.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.490
But affect theory, no.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.790
I haven't gone there, yet.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.090
I may. But I'm most
familiar with affect theory,

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.390
having written a review
of Jonathan Hayes book

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.690
on the sensualist surface
-- what is it called?

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:36.190
Some of you would know that.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.590
You two would know.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:39.890
[Laughs, inaudible response].

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.190
The Sensuist Serf [assumed
spelling] -- [laughs].

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.060
They had to read it, I know.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:50.950
So, that was more about
wanting to touch and wanting

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.250
to touch the ceramics.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.930
That is how he uses it.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.740
And the theorists whom he
cites are engaged with that.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.290
So, this is not where
I was going.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.790
In terms of going
to touch something.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.280
Is that -- did I
answer your question?

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.580
Okay. Good.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.510
Yes.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:44:03.330
[ Inaudible question ]

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.540
Yes. You're absolutely right.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:11.950
In fact, just the other day,
in a wild hurry to return books

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:18.110
to the National Gallery of Art
Library, I read parts of a book

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.400
on British art that
you're referring to.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.030
And indeed, there were
very strong feelings

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:31.250
about not showing feeling
and especially in men.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.280
So, this is not unusual.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.430
It's the reasons for not
doing it differ, I suspect.

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:42.380
I'm not familiar enough
with the European situation

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.020
but I think the Chinese
situation is also very complex.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:50.280
And most people will argue it's
because of Confucian decorum.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.580
Smoothing the face.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.540
You know, you find these in text

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.710
that date back to
the 6th century.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.130
But my question was, well,

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.940
certainly surely things
[inaudible] change when you get

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.540
into the 16th century
and that they were --

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.820
it was more complex and there
were other issues involved.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.420
But you're absolutely right.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.980
The thing that really struck
me as being so different,

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.620
though, was the La Brun.

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.560
And his book -- or based on
a lecture about the passions

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.030
that he gave to the
Academy in the 17th century

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.830
where he was talking
about muscular, I mean,

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:28.170
focused on muscular contractions
in every face that he described.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.810
And that is what's
missing -- or not missing.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.770
Is not relevant to
the Chinese case.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.930
Because of the completely
different notion

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.620
of how a face moves
and how a body moves.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.220
But your point was
absolutely correct.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.210
Yes. Absolutely taken,
well taken.

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.290
That class distinction
determines --

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.970
will determine pictorial
representation of emotion.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.480
Any other questions?

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:02.140
So, did convince you all that
Hongshou was incorporating --

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.670
or appropriating
print convention?

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:06.390
I'd really love to know
from you, other historians

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.690
in the audience, actually.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.080
Oh, dear, I hope I did.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.880
[Laughs].

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:22.210
[ Inaudible response ]

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:26.210
I'm sorry, I didn't catch.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.510
[Inaudible response].

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.590
Oh, this one of the
drunkard on the banana palms,

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.470
which by the way, for decades
and decades was identified

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.990
as a self-portrait of Hongshou.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:40.780
And I disagree entirely.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.200
And the Met has recently
overturned that --

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.880
has removed that label from
[inaudible] from the leaf.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.940
This comes from the
Metropolitan.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.300
You can -- the Met
is very generous

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.350
in their -- don't touch that.

00:46:56.350 --> 00:47:00.920
Very generous in their -- at
their site, their website.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:06.110
You just type in
Hongshou and you can get

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.270
to this and download it.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:11.570
[Inaudible response].

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:12.870
It's an album.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.000
It's an album.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.300
So, like this.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.620
You -- yes.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.380
And it's -- this is
an interesting one

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.680
in that it also has pictures,
paintings by his son.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.630
So, I think the album was put
together by somebody else.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:31.730
I don't think Chen
Hongshou put it together.

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.620
Most people date it
to about the 1630s.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:40.230
But it was actually
assembled after that time.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:41.860
I'm sorry, I misunderstood
your question.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.660
Yes.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:48:02.960
[ Inaudible question ]

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.430
Because, when gentleman were
not supposed to be shown

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.040
with any kind of
distress or emotion.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.150
I mean, even if they were
worried -- you got that part.

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.380
So, how did he reanimate this?

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.890
How did he go about doing this?

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:18.930
I'm arguing that it's because
-- he was a print designer.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:25.290
So, he did make illustrations
for printed books in the 1630s.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.850
And at first I thought, well,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:28.480
it must have come
from that experience.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.300
But this picture is often
dated prior to that time.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.670
So, I think he may have
been inspired by books

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.280
with which he was familiar.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.310
Which often were illustrated.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.410
This was the prime time
for printed illustration.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:49.170
The -- no one else did it.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:51.250
Is what's so extraordinary
about Hongshou.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.080
And I think that -- you
know, he's -- I've said it.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.740
There's only one
sentence in which I --

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.500
or phrase that I said he
was noted for being weird.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.890
His contemporaries said
he's strange and startling.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:07.090
There was one collector
who claimed that he had

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:09.620
to put his paintings in a box
because he could only look

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.920
at them for so much --

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.240
for so long and he had
to keep them hidden.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.200
And there are many,
many commentators write

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.590
about the oddity
of Chen Hongshou.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.830
In fact, most contemporary --
people who are writing today,

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:23.660
will focus, he's weird.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.330
But I began to wonder, well,

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.580
what exactly did they think
was weird about Chen Hongshou.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.870
I mean people in
the 17th century.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:34.840
And because not very many
art writers will say, well,

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.540
it's because of this
or because of that.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.130
They'll just say, it's odd.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:40.500
Some -- there's one
person I know who wrote

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.020
about the distortion of form.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.320
But they don't use that word.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.030
That is a word that
modern scholars use.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.380
So, my thought about
what was odd

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.760
for contemporary viewers
was the juxtaposition

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.710
of disparate genres.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:58.510
Print was not considered
as important as painting.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:05.390
I mean, it was a -- I was
questioned about this at CASVA.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:07.270
And it didn't really occur

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:10.370
to me how really radically
different China is.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:13.860
I can count on one hand,
and I would be hard

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.590
to finish my fingers, with
the number of painters

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.800
who also were print makers.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.380
Now in the 17th century
in Europe, you know,

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.680
hundreds and hundreds.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:32.550
Right? So, it's a totally
different engagement with print.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:36.030
Most of the print designers, we
don't even know who they are.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.330
We know the engravers.

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:38.860
What's curious, we
know the block cutters.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:41.940
But we don't the people
who designed the pictures.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.150
Except in the case of
really famous painters

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.860
such as Chen Hongshou,
[foreign name].

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.840
But again, two, and then.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.140
Not too many.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.440
So, that's a really
major difference.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.740
So, incorporating print into
this very esteemed genre

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.670
or painting or thing, painting,
was I'm beginning to think

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.030
or that was my theory, anyway.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.660
It's what made him
weird to his audience.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.960
His first audience.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.170
Yes. It doesn't seem
so weird to us.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.530
But I think it may have been.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:15.730
And he's juxtaposing other very
incongruous manners of drawing

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.030
in this particular picture.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.220
We get -- let's see
if I can go backward.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:24.020
I think I have the [inaudible].

00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.470
Somewhere back here.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.920
There. He -- sorry.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.660
He's trying to give
the sense of illusion.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.710
Of three-dimensionality
in the robe.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:40.430
With the stripes of the dark
gray, and then the white.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:44.430
Which was an antique
manner of drawing.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:46.980
How he came to know
about this, I don't know.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.850
Many people have argued that
he was looking at forgeries

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:55.050
and the oddity of his
representation was

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.300
because he was looking
at fake paintings

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.120
that were popular at this time.

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.030
But the flatness of the
face and those signs

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:06.050
of sorrow are not
three -dimensional.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.500
So, you've got the
three-dimensional,

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.800
you've got the flat.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.600
You've got different things

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.650
that are clashing
against one another.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.440
So, it's not just the
print and the painting.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:19.890
It's other things, I think,
that are at work here, clashing.

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:24.660
And that is what, I think,
was discomforting and unusual

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.410
to his contemporaries, in my
opinion now, today, anyway.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:29.710
[Laughs]. Yes.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:35.290
&gt;&gt; I have a question
that -- about emotion.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:36.770
[inaudible] for the --
language of [inaudible].

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:43.770
Looking at the fine
lines of Chen Hongshou,

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:46.460
he was a great artist
[inaudible] craft.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.490
I was thinking about
his contemporaries,

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.810
[inaudible] who expressed
his emotions

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:57.760
through the brushstrokes.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.410
Do you consider including,
in your [inaudible] emotions

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:08.870
in Chinese paintings emoted
through the brush language --

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.940
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: Through
the body or gesture, you mean?

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.110
Or actually the stroke, itself?

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:14.410
&gt;&gt; The strokes.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:21.200
Because two ways of painting
the [inaudible] the psychology

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.910
of artist.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:33.000
Maybe it's fair to say the
same about [inaudible].

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.900
Brushstrokes are very
nervous, direct --

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.070
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: Mm-hmm.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:46.610
Indeed. I have not -- this
is a work in progress.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:51.430
And this is actually just very
recent work that I've done.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.920
So, no, I can't say that
I've gone in that direction

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:58.780
but thank you for reminding
me though, of the more --

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:02.460
Chen Hongshou is extremely
restrained as you point out.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:06.910
Even when he's working
with dry ink on paper.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.290
It's still restrained
and very quiet

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:13.040
in the way he uses his brush.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.900
And extremely disciplined.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.200
Tight and controlled.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.360
Whereas [inaudible] is a
different kind of control

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.660
but nonetheless, it's --

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.000
one seems to respond
kinesthetically, I think.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.530
Is that what you're
kind of getting at?

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.220
No, I have not explored that.

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.120
But that would certainly
be worth exploring.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.600
Indeed, as another form of
emotion in Chinese painting.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.620
Which I confess, I -- my
husband is a Europeanist

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.020
and I often tease him
about one thing or another.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:46.150
Of course, assuming the
Chinese art is superior.

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.370
But I had to confess, I
had not really admitted

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:53.220
to myself how subtle
these signs of emotion are

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.720
in Chinese figure painting.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.750
So, this was actually revelatory
to me, to do this work

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.020
and to look so closely
at this things.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.850
I mean just the little eyes
going -- and that's it.

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.770
You know. So, that's why
I was really interested

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.070
in the [foreign language] works.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:19.030
[Foreign language] work on the
musculature and medical theory.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.750
Found really useful for that.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.220
Anyway, that's going off your
subject of [foreign language].

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:32.040
&gt;&gt; I'm going to look over to
the subject to the spirit of --

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.950
to the areas of the theater.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:38.250
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson:
Indeed, yes.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.470
That's a huge question.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.150
For those of you
who are unfamiliar.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:52.020
There's been quite a bit
of work on the relationship

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.250
between printed illustration
and the theater.

00:55:55.250 --> 00:56:02.270
And a number of scholars,
both Chinese and also people

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:08.460
who are trained in this country
have argued that the drama

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.700
of printed illustration came

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.500
from the print designers
seeing plays.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.030
And that it was a
memetic exchange.

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.090
So, that they copied the
gestures that they saw in a play

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.130
and put it in their
illustrations.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.720
I personally have generally
been opposed to that.

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:33.440
I can't see a designer
needing to go to a play

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.230
to actually -- and to copy it.

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.240
I mean, I know that
there are copies.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.650
There actually are
representations of plays

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.010
in the prints and
they don't really look

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:44.840
like the emotional pict --

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.080
so, I think there's
actually a distinction

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.180
between the way a play is
represented in a print.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.460
And then the way emotion
is represented in a print.

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.820
And so, I'm not -- I think it's
much more indebted to painting.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.120
Conventions of painting rather

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.530
than to opera, operatic
gestures.

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.740
We also don't know very
much about the gestures.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.020
And nonetheless, someone
at CASVA reminded me

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.890
of Bassano [phonetic
spelling] painting experience

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.970
in 15th century Italy?

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:18.270
Right? Okay.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:22.150
And he was interested in
gesture as well in that book.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:23.890
Not a large part of it.

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:26.090
But there is a small
part of it on gesture.

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:29.150
Where he emphasized that we need

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:30.490
to know what these
gestures mean.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.200
So, how do we find out?

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.090
And he went to --
instead of suggesting this

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.620
from a memetic relationship,
with drama,

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:41.440
he went to -- where did he go?

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.950
Now it's slipping my brain.

00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.470
He -- oh, I know.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:53.980
He -- when monks had to
take vows of silence,

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.280
what were their hand gestures?

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.770
And so he found text that
described the gestures of monks.

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:05.210
That's another -- that's one of
my things on my to-do list here.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:09.020
because I think that kind
of approach might be --

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.810
would suit my intellectual
inclinations more than the idea

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:17.050
of copying the way a gesture
was performed on stage.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:20.700
But there is no question on
the other hand, I don't think

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:26.370
that this gesture of the hand
to the face, meant sorrow.

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:31.270
And it could be that there
was just general knowledge,

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:35.890
as Bassano would say --
I'm causing trouble here.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:39.440
General knowledge that
this gesture meant sorrow.

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:43.290
So, I'm still working
on that issue.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:45.600
But it's a very important
one, I think, actually.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.930
His opera was so important
during that period.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:53.050
&gt;&gt; You just mentioned
that you seem

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:56.970
to prefer the Chinese painting

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.720
because the [inaudible] you
think is a little bit superior

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.020
in your opinion?

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.320
I understand that --

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.620
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson:
Oh, I just tease --

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.820
this is a source of
teasing for my husband.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:11.030
I shouldn't even have
mentioned something so bold.

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.240
But it's true.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.540
[Laughing, inaudible response].

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:17.840
Sorry. Would you
repeat your question?

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.140
I was overwhelmed with
feeling embarrassed.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:21.770
&gt;&gt; You just mentioned

00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:23.210
that something is more
superior in your mind.

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.960
Could you elaborate that?

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.260
Because --

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:29.560
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: You
know, to tell you the truth I --

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.690
the time I've spent at CASVA
I have a new appreciation

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:32.990
of even Italian art.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:35.320
And I have never
loved Italian art.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.230
And you have to love
Italian art at CASVA.

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:40.770
And another thing that I
must say, I was really moved

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:45.480
by the Bellini and the
Piata, and the words that --

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.940
those swelling eyes
will bring groans.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:51.160
And there is something that is
so moving, so very beautiful.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.070
So, I confess -- I
confess this to my husband.

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:57.030
I was simply ignorant.

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.410
There you have it.

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.080
They're just really,
really different.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.170
And that's where I
guess my interest

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:07.800
in drawing contrast now,
which I was frankly,

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.160
never interested in doing.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.540
Is to highlight how really
different the Chinese situation

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:14.900
is or case.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:20.260
I don't -- I'm less interested
in comparative studies that try

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.710
to -- well, most recently a
book on [foreign language]

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:26.960
in the same book with
[foreign language].

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.480
It's a brilliant book
and beautifully written.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.400
But, you know, I question is
she trying to go too far to try

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.610
to create this early modern
spirit in China and Europe.

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:43.420
I'm not entirely
convinced by that.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:48.090
But the -- I take
back everything I said

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:49.400
about [laughs].

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.310
Actually, I love
European art a lot.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:57.910
There were just certain
periods that I was biased about.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:00.090
No more.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.390
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Wang: Alright.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:02.690
I get right on.

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:03.990
&gt;&gt; Anne Burkus-Chasson: Okay.

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:05.290
[Laughs].

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.590
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Wang:
Thank you for coming.

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:07.890

Thank you, very much.
