00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
&gt;&gt; I'd like to welcome Rick Moonen from Las
Vegas, R M Seafood, and also on this season's

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.170
"Top Chef Masters," which I'm sure hopefully
he'll want to talk about.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.349
So Rick, if you don't mind, I'll give the
floor to you.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.349
Thanks for coming here.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.289
Rick Moonen: All right. It's a pleasure.
I'm thrilled to be here. Thank you very much.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.289
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.289
Rick Moonen: Thanks for coming in and listening
to me talk at you today a little bit.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.050
I've got about 45 minutes to just give you
a little bit of "The World According to Me"

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.969
in the world of seafood.
And then, we'll have like some 15 minutes

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.219
or so to just Q and A.
Talk about anything.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.949
So I'm going to briefly touch on some subjects
that I can talk about for hours, but that's

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.999
not why I'm here.
I'm just kind of like giving you an idea.

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.569
I wrote a cookbook last year called, "Fish,
Without a Doubt.”

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.149
And the reason for "Without A Doubt" is because,
there's so many confusions around seafood.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.690
I've been in the hospitality industry for
30 years.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.150
So, I've seen a lot of changes.
I've seen a lot of advances.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.100
And we're at a critical point of our lives
right now that, if we don't do something,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.370
or understand a lot more about our oceans,
we could lose our oceans, right?

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.360
That's the truth of it all, and that's the
scary part.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.970
And I hope that it scares people enough to
motivate them to take some action.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.870
And that's my ulterior motive today is to
kind of like, leave you with that feeling

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.250
that, "Holy Smokes. This isn't an option anymore.
It's a call to arms."

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.610
I'm going to give you a little bit of my bio
 -- a little verbal bio of myself.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.540
I graduated from the Culinary Institute of
America, which was -- and still is -- considered

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.820
one of the best schools in the world for culinary
arts, learning about cooking.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.620
Graduated first in my class in 1978.
That's a long time ago, and the world was

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.550
different then.
I went into New York City, and I worked at

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.810
a restaurant called, "La Cote Basque." from
1980 to '82.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.500
I was there for two years.
I was the Saucier.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.520
Saucier is just like this very big position.
You're in charge of all the stocks, the sauces,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.140
sauteeing everything on the line.
And as it would just -- I was cooking meat,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.399
actually, I was on the stage where I really
cooked meat.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.819
On the other end of the line was a chef called
Charlie Palmer, who is pretty well-known today.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.650
And he was cooking fish.
And as it turns out, he's got the meat restaurant,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.780
I got the fish restaurant, but that's just
the way it was back then.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.049
I went to Key West, Florida, after that, because
I wanted to see something out of New York

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.049
City.
That's where I grew up.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.079
I grew up in a part of the suburb of New York
called Flushing, which was really -- in the

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.849
60's and the 70's, when I was growing up -- was
a really melting pot.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.819
There was a lot of ethnic diversity.
You know, across the street from me was the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.849
Greek family.
Then, there was Catholics and Jews and Italians

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.409
and Irish, and you name it, it was all in
the same neighborhood.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.139
And there was traditions that went along with
it.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.989
So it was a pretty cool place for me to grow
up as far as learning about diversity of the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.450
world, you know, if you were going to be in
one area.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.490
So I wanted to leave.
So I went down to Key West, Florida.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.090
I stayed down there for nine months.
I went fishing a lot.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.930
I worked in a restaurant.
There was a lot of seafood down there, and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.680
I saw a lot about what freshness really meant.
I would have guys -- shrimpers -- come to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.870
my back door with bags of mixed-size shrimps
that they just caught that day, selling it

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.069
for five dollars a pound just so they could
have some drinking money.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.310
It was an education for me, but it was also
an exposure to real, super-pristine freshness.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.499
Went back to New York City after being in
Key West for nine months, because I realized

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:37.040
New York was really the place to be.
And I got a job at Le Cirque, another very

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.409
well-known, high-end French restaurant.
Because when I got out of school, it was French.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.090
There wasn't American restaurants.
There wasn't a lot of diversity.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.200
Cuisine was considered -- if you wanted to
go into a great training experience -- it

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.510
was the French restaurants.
And there was a lot of them.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.209
And that slowly evolved into what we see of
more cross-cultural and more ethnic-focused

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.879
restaurants in neighborhoods in New York City.
Stayed at Le Cirque for two years.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.769
I was the Saucier there as well.
Went on to a couple of other smaller restaurants

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.889
from there.
Le Relais, French restaurant where I had my

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.550
first chef job.
It was a small bistro, bustling, busy.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.940
Went in the kitchen, just worked like crazy
and just tried to make sense of it all.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.560
Worked at a place called Bar Louie.
Consulted that.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.430
Got them set up with their -- it was a large
restaurant down by the NYU, a University in

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.100
New York City.
And they were bustling.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.210
It was an Italian restaurant, and I set up
all the sauces and the systems and everything.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.110
Eventually went to my own restaurant called
Chelsea Central.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.840
My first review from the New York Times was
a two-star review from Brian Miller who was

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.170
the reviewer at the time.
It was a turning point for my career, because

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.020
you really 'den, den, den,' all of a sudden
celebrity started to get involved.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.170
Because when I went to school, it was just
a -- it was a profession.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.470
It was a vocation.
You were working 12 hours a day, six days

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.870
of the week, and you really weren't getting
any kind of special recognition for it.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.561
But when I finally went to The Water Club,
things started to change a little bit.

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:18.480
This is a little more than 20 years ago.
It was 1988 when I started.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.180
I started on 8/8/88, as a matter of fact.
Yesterday was 9/9/09, so.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.270
This is one of those dates I could remember.
And I stayed there for four years.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.860
And during that time frame, I got involved,
not only -- I started to put on different

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.250
hats.
I started to see some changes, some shifts.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.170
People started to ask more questions.
You weren't just a cuisineer anymore.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.210
You needed to know more about people's diets.
You know, because you had the Atkin's Diet.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.471
If your guests were asking you, you know,
they told you they were on the Atkin's Diet,

00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.420
you were expected to know what that meant
and how you were going to feed them, and what

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.870
on the menu didn't conform to the Atkin's
Diet, or this diet, or that diet.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.370
And then there was the need to learn a little
bit more about the environment.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.890
How things were caught.
Sourcing of food became more of a focus because

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.440
of media, knowledge, you know, education of
the consumer.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:15.740
I started to realize that the tuna that they're
purchasing or consuming is affecting dolphins,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.640
you know.
So they wanted to know how it was caught.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.150
And so, now you had to start to source out
a little bit with more information so that

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.540
you could provide your guests, who come to
your restaurant, with the certain level of

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.610
trust that you're going to take care of them,
and that you can answer these questions.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.410
So the role of the chef definitely went through
an evolution during that time frame, and I

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.550
got involved as an activist and an environmentalist
when I started speaking out about genetically-engineered

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.160
foods.
That was 20 years ago.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.230
And I was interviewed, by happenstance, when
I was with a group of chefs on the steps of

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.340
City Hall.
And a gentleman with a microphone asked me

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.280
if I would make a comment about genetically-engineered
foods, and I'm like, "What's that?”

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.850
You know, I'm hanging out with a bunch of
other chefs.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.860
We're dressed up in chef jackets because we're
getting our picture taken because of our contribution

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.840
the increase of tourism in New York City.
And so, I get this microphone put in my face,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.090
and he's telling me that, "Well, genetically
engineered foods is where they're taking,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:23.060
you know, fruits and vegetables and they're
changing them and altering them with the genes

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.000
of other animals and bacteria etc. to alter
them so that they can give them longer shelf-lives

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.800
etc.”
And I was like, "Wow, that's pretty radical."

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.470
So I made a comment.
I said, "Hi. My name's Rick Moonen.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.670
I'm the executive chef at The Water Club.
I think Mother Nature has been doing a terrific

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.970
job for a millennium, and really, if we're
going to spend our money, we should put it

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.521
best spent in distribution of really, good
organic foods, because it just didn't seem

00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:50.220
to make it into too many people's houses.
Thank you.”

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.370
That made it on the radio, and it was one
of those radio stations that repeated a sound

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.500
bite every hour.
And so, all of a sudden I'm getting phone

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.790
calls from something I knew nothing about
a few hours ago, genetically engineered foods.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.481
So I'm suddenly the expert to go to.
So I realize at that point I needed to find

00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.830
out more.
And this is, again, in the late eighties.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.580
So the only thing you had was a fax machine
and a phone.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.030
You know, we didn't have all these things
on our laps.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.160
And I made a few phone calls.
I got the New York Times, looked up a genetically-engineered

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.889
food article, and I realized that Dr. Rebecca
Goldberg and this guy named -- Oh, what was

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:28.430
his name?
He was a big activist.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.880
Jeremy Rifkin! Big activist in D.C.
Called him up and said, "I need more information.”

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.430
They faxed me a ream of paper.
And I'm sitting there reading and just wigging

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.890
out over the fact that there's no premarket
safety testing on these things.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.150
There's flounder genes in your tomatoes, whether
you know it or not, because flounders are

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.170
found that they can freeze, and they can thaw
out.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.060
A flounder will live. "Oh, that's cool.
Let's take that gene, put it in a tomato,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.560
and now we got frost-resistant tomatoes.”
[low whistle] Whoo.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.141
20 years later, we got Food Incorporated going
on in our lives.

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:03.120
And it's scary, you know?
But back then, I was realizing that no pre-market

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.070
safety testing, no mandatory labeling.
So I can't even find out if I'm getting it

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.711
or not as a food product.
So I spoke out about it.

00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:14.061
And I ended up talking to a bunch of chefs.
We ended up having a press conference.

00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:18.250
The press conference turned into a Chef's
Coalition for the Pure Food Campaign.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.800
Five hundred chefs later, you know, a few
months later, sending out letters.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.380
Everybody's up in arms about their food, where
it's coming from, how they can't answer the

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.350
concerns of their customers anymore, because
if you had an analogy to a flounder, how would

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.430
I know if you were having a tomato salad today?
I can't tell you that anymore.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.040
That was just wrong, and that's really what
we're reacting to.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.820
I'm a chef.
But somehow I ended up becoming more than

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.930
that.
Then I went from The Water Club to a restaurant

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:50.540
called Oceana where my life went Boof.
Single subject. Seafood restaurant.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.920
Had lots of experience. Been in Key West.
Went fishing. Went fishing with my dad.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.960
Went to the Culinary Institute of America.
Graduated first in my class.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.560
I've got all the right things going on.
Now I've got the single subject of the oceanic

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.150
world, Oceana.
And I got a phone call from Nora Pouillon,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.180
who's the chef that has an all-organic restaurant
in D.C.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.110
We had done things together, talking on panels
about genetically-engineered foods.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.839
And she got involved in a program called,
"Give Swordfish a Break.”

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:27.190
Now, swordfish -- North Atlantic swordfish
 -- beautiful animal, pelagic, goes all over

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.520
the world.
And if they'd found out, or they did some

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.810
statistics, some studies, that if we don't
change the way we were buying North Atlantic

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.020
swordfish, purchasing and catching it -- or,
hunting it, really.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.940
It's not just catching, it's hunting -- that
it was going to become commercially extinct

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.170
in the next five years.
I was like, "Woe.”

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.300
And because I was going to the Fulton Fish
Market on a regular basis when I was a chef

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.220
at The Water Club, I realized that there were
some major changes from my own personal experience.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.110
I'd seen -- when I was at the Fulton Fish
Market -- the size of the fish diminish.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.660
They categorize them.
Swordfish that's under a hundred pounds is

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.100
called a "pup."
Between 100 pounds and 200 pounds, it's called

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:11.670
a "marker.”
Two hundred and above, it's a "double marker.”

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.430
And on and on.
I'm going to guess that at 300 or above, it's

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.170
probably a "triple marker.”
Now, I used to see double markers all the

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.350
time.
I used to purchase them.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.480
You know, when I was at The Water Club, we
did some major volume.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.640
I'd buy entire fish.
It was a great steak on a grill for large

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.550
parties, banquets.
Grilled swordfish was very, very, very well-appreciated.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.640
I started seeing smaller and smaller.
I mean, to the point where, it was more common

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.750
on the Fulton Fish Market to find pups, 100
pounds and lower.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:43.000
And when I was asked to be a part of, "Give
Swordfish a Break," well, I saw that there

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.320
was concern, so I joined.
I said, "Why not?”

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.990
And I ended up becoming a poster-child spokesperson
for it.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:58.860
And I never looked back. You know.
What it was, was an awareness campaign to

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.370
alert people that, "If we kind of lay off
of this fish a little bit? It'll make a recovery.”

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.720
But it was more so trying to get government
regulations to happen.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.899
In the history of these regulatory agencies
trying to be persuaded to do the right thing,

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:20.110
they normally -- it was difficult.
Whereas with this nationwide awareness program,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.470
motivated agencies to actually make regulatory
changes internationally.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:32.370
And North Atlantic swordfish became on a path
of sustainability, which is amazing and it

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:38.630
was historic.
I ended up going from Oceana, after I got

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.502
involved with "Give Swordfish a Break," I
went and opened up my own restaurant in New

00:12:41.502 --> 00:12:45.040
York City.
And now I'm in Sin City, Nevada -- Las Vegas,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.990
Nevada -- for the last five years, running
my own restaurant.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:52.040
It's called Rick Moonen's RM Seafood.
And it's about all different kinds of layers.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.690
From downstairs as a casual cafe where there's
recognizable seafood items like gumbos and

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.830
chowders.
We have a sushi area. I have a raw bar area.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:07.150
And upstairs is my fine dining floor, where
the white tablecloths, the fancy linen and

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:16.920
silver come out, and we deliver a topnotch,
expensive, high-end experience.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.240
When I graduated from The Culinary Institute
in '78, there was not a part of that -- and

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.640
this is considered the finest culinary school
in the United States -- there wasn't even

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.820
a program on seafood.
In 1976 when I started there, it wasn't a

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.890
part of the curriculum.
There was nothing about fabrication of fish.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:43.520
There wasn't anything about product identification.
Because seafood is confusing to most people.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:51.910
And there's many, many reasons why it's confusing.
I was not really capable of finding too much

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.390
sources on seafood, you know?
I'm thinking about back on, you know, you

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:01.649
go through an entire culinary school, and
the only exposure that you had to seafood

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:05.110
was from appetizers.
And that's really all that was being offered

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.620
in restaurants at the time.
I have a couple of menus.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:14.520
This is a menu from Chicago in the 1970s.
And just for the heck of it before I came

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.940
out here, I decided to open it up and look
at it, because I just wanted to know in the

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.709
70's, what was being offered in restaurants.
And this isn't necessarily a seafood restaurant,

00:14:21.709 --> 00:14:27.940
but really, what you would have is shrimp
cocktail, crabmeat cocktail, smoked Nova Scotia

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:35.750
salmon, baked clams, clams in red sauce.
You know, you would find dishes that were

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.839
just very, very basic.
You weren't -- and back in that time that's

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:44.320
when fish had -- and dishes had -- names to
them.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.750
You knew what "florentine" was.
Florentine meant that there was spinach in

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.060
it.
I've got a list of things here.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.291
Bonn femme.
These are classic dishes.

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:59.300
This is what you learned.
But it was only like five or six or seven

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.930
different types of things that you learned
and that was it.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.450
Diversity of what was being served in the
United States was very narrow.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:12.970
You knew that "almondine" meant almonds.
A la Genevoise. If something was sauteed genevoise,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.959
it meant that there was going to be capers
and lemon and croutons, and maybe a little

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:19.180
bit of brown sauce around the outside.
Florentine was spinach.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:25.200
You had Thermador, Rockefeller, Veronique,
and maybe that was about it.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.690
Those were recognizable names.
You didn't really find anything that was being

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:39.000
innovatively handled.
And that started to happen.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.670
I guess it took maybe another 10, 15 years
before you started to see on menus things

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.480
like this.
You know, poached Ecuadoran shrimp, arugula

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.870
roasted baby beets, lime ginger vinaigrette.
You started to see more focus on products.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:04.190
You know, "day boat diver sea scallops seared
with," you know, and then they'll tell you

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.040
the farm that the corn came from and how it
was done.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.870
And that became more of the norm on a menu.
So you went from classic dishes that you understood

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.830
and moved into more of a innovative style
of dealing with the ocean.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:23.990
But there was still confusion, and why?
First of all, names.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.540
The nomenclature, or the "name game," I call
it.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.410
You know, just common names of fish just don't
exist.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.310
You can change the name any given day, any
given moment.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.110
The U.S. sea robin, for instance.
This is a nuisance fish.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.020
If you're out at sea fishing, you get sea
robins and you throw them back.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.529
They're junk fish.
They're a pain in the neck. They're taking

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:48.860
your bait.
But basically, that same fish -- same genus

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.450
and species -- is one of the bases for bouillon
base in France.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:58.800
It's just about confusion and misunderstanding.
Black fish. When I was at Oceana, I popularized

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.900
a dish.
It was made out of a local fish out of Long

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.269
Island.
It was called tautog, or black fish.

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:07.179
But anybody that would fish it in Long Island
would see it as junk fish, and they couldn't

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:10.429
understand why I was serving it on a three
star menu in New York City.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:16.600
Because fish is good. It's all up here.
A lot of it is about us stepping outside of

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.110
a comfort zone, you know, and understanding
a little bit more about fish.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:25.110
But how can you understand and embrace fish
when they're changing their name every other

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:29.950
day?
A popular fish that's endangered today -- or

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.330
is certainly, if it's not completely endangered,
is on the path to be -- is Chilean sea bass,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:40.780
originally known as Patagonian toothfish.
A beautiful fish that was another marketing

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.710
name-change game was Orange Roughy.
Orange Roughy, great fish.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.360
How many people have heard of Orange Roughy?
Do you know what it was called before it was

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.049
Orange Roughy? Slimehead.

00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:51.049
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:54.210
Rick Moonen: That's what it was called.
Now, if you came into Oceana, and I had my

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.260
captain come up to you and say, [in a French
accent] "Tonight, chef Rick Moonen has prepared

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.110
the slimehead very nicely for you with blah
blah," you're not going to listen to it.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.400
So it's about, you know, that achievement
of comfort level.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:15.230
Oysters. They're renamed every single day.
I mean, an oyster is basically identified

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:20.140
by where it's grown, you know, and which is
actually oysters are a great example of something

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.070
that's very sustainable.
These are filtered feeding fish that clarify

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.080
the water, that keep everything healthy, that
make the eel grass grow on the bottom that

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.710
give the fish a place to hide.
It's an ecosystem.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:40.631
It's about us understanding our symbiosis
 -- our nourishing and giving back to the

00:18:40.631 --> 00:18:45.030
ecosystem that has been giving us something
that we are super-privileged to get, but we

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:51.570
abused over so many, many years.
Cod. Let's talk about just for a second.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.900
Cod is what built America.
The reason that Europeans came over to the

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.600
United States or into the Georgia's banks'
areas in the first place was, there was such

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.570
a high population of cod that you could walk
across the water on their backs.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:11.520
Cod goes under the name haddock, hake, pollock,
ling cod, true cod, scrod -- which is, I guess

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.780
just a nickname, a local colloquialism for
an immature cod -- tomcod, etc. etc. Atlantic

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.410
cod, Pacific cod.
And that's just cod.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.299
Bass. The word "bass" doesn't hardly mean
anything, because it just sounds so good it

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:34.150
gets slapped on to so many different fish.
So that's confusing layer number one.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.799
How do I tell if it's fresh?
How do I do this?

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:41.270
You know, when I was asked to do a cookbook,
"Fish Without a Doubt," is what I came up

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:47.350
with, because I was typecasted into being
a seafood chef because I was at Oceana, and

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.630
that's what I was doing.
And now I'm outspoken.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:54.130
I'm a proponent of the ocean.
Trying to get people to be aware that What

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.710
we eat affects the future or the possible
future of what we're going to eat.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:05.850
I did a little bit of research, because seafood
cookbooks generally did not sell.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.890
Because seafood is available fresh on this
coast and that coast and pretty much in the

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.970
middle, not much of anything else.
And because it's so confusing that, that's

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.320
the way it's always been.
The middle of America is eating meat and dairy

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.260
and the sides of America are eating seafood
more, but not at a crazy rate.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.730
As time would go on, we learned more that
seafood is good for us, so we have to source

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:31.049
it out.
And we -- there was a lot of questions about

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:35.730
doing a seafood cookbook.
So I did a little bit of a canvas.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.832
I asked a lot of people, "Why don't you cook
seafood at home?”

00:20:38.832 --> 00:20:44.400
"Mmm. It smells up my kitchen.
I'm not really sure how to pick it out -- tell

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.900
if it's fresh.
I don't know what to do with it.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.429
It's expensive.
If I don't cook it that day, it's bad the

00:20:48.429 --> 00:20:52.080
next day.
And what if I overcook it?”

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.600
If you overcook it, it's just unfamiliarity.
We weren't familiar with it.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.370
Well, seafood stinks.
That's what people think.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:06.010
It smells up your kitchen.
Well, when I grew up in Flushing -- I'm going

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.410
to go back to my childhood.
I think back on some things now. -- I think

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.790
it's just a matter that we're not used to
the way it smells.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.179
Good seafood cooking isn't something that's
a normal aroma in your household.

00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:20.130
I used to deliver newspapers in these apartment
buildings.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.720
And when you're in an apartment building,
the smells of what's coming out of each little

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.120
apartment is just amazing, the diversity of
 -- I mean, I was just a little kid.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.880
I was chubby. I was hungry back then.
So I was really always attracted to it all.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.570
But the reality of it is, when you come home
and there's a turkey in the oven, or there's

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:44.140
a prime rib in the oven, no one's coming home
screaming, "Ma! It smells beefy in here.”

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.679
Fish is fish. It's part of who we are.
And because it wasn't part of the American

00:21:48.679 --> 00:21:53.429
culture growing up, it was treated as something
foreign.

00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:55.410
You know, in my household, we ate it once
a week.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.440
My mother, devoted Catholic.
Fridays we're eating fish.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.370
If you eat meat on Friday, you go to hell.
So, I'm probably going to hell; I ate a hotdog

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.169
once.
But, that's what it was.

00:22:07.169 --> 00:22:10.809
You know, I mean, it could be fishsticks with
coleslaw and tartar sauce one Friday, which

00:22:10.809 --> 00:22:16.230
personally, as a kid, I loved.
Could be -- or a swordfish steak broiled under

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.120
the broiler.
Or a piece of salmon, or something different,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.440
but it was something delicious.
And it's just about that comfort.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.970
And it's about -- that's where I'm hoping
that our culture is ready to push ourselves

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.799
over the edge and get a little bit more diverse.
Because at the end of all of this, that's

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:33.919
the answer.
It's about diversity.

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:38.670
It's about getting out of your little comfort
zone of shrimp, salmon, and tuna, and that's

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.770
it.
Okay, I got my Omega-3s, I'm good.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:47.110
But the problem is that we put so much pressure
on those species that they become endangered

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.500
and nonsustainable.
So somehow we're going to have to find a comfort

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.870
of stepping outside that so.
I wanted to write a book to help out with

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:59.150
that a little bit, you know?
Say that, categorically, here's a recipe,

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.460
pick anything out of this category of fish,
and you'll have a success.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.200
And hopefully you're stepping out into a place,
you know.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.700
So you're having tilapia once in awhile.
You're having a barramundi.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:18.990
You're having fish that's outside of your
"tuna, salmon, and shrimp" box of comfort.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.570
Freshness. How do I tell if it's fresh, you
know?

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:28.600
That I rolled into the book.
The comfort of picking out a piece of meat

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.910
is not really that -- the anxiety level is
low.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.351
You know what to look for.
It's the same things when you're looking for

00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:37.380
fish.
If it's browning around the edge, or it doesn't

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.590
look right, or the coloration isn't the same,
if it's not attractive to you, you've got

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.220
all the basic skills.
And that's what I try to do.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.450
This language I'm speaking to you with, that's
the voice -- that's the language I wanted

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.830
to do a book.
I didn't want to be pretentious on a subject

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.059
that's already confusing, because that's not
going to get you anywhere.

00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:56.101
I want to say, "It's not that difficult. If
I can do it, you can do it.”

00:23:56.101 --> 00:24:00.810
And because I was doing it for so many years,
you know.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:05.160
I tried to kind of like give people an idea
like what's happening.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.470
How are fishes handled is really the most
crucial thing to the freshness.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:13.600
It's not How many hours out of the water.
Two boats fishing, same day, same bay, pulled

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.100
a fish out of the water.
Ooh! They both caught a 15-pound, striped

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.049
bass.
Mr. Number One, with a cigar in his mouth,

00:24:20.049 --> 00:24:24.010
throws it on the deck, steps on it, pulls
the hook out of the mouth, and starts fishing

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.450
again and leaves it right there.
Second person carefully takes it out, puts

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.169
it on ice, guts it, puts it there.
Fish has been out of the water for exactly

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.210
same time.
Which fish is fresher?

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.870
Well, the one that's on ice.
Well, not really.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:41.299
It's the same amount out of the water.
So it's How it's caught. It's sourcing.

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:45.840
It's so many different things.
Oh boy, more confusion, all right?

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:52.510
But, you can use your own eyes. You can tell.
If they're handled correctly, you know, and

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:57.140
you can go to a fishmonger, and you ask questions.
What I want to do is empower you to ask the

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.020
questions.
The more consistent questions that are asked

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:05.120
upon an industry that has not really focused
on being consistent is going to force them

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.179
to be consistent, and the power of where we
are right now can tell you that.

00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:15.780
Just walking through this campus is blowing
my mind, and this is where movements are changed.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:22.250
I mean, we vote with our wallets, you know?
So knowledge is incredibly powerful.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.419
And emotion behind it is what makes people
use that knowledge.

00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:29.419
So I'm here to make you all cry if I can figure
that out today.

00:25:29.419 --> 00:25:31.750
The fish, you look at it; it's supposed to
bounce back.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.760
You touch the flesh.
The scales should be all intact, the eyes

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.860
should be clear.
You know, the gills should be red.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.360
All the usual things that people are a little
bit afraid to look at.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.990
But basic instinct.
Your nose [sniff] -- it should smell like

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.780
an ocean.
Fish should smell like an ocean.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.620
They shouldn't have a stink; they should have
a scent, you know?

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:59.340
A perfuminess about them.
Cucumbery, you know?

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.110
Those are just a few of the concerns about
 -- Overcooking.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.940
All right.
Within the book I talk about playing with

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.810
your food a little bit: prodding, touching.
You've got a set of references.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.179
Every single person here has cooked an egg
I would assume.

00:26:13.179 --> 00:26:15.520
We've all fried an egg.
We've seen an egg being fried.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.620
An egg white is pure albumin practically.
You see it go out of the eggshell.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.020
It's pure, clear, see through it, translucent.
[whistles] You know that, "Well, until that's

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.090
all white, the egg whites aren't cooked."
Right?

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.220
'Cause then they turn, you can't see through
them anymore.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.170
They turn white like your shirt.
And then the yolks, depending on how you want

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.511
them cooked, you know what you're looking
for.

00:26:33.511 --> 00:26:37.750
You've learned what kind of egg you like.
Same thing with fish, you know?

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:42.130
Protein, when it cooks, changes colors.
So you just need to poke and look in there

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:46.770
a little bit, but if you put a piece of fish
in a pan, you'll notice on the bottom, it's

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.590
going to start changing color.
If it's a clear fish, you know, it's got that

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.890
translucence to it, little by little it's
going to start turning more white just like

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.100
the egg white did.
You know, if it's pink fish, you know if it's

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.679
a red fish, it turns a little lighter in color.
It turns pink.

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:02.590
But those are your set of references.
It's all just about paying attention and having

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:08.630
a little bit of fun with your food.
Touching.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.220
The way a raw piece of fish feels, it feels
like a raw piece of flesh.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.840
But, as it cooks, the proteins firm up a little
bit.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.610
So rule of thumb, if you touched your thumb
right here, you'd see it's nice and soft.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.809
If you touch your thumb to your index finger,
that muscle starts to tighten up a little

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:25.820
bit.
And as you go down a little bit more, you

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.280
touch this finger, the muscle firms up a little
more.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.950
That's like a medium rare piece of meat or
fish.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:34.080
That's more like medium. It gets firm.
And if you touch your pinky, that's as firm

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.600
as it gets.
That's like a well-done piece of meat.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.420
And if you're not sure, poke your knife in
there and look at it.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.171
And little by little you learn how to tell
the doneness of a fish.

00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:48.440
So you're not going to blow it.
You're not going to ruin a piece of ocean

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:55.530
protein by overcooking it as long as you're
willing to play around with it a little bit.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.630
And then, once you've got your set of references,
you're good.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.970
And then there's sustainability, you know?
About being responsible.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:12.490
"Where do I go? It gets so darn confusing.”
So I threaded sustainability through my book.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:15.850
What I tried to do is break it down by cooking
techniques.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:22.900
All right? And cooking techniques changed
a little bit over the years.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.289
My book -- 1977 is the copyright of this book.
This is a blue book that cover fell off.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:31.770
It's called "The Encyclopedia Of Fish Cookery,"
by A.J. McClane.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:38.420
And this is what I had to go to, because fish
cookery was not -- there wasn't a large section

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.480
in a library on this.
And if you went through.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.750
Say you're are a house cook, and you wanted
to learn how to cook fish at home.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.250
You knew how to pick it out and you were going
to bring it home and you really wanted to

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.900
know how to do it.
You had two choices.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:53.970
One that was old school which is old baked
casseroles, stinky bad fish, no-wonder-you-didn't-like-it

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.289
recipes, you know?
Or you got recipes that you could never reproduce

00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:01.600
at home.
So it's hollandaise sauce, glissage, poached

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.030
all of these other things that were just too
far ahead of it.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:08.669
But me as a professional, this was my set
of references.

00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:12.559
And I was funny, I was just thumbing through
it and cooking methods.

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:18.000
Deep frying.
Basic fish batter, thin fish batter, all part

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.360
of frying.
Deep frying in advance.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.980
Deep frying to order.
Deep frying, more deep frying.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.260
Oh, pan frying.
Sauteeing.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.490
Fish cakes.
Poaching or broiling.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:34.890
Baking and planked fish.
That's it. That's it for fish cookery.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:40.040
Now, I wanted to take it -- and take it to
a slightly different level -- so we started

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.360
talking about steaming.
Steaming fish is real simple.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.500
Aromatic steaming.
You could steam it in a bamboo steamer.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.600
Explain to you how an inexpensive thing like
that can bring you great results.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.780
Or putting them into little wrapping them
into tinfoil and letting them steam with aromatics

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:02.520
which is actually a derivative of a classic
called a fish in papyote.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:10.531
Grilling. There wasn't a lot of grilling or
barbecueing of fish, you know, many years

00:30:10.531 --> 00:30:13.270
ago.
And it didn't come in with the French influence,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:19.789
because French cuisine doesn't really embrace
grilling -- bottom grilling -- it just wasn't.

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:25.350
So you never saw that going on in French restaurants.
And that became more of an evolution, and

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.570
I was part of that.
Roasting. Slow roasting, large pieces of fish,

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:35.360
not just baking in a casserole, but actually
taking a piece of fish, coating it in something

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.500
and roasting it.
Cooking it, letting it rest, slicing it.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.710
That became more popular.
Butter-basting, where you're not just frying

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.929
something, you're putting it in a pan, and
as the butter browns, you keep putting it

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:49.490
over the top of the fish.
That's a technique that I use a lot, and I

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.870
try to introduce into "Fish Without a Doubt."
The purpose of this book is to get people

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:02.190
to take from "Dad fish" to "successful fish.”
Next book will be the fancy stuff.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:06.549
But I didn't want to intimidate anybody by
coming out with a book that was going to like,

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:10.460
continue the whole idea that you, "Well, you
make a hollandaise, and then you just fold

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.370
in some whipcream, and put it over the top,
and that's it.”

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:19.480
How many people make a hollandaise at home?
None that I know of anyway.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.170
And butter poaching and better poaching methods.
Like not boiling fish.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:28.940
Cooking it at controlled temperatures so that
the protein actually stays intact and that

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:34.481
the results come out unctuous.
And those are all techniques that I incorporated

00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:38.370
into the book.
And it's broken down by exactly that.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:46.039
And flavor combinations.
It basically gives you a matrix of possibilities,

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:49.340
you know, so that when you're going to the
store, and you've got a recipe in your hand

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.880
that you ripped out of a magazine or printed
on your computer.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.230
And you're going to the store to buy chicken
breast, broccoli, garlic, lemon grass, whatever

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.550
it is, you can get those items.
But if you're going to the store, and you're

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:07.169
going for trout, for instance.
Okay, I got a great trout recipe for all of

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:12.539
you, all right?
It's chicken fried trout with a coleslaw and

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:14.150
a tartar sauce.
Delicious.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:18.730
And you're, "Great, I'm going to go do it.”
And you run to your store and you go, "I need

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.169
trout. No trout? Ohh.”
What do you do?

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:26.250
You know you're going to find chicken.
Well, what I try to do is, accept substitutes.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.620
You know that same chicken fried trout recipe?
You can do it with tilapia.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.779
You can do it with catfish.
You can do it with mahi mahi.

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:39.220
You can do it with Arctic char.
So you've got yourself one technique, yet

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:47.000
a matrix of possibilities for success.
And that was another directive that I wanted

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.990
too.
And that's what's going to get you comfortable

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:54.179
 -- or hopefully, will get you comfortable
 -- with personally having success at home

00:32:54.179 --> 00:33:00.800
which will make you want to do it more and
more again and see some diversity.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:07.490
What really happened -- how it all came to
change was -- in my lifetime.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.320
I'm from the East Coast.
I saw when Gilbert Le Coze opened up a restaurant

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:19.190
called La Bernadette in New York City.
It started to show people that fish can be

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:23.860
treated a little bit differently and enjoyed.
It's okay to have fish that's not completely

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:30.050
cooked through if it's sourced out right.
He started to introduce carpaccios and ceviches

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:36.860
and tartars and medium-rare cooked fish.
And this is at a time where sushi wasn't even

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.279
recognized.
People weren't eating raw fish.

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:44.711
It just wasn't done.
But a restaurant in New York City got four

00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:49.419
star acclaim from New York Times, got a lot
of recognition from New York Magazine, and

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:56.220
it started to get national -- it became a
movement of seafood shifting.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:03.100
People started to go, "Ooh. Something different.”
And we start to enjoy fish and seafood in

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:09.770
a different manner.
And then, people like Julia Child came on.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.070
She had her cooking show.
And she was helping to break down.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.670
Here's this lady that everybody can embrace.
You like her.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.000
She's kind of goofy, which makes it even better,
because if you're going to talk about a pretentious

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.980
subject, being goofy is kind of cool, right?
And she'd throw this fish up on the table,

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:31.040
and it was this ugly, ugly fish called the
monk fish or an angler fish or a lotte, L-O-T-T-E.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.869
Of course, it's going to have 12 names, because
we've already had that discussion.

00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:38.390
And she goes to break it down, and you see
the little piece of the tail comes out.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:42.369
And the ugly thing goes away and it gets cooked
up and it's unbelievable.

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:45.830
The recipe is great.
And it's called "Poor man's lobster," and

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.260
we all embrace it.
Well, that's great.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.960
And that's a good start, but everybody ran
that way.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.871
Monk fish became so popular, that it became
overfished, all right?

00:34:55.871 --> 00:35:01.040
So, then you had Paul Prudhomme.
You know, he came on board and here's this

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.910
guy from Louisiana, really cool, spicy stuff,
you know, pan-blackened red fish.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:11.849
And that was fantastic 'til red fish ran out.
Because we have a tendency to be, "What's

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:17.369
next?" And we jump on board and we just fish
it to death almost.

00:35:17.369 --> 00:35:25.310
Another example of that is -- I don't even
like to talk about it -- but, it's when Japanese

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:33.510
sushi, Japanese cuisine, the respect, the
intrigue of Japanese cuisine came into the

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:39.710
mainstream United States eating habits.
I remember when I went to Nobu in New York

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:41.290
City.
Awe man, it's changed.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:47.010
I mean, I remember when I first had hamachi
with uzu and a jalapeno pepper on it.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.760
It just made me stop and I couldn't believe
it; it was so delicious.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.619
You know, blue fin tuna.
And all of these things that are just amazing

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.950
products.
Chilean sea bass is another amazing product,

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:05.109
but we need to be able to be creative enough
to realize that chefs -- gatekeepers, influential

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:12.750
people that are trying to introduce seafood
 -- that we're careful that we don't push

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.920
things in a direction that makes them fall
off of a cliff.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.800
Because fish aren't created equal.
And when I first got involved in talking out

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.940
about sustainability, it was one thing.
"Let's stop catching so many," because we've

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.970
got technology.
The last 50 years, technology has far surpassed

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.859
anything that's being hunted, all right?
I mean, nothing that's hunted today stands

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:38.640
a chance.
If we allow it, they will be completely captured

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.470
and just taken out of the ecosystem, and we
can't allow that to happen.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:46.210
Everything is here for a reason.
One thing works off another.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:50.300
They rely on each other.
And I like to use a car example, because people

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.150
seem to care more about what they put in their
cars than in their bodies, etc.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.060
And so, would you pull your precious car to
the side of the road, open the hood, take

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.700
a part out, throw it on the side, close your
hood, and expect it to drive the same? No

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.490
way.
But we do that to our ecosystem, because if

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.560
it doesn't affect us, we don't really care
about it.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:16.089
It has historically just moved on as insignificant
or not as important as it should be.

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:20.180
You know, sharks.
Peter eventually came out with a movie called

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.170
Jaws.
"Sharks are bad. I don't care if they all

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.500
go away, my kids are safer.”
Well, that's not true.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:32.250
Sharks are a necessary part of an ecosystem.
Everything plays a role, and you can't just

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:38.570
pull something out and expect that it's going
to continue to roll, you know, in a healthy

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:48.150
manner.
[pause] I am confused where I'm going next

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:55.130
to be honest with you.
Other things that I'd wanted to incorporate

00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.680
into "Fish Without A Doubt" is basically just
a level of comfort.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.500
You know, when I did this book, I tried to
immerse myself into what most people have

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:11.780
to encounter as hurdles when they decide that
they're going to cook fish at home.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.700
And that is, you know, recognizing, being
comfortable going to the market, holding on

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.980
to it, how to handle it when they get home.
And so, I had a lot of different sections

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.990
of "Fish Without A Doubt" are just illustrative.
Rub your hand over the fish, touch it, smell

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.290
it, feel it, cook it, while it's cooking,
you know, prod it.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.589
You know, here's some flavors that are going
to work, that are going to give you a much

00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:44.310
better level of success.
So back to sustainability.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.530
It wasn't just about taking too many fish
out of the ocean.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.910
And I thought that was the way it was going
to be, because there's other issues of concerns,

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:59.320
one of them being -- not just overfishing
 -- but bycatch.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.420
Different fisheries are targeted species,
boats go out after them, and they capture

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:10.849
a lot of fish that are not necessarily on
their targeted species list.

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:17.510
So there's a lot of excessive waste of bycatch.
I just wanted to give a statistic.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.080
These are the accidental capture of untargeted
species.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.720
So if you're going after pollock, for instance,
in the Bering Sea, and you've got these gigantic

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.820
trawlers, these things that are the size of
city blocks that are just, you know, removing

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:36.010
pollock from an area where they've identified
them, other fish come up with them such as

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.400
wild salmon, such as sea turtle such as other
things.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.070
And by the time they filtered out what they
wanted to bring up in the first place, everything

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:50.810
else gets pushed over the side, dead or dying.
So the tuna's like 7.3 million tons in a year.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:58.700
That's a lot of protein.
And in an ecosystem that the biomass is just

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:04.150
diminishing, we need to take that into consideration.
So I needed to take that into consideration.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.490
I didn't want to, but it's something that
I had to think about when I was trying to

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.940
decide what I was going to put on my menu
or what I was going to promote.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.630
Habitat destruction was another one.
If you destroy where they live, you know,

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:25.060
that's going to contribute to the deterioration
of a population of a species.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:32.280
So if you're going to drag these real, superheavy
nets along the bottom of the ocean floor,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.700
basically you're destroying where they live.
You're catching them, you're bringing them

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.300
up.
Let's just talk about shrimp for instance,

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.190
because people understand shrimp.
Shrimp dredging, you throw these big nets,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:45.550
and you drag them around using sonar.
"Well, there seems to be more in this area,

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.970
that area.”
But you're knocking down everything that they

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.990
need to reproduce after you're done catching
them.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:56.920
It's like clear-cutting a forest to get a
deer for dinner, and then there's no more

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.800
forest left.
And you wonder why there's no more deer the

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:05.200
next time you come back to find that deer.
Same exact mentality and it happens continuously.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.380
So habitat destruction.
So now, still trying to be a chef here and

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:18.050
trying to figure out and do the right thing.
I've got to worry about sonar, radar, just

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:22.241
technology being too strong.
Then now, you got to worry about them catching

00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:26.920
things they're not supposed to catch, and
that's a big disgusting waste.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.190
And now, it's about habitat destruction.
Let's stop messing up their world.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:34.510
Let's make sure the coral reefs are good and
everything else, so that there's a healthy

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.910
ecosystem for everything else.
Good. I'm done, right? No.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.210
The thing that I thought was the greatest
answer in the world was farming fish.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.790
We could farm fish, right?
This is great.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.150
Farmed Atlantic salmon, the best thing since
sliced, white bread.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.160
This was back when I was in Oceana.
I thought farm-raised Atlantic salmon was

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.550
tremendously great.
And I'm supporting these environmental groups

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:59.030
doing efforts about, "Give Swordfish a Break.”
Fine. We'll give swordfish a break.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.510
It's worked. All right?
Now they start talking about the salmon that

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:07.410
I've been loving, because it's inexpensive,
it's diverse, everybody loves salmon.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.800
Salmon is the number one selling fin fish.
You can cook it just about any technique you

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.150
could possibly want.
It's on the cover of my book.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.540
You know, you wouldn't put something on the
cover of a book that's going to scare people

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:23.950
away, you know? So salmon being fantastic,
I didn't want to hear how it's not good for

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.480
the environment.
I'm getting to the point where I don't want

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.060
to know anymore.
My job is getting much more complicated, but

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.860
I needed to, because I was already deep into
finding out about what's happening.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:41.250
And there's aquaculture that you're raising
carnivorous fish, carnivorous animals.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:45.990
There's nothing you can buy in the supermarket
that's carnivorous, except for fish.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.970
Now, in order to feed those fish, you have
to give them meat.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.900
And the meat that they eat is more fish.
So you go over, and you grab larger quantities

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.060
of this fish.
Sardines, anchovies, what do you care -- you

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.730
don't eat them anyway, right?
Let's get all those anchovies and sardines

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:05.099
out, make Purina Salmon Chow, feed the salmon.
Well, the ratio is off.

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:08.170
Takes you five pounds of this fish to make
one pound of that fish.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:14.220
What about all the other wild species that
are relying on the sardines, anchovies categorically?

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.680
They suffer too. Oh boy.
That's just what I needed.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.630
Not only that, they escape.
Because they're open nets.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.660
They put them in the ocean, you know, in these
netted areas and there's high concentrations

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.560
of fish in there.
Well, they have predators.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:32.210
Predators come and rip holes in there.
If I was an orca whale, or if I was a killer

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.540
whale, and I knew there was a smorgasbord
of salmon around the corner, [whistles] me

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.970
and the rest of the boys are going to go rip
a hole in there and have dinner.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.329
Well, that happens, and millions of them escape
a year.

00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:45.020
Also competing for food.
And God forbid that they start to reproduce

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.000
with the wild species.
That will just take a genetic code that has

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.049
been set up over millions of years and just
pollute it to the point where they won't even

00:43:52.049 --> 00:43:54.440
 -- they'll get so confused they won't even
know where they're going anymore.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:44:04.760
Where was I? Okay.
Well, and then, there's the usage of antibiotics.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.760
You know, if you've got a concentration of
fish in such a small area, one gets sick,

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.829
they all get sick.
The stress or the strain of their environment

00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:15.990
is just not right.
So, Holy Smokes.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.200
I'm giving you so many negative things.
Well, there are solutions.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.470
A permanent barrier, first and foremost, between
the farm and the natural environment would

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:28.470
be great. Okay.
One more thing I didn't even bring up -- these

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:35.850
nets.
Sea lice, which is a natural part of a life

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:42.190
cycle of a fish, but normally the sea lice
don't come into their world when they're immature.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:44.931
When they're immature, they don't have a coating
on the outside.

00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:47.740
They don't have the scale coating that can
help protect them from sea lice.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.470
Well, these salmon farms produce such high
concentrations of sea lice that then spews

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:58.330
into the natural environment that anything
that may swim by, such as one of the five

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.109
left species of salmon, they get infected
by it.

00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:07.369
And it's detrimentally affecting their population
and their chances of coming back in consequent

00:45:07.369 --> 00:45:12.210
years.
So salmon is really a big case study right

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:17.130
now on what's happening in aquaculture and
how there are better techniques.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.040
And the better techniques are when there's
a permanent barrier.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.710
When there's closed containment systems.
And there are -- there's a lot of research

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:26.320
being done.
There's prototypes.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.730
It's more expensive, so no one wants to run
and do it, but -- in our world and hopefully

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:37.040
in our lifetime -- we're going to see more
and more of closed containment systems being

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.400
implemented.
They're talking about doing it in Canadian

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.200
government subsidization, subsidizing some
closed-containment systems.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.590
And the one thing that I don't even like to
talk about -- but it's a part of my reality

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:55.740
 -- it's health risks.
You know, health risks of fish.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.920
I'm trying to sell you fish.
I'm trying to tell you how good it is.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.820
Omega-3 is great for your body, for your mind,
and I want you to buy my book.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.599
I want you to take it home, because it's a
tool, you know.

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:15.290
And then if you purchase, you know, sustainable
fish off of like programs like Seafood Watch.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:22.390
Seafood Watch is like this Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Well, it's not just aquarium.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:31.890
To me it's like the center for sustainability
of the oceans in my world, because it's a

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:38.690
combination of many different layers of expertise
 -- scientists, marine biologists, you know,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:43.750
and people that just really care.
And they boil it down to these Seafood Watch

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.980
cards, where you get yellow, green, and red
areas, and they simplify it all.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:53.079
Everything that I've been talking about to
you about for the last 45 minutes is basically

00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:58.410
broken down and simplified on these cards.
If you choose from the best choices, you're

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:05.780
making major strides towards making sure that
there's a healthy supply of ocean protein

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.830
in the future, you know.
And if you can't find the green, ask questions.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:16.870
"Why not? Why can't you get the green?”
Along with this becomes a tool towards making

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:22.130
sure that generations from now that there's
going to be seafood available on and on and

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.850
on.
I went further than I thought I was going

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.450
to go.
I can continue to talk forever, but I wanted

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:33.662
to open this up for Q and A, and see if there's
any parts of what I was giving you a discussion

00:47:33.662 --> 00:47:34.900
about that we can maybe go a little deeper
in. Yes?

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.900
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:51.460
Q You talked a lot about trends in the U.S.
and consumption and things, but are places

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:56.369
like China or India exploding in growth, and
what do you see there?

00:47:56.369 --> 00:48:00.480
Rick Moonen: Unfortunately, we're on this
big round thing called the globe.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:05.510
And not everybody plays exactly the same.
Not everybody -- although regulations are

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:12.470
set -- not everybody follows them.
You know, the United States is actually pretty

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.670
darn good.
I mean Alaska, for instance, is probably one

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:21.500
of the greatest models for sustainability
in the globe, you know?

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:28.050
And I can't answer to what everyone else does,
but I mean, if we're all going to play in

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:33.329
this sandbox of life and we're going to try
to like continue to have the privilege of

00:48:33.329 --> 00:48:38.970
taking things from it that we don't even really
 -- I mean, I'm talking about wild species.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:44.820
Someone has to start somewhere and better
regulatory systems have to be set up.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:47.790
It's difficult. It's an ocean.
It's two-thirds of our world.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:52.440
It's who we are. We're an ocean.
You know, our bodies are just an ocean within.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.701
If you don't believe it, taste your tears.
I mean, it's our lives.

00:48:55.701 --> 00:49:01.720
We are a product of our environment.
And as soon as we can get everyone else to

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:08.810
kind of get on board with that, and by way
of regulation, you know, we're going to have

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.900
that question that you asked me.
I don't know exactly how to answer.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:16.660
I wish I had a better -- there's some people
here that I turn to.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.390
Sheila just stand up for a second.
You have to stand up.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:25.210
Sheila Bowman is the Outreach Program Director
for the Seafood Watch Program in Monterey.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.040
She's my Go-to person.
My entire career, I would call Sheila Bowman

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.311
when I'm doing my next menu, I'd say, "This
is so confusing.”

00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:36.130
And she doesn't know.
We don't always have the answers to everything.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:42.770
Octopus, for instance, I did a big thing in
Art Culinaire.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.430
It's a beautiful book, and I was asked if
I would do something on octopus; I'm like

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.820
[Sss].
Let me see if I really, if it makes sense

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.349
for me.
Because I'm a big supporter of sustainability.

00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:55.830
If I do a thing on octopus, am I going to
be going against?

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.230
So I called Sheila.
I said, "What do I do?

00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:02.240
Tell me the story of octopus.”
And she's like, Well, here's the species -- a

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.520
consumed species, right?
Not great in the United States, but it gains

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.339
popularity.
It's bigger in Greece and Italy etc.

00:50:11.339 --> 00:50:15.730
But this is an animal who's designed to be
a chameleon and hide.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:23.670
How do you do an inventory on it? You can't.
Sometimes when it comes to biomass, you kind

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:30.650
of like guessing a little bit.
You know, and that's another layer of confusion.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:41.230
But if you really want to give yourself some
direction, you log onto seafoodwatch.org or

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:48.760
you can go onto your iPhone.
If you have an iPhone, you can download an

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.150
application that instantaneously tells you.
You put in the region where you are.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:57.580
You're in the Northwest, because, like I said
before, the Northwest and the Southeast are

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.640
going to call the same fish two different
things.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.900
You clarify it.
It tells you and it's green, red, and yellow.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.369
If it's "avoid," you push it, it tells you
why you're avoiding it, and it can give you

00:51:06.369 --> 00:51:10.260
a little alternative in certain circumstances,
which is just an amazing tool.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:17.829
So if we can kind of spread that kind of technology
and that kind of mentality and utilize it.

00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:20.990
When you're sitting in a restaurant, and you're
about to order something.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:29.430
Or you're going to a store and you're about
to buy something, if you use these suggestive

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:33.130
purchasing directives, you're going to be
doing a world of difference.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:37.800
I was bringing you up for a reason.
What was that?

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.380
Just to recognize you? Octopus, yeah that
was it.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.040
Any other questions? Did that answer your
question?

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.380
I wish I had stronger -- There isn't an answer
for everything.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:51.660
We're at a critical point where we need to
realize that the government isn't going to

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.180
do it for us. It's.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.880
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.869
Rick Moonen: I don't know the answer to that
if they're consuming more than usual.

00:52:01.869 --> 00:52:08.970
The answer is yes.
I'm a single-subject focus.

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.950
I'm in a desert.
I'm trying to get other fellow chefs to like,

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:16.890
grasp on to the concept of green.
It's an amazing part of my life.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.850
I've been talking about it for 20 years.
I've kind of been the loose cannon, loud mouth,

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:26.600
talking about swordfish and Chilean sea bass.
I'm walking down the street and fellow chefs

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.130
coming at me -- they cross the street, they
don't want to hear what they can't serve on

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:35.270
their menu, you know, because it's hard to
keep your finger on the pulse of it.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:41.839
It's not impossible.
Seafood Watch cards, applications on your

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:45.640
iPhone, a certain mentality.
Eating lower on the food chain is actually

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.609
good for you, for your health.
Because generally-speaking, they're high in

00:52:48.609 --> 00:52:54.390
Omega-3's.
They don't have high concentrations of methyl

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:57.890
mercury, dioxins, PCBs, because they haven't
had a chance to.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:05.010
So those are better for you, you know?
Again, step outside your comfort zone.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:09.410
Try something a little bit different other
than the fish that are in the red, and you'll

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.569
find out that it can be delicious.
And it's up to people like myself and people

00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:17.010
in my industry to take sustainability and
make it taste good.

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:21.060
But the one thing tonight that really disturbs
me is, almost on every single year, I'll get

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:26.050
one or two phone calls from big journalists
that want to know, "What's the next big fish?”

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.660
Because everybody wants to outdo the other
and scoop it up and be the trend and be right.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.260
But the real next big fish is "all together.”
Let's see if we can't just mix it up.

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.540
I don't want, I mean, I could tell you about
a fish that's being farmed in a sustainable

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.670
manner and it'll be out and it's called cobia
and it's delicious.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.839
And it is.
But I don't want that to be the next targeted

00:53:44.839 --> 00:53:48.250
fish, because then they're going to have to
make so many farms that it's going to have

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:52.630
an impact on something.
If we could just learn that diversity is the

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:59.470
answer to living in symbiosis with our ecosystem,
we'd be so much better off.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:03.520
Any other questions? Yeah.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:19.190
Q I've read that, in a number of cases -- particularly
catfish -- the farmed fish are lower in Omega-3

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:24.580
fatty acids, because they're not eating stuff
that's -- they're eating whatever's the cheapest

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.580
foods.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.780
Rick Moonen: They're vegetarians.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.780
Q Yeah.

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:33.890
Rick Moonen: Well, you have -- I don't know
how the height of Omega-3s in tilapia, in

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:36.080
catfish.
They're not as high as you're going to get

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.000
in the oil-laden fish like salmon, you know,
mackerel, sardines.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.849
These are the fish that are just dripping
in Omega-3s, but you still have levels.

00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:54.010
And they're completely environmentally friendly,
you know.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:55:00.340
But all catfish again isn't created equal.
U.S. farm-raised catfish is probably the best

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.170
catfish you're going to get.
Because outside of the United States, they

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:09.820
figure out cheaper ways of producing it -- overproducing
it, taxing the environment -- the fish aren't

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.240
going to be as healthy.
Animal welfare?

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:20.960
These fish are just jammed, filled, throw
on this chemical -- well, you know, like to

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:26.190
regulate parasites or whatever else that needs
to be regulated, or antibiotics, if there's

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.510
an outbreak of some sort.
We have much tighter regulations in the United

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.930
States.
So you're eating healthier fish, and you may

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:39.839
have to eat higher amounts of it to get the
level of Omega-3s.

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:43.589
So there's some truth to it.
Again, not all fish are created equal.

00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:50.430
But those, being vegetarian, are considered
some of the best alternatives or the best

00:55:50.430 --> 00:56:01.119
farmed fish to eat. Any other?
I can stay here all day and talk about this

00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:03.140
stuff.
You feel a little bit more comfortable?

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:13.780
Do you have a better understanding about seafood?
Yes? All right.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:20.210
Well, I appreciate you listening to me.
I have a lot of information on Seafood Watch.

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:24.660
These are, you know, these are big, larger
cards.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.290
These are the kinds of things that I hang
in my restaurant in my kitchen.

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:31.300
And it just kind of takes in all the different
regions and all the different fish.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.569
There's a lot of fish out there that we haven't
tapped.

00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:37.319
We know more about the outer space sometimes
than we do about our own oceans.

00:56:37.319 --> 00:56:42.960
And we really need to pay a lot more close
attention to what's going on beneath the surface

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:50.200
of the water that covers most of our globe.
And we can learn in a way that can be tasty,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.790
and we can be responsible.
It's all at our fingertips.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:57.119
It's just a matter of us embracing it and
making it a part of our lives.

00:56:57.119 --> 00:57:00.380
And it's not that difficult.
If I can do it, you can do it.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.910
Thank you very much for listening.
I appreciate it.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:02.030
