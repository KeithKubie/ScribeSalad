JEFFREY BARZACH: I really
wanted to figure out

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.682
what it was like to be
in a bonding experience

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:13.640
with a group of people.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.880
I feel like that's
something very special

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880
where a group of people
are just together,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.250
and perform songs,
and do activities.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.510
And Outdoor Action gave
me that venue to do that.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.350
And I feel like that is a much
more team building experience

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.420
and to meet new people,
other incoming freshmen,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.711
and build friendships that way.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060
CAREN JU: Outer Action
seemed fun and a good way

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.190
to introduce yourself
to new people.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.060
You can get caught up every day
in studying and doing whatever

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.240
to prepare for your future.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.600
But when you stop, and you
experience the outdoors,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.677
you know how precious
life is and how much

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.760
you can appreciate the
little things that you have

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.807
while you're camping.

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:50.890
WENDY HO: My advice to the
incoming and first year

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.050
students is really get
to know your class.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.910
I think during my first year, I
was trying to do way too much.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.877
And I didn't spend
enough time just getting

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:00.460
to know the people
at Princeton, which

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.100
I think is arguably the most
important part of Princeton.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.690
So just spending
time with people

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.030
and really being
intentional about your time.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.520
FAWAZ AHMAD: Spending several
days outdoors with people

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.430
I've never met, doing activities
I've never done, in a place

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.600
I've never been to--

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.120
so all of these
things, I think, really

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.110
go along with the spirit
of college in itself--

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.760
exploring new things,
challenging parts of yourself

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.657
that you didn't even
know existed before,

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:28.990
and meeting new, awesome
people and doing awesome things

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.490
with them.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.540
