00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.132
There are lots of different ways to solve this problem

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:03.949
and that's true for all programming problems

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.649
One of the things I hope you will learn from this class is that you can do experiments

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.249
you can try lots of different things.See what works.

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.616
And there are often some solutions that will be better than others. But you should always feel free

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.600
to try running code in the interpreter to see what happens.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.866
Here is one way to solve this:

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.549
We are going to use print and we need an expression that computes the number of

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:26.500
minutes in seven weeks. So we will multiply seven, which is the number of weeks

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.283
times 7 days in a week, times 24 hours in a day, times 60 minutes in an hour.

00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:38.332
And that will output the number of minutes in 7 weeks.

00:00:38.332 --> 00:00:43.899
Let's try that in the python interpreter. Then we run and we get 70560 minutes as

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.698
our answer. That seems like a long time.

00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:49.633
You can do this course at any pace you want. But it's designed to take most people

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.683
about 7 weeks to complete. Some will go faster, some will go slower and that's fine.

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:56.899
What I hope is that by the end of the course, you feel like you can

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.017
really write programs to do interesting things

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.698
and you've got a great understanding of computer science.

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:05.306
Of course we don't expect you will send all 70000 minutes during those 7 weeks

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.816
just working on this course.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.816
You may need to eat, sleep, work a job, go to school, do some other things,

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:12.839
but I hope you will really enjoy the course.
