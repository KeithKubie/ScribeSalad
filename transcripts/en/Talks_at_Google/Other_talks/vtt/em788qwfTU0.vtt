00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.660
MARIA: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.490
My name is Maria and
I work here at Google

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.180
in a product excellence team.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.700
And thank you for
joining us today

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.970
in person and over live stream.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.670
It's great to see interest
in design at Google.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.900
And I'd also like to thank
my co-organizers, Sergey

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.520
and Morris, for
making this happen,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.150
as well as the Talks
at Google team here.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.960
So today we're excited to
welcome Dr. Barry Katz, who's

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.970
going to talk about the history
of design of the Silicon

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.410
Valley.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.050
Barry has five different jobs.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.920
He is a fellow at the IDEO.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.200
He is also a professor of
industrial and interaction

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.360
design at the California College
of the Arts in San Francisco.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.470
He is a consulting professor
in the Design Group,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.740
Department of Mechanical
Engineering at Stanford.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.650
He is also an
innovation consultant

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.370
to governments and
companies around the world.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.500
And he is a book author.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
BARRY KATZ: That's five.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.850
MARIE: That's five.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.390
I said five, yeah.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710
And today he's here to talk
about the history of design

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.070
in the Silicon Valley, the
topic of his latest book.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.830
And I've been lucky
to be Barry's student.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.172
And I think that we're here
up for a really great talk.

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:22.546
BARRY KATZ: Thank you.

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:25.920
Thank you Maria.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880
So I think I need the microphone
for the remote people.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.500
Google is like this
huge vacuum cleaner

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.140
that's sucking up talent
from all around the Bay

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.680
Area and the world.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.480
So it's been a real
pleasure to see so many

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.090
of my former colleagues,
students, friends,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.580
old friends, new
friends, from all five

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.620
of those reference points
that Maria referred to.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.290
And it's true.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.420
I do all of those
things and I have

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.100
a lot of lunches on
Caltrain, which as you know

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.260
does not have a restaurant.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.120
I'm moving around a lot.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.790
What I would like to
talk about with you

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.440
is the formation of a design
profession in Silicon Valley.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.230
And I thought I would
start with a little bit

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.940
of self-promotional advertising.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.650
So forget that.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.640
But I did just published
a book, "Make It New,"

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.340
which is derived from an
exhortation of the poet

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.180
Ezra Pound in 1934 when he
delivered this manifesto

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.200
under the title "Make It
New" in which he called

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.280
for a revival of our culture.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.050
And that kind of seemed
like an appropriate way

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.520
to think about design in
Silicon Valley, which I think

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.890
has been a neglected,
curiously neglected

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.330
part of the story of the
success of the Valley.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.370
So here's the proof.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.660
What you've got on
that image on the right

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.830
is a page out of the 1979
Palo Alto phone book.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.520
And it lists, in
that red perimeter,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.910
every one of the design
consultancies in Northern

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.950
California, all nine of
them, including one called

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.570
Hovey-Kelley Design, which is
the only one that still exists,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.480
although it's changed
its name a few times

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.680
and is now known as IDEO.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.210
But they are, all
of the designers

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.660
in Silicon Valley squeezed
between detective agencies

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.790
and diaper services.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.370
And there's not a whole lot.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.400
So when I began
to-- I become very

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.270
curious about how we have
moved from this situation,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.010
in which we were
absolutely not on the map,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.500
to where we are today.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.830
And I'm going to be arguing that
there are probably more design

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.070
professionals working within
50 miles of where you're all

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.680
sitting right now than
anywhere else in the world.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.520
And that happened in
about 30, 35 years.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.480
So I became very curious
about that phenomenon.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.685
This is the first of a series
of stupid maps with logos

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:04.310
all over them that
you're going to see.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.562
So I apologize for that.

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.030
But it is of course
our beloved Bay Area.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.770
Those are the two
earthquake faults,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.000
which make it a kind
of a fragile place.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.014
My students refer to them
was my fault and your fault.

00:04:21.014 --> 00:04:23.690
And what you're
seeing in the logos

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.140
are a selection of some of
the design consultancies

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.390
that operate in the Valley.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.400
The original ones, which still
exist-- Lunar, IDEO, and Frog,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.690
all founded around 1980.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.310
And then they began to calve
off a second generation

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.800
and a third generation, and
now already a fourth generation

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.760
of smaller firms that
are spilling out,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.180
such that today there are, as
I think I can probably argue

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.630
convincingly, more
designers working

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.000
in this area than anywhere
else in the world.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.600
And part of the reason that
that is just so striking

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.630
is if you would
ask almost anybody

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.640
in about, let's say, 1980 when
this activity began to ratchet

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.120
up, what are the design
capitals of the world,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.370
I think there would have
been a really easy consensus.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.380
And you should disagree
with me if this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.940
doesn't sound about right.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.310
But it would have been
London for product design

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.250
and New York for graphics
and Paris for fashion

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.280
and Milan for furniture,
Tokyo for electronics,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.980
Los Angeles for whatever
they do down there.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.220
And if you had said, and
the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.680
I think you would have been
met with a blank stare.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.400
There was virtually nothing
that distinguished the area

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.890
in terms of design.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.350
And now we find ourselves
as the global epicenter

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.730
of professional practice.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.020
The second piece of
it is, in addition

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.150
to the independent
design consultancies--

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.990
the IDEOs, the
Frogs, the Lunars,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.400
and their second, third, and
fourth generation offspring--

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.090
practically every one of the
iconic companies of the Valley

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.730
has built a significant
internal design group.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.120
So you've got about 200 and
some design professionals

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.500
working at Google.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.392
There are about 180 UX
designers working at Uber.

00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:28.410
Pinterest has about 40.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.200
Quora has its team.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.870
And we're starting to
see, ominously for some,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.060
the arrival of
Chinese companies.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.820
Alibaba has a design
group, Apple's

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.510
iconic industrial design
studio, and so on and so forth,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.750
the result of
which is, as I say,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.820
the beginnings of--
not the beginnings,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.570
but we are well into the
building of a critical mass

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.040
of independent
consultancies plus product

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.880
oriented companies with their
own very significant design

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.730
populations.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.840
And then the third
piece of it-- this

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.710
is not precisely a Silicon
Valley story, but in a sense

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.970
it is.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.750
We are starting to see the
building of internal design

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.890
groups or design thinking
groups-- which is not

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.720
quite the same thing--
showing up in companies that

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.980
have no-- and organizations,
not just companies-- that have

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.030
no particular tradition
of being product oriented

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.520
or having any kind of
a design sensibility.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.670
So what's going on when, within
the last three to five years,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.530
Kleiner Perkins announces
that they have appointed

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.190
John Maeda, former
president of RISD,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.160
as its first design partner?

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.100
Or when, what else, we've got
McKinsey, which is, I think,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.010
an $8 billion
management consultancy

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.510
buying Lunar Design whole,
acquiring this design

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.760
competence?

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.750
And I could repeat
those kinds of stories--

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.200
Capital One acquiring Adaptive
Path, this wave of mergers,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.320
acquisitions by large
organizations of design

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.290
companies in order to build
an internal design competence.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.850
It's actually quite amazing.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.870
The US Army has gotten
addicted to design thinking.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.550
God help us.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.140
I don't know where
that's going to take us,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.270
what a prototype of a
war might look like.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.289
And I will tell you
one quick story,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.659
because I really love this one.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.820
About a year ago,
McKinsey threw a big party

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.880
for a hundred of its
top corporate clients

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.320
to show off the new
acquisition that it acquired,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.910
Lunar Design, a very
distinguished engineering

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.930
plus design organization
based in San Francisco, about

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.880
70 people.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.010
And they had asked
me to MC the event.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.840
And as I introduced each
of the McKinsey guys

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.750
who were the
architects of the deal,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.420
they all got up in
front of the audience

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.130
and made a big deal out of
the fact, I'm wearing jeans.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.200
I never thought I
would be wearing jeans.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.690
But we're so cool now.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.280
We're hanging with designers.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.060
And then I looked over at my
three friends from Lunar Design

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.715
and they were all wearing suits.

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:19.500
Like we can play with
grown ups, there's

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.080
nothing to be afraid of.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.150
We're not going to hurt you.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.510
So we've got this
critical mass building up.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.330
These are of course not
exclusively Silicon Valley

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.740
firms, but they testify to
the explosion of interest

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.750
in the design practice
and the design

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.270
mentality that absolutely
does have its roots here.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.930
So this led me to a
series of questions

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.230
that I set out to
answer in the book.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.700
And assuming that
nobody in this room

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.440
can read, they are, number
one, how did the Bay Area

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.180
move from relative obscurity
to become what I think

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.000
is the global epicenter of
professional design practice

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.230
in the world today?

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.570
Secondly, how did design
move from a marginal service

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.800
in which designers
are basically pleading

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.960
for an audience with
some engineering manager

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.420
somewhere to becoming a
strategic driver of some

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.290
of the world's most
important companies?

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.070
Now I'm thinking about
the week that Larry Page

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.520
became CEO of Google and
announced the launch of Project

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.330
Kennedy here.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.940
In the past, he
said-- this is not me.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.470
This is your boss-- that
Google has been driven

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.390
by engineering and analytics.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.620
In the future, it will
be driven by design.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.370
I think many people
in this room are still

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.870
waiting to see that happen.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.410
But it's beginning.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.460
And an acknowledgement
from the top

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.100
is a fairly extraordinary thing.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.090
So how did design move from
being a marginal service

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.970
in which designers were trying
hard to convince somebody

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.010
in upper management or
in engineering teams

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.170
that they had a value to add
and they weren't simply cute,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.010
to the increasingly
important role they are

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.590
playing across the spectrum?

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.690
And then third, how did
professional practice evolve?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.130
So to be a designer in the early
stages of this story-- which

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.390
I'll get to in a
moment-- meant probably

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.180
you were packaging electronic
components in sheet metal

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.469
enclosures.

00:11:21.469 --> 00:11:23.510
And if this is a design
audience, how many of you

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.050
guys are doing that?

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.380
That's not what it
looks like any longer.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.870
There are probably still some.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.950
But we now have this
amazing phenomenon

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.180
of designers working on
some of the thorniest, most

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.280
wicked, intractable problems
of human civilization today.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.300
So designers working on
global poverty as a design

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.820
issue, urban violence
as a design issue,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.420
on pediatric obesity, access
to maternal health facilities

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.420
as design problems--
very, very different.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.100
How did that
evolution take place?

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.650
So what I'll do in
a few minutes now

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.800
is tell you a bit about
how I formulated my answers

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.930
to these questions in a project
that took me about six years.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.460
And I have to say it was
a total labor of love.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.480
I enjoyed it hugely,
interviewed about 200 people.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.320
Normally my research
strategy was,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.180
I would find myself
in conversation

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.220
with one of the important
figures in the story.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.476
The last question was,
so, what's in your garage?

00:12:32.476 --> 00:12:34.850
Oh, boxes.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.320
What's in the boxes?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.980
Papers.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.000
What kind of papers?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.166
I don't know, I haven't
looked at the goddamn things

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.000
in 30 years.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.390
And then I'm six weeks
in Larry Tesler's garage

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.280
in Portola Valley looking
through all of this stuff.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.930
In any case, the book is based
almost entirely on first person

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.710
original primary
source research.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.490
And the stuff is there.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.250
And it just required a lot of
digging and was loads of fun

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.730
to do.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.500
OK, so I would like
to tell you kind

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.180
of a synopsis of some
of my findings organized

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:16.310
around one particular story
out of the large number.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.870
So I spent time looking at the
technology companies of course.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.420
The origins of design do not
start with Apple and Steve

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.960
Jobs.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.580
That's the ghost of Steve Jobs
rising above the new Apple

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.850
campus.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.320
But it goes back much further.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.980
So I spent lots of time
looking at the tech companies.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.890
The academic environment
of the Bay Area

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.870
is extremely important.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.970
So I studied the nature
of design training, how

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.970
we design designers
in the engineering

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.220
environment of Stanford,
the arts school

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.840
environment of California
College of the Arts,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.680
and in the public university
setting at San Jose

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.180
State, each of
which was critically

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.900
important in its own way.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.490
Looked at the labs, which played
a very, very important role

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.600
from Stanford Research
Institute, now

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.410
SRI International, to
the famous Xerox PARC,

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:19.350
Atari Research Labs-- those
drug besotted hippies down there

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.950
were a major piece
of the story-- and up

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.710
to Interval Research.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.050
I don't know if you're
familiar with that one.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.590
But it was all a real eye
opening experience for me,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.710
partly because my
beginning assumption

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.240
was that design
in Silicon Valley

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:42.570
began when Steve Jobs began
to hire the group that became

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.560
IDEO and Frog Design and Lunar.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.400
And it turned out that that is
the midpoint of the story, not

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.140
the origins.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.960
That was, to use our
favorite word, the pivot.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.930
So for the origins,
we need to go back

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.200
to two iconic companies.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.880
Hewlett-Packard is
still very much with us.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.110
Almost the only
thing left of Ampex

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.070
is that sign, which you will
see as you're riding the Google

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.690
bus back up to Noe Valley.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.440
They're missing
a P, and I always

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.520
think that American
Express stole the P

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.110
to get some free advertising.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.970
And it looks
something like this.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.950
August 1, 1951, a guy named
Carl Clement drove down

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:30.520
from Washington state with
his freshly minted University

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.100
of Washington industrial
design degree,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.700
looked up an old
college roommate

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.490
who was working for a 250 person
instrument firm in Palo Alto

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:45.620
that some of you may have heard
of called Hewlett-Packard.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.510
On a whim he
interviewed for a job.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.800
He showed his
airbrushed portfolio

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.080
full of automotive interiors
and desk lamps and things.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.990
The engineering manager,
an applied physicists

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.450
named Ralph Lee, looked over his
stuff and said it's very nice,

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.870
but we don't do that here.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.510
But they gave him a
job none the less.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:14.000
Because one day, it was noticed
that the insignias on the HP

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.670
packing crates blended
into the background

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.730
and were not visible.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.740
And they had the idea that this
guy was a designer, whatever

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.000
the hell that meant,
might be able to help

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.780
improve the graphics.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.940
So the result-- and that
is the first designer,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.320
designer 1.0 of Silicon Valley.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.290
The result was to get rid of
the beige cardboard background,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.610
make it white so that
the HP logo would pop.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.670
David Packard was driving
behind an HP truck one

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.530
day that didn't have
its rear door down

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.680
and he saw it and he
said that's really great.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.380
And design begins in the Valley.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.510
That is Bill Hewlett.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.020
That is David Packard.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.710
I like to say that Hewlett is
standing up because Packard

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.880
really was about 18 feet tall.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.140
So the story begins
very much as a kind

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.200
of a branding story, which in
itself is not that interesting.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.069
I have this great quote in
which as the design group, which

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.329
was one person,
tried increasingly

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:24.050
to gain a hearing within the
engineering environment of HP,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.180
they let him in with
the instruction,

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.840
"You irritate my engineers,
you're outta here."

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.160
In time, the design
group increased

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.050
by orders of magnitude.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.260
It went from one person to two
and from two people to four,

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.230
and swelled within
a decade to a total

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.810
of six people, this
sprawling design enterprise.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:54.720
And they moved from rather
trivial projects of the sort

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.030
that I just said-- improving
graphics on cardboard boxes--

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.440
to the idea that we can
establish a coherent design

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.140
language.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.890
This is actually, in
a way, an anticipation

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.880
of what Project Kennedy did
at Google when they set out

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.500
to integrate Maps and Search
and Gmail and the other products

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.330
in the platform and give them
kind of a family coherence.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:26.230
So at the time of the second
phase of design at HP,

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.800
the HP catalog listed
something like 373 devices.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.350
Each one of them was a
discrete self-standing entity.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.430
They would have been
enclosed in mahogany boxes,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.320
in aluminum with
mitered edges, sometimes

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.700
in no enclosures at all.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.200
That was not on the
radar screen as part

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.120
of the offering of a company.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.560
And the proposal was made
by the internal design group

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.030
that we can establish a
coherent language that

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:07.820
would help engineers to
identify an HP product anywhere

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.320
they saw it.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.440
And these were
beloved instruments

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.990
in the technical
community across the US.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.480
So this was actually a
fairly significant thing.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.370
And you can see the results
of that after several years,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.960
that there is definitely
a family resemblance

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.400
among their products.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.694
But I want to move to
the third phase of this,

00:19:26.694 --> 00:19:28.110
because what we're
actually seeing

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.340
is the formation of a new
concept of professional design

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.560
practice, which will
lead in a straight line

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.220
to where we are today.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.840
Phase three-- phase one was
cardboard boxes and graphics

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.340
on them.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.290
Phase two was a consistent
design language.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.170
Phase three was the
suggestion that I

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.670
hope will resonate
with some of you

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.230
in design at Google, which
is that design can actually

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.780
improve the performance
of a product,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.580
not just make it
look good and not

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.880
just make a statement
to the external world.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.120
And that happened when a new
guy took over with the idea

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.900
that we're going
to embed ourselves

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.740
in the various divisions
of Hewlett-Packard--

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.390
oscilloscopes,
microwaves, and so on.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.580
And what he did-- his
name was Alan Inhelder.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.630
And he left us just
about a year ago.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.500
But I was able to spend a bunch
of time with him in his retreat

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.490
up in Portola Valley.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.340
And he told me the story of how,
as he attempted to establish

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.510
credibility within this
insanely engineering driven

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.040
environment-- you may hear some
resonances of your experience

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.670
here-- he took Hewlett-Packard's
single best selling product,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:51.990
HP model 608 VHF signal
generator, and made

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.290
a facsimile of the
faceplate of it

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.610
on a piece of
cardboard, which he then

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.540
overlaid with those pieces
of colored masking tape.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.100
That's all you're seeing there.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.930
And his point, as
he presented it

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.660
to a very, very skeptical
group of electrical engineers,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.190
was that the design, or the
lack of design of the product,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.150
was completely irrational.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.830
It was completely arbitrary.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.370
It was almost literally as
if the internal workings

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.150
of the product had
been established,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.140
and then somebody poked
holes in the face plate

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.170
to accommodate the controls
for attenuation, frequency,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.190
modulation, and whatever.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.170
And with a little
bit of forethought,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.430
and a little bit of analysis,
it could be reconfigured.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.190
It was called in those days a
related function and control

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.490
link analysis.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:47.220
That if there were a
clear visual connection

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.360
between turning the thing on,
controlling it, and reading out

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.170
the display, it could be
easier to use, faster to use,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.080
perhaps even safer to use.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.260
We could perhaps
take up less space,

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.060
scarce real estate on
an engineer's bench,

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.830
and so on and so forth.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.480
The engineers listened to
him with their skepticism

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.660
beginning to melt away.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.390
There was a silence when he
finished his presentation.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.670
And then they gave him
a standing ovation.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.600
And design was established
at Hewlett-Packard.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.830
So that's a beginning story.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:23.520
And that goes back,
way way before Apple

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.250
began to put design
so prominently

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.300
in the world's consciousness.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.230
That was back in the
50s and into the '60s.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.990
But for most of the period,
this is what design was.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.470
It was people such
as Harold Lindsay,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.370
chief engineer at Ampex, which
invented magnetic recording.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.320
Actually they stole
it from the Nazis,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.390
but they commercialized
magnetic recording.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:55.160
Harold Lindsay, the
iconic embodiment

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.010
of what I call the engineer
with taste-- nothing

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.070
went out of Ampex's
studios that didn't

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.100
have his kind of fastidious
attention to detail.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.760
And over about a
decade, the model

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.950
of the engineer
with taste evolved

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.070
into that of the professionally
trained designer.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.900
That's a guy named
Frank Walsh who

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.430
was the first manager of
industrial design at the Ampex

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.960
Corporation-- which again
basically no longer exists--

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.990
with his friend,
whose name is Elmer

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.550
Average, an articulated
anthropometric figure, in which

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.550
they're approaching the
task of design in, I'd say,

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.960
an almost rigorously
scientific fashion,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.890
not just kind of how it
looks and how it feels

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.140
and is it beautiful or not.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.510
So it's starting to happen.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.710
We're starting to get a
professionalization of design

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:51.110
at the two big companies,
Hewlett-Packard and Ampex,

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.810
and then a small number
of little operations

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.120
that are scattered
around the Bay Area doing

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.580
calculating machines and such.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.990
The main characteristic
of design

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.150
for most of this period--
for all of this period

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.750
thus far is it was strictly
within a very technology

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.740
intensive and what we
would call business

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.900
to business environment,
which they stayed as far

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.840
away from the consumer
market as possible.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.760
The reason is probably
contained in this story.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.010
If any of you have
parents who worked

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.590
in engineering in the Valley, or
anywhere else for that matter,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.290
in the 1970s, just show
them a picture of the HP 35

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.350
calculator.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.480
And your father-- it'll
probably be your father--

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.710
will start to cry.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.370
This is the beloved instrument.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:45.440
This is the iPhone of the 1970s.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.190
And it's a very, very good
story of why designers remained

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:54.060
confined to this very
technology intensive environment

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.990
and those sorts of products.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.420
So what happened here-- I'll
tell the story very quickly,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.550
but it's a good one.

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:04.110
In 1971, Bill Hewlett
conceived the idea

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.040
of investing a million bucks.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.240
And in those days, a million
dollars was real money.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.257
It was not down payment on
a dog house in Los Altos.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.196
He conceived the idea of
investing a million dollars

00:25:19.196 --> 00:25:24.260
in replacing Hewlett-Packard's
very, very successful desktop

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.190
calculator with
a portable device

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.620
that an engineer could
stick into his shirt

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.770
pocket-- his shirt pocket,
obviously-- and take out

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.080
into the field, as a surveyor,
as a mining engineer,

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.130
perhaps as an airplane
pilot, perhaps as a surgeon

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.370
into an operating room, any kind
of professional environment.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.530
He had to overcome significant
resistance from his business

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.670
office, from his
engineering people.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.210
But he was the boss,
so he had his way,

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.130
and I would say fortunately.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.890
But here is the thing about it.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.810
In all previous tech products at
Hewlett-Packard and pretty much

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.030
elsewhere, the brief
would have begun

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.310
with technical specifications.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.460
And it would have been
something like, build

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.090
a machine that will execute
transcendental functions using

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.890
a pseudo multiplication
algorithm

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.780
and displayed in
reverse Polish notation.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.775
And I have absolutely no
idea what I just said.

00:26:20.775 --> 00:26:24.660
And then it would be handed
over to the design group

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.350
to put it in a box.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:31.780
And in this case, the sequence
was completely reversed.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.490
So the starting
point was rather--

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.070
and I'm quoting Hewlett right
now-- "Give me," quote, a shirt

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.590
pocket sized scientific
calculator with four hour

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.760
operation from rechargeable
batteries at a cost

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.280
that any laboratory
and many individuals

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.040
could easily justify."

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.990
Not a technical
criterion in there.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.700
So it was, in a sense,
start with the design,

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.100
and then give me the
suitable engineering

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.410
innards of the thing.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.400
So it was a landmark product.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.830
They estimated that they
would probably sell, I think,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.890
500 of them over the first year.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.890
In the first year, it was just
a complete runaway, blockbuster

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:19.490
success, amounted to 40% of
Hewlett-Packard's profits.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.540
So it sent the message--
it just telegraphed

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.230
this powerful message,
design matters.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.930
Design can actually be a
critical driver of a product

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.740
and not simply an
aesthetic afterthought.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.880
Unfortunately, it
went to their heads.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.760
They got the idea,
we can do anything.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.270
We were on the cusp of a
new age of miniaturization.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.090
What else can we do?

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.790
And it's not just
Hewlett-Packard, but Intel

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.350
as well.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.280
So Hewlett-Packard says the
next stage after a calculator,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.700
let's put it on your wrist.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.530
And we're talking wearables
now in the early 1970s.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.610
So they created this
absolutely hideous marvel

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:07.750
of miniaturization, the HP-01
watch calculator whose buttons

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.410
have to be pressed by
a little stylus that

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.530
was buried in the watchband
that you instantly lost

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.730
or used as a toothpick
until it became disgusting.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:22.390
Engineers loved it, but
it's kind of a dumb thing.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:26.950
Gordon Moore, similar
idea over at Intel, Moore

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.880
of Moore's law, that we have
mastered miniaturization.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.890
We can put $50,000
transistors on a chip.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.720
My god, what else can we do
with our technical savvy?

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.210
Let's make a watch.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.820
So they created what I am pretty
sure is the ugliest wristwatch

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.920
ever created.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.840
Gordon Moore wore the Intel
Microma on his deathbed.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.654
He referred to it as
his $15 million watch,

00:28:53.654 --> 00:28:55.570
because that's how much
money the company lost

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:59.310
on it, as a reminder
never to go anywhere

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.130
near the consumer market.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.530
So they understood tech.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.480
They understood the
business environment.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.060
They understood the engineering.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.720
And they didn't
understand anything

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.450
about the vagaries
of consumer behavior.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.770
That's terra incognita.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.560
That's death.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.490
There was only one exception
that I can think of a tech firm

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:25.270
in the region venturing
over that forbidden boundary

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.400
separating the
professional engineering

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.370
world and the consumer market.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.300
And that is, of course, Atari.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.230
How many of you
have played "Pong?"

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.730
All of you?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.570
Any of you?

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.440
So I lost a very large number
of quarters in "Pong" machines

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.740
when I was in graduate school
in Santa Cruz years ago.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.480
But it was pretty much
the only tech product

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.490
that I can think of
from the first 30

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.880
years of the growth
of this region

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.620
as a tech center that was
commercially interesting

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.230
and commercially successful.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.590
And in fact Atari
was, for a time,

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.820
the fastest growing
and most drug

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.870
infused company in
the United States.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:14.160
For most people however,
design in California

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.560
meant either Grateful Dead
posters or the Sunset Magazine

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.100
image of a Northern
California lifestyle-- Eichler

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.820
houses, glassy atriums,
and that kind of thing,

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.460
maybe a little bit of
Eames era furniture.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.150
But as I said at the
beginning, if you thought

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.320
about the major centers of
design anywhere in the world,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.410
we were simply not on the map.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.970
And it began to change from
very unexpected quarters.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.410
And I will explain that
just through one example out

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.230
of a very large
number, some of which

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.500
are discussed in the book.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.480
And it starts here.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.860
I'm sure a lot of you are
familiar with the migration

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.460
of personal computing out of the
laboratory environments of what

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.980
was then called the
Stanford Research Institute,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.060
and toward the market.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.710
But let me tell it
to you rather briefly

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.190
from a design perspective,
which is something

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.320
that I was able to get into, and
surprisingly seem not to have

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.660
been discussed elsewhere.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.940
So here is the famous Douglas
Engelbart, the inventor

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.230
of the workstation.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.490
And we know all about Douglas
Engelbart and the 1968

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.470
presentation at the San
Francisco Joint Computer

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.680
Conference in which
he demonstrated

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.050
remote collaboration through
an interactive computer

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.240
experience.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.600
What was not known is that one
of Engelbart's best friends

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.900
in this critical period in which
he is exploring the computer

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.600
not as a calculating machine but
as an interactive information

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.990
and communications machine--
he made friends with a guy

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.850
named Robert Propst, who was the
director of the Herman Miller

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.980
Research Institute, Herman
Miller office furniture,

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.590
a design driven office
furniture company-- still

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.210
very much with us and
very much design driven

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.770
in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:12.020
Propst always thought of himself
more as a philosopher than

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.740
as a furniture designer.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.440
And he had become interested in
the changing patterns of work

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.300
as we faced a situation
of what everybody now

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.720
calls information overload
or the information tsunami.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.400
So he got into the
practice of looking

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.360
at what IDEO people like
to call the extreme users.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.990
He had a different
language for it,

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.070
but that was people who lived
in a world of hyperinformation.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.010
And he found his way to
Douglas Engelbart's lab,

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.450
the Augmentation Research
Institute at Stanford Research

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.180
Institute-- Research Center--
where they were developing

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.050
the first online system.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.890
So we had the inventor of the
cubicle, called the action

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.410
office-- for which he
apologized later in his life,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:04.270
by the way-- making friends with
the inventor of the workstation

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.120
in a really historic
collaboration of design

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:08.970
and engineering.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.660
So Engelbart is sitting
there with-- I'm

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.700
afraid you can't make
it out very well,

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.270
but it's a plastic tray that's
something like what you would

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.100
see in a baby's
high chair, which

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.960
has three reservoirs in it,
one containing a keyboard

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.010
that was cannibalized off of
an IBM Selectric typewriter,

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.750
another device called an X-Y
Position Indicator, which

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.660
you better know as a mouse.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.220
And a third is a
five fingered key

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.960
set-- they called it a
chord set-- through which

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.700
by pressing the keys
in any combination

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.595
you could get the
first one an A,

00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:49.140
a B, a C, a D,
two together E, F,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.210
the full alphanumeric keyboard.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.540
And Engelbart on
his deathbed was

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.910
convinced that that was a
faster way to input data

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.560
into a computer than the mouse.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.365
In any case, it
was the designers

00:34:02.365 --> 00:34:07.500
from Herman Miller who
helped Engelbart actually

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.120
to fashion the program.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.300
So there we have
the first prototype

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.330
of an interactive
computing experience, which

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.590
is about communication and
getting your work done and not

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:27.400
simply about feeding in rolls
of punch cards in the morning

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.730
and pulling out rolls of
paper tape in the afternoon.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.290
He also, interestingly
enough, built a computer

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.800
with a display on it,
which was highly, highly

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.340
unusual in the 1960s.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.650
It would be like putting a
Plexiglas hood on your car

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.040
so that you could
see the engine.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.909
Why would anybody
want to see what's

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:49.000
going on inside the computer?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.010
You put in your cards,
you pulled out your tape.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.520
But for Engelbart, it's
an interactive experience.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.580
And the whole point
is that you are

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.900
interacting in a behavioral,
experiential way.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.630
So we pretty much
know the story.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.680
Engelbart was a bit of a nut.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.520
When Xerox Corporation
put $100 million

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.880
into opening a new research
center on Coyote Hill

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:20.180
Road in Palo Alto, a bunch
of Engelbart's top scientists

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:25.200
and engineers migrated over
to Xerox Palo Alto Research

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.690
Center where they proceeded
to build a working

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.580
functional prototype of
an interactive desktop--

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.175
or in the words of Alan
Kay, a personal computer.

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.970
This is pretty well known.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.690
There are gobs of
books about it.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.890
But I wanted to get into
the design element of it.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.370
And that proved to be a
very, very interesting story.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.450
They brought a designer, an
industrial designer-- actually

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.700
the same guy who had
created the design

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.030
group at Hewlett-Packard--
to help them figure out

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:07.100
what a personal desktop computer
experience might physically

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.220
look like.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.700
Here are some pages on the
right from his notebook.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.570
And on the left this
is Larry Tesler, who

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.290
was one of the chief
scientists at Google--

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:23.390
I'm sorry, you're Google-- at
Xerox, who then went to Apple,

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:28.600
playing around conceptually
with what some of these devices

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.380
might look like.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.390
So that's the mouse, which he's
imagining as a three button

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.726
thing, almost like Morse dash.

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.800
Dot-dash, and if you
get frustrated, damn it.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.680
And that's your emergency thing.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.780
The reason I love these
images-- and that's

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.420
that five fingered keyset thing.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.230
The reason I love these images
is that for much of design's

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.610
history, what
designers were doing

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.140
is taking an existing
product and improving it.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.990
So you got this year's
toaster looks like this,

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.880
so next year's toaster is
going to look like this.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.700
But if next year's
toaster looks like this,

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:10.790
the year has got to look like
this with a little bit of vinyl

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.470
applique on it or something.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.160
What was starting
to happen here is

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.460
designers were being challenged
not simply to improve

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.150
an existing product, but to give
form to the experience of using

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.810
something entirely new.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.410
And that is going to be
the signature, in a sense,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.320
of what became distinctive
about Silicon Valley.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.920
There is no predecessor.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.450
There is no ancestor.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.560
There is no way of
looking backward

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.135
to the previous
model of a mouse or

00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:45.100
of a desktop personal computer.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.770
There are a couple of images
pilfered from the web,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.690
so I'm not going to linger over
them, of what the Xerox Alto

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.190
looked like in the early 1970s.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.590
The industrial designer
Clement creates a keyboard,

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.870
which he used the term
garageable into the base

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.700
to save space on the desktop.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.310
And they were fond of bringing
faculty brats from Stanford

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:15.040
into experiment
with the computer.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.680
That should be
accessible even to kids.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.160
It's not about knowing
how the computer works,

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.660
what's under the keyboard
or behind the screen.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.340
It's about getting
your work done.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.050
Now then the story is a kind
of a familiar one, which

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.330
can be sort of summarized here.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.000
The Xerox Corporation,
of course,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.050
determined that they were
in the business of copy

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.510
machines and not computing.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.700
That was not much future
for personal computing.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:47.600
So the core of the Xerox
technical community

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.760
proceeded to leave in
indignation or despair

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.130
or whatever.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:58.000
Larry Tesler brings
the GUI experience

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.220
to the new Apple Computer.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.660
Two of the chief
guys left to create

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.300
a digital formatting
for visual design

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.200
at Adobe, Geschke and Warnock.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.740
The networking protocol
created at Xerox PARC-- I mean,

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.890
they invented
everything and proceeded

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.090
to lose it-- went to 3Com.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.830
Electronic Arts is a
direct descendant--

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.300
I'm sorry for the
stupid graphics.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.290
I couldn't resist.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.630
The first laptop computer
was done by Grid Systems,

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.620
a guy named John Ellenby.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:41.510
Charles Simonyi left Xerox
to bring his word processing

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:46.040
protocols, which was
rebooted as Microsoft Word.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.590
And it's a little
bit unfair to say

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.862
that Xerox PARC disappeared.

00:39:48.862 --> 00:39:50.820
It's still there and it's
a very distinguished,

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.580
important laboratory.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.570
But they watched
in dismay as one

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.160
after another of the
components of their system

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.850
became implanted in some of
the most successful companies

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:04.070
of the Valley today.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:07.810
This is finally where
Apple enters the picture.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.860
And the computer that
you're seeing here

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:15.050
is the Apple II, which is not
much to look at in some ways,

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:18.140
but I actually think is probably
the single most important

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.970
artifact from a design point
of view in this entire history.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.890
And it's simply for this reason.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:33.110
Jobs had the idea that for
every hardware enthusiastic who

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.060
wanted to buy a kit and
solder together a board

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:41.030
and build his-- usually
his-- own computer,

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.970
there were a thousand software
enthusiasts out there who

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.860
simply wanted to take
it out of the box,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.320
plug it in, put a monitor on
top of it, and get to work.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:56.310
So they made a gamble, in
1977, of selling a computer

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.874
in a sealed case.

00:40:57.874 --> 00:40:59.540
And I know that doesn't
sound like much,

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.740
but I actually think
that that decision

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.210
is pretty close to the
seminal turning points that

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:11.450
began to pivot design from a
strictly technology environment

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.950
and toward the consumer market.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.830
Because as soon as they
raised that question

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:22.140
of selling a computer that only
a trained professional could

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.670
or would be interested
in opening up,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.720
then every other question
of design followed.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.340
What should that case look like?

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.850
How approachable should it be?

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.940
What connection should it make,
visually and experiential,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.230
to every other thing
on your desktop,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.410
and so on and so forth?

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.180
And it began the entire
process of expanding

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.350
the perimeter around what
we consider design to be.

00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:48.580
And of course to
do that he begins

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.270
to tap into this emerging
community of many Stanford

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:57.030
graduates who are setting up one
and two and three person design

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.960
firms up and down
University Avenue.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.890
Knocks on the door
of one guy, Jerry

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.552
Manock, and said can you create
the case for the Apple II?

00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:07.010
Manock said I can
do it, but you've

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.250
got to pay me in advance.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.190
This was the third try
that Jobs had made.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.560
I personally know three other
people that turned him down

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.680
on the spot.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.360
And they're still
kicking themselves.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.820
I mean, would you invest
a lot of your time,

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:28.350
like $1,800 worth of
free time, in a startup

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.360
founded on April
Fool's Day, 1976,

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.154
and named after
a piece of fruit?

00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:35.320
So that was the environment.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.200
But a couple of
people were willing.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.870
David Kelley's group of half
a dozen Stanford graduates

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.210
above Roxy's dress shop
on University Avenue,

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.920
took on the problem of a mouse.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.560
Job said, I saw this
device at Xerox PARC.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.970
It cost $400 to make.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:58.360
The mouse had to be disassembled
at the end of each day,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.480
every component cleaned,
and then reassembled

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.810
so that it could be used the
next day by the researchers.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.780
Jobs said, can you
make one that will

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.720
cost $20 that I
can use on my jeans

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.010
and that doesn't require
that kind of maintenance?

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:16.910
Think of it not as an
instrument but an appliance.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.690
And they looked at each other,
of course we can do a mouse.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.641
And so they signed the
contract and Jobs left.

00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.140
And somebody said,
does anybody know

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:28.210
what a mouse is,
very much capturing

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.070
what's beginning to happen
at that critical period.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:37.150
And then it is very much
an Apple dominated story.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:42.910
Apple is becoming
internationally notorious,

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.860
partly for its design.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.850
And the decision is made by
Jobs himself and his inner core

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.900
that it's time to
grow up and establish

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.960
a globally significant
design language.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.930
So they launched a program
called the Snow White

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.680
competition in which they
sought out half a dozen

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.700
of the world's leading
designers, all European.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.820
Narrowed it down to
two, an English group

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.180
called BAB, which created
a series of prototypes.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.840
The computer is
Snow White and then

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.130
seven dwarf like
peripherals around it.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.190
And a small firm
in the Black Forest

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.200
then called Esslinger
Design, which

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.300
becomes Frog Design,
which created

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.430
the softer and more
approachable off-white language.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:31.750
And we are very much
off and running.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.420
So this is really the story.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.770
It's the migration of a
pure technical product,

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:42.440
Douglas Engelbart's original
interactive computer,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.970
from a science fair project
almost to a working prototype

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.790
to a commercial product.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.380
And what's significant
for our story,

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.380
this happens within
the circumference

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.440
of an easy bicycle ride.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.410
And we could repeat that
story with surgical robotics,

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:04.070
with electronic
gaming, with any number

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:08.190
of other artifacts of
the Valley, each of which

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:11.360
will engender a whole
new field of design.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.490
So for instance, Atari
invents game design.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:20.070
How many game designers do
you think Nolan Bushnell

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:24.540
hired in 1971 when he's getting
this company off the ground?

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.750
The answer, zero.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.270
Why?

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.640
There was no such thing.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.180
He was hiring software
engineers, programmers,

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.710
computer scientists, drug
addicts, comic book writers,

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.950
anybody he could find who
could craft a story in code.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.510
10 years later he was
hiring game designers.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.220
A new field had emerged.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.100
The same thing will happen
then with interaction design,

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.970
a combo of traditional graphic
design, computer science.

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.490
And we have a new field.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.670
And we are seeing this
over and over again.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.780
So the story then,
wrapping up, begins

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.480
to look something like this.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.200
In the case of
personal computing,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.220
this sort of migration, the
formation of service companies,

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.190
which are design intensive.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.270
And this does not mean
that they all get on buses

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.630
and go to the beach, but
rather they start to calve off

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.480
their own smaller companies.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.900
And where we are today, which
I find simply extraordinary,

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.790
is the last stage
of my story, which

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.850
is the expansion of
the range of problems

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.680
that designers are now, in a
sense, authorized to work on.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.700
So moving from
packaging electronics

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.770
to dealing with problems
of global poverty,

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:46.132
of public health access,
of design education,

00:46:46.132 --> 00:46:49.930
of ethical problems,
often under the name--

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.540
of the highly controversial
name of design thinking.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.120
But it is, in many
respects, the conclusion

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.400
of a story that
goes back 65 years.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.850
So that's kind of
where we are now.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.850
Design has not been supplanted
by design thinking, whatever

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:12.130
we try to tell you at Stanford.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.280
But we have built into
our consciousness,

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.900
in a sense, the idea that
the methods and methodologies

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.440
and strategies of the designer,
this toolkit that we've

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.510
been building for half a
century, some of those tools

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:30.930
can be applied to
pretty much any problem

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:32.550
that you can think of.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.330
So thank you for
your attention there.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:41.030
I will conclude with the
original-- this is actually

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.920
the awesome button,
as it was then

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.890
called by a small startup
up on University Avenue

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:53.390
called The Facebook, which a guy
named Soleio Cuervo was asked

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:57.200
if he could improve the
upward pointing thumb

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.090
and redrew the 16 by
16 pixel image that

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.680
was in an ugly shade of green.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.919
And it turned into one of the
most widely recognized symbols

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:09.460
in the world.

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.230
So I'll conclude on that note.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.760
I hoped you liked
what you heard.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.540
And if you read the book,
I hope you enjoy it.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.000
And I hope I did
not talk too long.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.280
But I think we have 10 minutes
for any questions or comments.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.660
And I am particularly
interested in hearing

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:34.790
from the perspective of
Googlers how well this sounds

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.461
and whether it corresponds, in
any way, to your own experience

00:48:37.461 --> 00:48:37.960
here.

00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:42.810
Please.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:47.907
AUDIENCE: So what
do you think is

00:48:47.907 --> 00:48:50.306
the future of design agencies?

00:48:50.306 --> 00:48:51.680
At the beginning
of your talk you

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.420
showed how both
designers migrated

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.020
to larger companies,
a lot of acquisitions

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.440
by big companies
of design agencies.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.390
I think part of that is in the
last decade, a lot of agencies

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.242
have really sold design
as a strategic asset.

00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:08.700
And companies have
realized if they

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.360
want to take advantage of that,
they need to bring it in-house.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.450
So how do you see that trend
playing out for agencies?

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.377
BARRY KATZ: It's a very,
very good question.

00:49:17.377 --> 00:49:19.210
I don't like to make
predictions because I'm

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.920
wrong about everything that
I've ever-- I'm a historian,

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.680
so I'm good at
looking backwards.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.890
Having said that, I'll make
a couple of predictions.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.490
One of which is one of the
things that we are seeing--

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.240
and it's a little bit
alarming-- is a kind

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.610
of a tightening of the
pipeline within many

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:36.570
of the independent
consultancies,

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:38.560
as many of the big
companies-- you

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.000
know, I referred to Google
as a big vacuum cleaner,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.650
which is sucking a lot of
talent out of the consultancies,

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.010
some of which are sitting
in this room at this moment.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:47.660
You may be one.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.205
I don't know.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.480
And that is unlikely to abate.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.480
So in a sense, it's very good
news for the design community.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.970
It may be problematic for the
independent consultancies.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.390
The effect on the
consultancies is, in part, they

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:12.850
are exploring how the skills
that they have acquired

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.120
over their various
histories can be

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.680
expanded and
diversified and applied

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.080
in different directions.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.270
And I think that is
actually one of the drivers

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:24.420
of this whole design
thinking movement.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.470
A second thing is
somewhat, I would

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.260
say actually somewhat ominous.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.740
Which is that there are a
lot of organizations which

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.400
don't have much of
a product history--

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.580
banks, financial
services, foundations,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.510
governmental organizations--
which have been hearing

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:46.290
the buzz about design
thinking, and will send

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:49.400
some of their execs to do a
program in design thinking

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.330
or get a certificate
in it or whatever,

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:54.350
and then are building an
internal design thinking team

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.820
within their bank or within
their insurance company

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.300
or their accounting firm,
Deloitte, or whatever.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.000
This has been happening, I
think you said the last decade.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.790
I think it's actually even
more recent than that.

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:12.530
And so we don't yet have
a longitudinal database

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:16.020
to see how successful
this is going to be.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.490
One sense that I
have is that there

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:20.180
are a lot of people
who are tacking up

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.660
their design
thinking certificates

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.410
on the walls of their
cool new studios.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.110
And within a few weeks,
the Post-it notes

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.090
are beginning to flutter
down, and they're not

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:31.000
quite sure what to do.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.620
So one of the things
that is telling me

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.230
is that there is a very
significant difference

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.780
between thinking like a
designer and being a designer.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.350
And it's not that one is
better than the other,

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:44.540
but they are very different.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.150
And companies,
organizations have

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.470
to be very clear about
what they are getting

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.510
and what they are not getting.

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:57.490
I think that a design thinking
sensibility is wonderful

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.080
if it gives people
a sense of when

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.510
you need to hire
a real designer,

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.800
and when you need to engage that
kind of professional service.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:12.220
So it is one thing to prototype
a product concept in a bank,

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.180
in the cool studio somewhere.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:17.970
But I can tell you, because
I teach in a design school--

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.500
we'll have one of
our second year

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:22.210
industrial design
students come in.

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:23.470
We'll give them an assignment.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.700
We want you to do
a ballpoint pen.

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.400
I just made that up.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.080
And the kid comes
in with a concept.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.570
And you say OK, that's great.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.514
Come back next Thursday
with 100 iterations of it.

00:52:33.514 --> 00:52:34.930
And they're never
going to do that

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:39.380
in the design thinking SWAT
squad within an organization.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:46.740
So there is a place for this
design as a strategic asset.

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.650
And there is clearly a place
for the deep professional skills

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:53.160
that are very, very
hard won over the course

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.250
of a serious design education.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:58.790
I hope that speaks to
your kind of question.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:59.490
Yeah, please?

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.580
AUDIENCE: How could one
be an engineer with taste?

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:07.230
BARRY KATZ: An
engineer with taste--

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:11.520
the question is how can somebody
become an engineer with taste?

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.810
Why, are you an engineer
who is seeking to--

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.690
That was a phrase that
I used in connection

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:25.130
with-- I guess Harold Lindsay
was employee two at Ampex way

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.660
back in the '50s.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.140
And he did have this
just impeccable sense

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.210
of beauty, symmetry, finish.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.280
And he never wanted any
of the recording machines

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:42.500
to leave his scrutiny
that wasn't perfect.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.341
Employee one at
Ampex, by the way--

00:53:45.341 --> 00:53:46.840
I'm avoiding your
question, but I'll

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.090
try to get back to it-- was
a guy named Myron Stolaroff.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:51.880
And I gotta tell you
this story in case

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.410
you don't know about him.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:57.710
In much of the universe, we
have the technical engineering

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:59.710
community off to this side.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.330
And they're sitting in
cubicles doing problem sets

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.730
and coding and whatever.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:08.270
And then you have the drug
music, arts people off

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:09.170
on this side.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.900
In much of Silicon Valley
they were the same person,

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.600
and still are.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.630
And there's a little
bit of a legacy of that.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.260
Myron Stolaroff was a
very, very highly trained

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:23.110
electrical engineer, and the
first employee at Ampex in 1949

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:23.800
I think.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.920
He has also consumed,
so far as we

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.390
know, more LSD than
any other human

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.220
being on the planet Earth.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.049
And he was in the habit-- maybe
this will answer your question,

00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.590
I don't know.

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:39.180
But he was dealing
with this problem

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.190
that we call the problem
of a disruptive technology,

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:46.540
that you're trained to
think in one paradigm

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.010
and according to one
mental framework.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:55.010
And that was, for him,
it was pressing wax disks

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.540
to make music recordings.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.830
And the whole
technology paradigm

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:03.750
had shifted to this
idea that you can embed

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:09.080
sound in iron particles
embedded in magnetic tape.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.890
And his engineers were
trying to think one way,

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:14.610
and they were being
asked to think

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.380
completely out of the box.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.870
How are we going to do that?

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:21.730
So he was in the habit of
packing up three or four

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:25.150
of his senior engineers into
the back of his station wagon

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.860
every weekend and driving
them out to his summer house

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:32.750
in the Sierras and filling
them full of LSD, in 1950, '51.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.410
He lost a few of them.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.550
And others, such as
Ray Dolby, went on

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:39.970
to do some fairly
significant work.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:45.466
So I'm not going to go
on record as suggesting

00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:48.090
that you go that route, although
I know a fair number of people

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:53.060
now who are reviving an interest
in that particular phenomenon.

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.400
I think probably
my serious answer

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.490
to that is it's not
taking a course with Barry

00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:00.770
Katz at Stanford or
anything like that.

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:05.390
It's probably by recognizing
that most creative work now

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.290
happens in teams.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.630
And what I've seen,
especially at IDEO,

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:14.140
it used to be that you would be
see a bunch of people sitting

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:17.190
around a table, and you'd say
which one is the designer.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.190
So here's the designer
and here's the EE.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.600
Thomas, are you still here?

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.420
And here's somebody from
the manufacturing side.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.060
And now we're
increasingly thinking

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:33.250
of a design team, almost an
undifferentiated group in which

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.230
people have different
competencies,

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:38.160
but they are approaching
their projects

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.890
as a kind of an
integrated design problem.

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.410
And there's got to be
something they're absorbing,

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.270
some of the skills and
mindsets of people with very

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.160
different sorts of training.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.030
That may or may not lead
you in that direction.

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.230
It's a nice question.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.410
I will meditate further.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.010
I think we have time
for-- yeah, please?

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:03.689
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to
get your perspective on,

00:57:03.689 --> 00:57:10.190
I guess the coalescing
of design research

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.478
from a lot of different
perspectives, maybe

00:57:12.478 --> 00:57:15.322
[INAUDIBLE] disciplinary
disciplines coming together,

00:57:15.322 --> 00:57:19.464
and where you see that kind
of going down the line?

00:57:19.464 --> 00:57:21.630
BARRY KATZ: Yeah, I think
it's a wonderful question.

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:25.560
It was about the coalescing
of design and research.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.900
So one of the ways
that I think about it--

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.967
it was one of those three
questions that I ask.

00:57:29.967 --> 00:57:32.050
It was sort of embedded
in that and I don't really

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.100
think I unpacked it with
much clarity in the talk.

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:41.280
But in the course of
certainly the 65 year history

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.940
that I have looked at, one of
the really striking features

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.750
of that history is the
expansion of the perimeter

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.050
around what we
call design and who

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.820
we need to be part
of that process

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.060
and what skills we
need to be acquiring.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.940
So I often like to tell the
story-- it's very much an IDEO

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.670
story, but I think it
will resonate here.

00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:08.550
The company started
in about 1980

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.340
with a rather
unusual combination

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.870
of industrial design and
mechanical engineering.

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:16.990
And a decade later, they began
to build a social science

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:20.770
competence into that with
the hiring of a woman named

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:26.550
Jane Fulton Suri who has a
background both in psychology

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:32.790
and architecture, which
have unpredictable points

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.630
of collision there.

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.450
Why bring in a
consultant afterwards

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:40.700
to figure out what was
wrong with this machine

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:43.510
such that a guy just chopped
off his finger on it?

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:47.400
Why don't you look at it
before the accident happened?

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.980
So that began a process of
adding social psychologists,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.690
anthropologists, ethnographers.

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:59.670
I have a friend there who has
a PhD in behavioral economics.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:03.140
So we're seeing the expansion
of the perimeter around

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:07.830
what is necessary to approach
the insane complexity of what

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:11.050
may seem like an
extremely simple product.

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:13.750
And I see that-- I hope this
speaks to your question.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.710
I see that as only expanding.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:19.080
I mean I think we are continuing
to ask, what new competence do

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.180
we need to build in in
order to grapple with that?

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.170
So I'm hearing about
sociologists at Google,

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:30.080
and I'm hearing about
writers being employed

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:34.480
in various companies
not simply to document

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.610
a story of a project
after it's completed,

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:41.910
but to use narrative strategies
to drive a story forward

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:43.230
from the outset.

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.970
So I think it's a
wonderful question,

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:49.050
but a very much open minded
one-- open ended one,

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:52.220
and I hope open minded as well.

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:54.140
MARIA: Thank you so much Barry.

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.450
We're out of time, but if
you can stay and ask for--

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:57.324
BARRY KATZ: Happy to.

00:59:57.324 --> 01:00:00.290
MARIA: --[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.760
BARRY KATZ: Thank
you very much folks.
