it through narration because that's the
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.010
it through narration because that's the
best we can do and that's one of the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
best we can do and that's one of the
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539
thought that element of fun was missing
from the first Thor because they showed

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
from the first Thor because they showed
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859
from the first Thor because they showed
him in battle in the beginning and he

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
him in battle in the beginning and he
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.539
him in battle in the beginning and he
was having a lot of fun in the first

prideful and too haughty and he needed
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.240
prideful and too haughty and he needed
to learn humility and so when he finally

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
to learn humility and so when he finally
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219
to learn humility and so when he finally
did get to fight it was so serious like

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
