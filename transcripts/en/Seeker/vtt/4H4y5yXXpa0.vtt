00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.930
Materials that can interact with electromagnetic
radiation based on their structure?

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.390
That’s so… meta.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.830
Sorry, had to.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.320
But we’re talking about metamaterials today!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.820
Actually we’ve talked about them before,
and me talking about us talking about them

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.250
is in fact…

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.250
Meta.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.270
Ok I’ll stop.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.550
But I just figured that since it’s been
over four years, three sets, and one channel

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.440
name change ago, we might look at them again
and see where the field of metamaterials is

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.440
now.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.320
First off we should get a pretty firm grip
on what exactly metamaterials are.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
Conventional materials interact with electromagnetic
radiation like light or radio waves based

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.390
on the properties of the material.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.110
We’re used to how glass bends light or how
gold reflects light and so on, and in our

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.130
everyday encounters with these objects we
know what to expect because there’s nothing

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.580
special about these materials usually.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.170
Unless some crazed engineer replaced them
with metamaterials, then things can get pretty

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.350
unnatural.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.460
Take that gold for example.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.119
You’re used to seeing it all shiny and yellowish
and even on the nanoscale that’s still true

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.180
for gold.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.200
Unless an engineer were to alter the surface
of the gold, making nanoscale structures that

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.159
changed how the light behaves.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.869
Then the gold could be green or red instead
of the usual yellowish tint.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.179
Nothing about the gold’s chemical properties
have changed, it’s still good old Au, atomic

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.450
number 79.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.130
But the structures on its surface can change
how we see it.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.990
These special structures take gold from a
conventional material to a metamaterial.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.109
You might be more familiar with the concept
than you realize.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.740
One Stanford engineer likens metamaterials
to TV antennae of old.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.079
To adjust the image quality you would wiggle
the antennae around until the geometry interacted

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.649
with the radio waves better.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.229
But the waves carrying TV broadcasts back
in the day were centimeters to meters long,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.640
so the antennas that interacted with them
were relatively big.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.679
If you want your material to interact with
electromagnetic waves that are microns to

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.689
nanometers, then the shapes are going to have
to be just a fraction of those wavelengths.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.189
You can start getting pretty creative with
these nanoscale shapes.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.140
You could make lenses that don’t rely on
the material properties of precisely shaped

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.099
glass to bend light, and instead use metamaterials
whose geometry focuses the light the same

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.520
way, but without the difficulty of shaping
a lense, or the weight of bulky glass.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.130
With metamaterials I could have glasses lenses
that are 100 times thinner than a strand of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.690
hair, but still do the same job as these old
coke-bottle bottoms of mine.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.430
Or you could start mixing materials up to
make different structures, or mixing structures

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.340
up to control electromagnetic waves in any
arbitrarily complex way you want.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.989
Obviously this has huge implications for a
lot of fields that deal with electromagnetic

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:41.989
waves.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.430
For example there are machines called synchrotrons
which use magnets to whip electrons around

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.830
and around in a circle until they give off
X-rays that are then used for various experiments.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.959
Synchrotrons are usually the size of buildings,
but using 10 million precisely etched shapes

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.110
in lithium tantalate crystal, researchers
were able to coax infrared light in a circle,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.549
causing positive and negative charges in the
crystal that gave off terahertz radiation,

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.890
waves that are between infrared and microwaves.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.109
The crystal was just half a square millimeter
in size, but it was mimicking what you normally

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.450
need a whole building to do!

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.620
Magnetic fields can be manipulated with metamaterials
too, and researchers at the university of

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.170
sussex just demonstrated a way to make one
magnet connect to another without the other

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.930
magnetic connecting back.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.599
A magnetic diode.This could make wireless
power transfer like cell phone charging much

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.469
more efficient because power would only flow
one way.

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:41.049
And of course light bending materials open
up the possibility of, wait for it… invisibility.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.200
But explaining how that works is a whole video
of it’s own.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.510
Just know that with metamaterials, the possibilities
are really only limited by how small we can

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.980
make the structures and your imagination.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.980
Pretty meta.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.329
And fun fact before you go, Meta materials
are only possible thanks to the same technology

we use to make our nanoscale integrated circuits
in today’s electronics.
