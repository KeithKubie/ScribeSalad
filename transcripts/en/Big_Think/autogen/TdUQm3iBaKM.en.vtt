when we look at all of the data that we

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
when we look at all of the data that we
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650
when we look at all of the data that we
now have when we look at the several

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

thousand descriptions that people have
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.539
thousand descriptions that people have
of the Enlightenment experiences when we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
of the Enlightenment experiences when we
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.310
of the Enlightenment experiences when we
look at over two hundred and fifty brain

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
look at over two hundred and fifty brain
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.439
look at over two hundred and fifty brain
scans that we've done of people engaged

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449
scans that we've done of people engaged
 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.820

in different types of prayer and
meditation practices I think one of the

meditation practices I think one of the
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.170
meditation practices I think one of the
things that we can ultimately distill

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
things that we can ultimately distill
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.150
things that we can ultimately distill
out of this on a very practical level is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
out of this on a very practical level is
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.730
out of this on a very practical level is
how do we actually help people down

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
how do we actually help people down

how do we actually help people down
their own path to enlightenment what are

their own path to enlightenment what are
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089
their own path to enlightenment what are
the what are the steps that people need

the what are the steps that people need
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.950
the what are the steps that people need
to think about taking so that they can

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
to think about taking so that they can
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.770
to think about taking so that they can
find their own path I think one of the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
find their own path I think one of the
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900
find their own path I think one of the
important aspects of all of this is that

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
important aspects of all of this is that
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450

on one hand we can talk about this in
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950
on one hand we can talk about this in
generalities there are certain basic

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
generalities there are certain basic
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.330
generalities there are certain basic
elements there are certain basic

approaches that people can take certain
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200
approaches that people can take certain
basic aspects of the experience that

that's meaningful for them so we start
to think about the actual steps that

to think about the actual steps that
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160
to think about the actual steps that
people take we've been able to to define

is part of what I did in my own in my
own pathway these are the kinds of

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450
own pathway these are the kinds of
 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.630
own pathway these are the kinds of
things that really helped bring a person

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640
things that really helped bring a person
 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.360
things that really helped bring a person
down their own personal path the fourth

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
down their own personal path the fourth
 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.880
down their own personal path the fourth
step is ultimately this kind of feeling

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890
step is ultimately this kind of feeling
 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.580
step is ultimately this kind of feeling
of letting it all go this feeling of

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590
of letting it all go this feeling of
 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.969
of letting it all go this feeling of
surrendering to the experience itself to

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979
surrendering to the experience itself to
 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.490
surrendering to the experience itself to
say that is is simple to actually let

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500
say that is is simple to actually let
 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.350
say that is is simple to actually let
that happen in a profound way is not

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360
that happen in a profound way is not
 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.439
that happen in a profound way is not
always the easiest thing

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449
always the easiest thing
 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.749
always the easiest thing
for an individual sometimes it has to be

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759
for an individual sometimes it has to be
 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:44.700
for an individual sometimes it has to be
that you kind of keep challenging and

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710
that you kind of keep challenging and
 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.379
that you kind of keep challenging and
revving and revving up the brain to such

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389
revving and revving up the brain to such
 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.079
revving and revving up the brain to such
an extent that when you finally do say

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089
an extent that when you finally do say
 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.790
an extent that when you finally do say
you know what okay I'm just going to let

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800
you know what okay I'm just going to let
 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.399
you know what okay I'm just going to let
this happen now that's what really just

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409
this happen now that's what really just
 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:54.989
this happen now that's what really just
kind of pulls the rug out from under the

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:54.999
kind of pulls the rug out from under the
 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:58.070
kind of pulls the rug out from under the
whole process and that very sudden

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080
whole process and that very sudden
 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.719
whole process and that very sudden
change in the way your brain goes

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729
change in the way your brain goes
 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.399
change in the way your brain goes
through the whole process that feeling

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409
through the whole process that feeling
 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:04.799
through the whole process that feeling
of surrender radically changes the way

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:04.809
of surrender radically changes the way
 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.239
of surrender radically changes the way
your brain works at that particular

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:06.249
your brain works at that particular
 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:08.429
your brain works at that particular
moment one of the areas of our brain

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:08.439
moment one of the areas of our brain
 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:10.170
moment one of the areas of our brain
that seems to be particularly involved

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180
that seems to be particularly involved
 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.420
that seems to be particularly involved
in this whole process of the rituals and

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
in this whole process of the rituals and
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.089
in this whole process of the rituals and
the feeling of surrender is our frontal

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099
the feeling of surrender is our frontal
 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.429
the feeling of surrender is our frontal
lobe located behind the far head and

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439
lobe located behind the far head and
 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.140
lobe located behind the far head and
what we have found is is that during

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150
what we have found is is that during
 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.420
what we have found is is that during
practices like meditation or prayer that

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430
practices like meditation or prayer that
 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.610
practices like meditation or prayer that
frontal lobe activity gets ramped up to

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620
frontal lobe activity gets ramped up to
 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.279
frontal lobe activity gets ramped up to
a very very high level but then when you

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289
a very very high level but then when you
 

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:28.800
a very very high level but then when you
have this feeling of surrender it drops

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810
have this feeling of surrender it drops
 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.079
have this feeling of surrender it drops
down to a very low level in fact since

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:31.089
down to a very low level in fact since
 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:33.089
down to a very low level in fact since
the frontal lobe is involved in helping

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:33.099
the frontal lobe is involved in helping
 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:35.610
the frontal lobe is involved in helping
us do purposeful things when we

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620
us do purposeful things when we
 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.769
us do purposeful things when we
ultimately give our purposefulness over

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:37.779
ultimately give our purposefulness over
 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:39.480
ultimately give our purposefulness over
to the process that frontal lobe

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
to the process that frontal lobe
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.700
to the process that frontal lobe
activity starts to decrease very

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710
activity starts to decrease very
 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.950
activity starts to decrease very
substantially and part of what we're

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960
substantially and part of what we're
 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.079
substantially and part of what we're
determining here is that it's not just

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:46.089
determining here is that it's not just
 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:50.040
determining here is that it's not just
being high and being low it's the the

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050
being high and being low it's the the
 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.200
being high and being low it's the the
difference itself it's the change from

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.210
difference itself it's the change from
 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.869
difference itself it's the change from
that peak to that very low level that

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879
that peak to that very low level that
 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.909
that peak to that very low level that
really rearranges the way the brain

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919
really rearranges the way the brain
 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:58.800
really rearranges the way the brain
works and sets up that very powerful

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810
works and sets up that very powerful
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.110
works and sets up that very powerful
experience if you think about flying in

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120
experience if you think about flying in
 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.089
experience if you think about flying in
an airplane when you're on the ground

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:03.099
an airplane when you're on the ground
 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.699
an airplane when you're on the ground
you don't feel very much and when you're

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:05.709
you don't feel very much and when you're
 

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.619
you don't feel very much and when you're
up in the air you don't feel very much

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:07.629
up in the air you don't feel very much
 

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.119
up in the air you don't feel very much
even though you're going four or five

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:09.129
even though you're going four or five
 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:10.980
even though you're going four or five
hundred miles an hour but it's the

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:10.990
hundred miles an hour but it's the
 

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.899
hundred miles an hour but it's the
take-off or the landing where you really

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:12.909
take-off or the landing where you really
 

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.339
take-off or the landing where you really
feel the change occurring and that's

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:14.349
feel the change occurring and that's
 

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:15.689
feel the change occurring and that's
kind of what's going on in the brain

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:15.699
kind of what's going on in the brain
 

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:17.879
kind of what's going on in the brain
it's not being in one state or the other

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:17.889
it's not being in one state or the other
 

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.820
it's not being in one state or the other
it's the change that occurs that really

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:20.830
it's the change that occurs that really
 

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.589
it's the change that occurs that really
sets up the dramatic experience that

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599
sets up the dramatic experience that
 

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:23.969
sets up the dramatic experience that
people can have and that drop of

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:23.979
people can have and that drop of
 

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:26.429
people can have and that drop of
activity from that very high level in

00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:26.439
activity from that very high level in
 

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.749
activity from that very high level in
the frontal lobe to the very low level

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759
the frontal lobe to the very low level
 

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.329
the frontal lobe to the very low level
in the frontal lobe is I think a very

00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:30.339
in the frontal lobe is I think a very
 

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:32.339
in the frontal lobe is I think a very
important driving force of these

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:32.349
important driving force of these
 

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:34.409
important driving force of these
biologically behind the aspect of that

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:34.419
biologically behind the aspect of that
 

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.509
biologically behind the aspect of that
experience but that feeling of surrender

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519
experience but that feeling of surrender
 

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:38.279
experience but that feeling of surrender
and giving oneself over to the

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:38.289
and giving oneself over to the
 

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.629
and giving oneself over to the
experience is a very critical element

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:39.639
experience is a very critical element
 

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:42.629
experience is a very critical element
down this process and then the last step

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:42.639
down this process and then the last step
 

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:44.400
down this process and then the last step
is really what we talked about is

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.410
is really what we talked about is
 

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.350
is really what we talked about is
reflecting on what this experience is

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360
reflecting on what this experience is
 

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.990
reflecting on what this experience is
for you and what that really means is

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000
for you and what that really means is
 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.540
for you and what that really means is
that it's not just enough to have the

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:51.550
that it's not just enough to have the
 

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.280
that it's not just enough to have the
experience but how you then incorporate

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.290
experience but how you then incorporate
 

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.090
experience but how you then incorporate
it back into

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:54.100
it back into
 

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.680
it back into
your thought processes your beliefs your

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:55.690
your thought processes your beliefs your
 

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.269
your thought processes your beliefs your
experiences of the world the ways in

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279
experiences of the world the ways in
 

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.009
experiences of the world the ways in
which you you think about the world and

00:08:59.009 --> 00:08:59.019
which you you think about the world and
 

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.680
which you you think about the world and
and being able to come back and reflect

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.690
and being able to come back and reflect
 

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.269
and being able to come back and reflect
on that whether it's just throw up

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279
on that whether it's just throw up
 

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.949
on that whether it's just throw up
thought processes or practice like

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959
thought processes or practice like
 

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:07.949
thought processes or practice like
meditation this is this is a critical

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
meditation this is this is a critical
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:09.480
meditation this is this is a critical
element because it's what ultimately

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.490
element because it's what ultimately
 

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.579
element because it's what ultimately
brings that experience into your life

00:09:11.579 --> 00:09:11.589
brings that experience into your life
 

00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:14.100
brings that experience into your life
and makes it real for you and makes it

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.110
and makes it real for you and makes it
 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.629
and makes it real for you and makes it
something that changes the way you think

00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:15.639
something that changes the way you think
 

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:17.490
something that changes the way you think
about the world for the rest of your

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:17.500
about the world for the rest of your
 

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.009
about the world for the rest of your
life so that that ability to reflect is

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:20.019
life so that that ability to reflect is
 

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:22.350
life so that that ability to reflect is
very very critical and part of this

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360
very very critical and part of this
 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.199
very very critical and part of this
process can also be that people can have

00:09:25.199 --> 00:09:25.209
process can also be that people can have
 

00:09:25.209 --> 00:09:27.720
process can also be that people can have
more of the the smally enlightenment

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:27.730
more of the the smally enlightenment
 

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.009
more of the the smally enlightenment
experiences these sort of little mini

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:29.019
experiences these sort of little mini
 

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:31.470
experiences these sort of little mini
epiphanies that as they kind of build up

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480
epiphanies that as they kind of build up
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.090
epiphanies that as they kind of build up
and as you keep bringing them back into

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.100
and as you keep bringing them back into
 

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.490
and as you keep bringing them back into
your life that can set you up also for

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.500
your life that can set you up also for
 

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.900
your life that can set you up also for
that very big enlightenment experience

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:36.910
that very big enlightenment experience
 

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.449
that very big enlightenment experience
as well so so going down all these

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:39.459
as well so so going down all these
 

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:41.370
as well so so going down all these
different paths to kind of keep coming

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.380
different paths to kind of keep coming
 

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.319
different paths to kind of keep coming
back to them to keep experiencing them

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:43.329
back to them to keep experiencing them
 

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:46.319
back to them to keep experiencing them
and keep working on it that to me is

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:46.329
and keep working on it that to me is
 

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:48.660
and keep working on it that to me is
probably the most effective way of

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:48.670
probably the most effective way of
 

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.519
probably the most effective way of
trying to get to the enlightenment

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:50.529
trying to get to the enlightenment
 

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:52.769
trying to get to the enlightenment
experience of course the bottom line is

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:52.779
experience of course the bottom line is
 

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.629
experience of course the bottom line is
is that I can never guarantee to anyone

00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:54.639
is that I can never guarantee to anyone
 

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.920
is that I can never guarantee to anyone
that you're going to have enlightenment

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:55.930
that you're going to have enlightenment
 

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.749
that you're going to have enlightenment
there is no button to push that just

00:09:57.749 --> 00:09:57.759
there is no button to push that just
 

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.910
there is no button to push that just
suddenly and magically transforms your

00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920
suddenly and magically transforms your
 

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.249
suddenly and magically transforms your
brain or gives you that experience and

00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:02.259
brain or gives you that experience and
 

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:05.370
brain or gives you that experience and
again if we look at our survey some

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.380
again if we look at our survey some
 

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.199
again if we look at our survey some
people went through many many years of

00:10:07.199 --> 00:10:07.209
people went through many many years of
 

00:10:07.209 --> 00:10:08.610
people went through many many years of
meditation before they had their

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:08.620
meditation before they had their
 

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.439
meditation before they had their
experience some people that happened

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:10.449
experience some people that happened
 

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:11.519
experience some people that happened
while they were walking down the street

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:11.529
while they were walking down the street
 

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:14.429
while they were walking down the street
so we never really know how or when it's

00:10:14.429 --> 00:10:14.439
so we never really know how or when it's
 

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:16.439
so we never really know how or when it's
going to happen but these steps I think

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:16.449
going to happen but these steps I think
 

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.870
going to happen but these steps I think
at least for people who want to try to

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880
at least for people who want to try to
 

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.050
at least for people who want to try to
pursue that path and work towards it

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060
pursue that path and work towards it
 

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.269
pursue that path and work towards it
that can be a very those five steps can

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279
that can be a very those five steps can
 

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.100
that can be a very those five steps can
be a very important way in a very

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.110
be a very important way in a very
 

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.199
be a very important way in a very
powerful way of helping to get to that

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:28.209
powerful way of helping to get to that
 

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:30.540
powerful way of helping to get to that
experience of enlightenment there's a

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.550
experience of enlightenment there's a
 

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.269
experience of enlightenment there's a
very large amount of data including data

very large amount of data including data
 

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.150
very large amount of data including data
from our survey that talk about the the

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160
from our survey that talk about the the
 

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.460
from our survey that talk about the the
downstream effects of all of this when

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:38.470
downstream effects of all of this when
 

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.170
downstream effects of all of this when
we asked people who had these

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:40.180
we asked people who had these
 

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.749
we asked people who had these
experiences in our survey about how it

00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:42.759
experiences in our survey about how it
 

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:45.689
experiences in our survey about how it
changed their life overwhelmingly these

changed their life overwhelmingly these
 

00:10:45.699 --> 00:10:48.600
changed their life overwhelmingly these
were positive experiences 95 percent of

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.610
were positive experiences 95 percent of
 

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.400
were positive experiences 95 percent of
people basically had something positive

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.410
people basically had something positive
 

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.439
people basically had something positive
to say about this experience and it

00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:52.449
to say about this experience and it
 

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:54.090
to say about this experience and it
could and it inundated almost every

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.100
could and it inundated almost every
 

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.679

aspect of their life so when we asked

aspect of their life so when we asked
 

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.079
aspect of their life so when we asked
them did it improve your relationships

them did it improve your relationships
 

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:00.540
them did it improve your relationships
with people they said yes it did because

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.550
with people they said yes it did because
 

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.129
with people they said yes it did because
they felt more compassionate more loved

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:02.139
they felt more compassionate more loved
 

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:03.660
they felt more compassionate more loved
more open with the people that they were

more open with the people that they were
interacting with when we asked them

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.240
I need to do I know why we're here I
understand it I get it you know and now

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.250

I know what I need to do in my life and
it puts their job in perspective it puts

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:22.750
it puts their job in perspective it puts
 

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.030
it puts their job in perspective it puts
all the things that they know how they

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040
all the things that they know how they
 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.110
all the things that they know how they
interact with their family and

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120
interact with their family and
 

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.360
interact with their family and
perspective so those are changes that

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.370
perspective so those are changes that
 

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.040
perspective so those are changes that
are very very important when we ask

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.050
are very very important when we ask
 

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.540
are very very important when we ask
people about their psychological and

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.550
people about their psychological and
 

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.660
people about their psychological and
physical health they almost all say yes

physical health they almost all say yes
 

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.269
physical health they almost all say yes
it was improved they felt reductions in

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279
it was improved they felt reductions in
 

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.280
it was improved they felt reductions in
the stresses that they faced and their

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.290
the stresses that they faced and their
 

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.290
the stresses that they faced and their
and their everyday life they don't think

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.300
and their everyday life they don't think
 

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.760
and their everyday life they don't think
about stress the same way they don't

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:41.770
about stress the same way they don't
 

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.810
about stress the same way they don't
think about all the things that they

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:42.820
think about all the things that they
 

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.250
think about all the things that they
were worried about that stress them out

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.260
were worried about that stress them out
 

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.440
were worried about that stress them out
in the same way you know obviously if

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:46.450
in the same way you know obviously if
 

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.510
in the same way you know obviously if
you go down the path towards the

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:48.520
you go down the path towards the
 

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.190
you go down the path towards the
Buddhist perspective of enlightenment

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200
Buddhist perspective of enlightenment
 

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.720
Buddhist perspective of enlightenment
the whole point of enlightenment is to

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:51.730
the whole point of enlightenment is to
 

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.460
the whole point of enlightenment is to
end suffering and to a large extent

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.470
end suffering and to a large extent
 

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.620
end suffering and to a large extent
that's borne out in the the way people

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:55.630
that's borne out in the the way people
 

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.329
that's borne out in the the way people
describe what these experiences do for

00:11:57.329 --> 00:11:57.339
describe what these experiences do for
 

00:11:57.339 --> 00:11:59.370
describe what these experiences do for
them that it reduces their sense of

00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.380
them that it reduces their sense of
 

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.650
them that it reduces their sense of
distress their sense of anxiety their

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:01.660
distress their sense of anxiety their
 

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.750
distress their sense of anxiety their
sense of depression it helps to improve

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760
sense of depression it helps to improve
 

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.360
sense of depression it helps to improve
all of those issues that people deal

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.370
all of those issues that people deal
 

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.100
all of those issues that people deal
with and even their physical health they

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.110
with and even their physical health they
 

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.800
with and even their physical health they
felt better overall when we ask people

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:10.810
felt better overall when we ask people
 

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.810
felt better overall when we ask people
about their fear of death people no

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:12.820
about their fear of death people no
 

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.610
about their fear of death people no
longer fear death in the same way that

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:14.620
longer fear death in the same way that
 

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.440
longer fear death in the same way that
we typically do so that seems to be

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.450
we typically do so that seems to be
 

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.930
we typically do so that seems to be
something that people experience as an

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:18.940
something that people experience as an
 

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.640
something that people experience as an
improvement from these experiences and

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:20.650
improvement from these experiences and
 

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.200
improvement from these experiences and
then ultimately when we ask people about

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.210
then ultimately when we ask people about
 

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.700
then ultimately when we ask people about
their religious and spiritual beliefs

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:23.710
their religious and spiritual beliefs
 

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.460
their religious and spiritual beliefs
again almost uniformly almost everyone

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:26.470
again almost uniformly almost everyone
 

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.380
again almost uniformly almost everyone
says that they did that those

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:28.390
says that they did that those
 

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.210
says that they did that those
experiences were also improved now

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:30.220
experiences were also improved now
 

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.250
experiences were also improved now
interestingly more people said that

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:32.260
interestingly more people said that
 

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.079
interestingly more people said that
their spirituality was improved than

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:34.089
their spirituality was improved than
 

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.940
their spirituality was improved than
their religiousness was improved so

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:35.950
their religiousness was improved so
 

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.579
their religiousness was improved so
these experiences tend to be considered

00:12:38.579 --> 00:12:38.589
these experiences tend to be considered
 

00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:41.400
these experiences tend to be considered
to be more spiritual than religious but

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:41.410
to be more spiritual than religious but
 

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.230
to be more spiritual than religious but
still there was a substantial chunk of

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.240
still there was a substantial chunk of
 

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.970
still there was a substantial chunk of
people who said that they felt that

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:44.980
people who said that they felt that
 

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.470
people who said that they felt that
their religious beliefs were also

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480
their religious beliefs were also
 

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.060
their religious beliefs were also
improved and I think it probably comes

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.070
improved and I think it probably comes
 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.710
improved and I think it probably comes
down a little bit to the nature of the

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720
down a little bit to the nature of the
 

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.990
down a little bit to the nature of the
experience if somebody feels as part of

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000
experience if somebody feels as part of
 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.250
experience if somebody feels as part of
their enlightenment experience that they

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:53.260
their enlightenment experience that they
 

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.320
their enlightenment experience that they
have now intimately connected to God and

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.330
have now intimately connected to God and
 

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.180
have now intimately connected to God and
maybe that's based on their their

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.190
maybe that's based on their their
 

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.829
maybe that's based on their their
Catholic tradition for example or their

00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839
Catholic tradition for example or their
 

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:01.560
Catholic tradition for example or their
Jewish tradition then then they feel

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:01.570
Jewish tradition then then they feel
 

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.600
Jewish tradition then then they feel
like that has been an experience which

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.610
like that has been an experience which
 

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.370
like that has been an experience which
is deep in their religious beliefs

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:05.380
is deep in their religious beliefs
 

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.500
is deep in their religious beliefs
themselves but for a lot of people they

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.510
themselves but for a lot of people they
 

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.470
themselves but for a lot of people they
have this experience and it almost seems

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480
have this experience and it almost seems
 

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.390
have this experience and it almost seems
to blow away the religious beliefs or at

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.400
to blow away the religious beliefs or at
 

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.070
to blow away the religious beliefs or at
least the religious doctrines and they

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.080
least the religious doctrines and they
 

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.050
least the religious doctrines and they
feel that that the religion itself is

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:16.060
feel that that the religion itself is
 

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.110
feel that that the religion itself is
sort of too limited in terms of helping

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120
sort of too limited in terms of helping
 

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.240
sort of too limited in terms of helping
them to experience and explain

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:21.250
them to experience and explain
 

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.770
them to experience and explain
what that feeling was when they feel

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:22.780
what that feeling was when they feel
 

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.570
what that feeling was when they feel
that experience of enlightenment so

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:24.580
that experience of enlightenment so
 

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.790
that experience of enlightenment so
almost everybody feels more spiritual

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800
almost everybody feels more spiritual
 

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.280
almost everybody feels more spiritual
but many people also feel more religious

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.290
but many people also feel more religious
 

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.410
but many people also feel more religious
and the bottom line is is that almost

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.420
and the bottom line is is that almost
 

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.780
and the bottom line is is that almost
regardless of what aspect of a person's

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:33.790
regardless of what aspect of a person's
 

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.920
regardless of what aspect of a person's
life you're talking about these

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:34.930
life you're talking about these
 

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.720
life you're talking about these
experiences change it dramatically

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:36.730
experiences change it dramatically
 

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.160
experiences change it dramatically
change it for the better

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.170
change it for the better
 

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.980
change it for the better
and clearly change the brain itself as

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:40.990
and clearly change the brain itself as
 

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.930
and clearly change the brain itself as
well so we see all of these kinds of

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:42.940
well so we see all of these kinds of
 

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.600
well so we see all of these kinds of
changes reflected in the person after

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:45.610
changes reflected in the person after
 

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.690
changes reflected in the person after
they have this kind of experience
