00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Things are actually even worst.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We cannot set the wheel slip directly and we can't even set the brakes directly, at least not

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the standard type of hydraulic brake that's part of common cars.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So realistic approach to anti-lock braking is the following--the driver slams on the brake

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as strongly as possible and then the electronic checks whether the wheel slips becomes too large.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If so, it starts to decrease the pressure of the brake fluid and so on and so on.

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The implementation of this will be part of the homework.
