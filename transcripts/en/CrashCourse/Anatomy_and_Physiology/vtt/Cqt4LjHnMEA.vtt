00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Picture this: You’re getting ready to give
a big presentation in front of, like, a lot

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.100
of important people. You’re practicing in
front of your mirror, and then just for a

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.550
second you forget how to speak.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.580
Suddenly, you feel that familiar sting of anxiety,
like an icy hand on the back of your neck.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.340
You look at yourself in that mirror and you
start imagining some of the worst, worst-case

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.640
scenarios. Like, what if you totally lose
your train of thought up there? What if you

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.439
barf? What if everybody gets up and leaves?
Now you’re really nervous. I’m getting

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.099
freaked out just talking about it.

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.339
So ou start taking quick, shallow breaths,
and you’re feeling light-headed, and seeing

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.280
stars, and now you, my friend, are hyperventilating.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.520
When we talk about respiration, we tend to
focus on oxygen -- and who could blame us?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.600
It’s easy to forget the equally important
role that carbon dioxide plays in maintaining

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.920
homeostasis. Your internal balance between
oxygen and carbon dioxide factors heavily

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.880
into all sorts of stuff -- especially in your
blood, where it can affect your blood’s

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.240
pressure, its pH level, even its temperature.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.000
And now -- at, like, T-minus 5 minutes to
your presentation -- all of those things are

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
out of whack, because you’re exhaling more
CO2 than you should.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.840
You’re just about to faint, when a friend
suddenly hands you a paper bag to breathe

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.340
into. And you’ve never been so grateful
for a lunch bag in your life, because, somehow,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.480
it does the trick.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340
Within seconds, you’re back to normal.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.799
The drop in CO2 that occurs in your blood
when you hyperventilate is called hypocapnia,

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.549
and it signals a breakdown in one of the most
complex and important functions that your

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.420
respiratory system performs.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.399
That is: the exchange of gases inside your
blood cells, where the stuff your body doesn’t

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.149
want is swapped out for what it desperately
needs.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.299
This exchange -- between carbon dioxide and
oxygen -- is regulated by a whole series of

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.289
biological signals that your blood cells use
to communicate with your tissues, about what

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.979
they have, what they want, and what they need
to get rid of.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.859
It’s almost like a code, one that’s written
into your blood’s chemistry, in the folding

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.619
of its proteins -- even in its temperature
and acidity.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.680
It’s what allows you to perform strenuous
physical tasks, like climbing a mountain.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.680
It’s also what lets you reboot your whole respiratory
system, with nothing more than a paper bag.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.000
I’ll admit it: when we’ve talked about the 
chemistry of your blood so far, we’ve

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.760
tended to keep things pretty simple.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.630
Like, hemoglobin contains four protein chains,
each of which contains an iron atom; since

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.930
iron binds readily with oxygen, that’s how
hemoglobin transports oxygen around your body.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.760
Ba-da-bing.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.940
But the fact is, hemoglobin’s affinity for
oxygen isn’t always the same.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.680
In some places, we want our hemoglobin to
have a high affinity for oxygen, so it can

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.160
easily grab it out of the air.
And in others, we want it to have

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.100
a low affinity for oxygen oxygen, so it can
dump those molecules to feed our cells.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.860
So how does your hemoglobin know when to collect
its precious cargo and when to let it go?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.780
Well, a lot of it has to do with a principle
of chemistry known as partial pressure.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.890
One of the things that fluids always do is
move from areas of high pressure to low pressure.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.160
And molecules also diffuse from areas of high
concentration to areas of low concentration.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.060
But when we talk about gases in a mixture, we need
to combine the ideas of pressure and concentration.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.100
See, air is a mixture of molecules. And when
you’re studying the respiratory system,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.140
you often need to focus on the oxygen, which
makes up about 21% of it.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.100
But that doesn’t tell us how many oxygen
molecules there are. For that, we need to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.860
know the overall air pressure, since more
molecules in a certain volume means more pressure.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.580
So, partial pressure gives us a way of
understanding how much oxygen there is,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.660
based on the pressure that it’s creating.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.880
Example: The pressure of air at sea level
is about 760 millimeters of mercury. But since

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.100
only about 21 percent of that air is oxygen,
oxygen’s part of that pressure -- or partial

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.760
pressure of oxygen -- is 21% of 760, or about
160 millimeters of mercury.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.520
Now, that’s just outside, at sea level.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.640
When that air mixes with the air deep in your
lungs -- including a lot of air that you haven’t

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.700
exhaled yet -- the partial pressure of oxygen
drops to about 104 millimeters of mercury.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.410
And in the blood that’s entering your lungs
-- after most of its oxygen has been stripped

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.730
away by your hungry muscles and neurons -- the
oxygen partial pressure is only about 40 millimeters.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.520
This big differences in pressure make it easy for
oxygen molecules to travel from the outside air into

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.620
your blood plasma, because, as a rule dissolved gases
always diffuse down their partial pressure gradients.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.180
This is why it’s so much harder to breathe
at higher altitudes. When you climb a mountain,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.680
the concentration of oxygen stays at about 21%.
But the pressure gets lower, which means the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.180
partial pressure of oxygen also decreases to about
45 millimeters of mercury at the top of Mt. Everest.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.960
So the partial pressure of oxygen at the top
of the highest peak in the world, is almost

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.410
the same as the de-oxygenated blood that’s
entering your lungs.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.350
So basically there is no partial pressure
gradient, which makes it really hard to get

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.440
oxygen into your blood. But, let’s get back
to the red blood cells.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.860
Remember that the globin in your hemoglobin
is a protein -- and when proteins bind to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.270
stuff, they tend to change shape. And that
shape-change can make the protein more or

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.640
less likely to bind to other stuff.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.560
When an empty hemoglobin runs into an oxygen
molecule, things are a little awkward.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.190
It’s like a first date -- bonding isn’t
so easy.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.870
But once they finally bind, hemoglobin suddenly
changes shape, which makes it easier for other

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.590
oxygen molecules to attach, like friends gathering
around the lunch table.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.650
That affinity for joining in -- or cooperativity,
as it’s known -- continues until all four

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.750
binding sites are taken, and the molecule
is fully saturated.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.150
Now your hemoglobin is known as oxyhemoglobin,
or HbO2. It is not...not why the cable network

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.160
is called that. That’s the “Home Box Office.”
Anyway.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.420
By the time the blood leaves the lungs, each
hemoglobin is fully saturated, the oxygen

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.790
partial pressure in your plasma is about 100
millimeters, and now it is ready to be delivered

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.490
to where it is needed most.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.660
Active tissues, like the brain, heart, and
muscles, are always hungry for oxygen. They

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.419
burn through it quickly, lowering the oxygen
partial pressure around them to about 40 millimeters.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.150
So when the blood arrives on the scene, oxygen
moves down the gradient from the plasma to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.210
the tissues, to feed those hungry cells.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.160
That makes the oxygen partial pressure in
your plasma drop, so your hemoglobin starts

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.560
to give up more of its oxygen to the plasma.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.540
BUT! Partial pressures are only part of what’s
prodding your hemoglobin to give up the goods.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.700
All of that metabolic activity going on in
your tissues is also producing other triggers,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.160
in the form of waste products -- specifically
heat and CO2.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.900
Both of those things activate the release of more
oxygen, by lowering hemoglobin’s affinity for it.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.360
Say you’re climbing that mountain again,
and your thighs are feeling the burn. Red

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.660
blood cells saturated with oxygen are going
to the muscle tissue in your quads, where

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.660
the hemoglobin can dump a bunch of O2, because of
the lower partial pressures of oxygen in your muscles.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.060
But a hard-working quad will also heat up
the surrounding tissues, and that rise in

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.000
temperature changes the shape of hemoglobin -- and
it does it in such a way that lowers its affinity for O2.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.260
So when those red blood cells hit that warm
active tissue, they release even more oxygen

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.980
-- like 20 percent more -- beyond what partial
pressures would trigger.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.840
But wait! There’s more!

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.540
Carbon dioxide triggers the release of oxygen,
too, because it also binds to the hemoglobin,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.320
changing its shape again, lowering its affinity
for oxygen still more. And as oxygen jumps

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.880
ship, the hemoglobin can pick up more CO2.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.240
Finally, JUST IN CASE the hemoglobin isn’t
getting the message at this point, there’s

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.680
one more trigger that your respiratory system
has up its sleeve. The spike in CO2 that’s

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.000
released by your active muscle tissues
actually makes your blood more acidic.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.550
Since your blood is mostly water, when CO2
dissolves in it, it forms carbonic acid, which

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.790
breaks down into bicarbonate and hydrogen
ions. Those ions bind to the hemoglobin, changing

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.669
its shape yet again, further lowering its
affinity for oxygen.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:27.979
So now, at last, your tissues have the oxygen
they need, and your red blood cells are stuck

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:30.410
with all this CO2 that they need to get rid of.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.780
Your red blood cells ride the vein-train
back to the lungs,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.800
where they encounter a new wave
of freshly inhaled oxygen.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.620
And when that O2 binds to the hemoglobin -- which,
again, is hard at first -- it eventually changes

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.520
its shape back to the way it was when we started,
which decreases its affinity for CO2.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.060
So the hemoglobin drops its carbon dioxide,
which moves down its partial pressure gradient

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.980
into the air of your lungs, so you can exhale it,
and the whole thing can start all over again.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.100
Now if that isn’t enough to make you hyperventilate,
I’m not sure what is.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.360
But this brings us back to that unfortunate
episode you had before your big presentation.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.540
This whole complex code of chemical signals
that I just described? Well, it assumes that

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.360
what your cells and tissues are telling each
other is actually true.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.600
But as we all know, sometimes our bodies don’t
mean what they say. Thanks, body.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.400
Like, when you’re freaking out about your
presentation, your sympathetic nervous system

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.500
makes your heart race and your breathing increase,
to prepare you to fight or flee.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.820
The problem is: there’s nothing to actually
fight or flee from, so your muscles aren’t

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.850
actually doing anything, so they’re not using
all the extra oxygen you’re breathing  in.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.770
And they also aren't producing the extra CO2 that
you're suddenly exhaling all over the place.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.740
So when you start to exhale CO2 faster than
your cells release it, its concentration in

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:43.390
your blood drops. And with less carbonic acid
around, your blood’s pH starts to rise.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.270
And you know what else? While low blood pH
does things like change the shape of your

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.480
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen, high pH causes
vasoconstriction.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.820
Normally, this is supposed to divert blood
from the parts you’re not using during times

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.960
of stress, like your digestive organs, to
the parts that you are using.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.899
But when you hyperventilate, this constriction
happens everywhere, which means less blood

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:04.570
is delivered to your brain, which makes you
light-headed.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.820
Luckily, that trick with the breathing into
the paper bag -- it really does work.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.180
It works because it lets you breathe back
in all of the CO2 you just breathed out. So

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.500
the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in
the bag is higher, which forces that CO2 into

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.850
your blood, which lowers its pH, and you get
back to homeostasis.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.780
And of course, homeostasis is the key to life...and
you know, also to a successful presentation.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.340
If you were able to remain calm today, you
learned how your blood cells exchange oxygen

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.010
and CO2 to maintain homeostasis. We talked
about partial pressure gradients, and how

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.620
they, along with changes in blood temperature,
acidity, and CO2 concentrations, change how

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.140
hemoglobin binds to gases in your blood. And
you learned how the thing with the bag works.
