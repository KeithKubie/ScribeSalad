00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.360
People with generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, are characterized by constant stress or excessive anxiety.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.640
When something stressful happens, the brain releases cortisol and adrenaline, causing the muscles to prepare to fight off the stressor or run away from it.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.480
This is otherwise known as a sympathetic nervous system response, or the fight-or-flight reflex.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.900
People with GAD have fight-or-flight constantly running on the back burner. Each of the following points is a result of that reflex.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.760
Restlessness and fidgeting.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.940
This is more the flight than the fight response. The muscles and brain are ready to go, but there's nothing to run from.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.860
This is why doctors say that regular exercise alleviates symptoms of anxiety because people are using all their pent-up "go" hormones in their bodies to actually go.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.200
Some people find it helpful to have a small object to occupy their hands, like a scrap of paper to fold and tear.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.920
This way, the hands are kept busy and prevented from harmful fidgeting habits like chewing or picking at their fingers.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.680
Lack of energy or rapid fatigue.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.700
The flip side of your body constantly being ready to run or fight, is that it's truly exhausting.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:30.460
For example, if you were to tense every muscle possible in your body right now and hold it for the rest of forever, you'd get exhausted pretty quick.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.760
When all your energy is going toward something that could require an immediate response, then everyday tasks, like getting up to turn off the lights, seem much more tiring.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.540
Irritable bowels, acid reflux, nausea, or other stomach ailments.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.840
The first thought is probably 'ew', but if you think about it, this makes a lot of sense. People can't run long distances or perform heavy workouts with a full stomach, or that leads to cramps.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.860
So this is your body attempting to rush the job of digestion so that it can allow for a fight and make your body lighter, and more aerodynamic which makes fleeing easier.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.700
Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:17.400
This one is pretty simple. If you're in one place for too long, the danger could catch up to you. Your body, however, doesn't realize that there isn't actually any danger.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.620
So, if you stay awake or only sleep short periods of time, it's safer.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:32.260
Unfortunately, this system is a nasty cycle. You get anxious so you can't sleep, which leads to even more stress on your mind and body, which makes it even harder to sleep, and so on...

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.960
Hyperventilation.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.820
Muscles processing more energy require more oxygen to keep up the exertion. So breathing quickly would help to maximize oxygen intake.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.540
The challenge occurs when we overexert this response, and the lungs don't have time to pull the oxygen out of the air we breathe before we exhale.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.520
That's when oxygen intake decreases and results in that dizzy sensation many people experience during a panic attack.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.400
Heart palpitations.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.420
Similar to the hyperventilation symptom, heart palpitations happen because the body uses blood to carry oxygen to the muscles.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.860
In order to carry the most oxygen fastest to hardworking muscles, the heart has to pump it faster, resulting in palpitations.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.360
Clenched jaw or teeth grinding.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:27.560
Your body is ready for action. However, the challenge with anxiety disorders is not knowing what action. So your body responds with tensed muscles like a clenched jaw and teeth grinding.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:36.460
Other common muscle tension responses could be clenched fists, curled toes, tension headache, or chronic migraines and neck or shoulder pain.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.780
Shaking hands.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.500
This is another sign that adrenaline is sending your body signals to "go" in a situation when you don't want to go anywhere.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.900
This can also be a by-product of tension due to overexertion of the muscles.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.060
Sweating.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.280
Sweat is our body's way of cooling off during intense energy exertion.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.320
Muscles are burning energy being tensed and ready to go to work, which is generating heat, so the body moderates its temperature by sweating, even when you feel cold.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.780
Hot and cold sensations.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.420
The fight-or-flight response excites the body, which causes increased energy flows and creates heat.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:23.840
If the heat generated is intense enough, the body's parasympathetic nervous system is triggered, which creates a relaxation response. However, the body also sweats to cool itself when heat is generated.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:33.140
Coupled with the sudden relaxation, courtesy of the parasympathetic system, the body can experience chills because it cools too fast and is not used to the lower core temperature.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.900
Anxiety is a state of constant fear due to stressors from your body.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:47.600
This fear was a logical response for a prehistoric human, who needed to run or scare away predators when in danger, but it can be distracting in today's fast-paced world.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.660
The silver lining though, is that people with anxiety are the ones most prepared for surviving the zombie apocalypse.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.700
Do you or someone around you suffer from these symptoms of anxiety?
