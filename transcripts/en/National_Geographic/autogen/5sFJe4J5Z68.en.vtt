there was the first target that we

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020
there was the first target that we
 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.499
there was the first target that we
looked at in deeper water there it was

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
looked at in deeper water there it was
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.030
looked at in deeper water there it was
right in front of us I remember the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
right in front of us I remember the
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.669
right in front of us I remember the
first images of this small forest it

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
first images of this small forest it
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919
first images of this small forest it
seemed like of wooden objects rising up

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
seemed like of wooden objects rising up
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.870
seemed like of wooden objects rising up
out of the sediment and everyone was

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
out of the sediment and everyone was
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.849
out of the sediment and everyone was
just like this is something interesting

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
just like this is something interesting
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490
just like this is something interesting
and then as we got closer we found this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
and then as we got closer we found this
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080
and then as we got closer we found this
one piece that seemed to be much taller

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
one piece that seemed to be much taller
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.370
one piece that seemed to be much taller
than the other ones and they started

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
than the other ones and they started
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410
than the other ones and they started
following it up and I just kept going

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
following it up and I just kept going
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.140
following it up and I just kept going
and going and going and we got to the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
and going and going and we got to the
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600
and going and going and we got to the
top like this is the mast of a ship and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
top like this is the mast of a ship and
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.920
top like this is the mast of a ship and
the room just sort of went quiet from

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
the room just sort of went quiet from
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900
the room just sort of went quiet from
the not at the top of the mast to the
