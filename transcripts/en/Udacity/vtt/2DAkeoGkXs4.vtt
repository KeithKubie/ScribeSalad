00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.166
So that ends our conversation
about segmentation.

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.576
You can go from these, sort of,
very simple methods that just, sort of,

00:00:05.576 --> 00:00:08.986
cluster in some feature space, to ones
that cluster the feature space and

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:11.151
then do histograms and
cluster around those.

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:15.929
To the more gra, the more complicated
graph-based methods which use fo,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.208
some form of spectral
partitioning in order to div

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.160
to split the graph
into multiple sections.
