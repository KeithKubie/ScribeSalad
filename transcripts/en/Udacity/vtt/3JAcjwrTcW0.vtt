00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] There's one last type of memory in your computer that I want to talk about,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which is the hard drive.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is what a hard drive looks like.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can see that this hard drive has 1 terabyte of data.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you turn it upside down, you can maybe get a little better sense of what's going on here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It's a little hard to see.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My wife drew the line at opening the hard drive,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so I'm sorry I can't show you inside it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But inside here there's a bunch of disks that are spinning,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the disks are storing data in a magnetic way,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and there's a read head that can read data from the disk

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
as well as write new data from the disk.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So this is a very slow way of storing data compared to what we have in the DRAM,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but it can store a lot more data with a lot less cost.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There are 2 important properties that the hard drive has.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The hard drive is a lot bigger than the DRAM. It stores a lot more memory.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This was 2 gigabytes. This is 1 terabyte, so that's 500 times as much memory.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And a terabyte is close to a trillion bytes, so that's 8 * 2 to the 40 bits,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is equivalent to 8.8 trillion bits.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is enough memory to store about a quarter million songs.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The latency for a hard drive is much worse than the latency for the DRAM memory.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the reason for that, if you think about what you have to do

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to get data out of the hard drive, you've got these disks that are spinning

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in a physical thing, so you've got to wait until it spins to the point in the read head

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
where you can read it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If it's not in the right place, the read head also has to move across this.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You're moving real physical things, so that takes time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The latency for a hard drive is about 7 milliseconds,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and a millisecond is 1/1000th of a second.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And that's the average time. The time varies depending on where the data is.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So if you have to wait for it to spin all the way around and move to the head,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that can take a lot longer.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
If you're lucky, the data is in the right place and it doesn't take that long.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The cost of this hard drive is about $100 US dollars.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So let's add the hard drive to our data table.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
For the quiz it's up to you to figure out the values for the hard drive in the data table.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
As a reminder, we said it was $100 US for a 1.0 terabyte hard drive.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Your goal is to figure out the number of bits.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I've told you the latency is 7 milliseconds. That's a milli, not a nano.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You should be able to compute the latency distance.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The units to use for this are kilometers.
