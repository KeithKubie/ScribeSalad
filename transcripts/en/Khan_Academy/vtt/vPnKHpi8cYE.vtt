00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:02.581
- [Voiceover] In this video
we're talking some more

00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:06.249
about the DBQ or
document-based question section

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.733
of the AP U.S. history exam.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.984
In our first video we just
went through some general

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:15.120
strategy about how to
approach the question,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.766
which asks you to write an essay

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.622
with a thesis statement
addressing this question

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:25.244
about the social and economic experiences

00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:28.541
of African Americans moving from the South

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:32.512
to the North in the period 1910 to 1930

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:36.250
using a series of primary
documents which are provided

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.107
in the exam.

00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:40.174
In this video we're
gonna start taking a look

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.100
at these documents and it's going to seem

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.376
like this might take forever because

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:48.719
I'm going through them really
slowly and methodically,

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.274
but actually on the exam
itself you'll be able

00:00:51.274 --> 00:00:52.828
to look at these and get a sense

00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:54.919
of what's going on pretty quickly.

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:56.938
So let's go through these
documents one by one

00:00:56.938 --> 00:00:58.889
and I'm gonna put them up on the screen

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.723
and go through them and
take a few notes on them

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.740
so that we can see all of
them before we go about

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.620
the process of writing a thesis statement.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.548
So the first document we have here is

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.425
an African American folk
saying from the South

00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:16.305
in the 1910s.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.069
And the folk saying says the white man

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.042
got half the crop,
boll-weevil took the rest,

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.712
and I ain't got no home.

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:24.455
So what does this remind you of?

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:29.144
Well, it's definitely a
reference here to sharecropping

00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:33.788
which was a system of agricultural labor

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:37.248
devised after the Civil
War where white men

00:01:37.248 --> 00:01:40.196
would own a bunch of land and then rent

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:43.355
portions of it to African American farmers

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.909
and in return those farmers had to give

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.789
portions of their crops
back to the landowners.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.458
So this really ended
in a never-ending cycle

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:53.315
of debt for sharecroppers who could

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:54.710
never get ahead.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.470
It also mentions the boll
weevil which was a pest

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.189
that got into the cotton crop,

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.372
which really reduced the amount of cotton

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:05.020
produced in the South and led to

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.636
a major economic crisis.

00:02:09.873 --> 00:02:12.891
And lastly it talks about a kind of sense

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:14.655
of dislocation, right?

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.420
You don't have a home because you're in

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.759
serious economic trouble.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.946
All right, not bad.

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:26.614
Let's move on to a second document.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:28.425
All right, well this one
is a lot longer so I'm

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:31.212
gonna try to squeeze it in here.

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:34.183
It says it is a letter from a prospective

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:37.713
African American migrant in 1917

00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:39.571
who lives in New Orleans.

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.684
He writes, "Dear Sirs,

00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:44.053
"being desirous of leaving the South for

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.374
"the betterment of my condition generally

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:48.580
"and seeking a home somewhere in Illinois

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.437
"Chicago or some other prosperous town

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.177
"I am at sea about the
best place to locate

00:02:54.177 --> 00:02:57.310
"having a family dependent
upon me for support.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.796
"I am informed by the Chicago Defender,

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.373
"a very valuable paper
which has for its purpose

00:03:02.373 --> 00:03:04.301
"the uplifting of my race,

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.597
"and of which I am a constant
reader and real lover,

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:10.036
"that you were in a
position to show some light

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:12.403
"to one in my condition.

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:14.609
"Seeking a Northern home.

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.837
"If this is true kindly
inform me by next mail

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:20.555
"the next best thing
to do being a poor man

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.482
"with a family to care for.

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:25.895
"I am not coming to live
on flowery beds of ease

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:28.937
"for I am a man who works and wish to make

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.097
"the best I can out of life.

00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:33.232
"I do not wish to come there hoodwinked

00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:35.903
"and not know where to go or what to do.

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:38.202
"so I solicit your help in this matter

00:03:38.202 --> 00:03:40.547
"and thanking you in
advance for what advice

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:42.172
"you may be pleased to give.

00:03:42.172 --> 00:03:44.377
"I am yours for success."

00:03:44.377 --> 00:03:47.885
So in this document it's a man

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:51.901
who is trying to relocate to the North

00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:56.800
and he's drawing on the assistance

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.449
of the Chicago Defender,

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.158
which was a major black newspaper.

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.221
And he's also saying
that he is maybe afraid

00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:11.730
of being hoodwinked,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.659
so you could see that perhaps he's heard

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.678
some rumors that Southerners moving

00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:17.605
to the North might get into trouble

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:22.040
or be conned some how.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.198
And he's also very eager to say that

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.821
he doesn't want to live
on flowery beds of ease.

00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:30.562
He's a working man.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.419
So he is coming expecting
to do a good job.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.345
He's looking for work
and he's trying to put

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:39.776
to rest any stereotypes
that he could be a lazy man.

00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:48.280
Okay, here's our third document.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.201
It is an article in the
magazine Industrial Management

00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.710
from 1918,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.239
and it's written by
Dwight Thompson Farnham.

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:01.816
That's not anyone we've
ever heard of before,

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:04.621
but says he's a efficiency expert,

00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.897
so someone whose job it is to make sure

00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:09.242
that businesses are run efficiently.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.517
And his article is called
Negroes as a Source

00:05:11.517 --> 00:05:13.397
of Industrial Labor.

00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:14.861
Here's what he says.

00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:17.925
"A certain amount of
segregation is necessary

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:20.666
"at times to preserve the peace.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:23.476
"This is especially true
when negroes are first

00:05:23.476 --> 00:05:25.588
"introduced into a plant.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:28.235
"It is a question if it is not always best

00:05:28.235 --> 00:05:31.253
"to have separate washrooms and the like.

00:05:31.253 --> 00:05:33.994
"In places where different
races necessarily come

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:36.687
"into close contact and
in places where inherited

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:39.822
"characteristics are
especially accentuated,

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:42.399
"it is better to keep
their respective folkways

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.210
"from clashing wherever possible."

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.251
So in this document it seems like he is

00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:51.409
advising people who own factories

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.775
to segregate workers.

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:58.120
So if they're going to
hire black laborers,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.303
that they have to keep
them separate from whites,

00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:03.344
especially in bathrooms or places where

00:06:03.344 --> 00:06:06.339
inherited characteristics
are especially accentuated,

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:07.803
whatever that means.

00:06:07.803 --> 00:06:10.867
To me it sounds like a
sort of racist biology

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:14.228
that he's quoting here.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.077
I think another thing that he's saying

00:06:26.077 --> 00:06:29.583
is he's giving a clue that
white workers in the North

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:31.766
are not necessarily going to be friendly

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.391
to black workers,

00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:36.851
so I think it's fair to
say that it shows that

00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:39.312
African Americans moving to the North

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:42.553
are going to face racism

00:06:42.553 --> 00:06:44.989
and various forms

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:47.893
of violence or maybe even strikes

00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:51.928
from white people who don't
want to work with them.

00:06:57.623 --> 00:06:59.643
All right, let's do one more.

00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:01.824
This is another long one.

00:07:01.824 --> 00:07:05.377
A article from a white-owned newspaper,

00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:07.746
seems like that's important,

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:10.254
from Jackson, Mississippi

00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:14.285
about a race riot in Chicago in 1919.

00:07:14.285 --> 00:07:17.978
The article says, "The
only surprising feature

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:20.579
"about the race riot in Chicago yesterday

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:24.014
"is that it did not
assume larger proportions.

00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:25.779
"Trouble has been brewing in that city

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.545
"for several months and nothing short of

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:30.099
"exceptionally good work
by the police department

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.909
"can prevent further clashes.

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:34.974
"The native white population of Chicago

00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:37.854
"bitterly resents the
influx of negro labor

00:07:37.854 --> 00:07:39.711
"and especially the housing of blacks

00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:41.244
"in white neighborhoods.

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:44.587
"The decent, hard-working,
law-abiding Mississippi

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:47.745
"negroes who were lured
to Chicago by the bait

00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:51.043
"of higher wages only to lose their jobs

00:07:51.043 --> 00:07:54.386
"or forced to accept lower
pay after the labor shortage

00:07:54.386 --> 00:07:58.265
"became less acute are hereby
notified that they will be

00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:01.677
"welcomed back home and
find their old positions

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:03.211
"waiting for them.

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.439
"Mississippi may lynch
a negro when he commits

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:07.971
"the most heinous of all crimes,

00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:10.804
"but we do not blow up
the innocent with bombs

00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:13.613
"or explode sticks of
dynamite on their doorsteps."

00:08:13.613 --> 00:08:15.192
Well, youch.

00:08:15.192 --> 00:08:17.050
There's a lot going on here.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.810
First, you can see that this
is a white-owned newspaper

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.714
and it seems like maybe they're trying

00:08:23.714 --> 00:08:26.848
to spread the word to African Americans

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:29.333
who maybe have not yet left the South

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:32.375
that things are not that
great in the North, right?

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:33.675
'Cause they don't want
to lose their source

00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:35.417
of labor to the North.

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:38.412
So basically they're saying
that if African Americans

00:08:38.412 --> 00:08:41.152
stay in the South they might get lynched,

00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:45.441
but that's better than
being killed in a race riot.

00:08:48.698 --> 00:08:52.740
I think what we can take away from this

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.361
is in general there
weren't many good options

00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:59.146
for African Americans in this time period

00:08:59.146 --> 00:09:01.493
because in the South you have lynch law

00:09:01.493 --> 00:09:03.722
and in the North you have race riots.

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:07.482
So the question is was
one better than the other?

00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:09.132
Now there are still three more documents

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.059
for us to look at and we'll get to those

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.475
in the next video,

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:14.333
but I think if we have to kind of theorize

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:16.538
right now about what's going on,

00:09:16.538 --> 00:09:19.883
it seems like there are
many African Americans

00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:23.645
who have been seriously hurt economically

00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:27.614
by sharecropping and the
boll weevil infestation

00:09:27.614 --> 00:09:30.076
who are looking to go North,

00:09:30.076 --> 00:09:32.305
but they're finding
that when they go North

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.161
they may face segregation and violence

00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.738
that may or may not be
better than the lynch law

00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:39.295
of the South.

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.360
In the next video we'll
take a look at the last

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.518
three documents and then we'll take a stab

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:46.654
at writing a strong thesis statement

00:09:46.654 --> 00:09:49.230
based on this evidence.
