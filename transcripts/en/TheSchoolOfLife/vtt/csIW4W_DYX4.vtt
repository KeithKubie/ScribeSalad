00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.850
Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient
Greek kingdom of Macedonia

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.889
where his father was the royal doctor.
He grew up to be arguably the most influential

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.210
philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like
‘the master’ and simply ‘the philosopher’.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.390
His first big job was tutoring Alexander the
Great who, soon after, went out and conquered

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.550
the known world

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.529
Aristotle then headed off to Athens, worked
with Plato for a bit, then branched out on

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.440
his own. He founded a little school called
the Lyceum. French secondary schools - ‘the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.040
lycees’ - are named in honour of this venture.
He liked to walk about while teaching and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.390
discussing ideas.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.410
His followers were nicknamed ‘peripatetics’
- ‘the wanderers.’

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.480
His many books are actually lecture
notes

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.690
Aristotle was fascinated by how many things

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.030
actually work: how does a chick grow in an
egg? How do squid reproduce?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850
Why does a plant grow well in one place

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.170
and hardly at all in another? And - most
importantly - what makes a human life, and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.619
a whole society, go well?
For Aristotle, philosophy was about practical

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.280
wisdom.
Here are four big philosophical questions

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.900
he answered.
One : what makes people happy?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.810
In the ‘Nicomachean’ ethics (the book
got it’s name because it was edited by his

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.580
son, Nicomachus) Aristotle set himself the
task of identifying the factors that lead

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300
people to have a good life - or not.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.080
He suggested that good and successful people
all possess distinct ‘virtues’ - and proposed

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.200
that we should get better at identifying what
these are, so that we can nurture them in

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.010
ourselves and honour them in others. Aristotle
zeroed in on 11 virtues

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.080
Courage
Temperance

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.170
Liberality
Magnificence

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.210
Magnanimity
Pride

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.010
Patience
Truthfulness

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.030
Wittiness
Friendliness

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.210
Modesty

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.560
Aristotle also observed that every virtue
seems to be bang in the middle of two vices.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.479
It occupies what he termed ‘the golden mean’
[a perfectly balanced plank on triangle] between

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.750
two extremes of character.
For example, in Book IV of his Ethics, under

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.090
the charming title of ‘Conversational Virtues:
wit, buffoonery and boorishness’, Aristotle

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.470
looks at ways people are better or worse at
conversation. (knowing how to have a good

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.799
conversation is one of the ingredients of
the good life, Aristotle recognised).

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.209
Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle
sense of humour: that’s the “boor”,

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.099
someone “useless for any kind of social
intercourse, because he contributes nothing

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.370
and takes offence at everything.’

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.440
But others carry humour to excess: ‘The
buffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.740
himself, nor anybody else provided that he
can raise a laugh, and saying things that

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.300
a man of taste would never dream of saying.’

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.820
So the ‘virtuous’ person is in the golden
mean in this area: witty, but tactful.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
A particularly fascinating moment is when
Aristotle draws up a table of ‘too little’

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.140
‘too much’ and ‘just right’ around
the whole host of virtues.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.989
We can’t change our behaviour in any of
these areas just at the drop of a hat. But

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.380
change is possible, eventually. ‘Moral goodness’
says Aristotle ‘ is the result of habit’.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.410
It takes times, practice, encouragement. So,
Aristotle thinks, people who lack virtue should

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.450
be understood as unfortunate rather than wicked.
What they need is not scolding or being thrown

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.710
in prison but better teachers, more guidance.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.470
Two: what is art for?

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.599
The blockbuster art at that time was tragedy.
Athenians watched gory plays at community

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.250
festivals in huge open air theatres. Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles were household names.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.830
Aristotle wrote a ‘how to write great plays’
manual: the Poetics. It’s packed with great

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.150
tips.
For example, make sure to use:

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.069
peripeteia - a change in fortune, when for
the hero things go from great to awful [in

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.959
Titanic, Leonardo de Caprio gets Kate Winslow
(great) then they hit the iceberg (awful)

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.209
and
anagnoresis - a moment of dramatic revelation

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.379
when suddenly the hero works out their life
is a catastrophe

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.510
But what is tragedy actually for? What is

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.819
the point of a whole community coming together
to watch horrible things happening to the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.569
lead characters? Like Oedipus (in the play
by Sophocles) who by accident, kills his father,

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.870
gets married to his mother, finds out he’s
done these things [on screen: anagnoresis!)

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.360
and gouges out his own eyes in remorse and
despair.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.959
Aristotle’s answer is Katharis - which is
greek for … Catharsis.

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.500
Catharsis is a kind of cleaning - you get

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.950
rid of bad stuff. In this case cleaning up
our emotions, specifically our confusions

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.949
around the feelings of fear and pity.
We’ve got natural problems here: we are

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.479
hard hearted: we don’t give pity where it
is deserved. And we’re prone to either exaggerated

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.219
fears or not getting frightened enough

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.840
Tragedy reminds us that:
terrible things can befall decent people including

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.600
ourselves): a small flaw can lead to a whole
life unravelling

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.580
and so
we should have more compassion (or pity) for

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.160
those whose actions go disastrously wrong.
We need to be collective re-taught these crucial

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.020
truths on a regular basis. The task of art
- as Aristotle saw it - is to make profound

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.560
truths about life stick in our minds.
Three: What are friends for?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.300
In books eight and nine of the Nicomachean
Ethics Aristotle identifies three different

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.370
kinds of friendship.
There’s friendship that comes about when

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.199
each person is seeking fun; their ‘chief
interest is in their own pleasure and the

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.880
opportunity of the moment’ which the other
person provides. We need other people to have

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.350
a nice time around. We need pleasant companions.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.910
[on screen, beer drinking festival]
Then there are friendships that are really

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.620
strategic acquaintances: ‘they take pleasure
in each other’s company only in so far as

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.320
they have hopes of advantage of it.’

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.350
[on screen: faux-jovial business meeting]
Then there’s the true friend: Not someone

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.610
who’s just like you. But someone who isn’t
you - but about whom you care as much as you

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.320
are about yourself.
The sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.080
to, their joys are yours. It makes you more
vulnerable - should anything befall this person.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.610
But it is hugely strengthening: you are relieved
from the too small orbit of your own thoughts

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.250
and worries, you expand into the life of another,
together you become larger, cleverer, more

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.600
resilient, more fair minded. You share virtues
and cancel out each other’s defects. Friendship

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.419
teaches us what we ought to be. It is - quite
literally - the best part of life.

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.100
Four: how can ideas cut through in a busy
world?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.910
Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck
by the fact that the best argument doesn’t

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.440
always win the debate or the battle.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.710
He wanted to know why

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.650
this happens and what we can do about it.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.970
He had lots of opportunity for observations:
in Athens lots of decisions were made in public

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.020
meetings (often in the Agora - the town square);
orators would vie with one another to sway

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.860
popular opinion.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.060
Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals
are influenced by many factors that don’t

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.960
strictly engage with logic or the facts of
the case.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.540
It’s maddening. And many serious people
[especially Plato] can’t stand it. They

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.169
avoid the marketplace and populist debate.

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.460
Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented
the art of what we still today call Rhetoric:

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.009
the art of getting people to agree with you.
He wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.550
people to learn how to be persuasive - to
reach those who don’t agree already.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.580
He makes some timeless points: You have to
recognise, acknowledge and sooth people’s

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.600
fears. You have to see the emotional side
of the issue - is someone’s pride on the

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.780
line, are they feeling embarrassed - and edge
round it accordingly.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.759
You have to make it funny - because attention
spans are short.

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.360
And you might have to use illustrations and
examples to make your point come alive.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.479
We’re keen students of Aristotle.
Today ‘Philosophy’ doesn’t sound like

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.419
the most practical activity. Maybe that’s
because we’ve not paid enough attention, recently, to

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.060
Aristotle
