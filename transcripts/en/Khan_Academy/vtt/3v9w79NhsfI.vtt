00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.310
What I want to discuss a
little bit in this video

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.970
is the idea of a
random variable.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.930
And random variables at first
can be a little bit confusing

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.000
because we will want to think
of them as traditional variables

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.380
that you were first exposed
to in algebra class.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.160
And that's not quite what
random variables are.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.280
Random variables are
really ways to map outcomes

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.490
of random processes to numbers.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.320
So if you have a random process,
like you're flipping a coin

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.090
or you're rolling dice or you
are measuring the rain that

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.240
might fall tomorrow,
so random process,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.735
you're really just mapping
outcomes of that to numbers.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.340
You are quantifying
the outcomes.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.640
So what's an example
of a random variable?

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.270
Well, let's define
one right over here.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.940
So I'm going to define
random variable capital X.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.290
And they tend to be
denoted by capital letters.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.730
So random variable capital
X, I will define it

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.410
as-- It is going
to be equal to 1

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.100
if my fair die rolls heads--
let me write it this way--

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.615
if heads.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.464
And it's going to be
equal to 0 if tails.

00:01:20.464 --> 00:01:22.380
I could have defined
this any way I wanted to.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.921
This is actually a
fairly typical way

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:26.690
of defining a random variable,
especially for a coin flip.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.670
But I could have
defined this as 100.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.450
And I could have
defined this as 703.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.710
And this would still be a
legitimate random variable.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030
It might not be as pure a
way of thinking about it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.500
as defining 1 as
heads and 0 as tails.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.840
But that would have
been a random variable.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.000
Notice we have taken this
random process, flipping a coin,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.727
and we've mapped the outcomes
of that random process.

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:50.810
And we've quantified them.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.750
1 if heads, 0 if tails.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.000
We can define another random
variable capital Y as equal to,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.569
let's say, the sum of
rolls of let's say 7 dice.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.110
And when we talk
about the sum, we're

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470
talking about the
sum of the 7-- let

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:26.520
me write this-- the
sum of the upward face

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.960
after rolling 7 dice.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.730
Once again, we are quantifying
an outcome for a random process

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030
where the random process
is rolling these 7 dice

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.820
and seeing what
sides show up on top.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.260
And then we are taking those
and we're taking the sum

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.710
and we are defining a
random variable in that way.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.490
So the natural
question you might ask

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.100
is, why are we doing this?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.680
What's so useful about defining
random variables like this?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.310
It will become
more apparent as we

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.206
get a little bit
deeper in probability.

00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:03.830
But the simple way
of thinking about it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.710
is as soon as you
quantify outcomes,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.529
you can start to do a little
bit more math on the outcomes.

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.070
And you can start
to use a little bit

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.850
more mathematical
notation on the outcome.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.380
So for example, if you
cared about the probability

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.430
that the sum of the upward
faces after rolling seven

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.200
dice-- if you cared
about the probability

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.532
that that sum is less than
or equal to 30, the old way

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:28.990
that you would have
to have written

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.350
it is the probability
that the sum

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.150
of-- and you would have to write
all of what I just wrote here--

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.600
is less than or equal to 30.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.090
You would have had to
write that big thing.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.380
And then you would try
to figure it out somehow

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.910
if you had some information.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.010
But now we can just
write the probability

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.330
that capital Y is less
than or equal to 30.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.370
It's a little bit
cleaner notation.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.130
And if someone else cares
about the probability

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.600
that this sum of the upward
face after rolling seven dice--

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.112
if they say, hey, what's the
probability that that's even,

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:10.820
instead of having to
write all that over,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.839
they can say, well, what's the
probability that Y is even?

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.890
Now the one thing that
I do want to emphasize

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.460
is how these are different
than traditional variables,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.860
traditional variables that
you see in your algebra class

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.420
like x plus 5 is equal
to 6, usually denoted

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.180
by lowercase variables.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.330
y is equal to x plus 7.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.440
These variables, you can
essentially assign values.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.350
You either can solve for
them-- so in this case,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.360
x is an unknown.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.120
You could subtract 5 from
both sides and solve for x.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.990
Say that x is going
to be equal to 1.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.290
In this case, you could say,
well, x is going to vary.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.690
We can assign a
value to x and see

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.390
how y varies as a function of x.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.770
You can either
assign a variable,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.510
you can assign values to them.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.950
Or you can solve for them.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.780
You could say, hey x is
going to be 1 in this case.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.360
That's not going to be the
case with a random variable.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.930
A random variable can take on
many, many, many, many, many,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.660
many different values with
different probabilities.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.320
And it makes much
more sense to talk

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.480
about the probability of
a random variable equaling

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.430
a value, or the probability
that it is less than or greater

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.140
than something,
or the probability

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.990
that it has some property.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.669
And you see that in
either of these cases.

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.710
In the next video, we'll
continue this discussion

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.670
and we'll talk a little
bit about the types

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.650
of random variables
you can have.
