so Greg and I have been in a
 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.500
so Greg and I have been in a
relationship for over 10 years now and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510
relationship for over 10 years now and
 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.670
relationship for over 10 years now and
we've always wondered whether or not you

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
we've always wondered whether or not you
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.320
we've always wondered whether or not you
could scientifically evaluate how

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
could scientifically evaluate how
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.900
could scientifically evaluate how
compatible we or others actually are and

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
compatible we or others actually are and
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.549
compatible we or others actually are and
it turns out that researchers are doing

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
it turns out that researchers are doing
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110
it turns out that researchers are doing
just that they are looking at couples

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
just that they are looking at couples
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.539

biology neurology and genetics to figure
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.519
biology neurology and genetics to figure
out how compatible they actually are so

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
out how compatible they actually are so
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.830
out how compatible they actually are so
we decided to take this test and find

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
we decided to take this test and find
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570
we decided to take this test and find
out if we're actually meant to be

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
out if we're actually meant to be
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.200
out if we're actually meant to be
together

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

our oxytocin levels serotonin receptors

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
our oxytocin levels serotonin receptors
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759
our oxytocin levels serotonin receptors
HLA genes and dr4 genes

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

oxytocin is often called the love

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
oxytocin is often called the love
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.330
oxytocin is often called the love
hormone and is related to bonding

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
hormone and is related to bonding
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100
hormone and is related to bonding
affection and empathy there are actually

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
affection and empathy there are actually
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.810
affection and empathy there are actually
two versions of the oxytocin receptors

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
two versions of the oxytocin receptors
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.750
two versions of the oxytocin receptors
gene the a and the G variant if you have

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
gene the a and the G variant if you have
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610
gene the a and the G variant if you have
the G variant it means that the oxytocin

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
the G variant it means that the oxytocin
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560
the G variant it means that the oxytocin
fits in perfectly to the receptor so

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
fits in perfectly to the receptor so
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.850
fits in perfectly to the receptor so
when you're stimulated by it you have a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
when you're stimulated by it you have a
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680
when you're stimulated by it you have a
big response but if you have the a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
big response but if you have the a
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000
big response but if you have the a
variant it's kind of like a lock-and-key

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
variant it's kind of like a lock-and-key
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.369
variant it's kind of like a lock-and-key
that doesn't quite fit perfectly and so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
that doesn't quite fit perfectly and so
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779
that doesn't quite fit perfectly and so
the response is actually a lower

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
the response is actually a lower
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729
the response is actually a lower
stimulation from oxytocin the oxytocin

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
stimulation from oxytocin the oxytocin
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.220
stimulation from oxytocin the oxytocin
receptors related a lot to empathy

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
receptors related a lot to empathy
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069
receptors related a lot to empathy
there's affection but it's also how well

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
there's affection but it's also how well
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.630
there's affection but it's also how well
you are able to interpret how the other

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
you are able to interpret how the other
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.910
you are able to interpret how the other
person's amazed you are actually G okay

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
person's amazed you are actually G okay
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:19.280
person's amazed you are actually G okay
and you are actually you don't get the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
and you are actually you don't get the
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:28.969
and you are actually you don't get the
same kick out of those if you are a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
same kick out of those if you are a
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950
same kick out of those if you are a
thinker it's good to sort of communicate

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
thinker it's good to sort of communicate
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.870
thinker it's good to sort of communicate
verbally a lot about what you're

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
verbally a lot about what you're
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.630
verbally a lot about what you're
thinking because it may not is that I

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640
thinking because it may not is that I
 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.859
thinking because it may not is that I
always like I want to talk about this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
always like I want to talk about this
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.190
always like I want to talk about this
here like you always want to talk about

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
here like you always want to talk about
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.350
here like you always want to talk about
exactly Gracie would be more reading the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
exactly Gracie would be more reading the
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940
exactly Gracie would be more reading the
emotion reading this is yeah I don't

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
emotion reading this is yeah I don't
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.499
emotion reading this is yeah I don't
need the language I need only yeah

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509
need the language I need only yeah
 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.080
need the language I need only yeah
exactly so we give this combination the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
exactly so we give this combination the
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940
exactly so we give this combination the
thinker in the listener at 75 years

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
thinker in the listener at 75 years
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.859
thinker in the listener at 75 years
and that's because I mean you were

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
and that's because I mean you were
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240
and that's because I mean you were
saying that you're very good at talking

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
saying that you're very good at talking
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160
saying that you're very good at talking
and expressing your emotions but in some

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
and expressing your emotions but in some
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.230
and expressing your emotions but in some
cases the thinker is not I think there

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
cases the thinker is not I think there
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:13.250
cases the thinker is not I think there
is a party that many of you are probably

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
is a party that many of you are probably
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.140
is a party that many of you are probably
wondering if the fact that Mitch and I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
wondering if the fact that Mitch and I
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.030
wondering if the fact that Mitch and I
are gay is going to affect our results

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
are gay is going to affect our results
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.370
are gay is going to affect our results
so we actually asked dr. Seabrook what

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380
so we actually asked dr. Seabrook what
 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.170
so we actually asked dr. Seabrook what
she thought a lot of the research that

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
she thought a lot of the research that
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970
she thought a lot of the research that
has been done has been on heterosexual

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
has been done has been on heterosexual
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.800
has been done has been on heterosexual
couples what we find is that there is a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
couples what we find is that there is a
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.229
couples what we find is that there is a
similar trend so I wouldn't take your

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
similar trend so I wouldn't take your
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.160
similar trend so I wouldn't take your
results and throw them out the window

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
results and throw them out the window
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020
results and throw them out the window
they are people with a gay couple

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
they are people with a gay couple
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.729
they are people with a gay couple
contacts us and says they want to take

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
contacts us and says they want to take
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.270
contacts us and says they want to take
the test we subsidize the edge late

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
the test we subsidize the edge late
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.289
the test we subsidize the edge late
because there isn't a lot of that

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299
because there isn't a lot of that
 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.120
because there isn't a lot of that
research out there it's true like this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
research out there it's true like this
 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.050
research out there it's true like this
is something that could be so

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
is something that could be so
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.250
is something that could be so
heteronormative and it's just nice to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
heteronormative and it's just nice to
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410
heteronormative and it's just nice to
know that brilliant scientists are not

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
know that brilliant scientists are not
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.680
know that brilliant scientists are not
making it fully networked serotonin is a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
making it fully networked serotonin is a
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.090
making it fully networked serotonin is a
neurotransmitter that contributes to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
neurotransmitter that contributes to
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.009
neurotransmitter that contributes to
feelings of happiness and well-being and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
feelings of happiness and well-being and
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.420
feelings of happiness and well-being and
we each have two alleles for the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
we each have two alleles for the
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430
we each have two alleles for the
serotonin transporter gene if you end up

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
serotonin transporter gene if you end up
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.559
serotonin transporter gene if you end up
having both short alleles you're

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569
having both short alleles you're
 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.210
having both short alleles you're
actually worse at having your cells

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
actually worse at having your cells
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220
actually worse at having your cells
reuptake serotonin which ultimately

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
reuptake serotonin which ultimately
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.380
reuptake serotonin which ultimately
characterizes you as more emotional

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
characterizes you as more emotional
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.030
characterizes you as more emotional
which means you feel things way more

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
which means you feel things way more
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.890
which means you feel things way more
strongly whether or not they're good or

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
strongly whether or not they're good or
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050
strongly whether or not they're good or
bad in both directions if you have long

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
bad in both directions if you have long
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.479
bad in both directions if you have long
long or long short allele combination

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489
long or long short allele combination
 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.890
long or long short allele combination
you're actually much more even-tempered

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
you're actually much more even-tempered
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.050
you're actually much more even-tempered
and practical okay so what do you think

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
and practical okay so what do you think
 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.460
and practical okay so what do you think
you think you're lying I'm lying because

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
you think you're lying I'm lying because
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.449
you think you're lying I'm lying because
I feel like a lot of times I

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
I feel like a lot of times I
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.099
I feel like a lot of times I
relationship I'm like okay let's look at

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109
relationship I'm like okay let's look at
 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.870
relationship I'm like okay let's look at
the bigger picture and let's chill out

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
the bigger picture and let's chill out
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.310
the bigger picture and let's chill out
and I think that you're short cuz

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320
and I think that you're short cuz
 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.660
and I think that you're short cuz
they're like yeah and you would feel

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670
they're like yeah and you would feel
 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.090
they're like yeah and you would feel
really good too yeah I feel like if you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
really good too yeah I feel like if you
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.890
really good too yeah I feel like if you
had to be one or the other like I I

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900
had to be one or the other like I I
 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.020
had to be one or the other like I I
definitely like identifying more as a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030

formation of your odor because they are
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.150
formation of your odor because they are
in your sweat and your saliva as well so

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
in your sweat and your saliva as well so

the offspring that we create will have a
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.280
the offspring that we create will have a
more diverse immune system so as a side
