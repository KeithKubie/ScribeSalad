00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.680
MALE SPEAKER: We have
some very special guests

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.950
to chat to us about Alan
Turing and Bletchley Park.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.740
So first of all,
Sir John Scarlett.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.330
Sir John was chief of the
British Secret Intelligence

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.370
Service from 2004 to
2009, and today he

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.670
is the chairman of the
Bletchley Park Trust.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.970
Sir John.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.400
And Sir John Dermot Turing, who
is the nephew of Alan Turing.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.800
He first of all studied
genetics at Oxford

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.710
and then turned to the law as
a partner at Clifford Chance.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.670
And he's a trustee
at Bletchley Park.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.240
Sir John Dermot Turing.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.300
SIR JOHN DERMOT
TURING: Thank you.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.070
MALE SPEAKER: And
first of all, we're

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.640
going to be joined by Hangout
by two of the guys involved

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.355
in making "The Imitation Game."

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:56.730
I'm a little bit worried
because I can't see the Hangout.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.230
Oh, there's Graham, and
Teddy is there as well.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.870
You can see them, but I can't.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.470
Graham is the script
writer and executive

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.470
producer of "The
Imitation Game."

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.240
And the script of the film
topped the 2012 Black List,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
which is Hollywood's list of
the best unproduced screenplays.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
And it got the highest score in
the history of the Black List.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.010
I'm delighted to see
that the script has now

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.250
made its way into the film.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.900
And also on the Hangout
in the smaller thumbnail

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.220
there, Teddy Schwarzman, who
is the founder and principal

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.530
of Black Bear Pictures, and he
oversees all the operations,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.230
the development, the production,
and the planning of the films.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.040
So we're going to talk
to them in a second,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.830
but first of all we're
going to kick off

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.068
with a clip from the film.

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:47.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.749
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.040
-That's what you're doing here.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.610
The top secret
program at Bletchley,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.332
you're trying to break
the German Enigma machine.

00:01:58.332 --> 00:02:00.374
-What makes you think that?

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.850
-It's the greatest
encryption device in history,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.250
and the Germans use it for
all major communications.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.069
If the Allies broke
Enigma, well, this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.665
would turn into a
very short war indeed.

00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.130
Of course that's what
you're working on.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.880
But you also haven't
got anywhere with it.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.296
If you had, you
wouldn't be hiring

00:02:19.296 --> 00:02:20.700
cryptographers
out of university.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.620
You need me a lot
more than I need you.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.580
I like solving
problems, commander.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.620
And Enigma is the most
difficult problem in the world.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.190
-No, Enigma isn't difficult.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.060
It's impossible.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.620
And the Americans, the Russians,
the French, the Germans,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.380
everyone thinks
Enigma is unbreakable.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.560
-Good.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.983
Let me try, and we'll
know for sure, won't we?

00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:43.850
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.250
MALE SPEAKER: Right, so
over to Graham first,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.470
who wrote the script.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.920
And I understand, Graham, that
you've been very interested

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.450
in the subject of Alan
Turing from a young age.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.650
How did the film come about?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.430
GRAHAM MOORE: I always imagined
that I'd end up like you guys

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.230
actually working in
computer science.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.810
But I didn't.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.740
I ended up being a writer.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.810
And so I think among techy
computer-minded kids,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.280
Turing has long
stood as inspiration,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.970
someone who thought
differently from everyone

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780
around him and because
of his differences

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840
was able to see the
world in a new way

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.340
and do things that other people
didn't think were possible.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340
So it was sort of
a dream of mine,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.290
even after I became a writer.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.610
Turing was a subject I
always wanted to write about.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.350
And yeah, I feel so
privileged that Teddy and I

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.890
got involved in doing it.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.187
MALE SPEAKER: How long did it
take from screenplay to screen?

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:40.895
GRAHAM MOORE: I just
remember [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:44.430
about four years
ago now actually.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.900
Alan Turing was one of the great
geniuses of the 20th century,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.560
and I'm not.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.410
So you're sort of like, oh
my god, this is a huge story.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.046
This is an important story.

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.850
It [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.496
You hope you can add to it.

00:03:59.496 --> 00:04:02.390
You hope you can add
to Turing's legacy

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.080
as a need to be
[INAUDIBLE] preserved.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.020
So yeah, after about a
year, we found our way

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.130
to Teddy and to Morten
and developed the script

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.300
for another year.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.738
And then we were
off into production.

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:18.279
MALE SPEAKER: And
over to you, Teddy.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.620
I mean, at first
glance, it doesn't

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.670
look like the most
promising material

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.780
for a blockbuster film.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.994
Did you find it easy to get
the film off the ground?

00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:29.410
TEDDY SCHWARZMAN:
You know, really

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.480
what we were trying to do was
tell a story that we thought

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.430
was of great importance
and try and protect

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.950
the essence of Alan
Turing and his legacy

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.210
while not shying away from
the pain and injustice that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.090
naturally comes with
telling the story.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.730
Sort of getting
it off the ground

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.870
was really more about reading
the script and then saying,

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.010
OK, how are these pieces
going to come together?

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.860
And I think we believed that
the importance of the story

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.926
would generate it interest
from directors and from cast.

00:05:03.926 --> 00:05:07.920
I think the interest on
the casting side and people

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.795
like Benedict Cumberbatch
and Keira Knightley

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:14.180
and Mark Strong
and Charles Dance.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.554
That was something we were
so incredibly lucky to have.

00:05:16.554 --> 00:05:17.970
MALE SPEAKER: Great
that the story

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.470
has traveled so far
internationally.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.930
So Graham, had you visited
Bletchley Park before you

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.364
got interested in
making the film?

00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:28.030
GRAHAM MOORE: I hadn't
visited Bletchley

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.560
before making the film, but at
various stages in the writing

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.070
process, at the mid stage, I
went and visited Bletchley.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.390
And it's amazing to
walk around there.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.280
You can even go in and
touch the machines.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.840
And I think that's
something as a writer,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.110
that tactile experience of
seeing it in front of you,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.356
touching the walls,
it reminds you

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:50.730
of the responsibility
when you're

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.210
telling a story like this.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.270
This is a true story.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.220
This is about real people.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.380
This really happened.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.260
And so we all felt-- and I know
Teddy and Morten and Benedict,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.385
Keira, everyone felt this
tremendous responsibility

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:07.210
to be able to tell this
story accurately and fairly

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.194
and do it justice.

00:06:08.194 --> 00:06:09.610
MALE SPEAKER: How
much of the film

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.875
was actually shot
at Bletchley Park?

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:15.420
TEDDY SCHWARZMAN: I think
it was about four days out

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.154
of just a little over 40.

00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:20.910
We had looked at it to
try to figure out could we

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.610
shoot Hut 8, which you'll
see in the film there.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.240
But for a variety of
reasons, it made sense

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.400
to actually build a hut just
so we could have flexibility

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.760
from a shoot standpoint.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.680
So we ended up finding
sort of our hero

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.510
at Bletchley Park in Nettlebed,
which is just off of Henley.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.840
And we did the exterior
huts up around Bicester.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.330
And then we did some
of the interiors

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.870
that we could at Bletchley.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.870
MALE SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.940
And finally Graham, as
we'll see in the film,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.510
the Alan Turing
character is actually

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.930
very funny and amusing.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:09.270
What did you draw on to show
those little glimpses of humor

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.600
from the true story
of Alan Turing?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.710
GRAHAM MOORE: Yeah, I think
having some humor in the film

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.520
was really important
to all of us, me

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.080
and Morten very much included.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.100
Because I think that
Turing's life was funny.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.391
I think that one of the things
that I was so fascinated

00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:28.560
by in this film
was giving a really

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.000
three-dimensional
portrait of Turing.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.550
Because he was a willful man.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.790
He was a driven man.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.565
He was a passionate man.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:38.940
And we wanted the
film to express

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.500
all of that, the sort
of awkward situations

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.160
that he could experience.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.220
Obviously, his is a story
that ends so tragically,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.650
and we wanted the
film to show that.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.840
We wanted the film to face
full on the tragedy of what

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.210
he experienced, but also
certainly the beginning

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.850
to depict the full
spectrum of Turing's life.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.850
MALE SPEAKER: Brilliant.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.090
OK, well thanks very
much indeed, gentlemen.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.320
All best wishes for the film.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.550
It's in cinemas from
November the 14.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.912
Thank you very much for
joining us and all the best.

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:19.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.630
Right, so now we're going
to see another clip,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.130
and then we're going to turn
to the gentleman from Bletchley

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.150
Park.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.700
This next clip is
called Christopher

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.630
and is about the beginnings
of the digital computer.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.529
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:39.529
-Are you trying to build
your universal machine?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.985
I read your paper at university.

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.380
-Is it already being taught?

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.840
-No, no, no, I was precocious.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.584
So, you theorized a machine
that could solve any problem.

00:08:52.584 --> 00:08:53.750
It didn't just do one thing.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.500
It did everything.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.030
It wasn't just programmable.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.485
It was reprogrammable.

00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:01.620
Is that your idea
behind Christopher?

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.620
-Human brains can compute
large sums very quickly.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.610
Even you can do that.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.190
But I want Christopher to be
smarter, to make a calculation

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:15.030
and then to determine what to
do next like a person does.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:21.516
Think of it, electrical
brain, a digital computer.

00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:24.667
-Digital computer.

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:25.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.720
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
we'll start there.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.310
So, Sir John Scarlett, you've
been chairman of the Bletchley

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.510
Park Trust and obviously
before that involved

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.760
with the Intelligence Service.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.990
How important was
what Alan Turing

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.614
was doing there for the war
effort and subsequently?

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:44.780
SIR JOHN SCARLETT: What was
done at Bletchley, which

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.820
was actually
technically part of MI6,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.610
the secret intelligence
service at that time,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.980
although in practice
and in reality

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:59.990
it is the antecedent to GCHQ,
what was achieved there is--

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.870
well, it probably is the single
biggest continuous achievement

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.330
in intelligence terms ever.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.970
It's hard to underestimate
the significance of what

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.590
is achieved.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.500
And we need to
remember that history

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.965
when you watch the
personal story in the film.

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:18.590
MALE SPEAKER: Sir
John Scarlett gave us

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.480
the sort of importance
in military terms.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.700
Tell us about the
importance in computing

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.017
in scientific terms of what
went on at Bletchley Park.

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:29.350
SIR JOHN DERMOT TURING: Yeah,
this is quite interesting.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.050
There's this rather
charming scene

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.090
between Keira and
Benedict that you

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.600
see where they talk
about this sort of idea

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.370
of a universal computer.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.760
So you might get the sense
that this machine that's

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.362
built in the movie that's
called Christopher-- and I

00:10:44.362 --> 00:10:46.820
won't explain why because I
don't want to spoil it for you.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.790
But this machine
called Christopher

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.710
is like the world's first
electronic computer.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.420
There's a lot of
Anglo-American tension

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.190
about who actually made the
world's first stored program

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.430
electronic computer.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.170
And for stored
program computers,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.770
there's lots of first electronic
computers and so forth.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.699
So there's many, many
claims around this.

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:13.240
MALE SPEAKER: And now we do have
a very special guest with us

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.010
today.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:19.350
Ann is related to a Googler,
I believe, and worked

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.330
on the bombe machine at
Bletchley Park in the war.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.390
Can you tell us
what you did there?

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.530
ANN: When I worked on the
bombe at Bletchley Park,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.850
is there anybody else here
who worked at Bletchley Park

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:31.940
at that time?

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.860
Oh.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.264
MALE SPEAKER: Just you.

00:11:35.264 --> 00:11:39.300
ANN: I'm obviously the
oldest person here then.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.050
Well, I think it will
be a marvelous film.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.505
I've read about the man
who is playing the part,

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:50.020
and it seems to me he
will do a very good job.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.480
But we lived outside
Bletchley, and we

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.860
came in by bus every day.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.900
And we worked three
eight-hour shifts,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.840
three times with eight hours.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.210
And there were about 20 of us.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.670
And it was very exciting.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.990
The bombe brought up
the right setting.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.940
And we sent off and
then occasionally Hut 6

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.580
would tell us what we'd done.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.300
Not very often, but
just occasionally

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.769
we were told what had happened.

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:19.560
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much for coming,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.035
and many thanks
for what you did.

00:12:22.035 --> 00:12:32.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:38.209
And just finally over to Dermot
to ask, much debate about why

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:39.500
the bombe was called the bombe.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.010
Can you explain?

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.700
SIR JOHN DERMOT
TURING: Well, I can't

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.060
claim to have the
definitive story,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.420
but I've asked lots of people.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:54.700
And the idea is that the
bombe was named the bombe

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.890
because the Poles, who had
done this amazing work trying

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.190
to crack the Enigma in Poland
before the German invasion

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.080
of Poland in 1939,
they'd invented a machine

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.470
to try and uncover the settings.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.670
It wasn't as sophisticated
as the Turing-Welchman bomb

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.520
that you'll see in the movie.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.214
But apparently they called
it the bomba, and so then,

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:21.880
well, all right.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.380
You've just restated
the question.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.400
You haven't answered it.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.900
Why did the Poles
call it the bomba?

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.459
Well, we think-- and I'm willing
to accept other theories,

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.750
by the way, so if anybody's
got better ideas than this,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.206
then please do let me know.

00:13:34.206 --> 00:13:36.457
But we think it's because,
well, first of all it

00:13:36.457 --> 00:13:38.165
made this sort of
ticking noise, and when

00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:40.860
it got to the end of its runs
it make a clonking noise.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.500
So it tick, tick, tick, clonk,
sounds like a bomb, doesn't it?

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.080
But apparently
also the Poles used

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.716
to go out and have a sort
of mid-afternoon snack

00:13:50.716 --> 00:13:52.340
where they go around
to the local cafe,

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.860
and they just order an ice
cream, which is like a bombe,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.970
like the French dessert.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.410
It's a bomba in Polish.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.590
So they did that.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.347
But I think the
real reason is this,

00:14:02.347 --> 00:14:04.430
that if you've got something
that's really, really

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.920
good, if you're
German you say prima

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.036
or if you're French
you say super.

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:12.660
Sir John and I have this theory
that if you're British you say,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.519
"I say that's not
bad, not bad at all."

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.810
And if you're Polish you
don't say any of those things.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.710
You say bomba.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.169
So we think that
may be the reason.

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:23.584
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:14:23.584 --> 00:14:25.050
Thank you to all
our guests, really

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.490
fantastic and interesting stuff.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.860
Thank you so much
to Ann for coming.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.410
Now, the film begins
in 10 minutes' time,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.160
so we're going to take
a very quick break.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.780
Go and get yourself an
ice cream or a beer.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.840
And we'll reconvene just
before 6 o'clock please.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.160
Thank you very much indeed.
