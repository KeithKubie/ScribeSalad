00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.340
So how did I know the package I
wanted to install was called Finger?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.560
Most of the time the package names
are pretty easy to guess, but

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.930
not all the time.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.380
For instance Python has two
extremely popular versions,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.790
you have Python 2 and Python 3.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.510
It may be a bit more difficult to
figure out what the name of that

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.930
package would be.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.390
Fortunately, each distribution tends
to publish an easy to browse version

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.100
of their repositories.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.090
For Ubuntu, you can search for
packages at packages.ubuntu.com.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.945
If I were to search for Python and
I look at this top result that says 2.7,

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.755
so that's Python version 2.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:40.795
If I search for Python 3 and

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:45.180
I look at the top result it says 3.40,
so I know that's Python version 3.
