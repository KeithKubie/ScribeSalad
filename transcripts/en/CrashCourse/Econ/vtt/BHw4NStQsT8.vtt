Jacob: I'm Jacob Clifford.
Adriene: And I'm Adriene Hill.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.240
Jacob: And today, finally, Crash Course, is
gonna live up to its name. We're gonna talk

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.349
about crashes - economic crashes.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.729
Adriene: Crash Course - we've been waiting
for this!

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:19.729
[Theme Music]

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:25.860
Adriene: In Germany in 1923, people were doing
strange things like using money to wallpaper

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.720
their houses and burning money for heat. What
was going on? Had they all gone crazy?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.920
Nope! In the early 1920's, Germany was in
the grip of something called hyperinflation.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.300
In order to pay massive reparations to the
Allies after World War I, Germany printed

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.149
a lot of their currency - the Mark.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.050
One result of all this additional money was
higher and higher prices. By November 1923,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.620
it took a trillion marks to buy one U.S. dollar.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.900
There were one thousand billion mark notes
in circulation. The mark was effectively meaningless.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.950
A similar situation developed in Zimbabwe
a few years ago. Starting in 2007, inflation

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.350
grew rapidly, like really really rapidly.
By September 2008, the International Monetary

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.190
Fund estimated the annual inflation rate at
489 billion percent.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:26.720
In practical terms, the Zimbabwean dollar
lost 99.9% of its value between 2007 and 2008.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.840
It's hard to even imagine what that looks
like. Prices nearly doubled every 24 hours

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.390
and businesses revised prices several times
a day.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.420
In June 2008, The Economic Times reported that,
"A loaf of bread now cost what 12 new cards did a decade ago."

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.080
The government issued currency in huge denominations
to keep up with rising prices. The million

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.850
dollar bill, the billion dollar bill, and
finally in 2009, the hundred trillion dollar

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.420
bill - the largest denomination of currency
ever issued. The good news

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.240
was that everyone was a billionaire. But the bad
news was that those dollars were virtually worthless.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.039
Jacob: One definition of hyperinflation is
when a country experiences a monthly inflation

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.860
rate of over 50% or around 13,000% annual
inflation.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.680
But believe it or not, Zimbabwe's recent inflation
isn't unique, and it's not the worst inflation in history.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.660
In fact the worst was in Hungary in 1946.
Between July 1945 and August 1946, the price

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.420
level in Hungary rose by a factor of three
times ten to the twenty-fifth. And yes, any

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.340
time you have to express your inflation rate
using scientific notation, that's a bad thing.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.620
Besides the obvious confusion over what prices
to charge for things, why is hyperinflation so bad?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.260
Well inflation, and especially hyperinflation,
erodes wealth. In Zimbabwe, people who had

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.320
worked their whole lives and saved up for
retirement, saw their savings just wiped out.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.260
Extreme inflation also forces people to spend
as quickly as possible rather than save or

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.819
lend, so there is no money available to fund
new businesses. And all that uncertainty limits

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.120
foreign investment and trade.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.260
So, hyperinflation is bad. But how does it
happen? Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.460
Adriene: So, we're simplifying this stuff a lot.
But the root of the problem in both Weimar Germany

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.920
and Zimbabwe was that the government
was paying their bills by printing new money.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.260
An increase in the money supply can have two
effects. It can increase output or increase

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.680
prices or some combination of the two. Inflation
starts when output is pushed to capacity and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.160
can't rise much further, but policy makers
continue to increase the money supply.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.120
In theory, once output is maximized, the more money
you print, the more inflation you'll get. Simple, right?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.950
Well, that doesn't fully explain why Germany's
or Zimbabwe's inflation rose exponentially.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.250
Was the government really printing that much
money? Not exactly.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.820
After a couple years of doubling prices, people
started to expect high inflation, and that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.819
changed their behavior. Say you're planning
to buy a new refrigerator, and you expect

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.440
prices to rise quickly. You buy it as soon
as possible before the price has had a chance

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.400
to change. But with everyone following that
logic, dollars start to circulate faster and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.550
faster and faster.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.340
Economists called the number of times a dollar
is spent per year the velocity of money. When

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.709
people spend their money as quickly as they
get it, that increases velocity, which pushes

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.879
inflation up even faster.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.639
You get a vicious cycle of higher prices,
which lead to expectations of higher prices,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.440
which lead to higher prices.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.900
The hyperinflation in Germany ended when the
government replaced the worthless mark with

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.500
a new currency. Zimbabwe ended its hyperinflation
by abandoning its currency altogether. Now,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.880
its citizens use U.S. dollars or currencies
from neighboring countries.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.889
The good news is that prices have since stabilized
and real GDP has begun to increase.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.040
Jacob: Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.320
So, if you ever control a national economy,
try to avoid hyperinflation. You might also

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.480
want to stay away from depressions.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.000
A depression is kind of a hard thing to define,
but basically it's when real GP falls and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.960
keeps falling for a long period of time. This
has all sorts of terrible effects like high

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.060
unemployment and falling prices.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.430
Before the 1930's, economists use the term
depression to describe sustained falls in

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.510
GDP. But after The Great Depression, economists
started using the word recession for downturns

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.160
to avoid association with the 1930's.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.979
I guess calling it a depression was just too
depressing.

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.419
When the stock market crashed in 1929, it
didn't just cause problems for stock brokers.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.800
Everyone freaked out and stopped spending,
and the economy ground to a halt.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.330
Of course, that's not the only reason for
The Great Depression. Actually, there's still

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.600
a lot of debate about the causes.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.770
Anyway, when economies fall into deep recessions,
there are more workers than there are jobs

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.080
and more output than consumers want to buy.
So both income and prices fall.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.150
Central banks can try to use Expansionary
Monetary Policy to speed up the economy. So

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.240
for example, in the U.S. The Federal Reserve
can lower interest rates. This encourages

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.389
consumers and businesses to take out loans,
and hopefully, get the economy going again.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.740
But if people start changing their expectations
and anticipate further price declines, they'll

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.770
change their behavior in ways that work against
the central bank.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.650
Like, if you're planning to buy a refrigerator
and you expect prices to fall, you're gonna

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.940
wait to get a lower price. But, if everyone
follows that same logic, then spending declines

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.759
and so does the velocity of money.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.440
That leads to further price declines and a
vicious cycle of falling prices, which leads

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.300
to expectations of lower prices, which actually
leads to lower prices. It also leads to layoffs

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.669
at the refrigerator factory and so on and
so on and so on.

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.100
This is called a liquidity trap and some economists
believe it's a worsening factor in economic

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.080
downturns including The Great Depression.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.509
Adriene: Speaking of The Great Depression,
after the initial crash of 1929, The Federal

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.229
Reserve dropped interest rates to zero, output
and prices fell, and regular people started

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:38.800
to expect further price declines. Unemployment
rose to 25%, and the average family income

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.430
dropped by around 40%.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.080
This is...not great. Once interest rates hit
zero, and prices were still falling, the central

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.800
bank was in a bind. Continuing deflation meant that
borrowing money was a bad deal, even with no interest.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.220
The money you pay back in the future would
have more buying power than the money you

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.680
originally borrowed. This discouraged people
from buying homes or cars and discouraged

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.800
businesses from borrowing to expand capacity.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.440
In fact, getting out of The Depression took
nearly a decade. And it wasn't really monetary

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.500
policy that put an end to it. It was the massive
government spending of World War II.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.240
Okay, you don't want hyperinflation. You don't
want depressions. You also don't want stagflation.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.080
That's when output slows down or stops or
stagnates at the same time that prices rise.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.460
So, stagnant economy plus inflation equals
stagflation. Get it? It's a portmanteau.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.020
Jacob: The U.S. experienced stagflation starting
in the 1970's, after a series of supply shocks

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.180
including a rise in oil prices and, believe it or not,
a die-off of Peruvian anchovies, which were important

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.980
for animal feed and fertilizers. This combination of
events meant the economy couldn't produce as much.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.039
The Fed tried to address this by boosting
the money supply and cutting interest rates,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.740
but output couldn't rise much because of low
productivity and the oil shortage. So, all

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.520
that extra money just triggered inflation.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.600
It got even worse when people began to adjust their
inflation expectations. Businesses started to expect

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.120
costs to rise even further, so they laid off workers,
and that put the economy back into a recession.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.620
When The Fed boosted the money supply again,
that raised inflation expectations even more.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.590
This ended in the early 80's when a new Federal
Reserve Chairman took over. His name was Paul

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.410
Volcker. He actually cut the money supply
and raised interest rates dramatically.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.550
Output plummeted, and unemployment reached
ten percent, but prices stopped rising and

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.240
so did inflation expectations.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.589
The economy gradually recovered, and Paul
Volcker got the credit for ending stagflation.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.830
So hyperinflation, deflation, depression,
stagflation - they're all extreme economic

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:42.380
circumstances, but these extremes show us why it's
so important to measure and understand the overall economy.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.930
In some cases, government action or inaction
made things worse. And in other cases, the

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.230
government helped the economy get back on
its feet.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.980
But it's important to keep in mind that the economy
is made up of collective decisions of individuals.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.170
It's people like us, our expectations matter.
If enough people fear a recession, they're

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.620
gonna decrease their spending, and that's
gonna cause a recession.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.560
Adriene: Next week, we're gonna look at different
economic schools of thought. But regardless

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.990
of philosophy, policies designed to steer
the economy need to address expectations and

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.770
focus on creating confidence.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.990
