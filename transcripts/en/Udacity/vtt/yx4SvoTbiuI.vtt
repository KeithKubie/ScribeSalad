00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Let me show you how the Template works, real quick.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've got this file called front.html.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's currently blank.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to type in some HTML.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We've got our DOCTYPE--you know--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
our , our /ascii/,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We've got our here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and inside our we've got an tag,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is just--basically, it's called a HEADER1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It draws your text

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
bold, a little larger--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with a little margin around it, and that's it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So that's in this file called front.html.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we had opened this in our browser,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it would just print the words: /ascii/

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and let's go ahead and instead of loading this in our browser,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
return it from our file here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Instead of calling self.write,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I've changed this to self.render("front.html"]

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and let's give this a whirl.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay. Here we are in our browser--I've reloaded the page.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We can see my title is set to /ascii/

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we've got the text, /ascii/, up here.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The slash is just kind of a joke.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's how Fortran does their titles and stuff.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In our Editor, you can see--we just called the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
self.render function, which is defined here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
All that does is it calls

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
render_str on this Template name--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
this file name which render_str loads,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
renders--and then we write.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay. So, simple enough--that'll just save some time.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's a little bit more convenient to edit HTML

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as HTML--especially if you're editor is going to help you--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
than to have a big string in the middle of your Python file.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
All right. Let's go over to our HTML,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the first thing we want to add is our form.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So the method="post"

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and we're not going to define an action; we're just going to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
submit to ourselves, which is something we've done a lot.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So I've added one input field.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We're going to call it "title"--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and I'm going to include "title" in a little here,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
just to put it on a new line,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and then it's going to be an

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and this is going to be for the title of our image.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's go ahead--and I closed the tag.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm going to Save the file, and let's load it in our Browser

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to make sure everything's working.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Okay. Here I am in the browser,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and I reload and now I have my title string

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and a box I can type in.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay. All is well.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Let's add the next form field

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for inputting the art from the user.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we're going to call this "art",

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and let's interrupt this for a quick quiz.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Which is the most appropriate form element for inputting ascii art?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Is it ,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
a ,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
a element,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or ?
