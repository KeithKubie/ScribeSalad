00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.006
IT'S TIME TO PLAY OUR NEXT GAME

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.174
"SWEET EMOJI."

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.409
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.644
EMOJI IS SOMETHING PEOPLE USE TO

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.879
LET OTHER PEOPLE KNOW JUST HOW

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.780
THE THING THEY TYPED MAKES THEM

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.081
FEEL.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.382
IT'S WAY EASIER THAN USING WORDS

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.384
AND MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.619
ACTUAL HUMAN INTERACTION SO I'M

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.454
GOING TO SHOW YOU A SERIES OF

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:21.989
EMOJI AND FOR 250 POINTS I WANT

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.257
YOU TO TRANSLATE THE SENTENCE.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:23.991
ALL RIGHT?

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:24.925
HERE'S THE FIRST ONE.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.694
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.096
HOWARD KREMER?

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.398
&gt;&gt; "I WALKED DOWN TO GOLD'S GYM

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.534
FOR ALL THE (BLEEP)"

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.903
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:43.477
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS!

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:43.877

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.246
WHICH GOLD'S JIM ARE YOU GOING

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:46.547
TO?

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:46.947
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.215
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO THAT

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:48.482
ONE.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.049
NEXT ONE.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.986
NEXT ONE.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:53.320
JONAH?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.189
&gt;&gt; IT'S -- OH!

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.423
WHAT'S THAT POODLE?

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.559
YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN SCORE SOME

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.494
SWEET "H"?

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:00.894
(LAUGHTER).

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.629
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS!

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.063
POINTS!

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.798
OH, WAIT, DID YOU HAVE ONE,

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.132
HOWARD?

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.934
&gt;&gt; IT WAS RELAX AGO BIT BEFORE I

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:11.104
PUT THE DOG DOWN.

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:16.443
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.079
&gt;&gt; Chris: POINTS!

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:19.413
POINTS!

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.414
WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.249
WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.983
YES, JONAH RAY?

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.185

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.288

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.556

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:31.458
&gt;&gt; Chris: OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:31.792

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.827
YES?

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.798
&gt;&gt; MY CAT LOVES CHOCOLATE AND

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.267
THE FAWNS.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.603
