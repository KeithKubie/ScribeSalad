00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.037
Let's divide 7,182 by 42.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.620
And what's different
here is we're now

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.039
dividing by a two-digit
number, not a one-digit number,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.810
but the same idea holds.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.310
So we say, hey, how many
times does 42 go into 7?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.210
Well, it doesn't really
go into 7 at all,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.219
so let's add one
more place value.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.190
How many times
does 42 go into 71?

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.324
Well, it goes into 71 one time.

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:24.990
Just a reminder, whoever's doing
the process where you say, hey,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.820
42 goes into 71 one time.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.722
But what we're really saying,
42 goes into 7,100 100 times

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.930
because we're putting this
one in the hundreds place.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.888
But let's put that on
the side for a little bit

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:36.420
and focus on the process.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.950
So 1 times 42 is 42,
and now we subtract.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.860
Now, you might be able to do 71
minus 42 in your head, knowing,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.810
hey, 72 minus 42 would be 30.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.900
So 71 minus 42 would be
29, but we could also

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.670
do it by regrouping.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.210
To regroup, you want to
subtract a 2 from a 1.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.130
You can't really do that
in any traditional way.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.040
So let's take a 10 from the
70, so that it becomes a 60,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.580
and give that 10
to the ones place,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.870
and then that becomes an 11.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.860
And so 11 minus 2 is
9, and 6 minus 4 is 2.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.140
So you get 29.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.440
And we can bring down
the next place value.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.800
Bring down an 8.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.540
And now, this is
where the art happens

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.424
when we're dividing by
a multi-digit number

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:21.090
right over here.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.610
We have to estimate how many
times does 42 go into 298.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.235
And sometimes it might involve
a little bit of trial and error.

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:29.151
So you really just kind
of have to eyeball it.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.660
If you make a
mistake, try again.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.118
The way you know
you make a mistake

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:35.210
is, if say it goes into it 9
times, and you do 9 times 42

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.600
and you get a number larger than
298, then you overestimated.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.459
If you say it goes into it
three times, you do 3 times 42,

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:42.500
you get some number here.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.449
When you subtract, you get
something larger than 42,

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:47.990
then you also made a mistake,
and you have to adjust upwards.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.531
Well, let's see if
we can eyeball it.

00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:51.490
So this is roughly 40.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.790
This is roughly 300.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.480
40 goes into 300 the same
times as 4 goes into the 30,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.570
so it's going to be roughly 7.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.960
Let's see if that's right.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.970
7 times 2 is 14.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.479
7 times 1 is 28, plus 1 is 29.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.060
So I got pretty close.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.310
My remainder here-- notice
294 is less than 298.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.740
So I'm cool there.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
And my remainder is less
than 42, so I'm cool as well.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.740
So now let's add
another place value.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.779
Let's bring this 2 down.

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.320
And here we're just
asking ourselves,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.125
how many times
does 42 go into 42?

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.360
Well, 42 goes into
42 exactly one time.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.600
1 times 42 is 42, and
we have no remainder.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.110
So this one luckily
divided exactly.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.240
42 goes into 7,182
exactly 171 times.
