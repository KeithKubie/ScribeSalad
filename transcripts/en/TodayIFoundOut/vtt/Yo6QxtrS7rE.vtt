00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:13.049
MISSISSIPPI DIDN’T OFFICIALLY OUTLAW SLAVERY
UNTIL 1995

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.350
While the Thirteenth Amendment was set into
law, thus outlawing slavery anywhere in the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.410
United States, on December 6, 1865 when it
secured the needed 27 of 36 states’ approval

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.869
(3/4), it wasn’t until 130 years later on
March 16, 1995 that Mississippi finally got

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.370
around to ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.350
As you might expect, this made Mississippi
the last state to ratify it, with the previous

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.930
state of the initial 36 being Kentucky in
1976 and before that Delaware in 1901.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.690
All three of those states, along with New
Jersey, initially rejected the amendment in

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.180
1865, though just 9 months after rejecting
it, New Jersey changed their mind and ratified

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.180
it.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.399
The others took a little longer.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.420
The Thirteenth Amendment specifically states:

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.489
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime whereof the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.890
party shall have been duly convicted, shall
exist within the United States, or any place

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.060
subject to their jurisdiction.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.450
Congress shall have power to enforce this
article by appropriate legislation.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.590
Interestingly, The Thirteenth Amendment almost
stated the exact opposite of what it ended

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.590
up saying.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
A few years before the amendment to abolish
slavery was proposed as the Thirteenth Amendment,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.200
The Corwin Amendment was proposed in 1861
and would have been the Thirteenth Amendment,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.860
had 3/4 of the states ratified it.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.360
This proposed amendment would have forbid
Congress from passing any laws that restricted

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.900
or abolished slavery.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.630
Further, it would have made it illegal for
any anti-slavery amendment to be made to the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.049
U.S. Constitution.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.360
Specifically, it stated:

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.620
No amendment shall be made to the Constitution
which will authorize or give to Congress the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.729
power to abolish or interfere, within any
State, with the domestic institutions thereof,

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.439
including that of persons held to labor or
service by the laws of said State.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.069
This Corwin Amendment managed to make it passed
the House and the Senate in March of 1861

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.530
and was signed by President Buchanan thereafter.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.490
Ohio, Maryland, and Illinois ratified it.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.000
Although, once the American Civil War started,
the Corwin Amendment lost any momentum it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.489
had, because it had largely been proposed
to forestall the chance of a Civil War.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.849
Once the war started, Ohio rescinded their
ratification.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.410
The Corwin Amendment was passed without an
expiration, so it’s still on the table today

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.170
for states to ratify, if they so choose.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.040
The most recent attempt to do so was in Texas
in 1963, with a resolution to ratify it put

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400
forth by Republican Henry Stollenwerck from
Dallas.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.300
This failed to generate any momentum for the
Corwin Amendment, though, and the resolution

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.250
wasn’t considered by the state legislature.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.739
If you’re curious, there are some exceptions
to that “involuntary servitude” bit in

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.960
the Thirteenth Amendment beyond as a “form
of punishment”.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.300
For instance, the Supreme Court ruled in 1918
that the military draft does not constitute

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.349
“involuntary servitude”, even if the people
drafted do not want to join the military.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.930
This seems to fly in the face of the generally
accepted legal definition of involuntary servitude

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.810
which includes, “a person held by actual
force, threats of force, or threats of legal

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.239
coercion in a condition of slavery – compulsory
service or labor against his or her will.”

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.319
This case was brought before the Supreme Court
after the passing of the Conscription Act

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.030
of 1917.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.170
After this Act was passed, military tribunals
tried various people who refused to bear arms,

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.360
wear uniforms, etc. when drafted.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.090
More shockingly, a board was put together
to try consciousness objectors.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.680
The only people at this time who were allowed
to be conscientious objectors were Amish,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.659
Quakers, and members of the Church of the
Brethren.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.310
If the board decided they weren’t sincere
enough, they were sentenced.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.489
These were no light sentences either, 17 people
were sentenced to death, 142 were given life

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.989
sentences in prison, and 345 were sentenced
to penal labor camps for varying time periods.

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.400
The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Conscription
Act of 1917, citing Article I. Section 9,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.110
of the Constitution which gives Congress the
power to “declare war… to raise and support

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.720
armies… to make rules for the government
and regulation of the land and naval forces.”

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.220
Of course, this says nothing about the government
being able to force people to join the military,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.520
only that they have the authority to build
and support the armies.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.390
But, none-the-less, they upheld it anyways,
further citing Vattel’s, The Law of Nations:

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.760
It may not be doubted that the very conception
of a just government and its duty to the citizen

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.190
includes the reciprocal obligation of the
citizen to render military service in case

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.830
of need, and the right to compel it.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.330
… To do more than state the proposition
is absolutely unnecessary in view of the practical

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:16.580
illustration afforded by the almost universal
legislation to that effect now 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.889
in force.
