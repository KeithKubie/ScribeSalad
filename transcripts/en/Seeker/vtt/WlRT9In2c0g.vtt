00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.640
Female orgasms seems to be so mysterious they’ve
been the subject of studies for ages.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:13.530
Can we just agree that at the end of the day
they’re all just awesome?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.330
Hello everyone, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.080
Sexually speaking, women tend to be bit more
complicated than men.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.320
Female arousal is heavily dependent on location,
comfort, stress, and even more nebulous factors

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.279
like relationship with a partner and contextual
life.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.540
And many women still don’t know exactly
what gets them off.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.400
Is it direct clitoral stimulation?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Friction from intercourse?

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.530
A mixture of both?

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.020
In order to understand a female orgasm, it
helps to know the parts involved.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.260
First off, the part you can see on the outside
is not the vagina.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.760
It’s actually called the the vulva; the
vagina is the canal inside the vulva.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.990
And then there’s the clitoris.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.910
Most of us think of the clitoris as a small
organ typically covered by a hood but it’s

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.670
actually so, so much more.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.260
The clitoris the metaphorical tip of the iceberg,
the iceberg in this case being a system of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.420
nerves and muscles called the clitorourethrovaginal
complex or CUV that surrounds the vagina and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.660
the urethra.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.680
Since there is an external and internal portion
of this CUV complex, there are two types of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.160
orgasms women can experience: clitoral and
vaginal.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.909
The difference is just the means by which
these nerves are stimulated; for clitoral

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.320
orgasms it’s the external part of the clitoris
that is being stimulated.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.240
For a vaginal orgasm it’s nerves inside
the vagina that are being stimulated.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.040
Most women reach climax sooner from clitoral
stimulation since this tiny external portion

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.590
has more nerve endings than any other human
body part, male or female, but at the end

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.270
of the day it’s all the same bundle of nerves
and muscles.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.650
It’s not entirely surprising that not everyone
understands this distinction.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.860
The clitoris wasn’t even scientifically
‘discovered’ until the 1500’s, and for

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.560
centuries the body part was pretty much ignored.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210
This was partially because of the taboo surrounding
female sexuality, but also scientists didn’t

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.250
really see the value in having a clitoris,
or a female orgasm at all.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.150
It’s an orgasm that doesn’t emit sperm
so doesn’t further the human race.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.380
So, they thought, what’s the point of having
or studying the female orgasm?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.259
In fact, the idea that a women could have
different types of orgasms didn’t arise

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.239
until the early 1900’s.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.629
Famed Psychiatrist Sigmund Freud argued that
clitoral orgasms are inferior to vaginal orgasms

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.430
because women can only fully realize their
mature sexuality from a having intercourse

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.579
with a man.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.569
Today we know that this is totally ridiculous,
but still many women say clitoral and vaginal

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.879
orgasms feel different, so why?

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.879
And how?

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.769
Well it may have something to do with blood
flow.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.700
In a 2014 study, scientists observed women
during clitoral and vaginal stimulation using

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.700
ultrasounds.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.439
The researchers found that while clitoral
orgasms altered blood flow in the exterior

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.650
clitoris, vaginal orgasms affected blood flow
in the entire clitoral network, the CUV.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.799
These differences in blood flow were correlated
to the change in sensation.

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.379
But, vaginal or clitoral -- even male or female!
-- all orgasms have largely the same effect

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.279
on the body and brain.

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:01.019
Orgasms occur when the muscles that were tightened
during arousal finally relax.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.409
This happens through a series of rhythmic
contractions.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.889
The feeling of ecstasy, bliss and sometimes
a rush of emotion come from a release of hormones

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.409
like dopamine oxytocin and prolactin in your
brain.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.650
And scientists say this has major health benefits.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.099
Orgasms are said to reduce stress, improve
sleep and lower blood pressure.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.230
So we should stop pigeonholing orgasms into
just vaginal or clitoral and instead focus

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.849
on the feelings they give us.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.819
In the end, they’re all pretty great!

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.689
So that's all about good sex.

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.540
But what about when sex goes horribly, horribly
wrong?

And speaking of good sex...

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.239
Could sex be so good that it actually kills
you?

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.519
Jackie has the answer to the odd question
of whether or not sex can kill your grandfather

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.310
in this video right here.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.879
This happens because the male body responds
to cardio-vascular stress by increasing vascular

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.799
resistance, which is the force that opposes
blood flow.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.059
This can lead to an uptick in blood pressure.

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.930
