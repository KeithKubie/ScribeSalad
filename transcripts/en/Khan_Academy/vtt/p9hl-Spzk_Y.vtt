00:00:00.344 --> 00:00:02.260
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.710
how far can I see from
the window of a plane

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.470
when a plane is at
its cruising altitude.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.810
And just to give us some
numbers to work with,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.550
let's just assume that the
cruising altitude that we

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.280
are working with, the altitude
of the plane, is 10 kilometers.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.630
And the number for the radius
of the earth-- and so this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.050
will be important
for figuring out

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.410
how far I can see
from the plane.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.440
Let me do this is
a different color.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.490
The earth's radius-- I'll do
it in green-- in kilometers

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.140
is 6,371 kilometers.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.472
And it's actually not
constant throughout the earth,

00:00:46.472 --> 00:00:48.930
but we're going to assume that
for the sake of this problem

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.320
that Earth is a perfect sphere.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.820
It actually is not
one, but we will

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.790
assume that it's
a perfect sphere.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.380
And its radius is
roughly 6,371 kilometers.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.670
So given this
information, can we

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.200
figure out how far can we
see on a perfectly clear day

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
from the window of
a plane cruising

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.636
at an altitude of 10 kilometers?

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.260
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.050
and try to think
about it on your own.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.680
So I assume you've
given a go at it.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.350
So let's draw Earth.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.220
And this by no stretch
of the imaginations

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.370
will be a scale drawing either
of Earth or of the plane

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.710
flying above the
surface of Earth.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.110
So let's say that this
right over here is Earth.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.780
I would want to draw it as a
perfect sphere, but I have not.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860
But you understand
my limitations.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.230
Now let's see what we could do.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.080
So the plane is traveling at
an altitude of 10 kilometers.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.320
So let's say that this is
the plane right over here.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.460
And this distance, once
again, by no stretch

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.785
of the imagination drawn
to scale, is 10 kilometers.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.100
And then if we were
to keep going down

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.010
to the center of the
earth, that would

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.180
be another 6,371 kilometers.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.920
And when you think about
how far you could see,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.660
your line of sight is
really forming a tangent

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.740
with some point on the
surface of the earth.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.840
So this is me in my plane.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.673
And let's say I'm looking
at that direction.

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:23.240
How far could I see?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.410
Well, I'm going to be
hitting the surface

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.210
of the earth at some point.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.140
And that line of
sight is essentially

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.620
going to be tangent
to the surface.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.951
So let me see if I can draw
it a little bit cleaner.

00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:39.200
So let's see, it's going to
be tangent to the surface.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.840
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960
And so this is the
furthest point I could see,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.500
the point at which
my line of sight

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.620
is just tangent to the
surface of the earth.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.371
Well, how far is that
point of the surface

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.078
going to be from the
center of the earth?

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.540
Well, we're assuming that
Earth is a perfect sphere.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:07.410
So that's also going
to be 6,371 kilometers.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.510
And the other thing we
know is that a tangent line

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.340
is going to be
perpendicular to a radius.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.450
So this right over here is
going to be a right angle.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.820
And all sorts of bells should
be ringing in your brain

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.570
at this point
because we have just

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.000
constructed a right triangle.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.240
And what we want to figure
out, how far we can see-- well,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.970
that's this unknown side
of this right triangle,

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.490
the side that I
have marked in x.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.710
So we can just use the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.570
We know that the square of
this side, so x squared,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.250
plus the square of this
other non-hypotenuse side,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.390
so 6,371 squared, is going
to be equal to the square

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.074
of the hypotenuse.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:51.740
So what is the length
of the hypotenuse?

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.620
Well, the hypotenuse is 6,371
kilometers plus this extra 10

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.020
kilometers of altitude squared.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:14.490
And so we get x squared
plus 6,371 squared

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.790
is equal to-- what
is this going to be?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.190
This is going to be this whole
distance right over here.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.720
The whole distance is just
going to be 6,381 kilometers,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.590
and we're going to square that.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.760
So x squared-- we just subtract
6,371 squared from both sides.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.310
We get x squared
is equal to 6,381

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.190
squared minus 6,371 squared.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.715
Or we could say that x is
equal to the square root of all

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:51.530
of this business.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.420
And I could just
copy and paste that.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.700
So copy, and paste.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.820
Let's throw that right in there.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.080
Actually, my radical
is not big enough.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.520
So let me make my radical
a little bit bigger.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.740
And then we can use a calculator
to actually compute this.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.142
So let me get my calculator out.

00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:15.100
And this is exciting
because now we can finally

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.430
know on a perfectly clear
day how far we can see out

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.690
of a plane.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:26.440
So it's going to be the
square root of 6,381 squared

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.790
minus 6,371 squared, which
is going to be-- we deserve

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:41.130
a drum roll-- roughly
357 kilometers,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.160
if we round to the
nearest kilometer.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.600
So x is approximately
equal to 357 kilometers

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.570
in any direction.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.270
So you could see 357
kilometers in that direction.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.980
You could see 357 kilometers
in that direction.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.977
So let's say you're
looking at a map of the US,

00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:04.435
and your plane is
flying across it.

00:06:04.435 --> 00:06:05.476
And this is kind of neat.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.080
And once again, this is by
no means drawn to scale,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.515
but let's say that this right
over here is North America.

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:16.255
That's the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:17.340
That's Louisiana.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.256
I'll draw Lake Pontchartrain
right over there.

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:20.750
And then see, that's Florida.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.780
And then that's the
rest of North America.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.360
That's California,
just like that.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.570
That's Vancouver.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.074
I could keep going--
Alaska, so on and so forth.

00:06:28.074 --> 00:06:29.490
So if you're flying
in your plane,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.740
and your plane is right here,
if we assume the numbers we just

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.480
assumed, in any direction,
you can see 357 kilometers.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.290
So 357 kilometers would
be about that far.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.910
So you could see that
far in every direction.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.512
So it's kind of like seeing
an entire state-- or actually

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.470
multiple states, depending
on what state you're

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.039
thinking about-- of the
US from your window,

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.580
if you could look
in every direction.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.390
Obviously, if
you're only sitting

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.510
on one side of the
plane, you could only

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.110
look out of one window.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.930
But maybe you could go switch
to the other side of the plane

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.263
and see the other side, as well.

00:06:59.263 --> 00:07:02.710
But you're actually
seeing a substantive area

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.430
when you look out of the window
from 10 kilometers, which

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.750
is roughly about
32,000 feet in the air.
