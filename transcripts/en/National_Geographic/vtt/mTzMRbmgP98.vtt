00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.834
NARRATOR: 30 years
ago, we discovered

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:06.467
man-made chemicals had punched
a hole in the ozone layer.

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:16.333
Is that hole here to stay,
waiting around to kill us?

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.700
Today, we're trying
hard to find out.

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:56.133
Morgan Sandercock is about to
test an experimental plane,

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.800
perfect for sampling ozone.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.767
MAN: (ON RADIO) Copy that.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.400
So I felt pressure rising.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.834
MORGAN SANDERCOCK:
(VOICEOVER) We think we

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.567
can go as high as 90,000 feet.

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:05.266
MAN: (ON RADIO) Jim,
you ready to go?

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.867
JIM PAYNE: (ON
RADIO) We're ready.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.567
MORGAN SANDERCOCK: (VOICEOVER)
That's the big boy territory.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:12.467
That's where things can go
wrong very, very quickly.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:17.233
If we lose cabin
pressure, then, the pilots

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.066
could very easily pass out.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.633
And we don't have any automatic
systems to recover from that.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.433
WOMAN: (ON RADIO)
Getting ready to roll.

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.166
NARRATOR: Now, a glider might
sound like a dangerous choice

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.266
so high up.

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.800
But gliders don't have
engines, which means they can't

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.333
pollute the team's samples.

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.633
MAN: (ON RADIO) Confirm
[inaudible] off.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.066
WOMAN: (ON RADIO)
[inaudible] is off.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.433
Wing wheel is off.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.700
MAN: (ON RADIO) Been
running at 11:32.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.900
MAN: (ON RADIO) 11:32.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.000
Written down in GPS 5.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.767
MAN: (ON RADIO) Airborne.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:53.300
[music playing]

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.800
NARRATOR: The Perlan
glider uses air

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.567
rising over the Southern Andes
to reach extraordinary heights.

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.133
MAN: (ON RADIO)
Airspeed, 70 knots.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:32.667
Looking beautiful.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:33.467
MAN: (ON RADIO) Yeah?

00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:34.900
MAN: (ON RADIO) Really high.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.967
MAN: (ON RADIO) Traffic.

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:36.700
MAN: (ON RADIO) Yeah.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:49.100
NARRATOR: 52,000 feet up makes
this the highest glider flight

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.600
ever.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.767
But you've got to get this
high to get a great picture

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:55.233
of the ozone layer.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:57.934
The good news is that
thanks to a global ban

00:02:57.934 --> 00:03:00.333
on ozone-harming
chemicals, it looks

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:01.834
like the hole is healing up.

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:07.767
Our shield is regenerating.
