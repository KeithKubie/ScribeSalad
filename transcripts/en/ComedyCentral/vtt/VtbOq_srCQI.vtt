00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.170
Now it is time
for tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:06.573
-(cheering)
-Yeah!

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.080
From Donald Trump calling
Jeb Bush "low energy"

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.949
to Donald Trump caught on tape
bragging about sexual assault

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.052
to Donald Trump becoming
the (bleep) president,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.620
2016 featured news stories

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.222
as insane and unbelievable
as Donald Trump.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:26.092
Will 2017 be
anywhere nearly as eventful?

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.428
Only time will tell--
we'll have to wait and see.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.829
Or will we?!

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:33.332
Let's all...
gaze into our crystal balls

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:36.869
with tonight's hashtag
#2017Predictions.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.671
(villainous chuckling)

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.640
(cheering)

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.043
-Yes.
-RICHTER: Nice.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.611
My first prediction

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.147
is that this (bleep) guy's
not going anywhere.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.583
Uh, other examples might be...

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.752
-(whooping, applause)
-Oh, stop it!

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.624
You say that here, and then
you'll go on the Internet

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:00.993
and tell me
how much come I eat on Twitter.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:03.396
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.198
I... That's for you.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.766
(laughter)

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.469
So, examples of this might be--
Apple swings the other way

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.537
and adds two
headphone jacks, or...

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840
It'll finally be a wrap
on planet Earth.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.576
I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock, and begin.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.978
-Diona.
-Black Twitter finally becomes

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.482
-a separate but equal app.
-(laughter)

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.550
(whooping, applause)

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:25.952
Points.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:33.025

the Trump impression on<i> SNL.</i>

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.128
-All right, points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.530
-Diona. -Planned Parenthood
changes its name

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:39.732
to Figure It Out Yourself,
You Dumb Slits.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.901
-All right, points.
-Whoa.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.236
Andy Richter.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.339
Uh, Jimmy Fallon tousles
Putin's hair

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.341
and gets his hand dunked
in acid.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:50.543
-All right, points. Points.
-(laughter)

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.911
Matt Besser.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.214
Kanye West completes
a full concert!

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.816
-Yeah, points.
-(cheering, applause)

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.452
-The whole thing.
-It'll never happen.

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.853
Diona.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.256
Jay Z releases
his follow-up to<i> Lemonade</i>

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.825
-called<i> We Were on a Break. </i>
-All right, points.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.927
-(laughter)
-Andy.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.264
The first viable human clone
is produced.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.666
It's a Chris Hardwick
that hosts a recap show

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.636
about all the other shows that
the actual Chris Hardwick does.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.337
-That's a fantastic idea.
-Yeah.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.770
-That's a fantastic idea.
-(cheering)
