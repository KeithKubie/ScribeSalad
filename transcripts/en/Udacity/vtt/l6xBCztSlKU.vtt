00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.330
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One point that we'll have is 14,5000. Since, after 2 weeks or 14 days, Grant

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.892
will have a profit of $5,000. The other point is a little bit trickier. We know

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:16.280
the ad agency wants Grant to pay them $2,000. So that means, at the start of his

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.920
ad campaign, or after zero days have passed, he'll have a net loss of $2,000.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.332
So, the point 0, negative 2000. If this is a little bit tricky for you, not a

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:30.470
big deal at all. I definitely see why this could be hard to figure out.
