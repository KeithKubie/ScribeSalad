ALBERT MEYER: Today's
topic is random variables.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.950
Random variables are an
absolutely fundamental concept

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.950
in probability theory.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.750
But before we get into
officially defining them,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.270
let's start off
with an example that

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.156
in fact, is a game because
that's a fun way to start.

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:17.030
So we're going to play
the bigger number game

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.480
and here's how it works.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
There are two teams,
and Team 1 has

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.020
the task of picking two
different integers between 0

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.819
and 7 inclusive, and
they write one integer

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:31.610
on one piece of paper
and the other integer

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.410
on the other piece of paper.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.470
They turn the two
pieces of paper

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.820
face down so the
numbers are not visible,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.480
and the other team then sees
these two pieces of paper

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.430
whose other side has
different numbers written

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.350
on them sitting on the table.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.752
What Team 2 then does is picks
one of the pieces of paper

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.490
and turns it over and
looks at the number on it.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.350
And then, based on
what that number

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.420
is, they make a decision,
stick with the number

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.480
they have or switch to the
other unknown number on the face

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.780
down piece of paper.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.560
And that'll be
their final number.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.400
And the game is that Team
2 wins if they wind up

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160
with the larger number.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.285
So they're going to look
at the number on the paper

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:13.701
that they expose
and they're going

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:15.090
to try to decide
whether it looks

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.182
like a big number
or little number.

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.390
If it looks like a big
number, they'll stick with it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.150
If it looks like
a little number,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.260
they'll switch to the other
one that they hope is larger.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.269
So which team do you think
has an advantage here?

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:31.060
Course, if you've read
the notes, you know.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.290
But if you haven't been
exposed to this before,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.580
it's not really so obvious.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.330
And what we
encourage and what we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.270
used to do when we ran this
in real time in classes

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.370
that we would have
students in teams, split

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.160
their team in half,
one would be Team 1

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.868
and the other would
be Team 2, and they'd

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:50.730
play the game few times,
see if they could figure out

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.100
who had the advantage.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.990
And if you have the
opportunity, this

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.470
might be a good moment
to stop this video

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.410
and try playing the game with
some friends if they're around.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.170
Otherwise, let's just proceed
and see how it all works.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.770
So this is the strategy
Team 2 is going to adopt.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.070
They're going to take this
idea about big and small

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.640
that I mentioned and act
on it in a methodical way.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.190
So they're going to pick
a paper to expose, giving

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.390
each paper equal probability.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.490
So that guarantees
that they have

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.250
a 50/50 chance of picking the
big number and a 50/50 chance

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.470
of picking the little number.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.529
Whatever ingenuity Team 1 tried
to do on which piece of paper

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.320
was on the left and
which was on the right,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.970
it doesn't really matter if Team
2 simply picks a piece of paper

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.580
at random.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.510
There's no way
that Team 1 can try

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.080
to fake out Team 2 on
where they put the number.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.600
OK.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.950
The next step is
that Team 2 is going

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.910
to decide whether the
number that they can see,

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.190
the exposed number, is small.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.620
And if so, would they switch?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.810
And otherwise they stick.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.110
So that is, they're going to
define some threshold Z where

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.410
being less than or
equal to Z means small,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.960
and being greater
than Z means large.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.680
The question is, how
do they choose Z?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.660
Well, a naive thing
to do would be

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.870
to choose Z to be in the middle
of the interval from 0 to 7.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.120
Let's say, you
choose Z equals 3.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.590
So there would be four numbers
less than or equal to Z

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.320
and four numbers greater
than Z. But of course,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.410
as soon as Team 1 knew that that
was your Z, what would they do?

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.440
Well, they would make sure
that both numbers were

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.260
on the same side of
Z. If you're Z was 3,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.650
they would always choose their
numbers to be, say, 0 and 1.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.690
And that way, when
you were switching,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.090
your Z would tell you that
you had a small number,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.710
you should switch
to the other one.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.540
And you'd only have a
50/50 chance of winning.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.750
So if you fixed that
value of Z, Team 2

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.020
has a way of ensuring that
you have no advantage.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.630
You can only win with
probability 50/50.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.530
And that's true no
matter what Z you take.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.217
If Team 1 knew what
your Z was, they

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:09.800
would just make sure
to pick their two

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.880
numbers on the same
side of your Z.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.840
And then your Z wouldn't
really tell you anything.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.709
You'd switch or
stick in both cases,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.510
and you'd only
have a 50/50 chance

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.930
of picking the right number.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.190
So what you do-- and this is
where probability comes in--

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.450
is you pick Z in a way that
can't be predicted or made

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.040
use of by Team 1.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.230
You pick Z at random, to
be any number from 0 to 7,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.800
not including 7 including 0.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.080
That is, your number is
either 0, 1, 2, up through 6.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.130
And being less than or
equal to Z means small,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.460
and being greater
than Z means large.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.670
And when you see a small
number, you'll switch

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.320
and when you see a large
number, you'll stick.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.310
But what's going to be large
and what's going to be small

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.920
is going to vary each time
you play the game, depending

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.510
on what random number,
Z, comes out to be.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.420
So let's analyze your
probability if you're Team 2.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.726
What's the probability that
you're going to win now?

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:16.399
Well, let's suppose that Team
1 picks these two numbers.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.940
We don't know what
they are, but they

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.451
have to pick a low number
that's less than a high number.

00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:22.200
So these two numbers
are at least 1 apart,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.890
they can't have the same
number on both pieces of paper.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.127
Otherwise, it's clear
that you are not

00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:30.960
going to be able to
pick the large one, that

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.780
would be cheating.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.322
OK, so there's two
different numbers.

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.196
So one of them has to
be less than the other.

00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:37.340
We don't know how much
less, might be a lot less,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.990
might be only one less,
but low is less than high.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.730
OK, now we can consider
three cases of what

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.930
happens with your strategy.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.730
The most interesting
case is the middle case.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.100
That is, when your Z,
which was chosen at random,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.150
happens to fall in the
interval between low and high.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.240
That is, your Z is strictly
less than high and greater than

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.630
or equal to low.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.510
And then in that case, your Z
is really guiding you correctly

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.560
on what to do.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.350
If you turn over the
low card, then it's

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.790
going to look low because
it's less than or equal to Z

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.880
so you'll switch to
the high card and win.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.690
If you turn over
the high card, it's

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.820
going to be greater than
Z so it'll look high

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.910
and you'll know
to stick with it.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.290
So in this case, you're
guaranteed to win.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.150
If you were lucky
enough to guess

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.390
the right threshold between low
and high, you're going to win.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.190
And so the probability
that you win,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.850
given the middle
case occurs, is 1.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.280
Now, what about the middle case?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.070
How often does that happen?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.310
Well, the difference between
low and high is at least 1,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.650
so there's guaranteed
to be 1 chance in 7

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.110
that your Z is going
to fall between them.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.550
And it could be more if low
and high are further apart,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.530
but as long as they're
at least one apart,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.200
there's a 1/7 chance that you're
going to fall in between them.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.670
OK.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.520
Now, in case H,
that's the case where

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.920
Z happens to be
chosen greater than

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.490
or equal to the high
number that Team 1 shows.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.480
In other words, Z is bigger
than both numbers than Team 1

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.890
shows and put on
the pieces of paper.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.100
Well, in that case, Z just
isn't telling you anything.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.480
So what's going to happen is
that both numbers are going

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.812
to look high to you--
sorry-- both numbers

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:24.270
are going to look low to you
because they're both less than

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.570
or equal to Z. So you'll switch.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.520
And that means that
you'll win, if and only

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.810
if, you happen to turn
the low card over first.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.540
Well that was 50/50.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.570
So the probability
that you win, given

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.390
that Z-- both cards are
on the low side of Z,

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.920
you'll win with half the time.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.150
And symmetrically, if Z is
less than the low card, that

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.900
is, Z is less than both
cards chosen by Team 1,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.400
then they're both going to
look high, and so you'll stick.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.677
And that means that you'll
stick, you'll win, if and only

00:07:59.677 --> 00:08:01.510
if, you happen to have
picked the high card.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.320
There's a 50/50 chance of that.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.130
So again, in this case that
Z makes both cards look high,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.900
or Z itself is low, Team 2,
you win with probability 1/2.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.010
Well, that's great because now
we can apply total probability.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:26.510
And what total probability
tells us is that Team 2 wins

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.120
is the probability that
they win given case

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.280
M times the probability
of M plus the probability

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.960
that they win given
not the middle case

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.860
times the probability
of not the middle case.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.580
But we figured out
what these were.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.870
Well, at least
inequalities on them,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.010
because there's
probability 1 that you'll

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.990
win 1/7 of the time.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.880
And there's probability
a 1/2 that you'll

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.900
win the rest of the time,
the other 6/7 of the time.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.590
You're going to win
4/7 of the time.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.050
The probability that you win
playing your strategy is 4/7.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.030
It's better than 50/50.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.050
You have an advantage.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.430
And whether that was a priori
obvious or not, I don't know.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.270
But I think it's kind of cool.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.770
OK, you win with
probability 4/7.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.540
Now, Team 2 has the advantage.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.430
And the important
thing to understand

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.280
is it does not matter
what team does.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.000
No matter how smart
Team 1 is, Team 2

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.780
has gotten control
of the situation

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.530
because they picked--
which piece of paper

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.210
they picked at random 50/50.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.000
So it doesn't matter
what strategy Team 1 used

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.700
on where they
placed the numbers.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.570
And they chose Z
randomly, so again, it

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.310
doesn't matter what
numbers Team 1 shows.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:49.540
Team 2 is still going to have
their 1/7 chance of coming out

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.980
ahead, which is enough to tip
the balance in their favor.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.990
It's interesting that
symmetrically, Team 1 also

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.390
has a random strategy
that they can use,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.070
which guarantees that no
matter what Team 2 does, Team 2

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.950
wins with probability
at most 4/7.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.130
So either team can
force the probability

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:15.800
that Team 2 wins to be at
most 4/7 and at least 4/7.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.740
So if they both play optimally,
it's going to stay at 4/7.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.780
And that's again, true no
matter what Team 2 does,

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.930
Team 1 can put this
upper bound to 4/7 on it.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.310
So essentially we can
say that the value

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.170
of this game, the
probability that Team 2 wins

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.650
is optimally for both is 4/7.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.220
OK, now what does this game
got to do with anything,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.600
with our general topic
of random variables?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.970
Well, we'll be
formal in a moment.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.890
But informally,
a random variable

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.460
is simply a number that's
produced by a random process.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.000
And just to give an
example before we come up

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.530
with a formal definition,
the threshold variable Z

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:01.930
was a thing that took a
value from 0 to 6 inclusive,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.600
each with probability 1/7.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.970
So it was producing a
number by a random process,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.880
that chose a number at random
with equal probability.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:22.000
If Team 2 plays properly
at random picking which

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.770
piece of paper to expose, then
the number of the exposed card,

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.760
or more precisely, whether the
exposed card is high or low,

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.000
will also be a random variable.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.740
And if Team 1 plays optimally,
the number on the exposed card

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.320
is going to be a
random variable.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.350
That is, Team 1 in their
optimal strategy that

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.310
puts an upper bound to 4/7 is
in fact, going to choose the two

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.230
numbers randomly.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.040
So the exposed card
is going to wind up

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.930
being another random
variable, a number produced

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.270
by the random process.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.800
And likewise, the number
of the larger card

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.070
if Team 1 picks its larger
and smaller cards randomly,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.560
it's going to be another
example of a number produced

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.256
by a random process.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:06.130
And likewise, the number
of the smaller card.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.230
So that's enough examples.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.030
This little game
has a whole bunch

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.940
of random variables
appearing in it.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.480
And in the next
segment, we will look

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.810
again officially,
what is the definition

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.030
of a random variable?
