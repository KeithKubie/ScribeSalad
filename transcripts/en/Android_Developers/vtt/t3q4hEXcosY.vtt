00:00:00.276 --> 00:00:02.400
SPEAKER 1: If you're like
many, you get a new phone

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.510
every two years.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.910
With some napkin math, you'll
see this means about half

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.580
of your users will get
a new phone this year.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.650
What happens when your
user gets a new phone?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.440
Google Play will reinstall your
app, and if you do nothing,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.520
you'll create a cold welcome.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.430
You'll show a blank
login form-- like they're

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.730
a total stranger who has
never created an account.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.290
No one enjoys that.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.680
There's a few ways you
can give a warm welcome.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.530
You can simplify log in by
using Google Sign In, Smart

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.440
Lock and Autofill,
and you can easily

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.570
move all of your app
settings to the new phone

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.610
by using Auto Backup.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.830
You're probably familiar
with Google Sign In.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.410
Instead of needing a
username and password,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.130
users press a single button to
securely log them into your app

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.350
with their g-mail account,
or any email address--

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.800
and if you enable it, they
can even skip the button.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
By adopting Google
Sign In, you can

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.450
lift registration and
activation as well as retention

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.630
in your iOS, web and
Android applications.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.060
For users with a password,
create a warm welcome

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.870
with Smart Lock for Passwords.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.510
Smart Lock is a
password manager,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.110
and it will offer to save users'
passwords when they log in.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.450
If they decline, it
won't bug them again.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.780
But if they accept, it
securely stores their password

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.790
in the cloud.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.270
Your Android and
web applications

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.010
can then fetch this
password programmatically

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.080
so you don't have to
show them a login form.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.220
Smart Lock is backwards
compatible from API 9

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.500
or Gingerbread.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.900
In a case study, one company
found a 20% reduction

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.380
in login related support
requests by adding Smart Lock,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.140
and it really warms up
the user experience.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.630
Android O adds the
Autofill Framework.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.520
Autofill works just
like in Chrome,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.080
offering to save
form content when

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.320
users enter their passwords
or other information.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.800
As a developer, you can get
ready by adding Autofill hints

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.620
and setting up a digital asset
link between their website

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.390
and Android application.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.330
This is a JSON file that you
host on your web server, which

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.190
allows Autofill
services to share

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.050
Autofill data between
your web and Android app.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.350
But how do you move content
that isn't behind a login?

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.520
For example, in Gmail we show
a welcome to our new users.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.240
You expect this to not repeat on
your new phone, and it doesn't.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.890
We used our cloud backup service
to build this functionality.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.580
And because offering
a warm welcome

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.700
is important to
Android users, we

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.420
offer it to Android
apps for free.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.180
Auto Backup saves
all of your apps

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.300
changed files, up to
25 megabytes, nightly.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.460
When your app installs
again, the files

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.410
are downloaded
before it launches.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.320
Restores aren't limited to
play installs, and happen even

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.330
when you side load from
Android Studio or ASB.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.140
To learn more about configuring
Auto Backup, including

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.110
how to exclude files,
check out the documentation

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.390
on developer.android.com.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.970
Remember, Auto Backup
is not a good place

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.430
to store information like
passwords or credit card

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.500
numbers, and definitely
not for storing

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.450
sensitive information
like medical records

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.780
or financial data.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.610
If your app already
has a different way

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.530
to transfer settings
to a new phone,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.210
check to make sure
you're transferring

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.530
all of the settings.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.840
It's easy to forget a
few, and users really

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.410
want that warm welcome.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.347
Thanks for watching.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:13.930
I've included links
in the description

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.580
for details about
how to integrate

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.762
any of these features.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.970
And be sure to check out
our previous video on making

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.560
your app Autofill ready.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.680
See you next time.
