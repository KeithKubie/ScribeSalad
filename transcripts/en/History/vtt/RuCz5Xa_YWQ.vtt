00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.290
[engine running]

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.670
[music playing]

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.330
So there's a part
of the Green Hell

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.420
that we call the Roller Coaster.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.920
You come out of that
last high bank dirt turn

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.210
and enter into
the Fishbowl here.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.710
This is the first of a series
of man-made log features here.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.500
Yeah, this thing
is super steep, Glen.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.830
You gotta carry speed
through this thing

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.250
or you're sliding
down into that junk.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.750
Yeah, I mean we're getting--

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.710
you know, we're 40, 45
degrees here on this thing.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.380
[engine roaring]

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.920
You want to stay high
and keep those tires dry,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.210
because if you end
up down in that muck,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.750
you're not going to
like the wobble boards.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.880
[engine roaring]

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.790
He looks like he's hung up
on those wobble boards, guy.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.120
Uh-oh.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.580
You want to keep
your tires dry as you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.120
come out of that last one.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.960
Because this is what we
call the wobble boards.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.210
And they do wobble, every one
of them that you drive over.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.120
[laughter]

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.460
Dry tires will
certainly help out.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.040
Yeah, this looks
like a lot of fun.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.120
But it's absolutely no fun
with mud on your tires.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.620
You end up on either side,
you're going on your lid.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.960
[engine roaring]

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.750
[splash]

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.920
You want to keep the
middle of the wobble boards

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.790
right in the center
your vehicle.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.620
You go too slow, the wobble
boards might hang you up.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.920
You go too fast, you bounce
off and go off the side.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.830
[engine revving]

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.290
[crash]

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.580
[laughter]

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.330
Once you get off of the wobble
boards, you gain composure.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.120
And then you gotta carry
a little bit of speed

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.420
up the log hill here.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.750
Because if you go
too slow, you end up

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330
high siding on the top of it.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.580
[engine roaring]

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.000
You want to carry enough
speed to not high side,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.920
but not too much,
because it really

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.170
drops off on this back side.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500
You don't want to be carrying
any speed into the pond.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460
If you hit that thing, your
motor is going to flood,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.170
you're out of it.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.420
Well, there you go.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.330
That's the Green
Hell Roller Coaster.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.040
Kicked it up a notch for season
2-- bigger, stronger, faster.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.000
[music playing]

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.500
What's happening, everybody?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.790
We're here at the Kaolin
Climb, the last challenge

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.830
you have to make it
over before you can say

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.540
you defeated the Green Hell.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.380
[engine running]

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.380
There he is!

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.380
Go, [inaudible], go!

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.120
Hammer it down.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.710
Go, go, go, go!

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.040
We stepped everything
up here for season 2,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.210
including the Kaolin Climb.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.620
It was only at about
42% grade last season.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.250
This season, it's
hovering right around 55%.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.170
Right now, my
calves are burning.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.380
Damn, that is steep.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.580
And we're only
halfway up right now.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.380
Once you make it up that
steep grade and it's dry,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.750
you hit all of this,
this thick muck.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.080
If you don't have the right
tire, it clogs the tire.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.580
And you get about halfway up.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.420
And you just slide
right back down.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.250
[engine running]

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.750
He's gonna have to kick it up.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.500
He's gotta rev it.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.080
Let's go!

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.710
This course is both
natural and man-made.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.960
We have dozers,
backhoes, excavators

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.250
out here working around the
clock to get the courses ready.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.790
Right now, we've got our
boys up top finishing

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.580
watering down the Kaolin Climb.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.120
We dumped thousands of gallons
of water down this last part.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.790
But there's no way
to get a run at it.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.420
Because where we're standing,
it's going to be deep.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.460
Yeah, I've played in
a lot of mud before.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.790
But this right here
is some nasty stuff.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.540
[engine roaring]

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.620
MAN: He's at the top!

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.460
If you can make it this far,
if you can crest that hill,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.580
well, you've made
it to holy ground.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.290
You've conquered the Green Hell.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.620
[engine roaring]

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.120
Yeah!

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.620
Woo!

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.460
[echoing]

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.670
This portion of the Green Hell
we call The Pond, with Halfway

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.670
Island in the middle.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.670
You can go to the right or left.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.460
It doesn't matter.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.580
[engine roaring]

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.330
If you hit it with some speed,
your day might end right here.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.460
The whole pond is
lined with kaolin,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.040
and we've already told
you how slippery kaolin

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.460
is when it's wet.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.170
The pond itself?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.620
Well, I think it's
about knee deep.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.210
[laughs]

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.380
This is a great opportunity for
a driver to throw it all away.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.380
Get the motor wet here,
and your day is done.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.210
[motor sputtering]

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.960
MAN: Well, that
certainly killed it.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.380
GLEN PLAKE: It's important to
have good water preparation.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.710
If you do have some
splash on the engine,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.960
you want to make sure all
the electronics and the motor

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.540
is relatively protected.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.210
MAN: It's full of water.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.830
And the big thing
is the air intake.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.420
Whether you got a snorkel,
or some sort of a deflection

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.750
scoop, really important not to
put any water into your engine

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.920
here.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.420
MAN: Check up for the water.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.580
ABE WINE: There he goes.
Smooth entry.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.920
Oh, you're never
going to flood

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.040
your motor going that slow.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.750
Hey, hey.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.670
GLEN PLAKE: The thing is here
is it really tests the driver's

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.330
ability to slow
it down, not come

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.580
in here with a whole bunch of
speed, big old wave of water,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.080
and get the engine wet.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.880
He's out!

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.750
He's out!

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.880
He's headed to you guys!

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.080
Yeah!

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.880
The pond can be
real tough on drivers.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.920
But on a hot day in Georgia,
standing here knee-deep,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.080
it's pretty nice for me.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.920
[laughs]
