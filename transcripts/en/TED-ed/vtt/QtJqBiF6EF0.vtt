00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:09.740
The sight of mistletoe
may either send you scurrying,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.781
or if you have your eye on someone,

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:15.219
awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries,

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.610
but how did the festive Christmas
tradition of kissing under mistletoe

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.010
come about?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.590
The long-lived custom intertwines
the mythology and biology

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.840
of this intriguing plant.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
There are more than 1,000 species
of mistletoe,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.750
which grows the world over.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650
In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.991
by the plant's unusual growth habits

00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.481
that they included it in their legends
and myths.

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:40.571
In ancient Rome,

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:44.280
Pliny the Elder described how 
the Druid priesthood in ancient England

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.362
believed that mistletoe was a plant 
dropped down from heaven by the gods.

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:52.899
That explained its unlikely position
amongst the high branches

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.591
of certain trees.

00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:56.971
They also believed it had powers
of healing

00:00:56.971 --> 00:00:58.792
and bestowing fertility.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:03.288
Meanwhile, Scandinavian legend told
of the plant's mystical qualities

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:07.844
in the story of the god Baldr
and his adoring mother Frigg,

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:11.103
goddess of love, marriage, and fertility.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:14.992
Frigg loved her son so much
that she commanded every plant,

00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:15.768
animal,

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:19.673
and inanimate object to vow
they'd never harm him.

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:22.803
In her fervor, however, she overlooked
the mistletoe.

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:26.103
The mischievous god Loki
realized this oversight

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.790
and pierced Baldr's heart
with an arrow

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.889
carved from a mistletoe branch.

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:32.771
Frigg cried tears of such sadness

00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:36.013
that they formed the mistletoe's
pearly berries,

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:40.143
making the other gods pity her
and agree to resurrect Baldr.

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:43.333
Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.603
that she transformed the mistletoe
from a symbol of death

00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:49.354
into one of peace and love.

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:52.313
She mandated a one-day truce
for all fights,

00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:55.823
and that everyone embrace
beneath its branches when they passed

00:01:55.823 --> 00:01:58.624
to spread more love into the world.

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.073
In the 17th century,

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:02.863
British colonists arriving
in the New World

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:05.394
found a different, 
but very similar looking,

00:02:05.394 --> 00:02:07.463
species of mistletoe.

00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:11.034
They applied it to these tales of
magic, fertility, and love,

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:15.515
spreading the mistletoe-hanging
tradition from Europe into America.

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:17.586
By the 18th century,

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:20.764
people in Britain had turned this
into a Christmas tradition,

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:24.895
but this custom comes down to more
than just human imagination.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.265
All of it was inspired by the plant's
intriguing biology.

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:31.465
We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,

00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:36.655
but draped on tree boughs in the wild,
it's known as a partly parasitic plant.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.935
Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:41.987
that penetrate the tree bark

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.935
and siphon off the water
and minerals

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:46.936
trees carry up their trunks

00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:49.086
To colonize nearby trees with its seeds,

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.715
mistletoe depends on birds
and other creatures

00:02:51.715 --> 00:02:53.504
to do the dispersing.

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:56.513
Birds that eat the mistletoe's
sticky white berries

00:02:56.513 --> 00:03:00.911
sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark.

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.377
Or with a bit of luck, they excrete
the indigestible seed onto a tree

00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:08.527
where it germinates and starts to grow.

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:11.166
With its resilience and foliage
that stays lush

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.923
even while the surrounding trees
lose their leaves,

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:18.077
you can see why mistletoe
captivated our superstitious ancestors.

00:03:18.077 --> 00:03:22.841
They saw these as signs of the plant's
magical qualities and fertility.

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.038
Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:29.958
with the diversity of wildlife
it supports.

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.989
More than just a parasite, it's also known
as a keystone species.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.009
It's eaten by a diversity of animals,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.009
including deer,

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.799
elk,

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:38.528
squirrels,

00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:39.331
chipmunks,

00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:40.275
porcupines,

00:03:40.275 --> 00:03:41.169
robins,

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.098
bluebirds,

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:43.101
morning doves,

00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:46.508
and the butterfly genus Delias.

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:48.769
Some mistletoe species produce
dense bushes,

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.219
which are excellent nesting
locations for a variety of birds.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.569
And despite their parasitic 
relationship with trees,

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.832
mistletoes can also help other plants.

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:02.789
For instance, juniper sprouts
near mistletoe

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:05.949
to benefit from the visiting 
berry-eating birds.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.530
Through the many benefits it provides,
mistletoe influences diversity,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.161
and allows ecosystems to flourish.

00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:16.258
You might even say that for this iconic plant,
life imitates legend.

00:04:16.258 --> 00:04:19.781
In the wild, mistletoe has the power
to bring things together,

00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:22.669
and in our own traditions,
we see that happening, too.
