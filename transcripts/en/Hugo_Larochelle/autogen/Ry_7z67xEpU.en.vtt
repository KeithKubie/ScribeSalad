00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 this capsule we will see examples 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.440
 independence that can be 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.570
 modeled with networks then bédié 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.370
 we saw previously how to calculate 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.070
 the marginal and joint probabilities 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 and since a policy conditioned 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 its joint productivity ratio 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.460
 we are therefore able to calculate 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 any probabilities 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.279
 conditional 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 now what we are going to see is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.800
 examples of conditional policies 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.390
 that can be simplified and between 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 others we will see examples 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 of independence sometimes conditional 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 sometimes a priori into variables that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.290
 are modeled by bezy networks on 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.059
 will see three different examples 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 first example we're going to watch we're going 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.460
 to be interested in the relationship of dependency 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.270
 spending between 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 where we have a grandparent who is the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 godfather 2 1 and who is the parent of a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 child he will be interested in the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.010
 relationship between a grandparent and a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 child is in this case also in a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 Vézien network where we have a community 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 so we only have the big parent and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.240
 the child will be independent 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 conditionally to the parents so if 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.979
 we observe the godfather the grandparent and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.509
 the child will be independent then a 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 example of a relationship like this 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 to our graph here it is variable 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 here that form a great relationship 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 parents parents kids so this is a 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.369
 examples that we could have 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.579
 in 6 mallarmé people or burglaries to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.670
 money take the example burglaries 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.220
 alarm and then hardly marries in this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.950
 case also a priori so if we do not observe 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.119
 not the housebreaking soul and marry adèle 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 are going to be dependent and so we can see 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.719
 his instrument due to the fact that 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.040
 burglaries will influence the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.630
 distribution of alarms 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.280
 so what kind of value to the man is going 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.170
 take it presumably given 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.680
 burglaries are barry burglaries that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 will change 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.270
 and then alarm will change the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.910
 distribution of my life so because of 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.400
 his ally 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.810
 a burglary addiction and marie 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.250
 if we do not observe there 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.580
 burglaries and marie call go 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.510
 become independent so we will observe 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 if we remember the definition 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.530
 of independence conditionally too 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 if they are helped by the anp 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.140
 conditioning it means that the 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.470
 marry probability calls knowing 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.450
 alarm and burglaries will be reduced to 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.260
 the probability that mayor calls his 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.000
 luck only to the soul and so between 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220
 others his opinion to calculate his office that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.170
 means that we only need to 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.590
 this probability there because of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 independence and this probability there 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.660
 in fact it is given here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.150
 this missile table so we see 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.590
 how can it simplify calculations 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.030
 certain departures from certain 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.220
 conditional since we are able 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.080
 Basque also to tell my son I have not 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.820
 need it so I just need to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.210
 this probity I am given 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.150
 directly in my peaceful network and 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.740
 so we'll see why it's all true 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.870
 that with an example a derivation 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.430
 mathematics but basically this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
 what happens is that if she knew in 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.140
 does in our calculation if he is not going to 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.090
 intervene for the calculation of the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.320
 politics of knowing this here we will not have 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 no need for sites to 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.530
 do this calculation is maybe a way 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.660
 little more intuitive we can see that we 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.540
 can interpret this as the fact that 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.830
 can block the dependency path 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.530
 between m 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.989
 here so if we see that as if there 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.370
 had a kind of path here associated 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.650
 at the dependence between the two beautiful 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.650
 effect of seeing a blocked vote this way 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.200
 so let's do the math to make sure 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.420
 this is the case that marie is 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.670
 independent burglaries sacha alam 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.950
 so let's do this calculation is here and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.310
 let's see if we can actually do 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.739
 not need the value of 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.690
 robberies which he defined by 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.270
 definition this conditional part 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.250
 it's just the joint parity of marie to 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.530
 the burglaries soul you know by the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.430
 marginal probability of 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.410
 alarm and burglaries now by 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.919
 definition or forgiveness by calculation of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.620
 marginal probabilities and using the 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.270
 I do not need people 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.050
 call to calculate the probability 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.360
 marginal so I can just ignore 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.010
 this variable because his descendants 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.340
 are not part of the variables observed 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.650
 I have that marginal politics here it's 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.720
 equal to this marginal probability 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.100
 the man and I have to marginalized on the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.770
 value of 6 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.830
 and then by the same reasoning I can 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.050
 write the probity of a marginal mourning 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.240
 of its constituents marginal probity 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.960
 to raise and s but where I have to summit 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.860
 on all possible values ​​of s 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.080
 now i replace mme enjoy 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.760
 marginalized by the product of 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.160
 conditional probabilities extracted 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.979
 of probability metal so I would have 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.620
 took advantage of m knowing about the probability of 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.639
 rising buy it's actually the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.740
 parents of these earthquake burglaries times 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.160
 the politi a priori of s times the 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.150
 a priori probability of burglaries and 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.100
 in the same way here 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.030
 I get the product of policies 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.760
 conditional like that because that's that 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.680
 I notice that in the products of 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.470
 numerator here inside the sum 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.300
 I have terms that actually do not depend 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.900
 not at all 2 is too much that I have this 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.729
 term there here the probability of marry 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.830
 calls sacha the soul who do not depend 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.410
 so I can take him out of the room 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.370
 job go out it's also but we'll see 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.970
 for the disclosure of these steps 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.500
 necessary 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.810
 so that's what I did here I 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:02.450
 pulled out pdm bent on the sum so 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.780
 I pdm this each time the sum here / 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.229
 s 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.710
 and now we notice here here I have 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.570
 exactly in fact the same term and so 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.940
 they can console themselves I have the same 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.810
 factor that is a sum on ace at 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.169
 numerator and the denominator and so 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.960
 i'm really waiting for p2m sacha to 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.440
 it's just m 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.440
 sacha 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.070
 and actually the reason I 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.960
 could make this reduction there it's 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:39.180
 that actually in the calculation and 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.910
 marginal producer in the numerator to my 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.550
 allowed to split my probity to a 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.610
 part that was m sacha then another 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.990
 part here that involved implied implied 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.310
 never m 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.950
 sorry so in fact it allowed me to 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.200
 simplify in two parts a part where 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.250
 I had variables that did not depend 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.440
 no other part where 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.340
 interact and so does it thanks to 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.130
 the observation of 1 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.290
 I could it is paris m of all 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.780
 factors that could involve 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.800
 is what made me come out of 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.130
 my sister ok so that's the reason 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.870
 mathematics 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.870
 if you want who can I go out 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.880
 mpm his charge thanks to them i'm in 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.390
 finally measure to separate m 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.250
 of the rest of the calculation that involves this is 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.320
 more than a few that implies it's good 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.420
 here he is at this camp it's bound 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.290
 with what we find at the denominator 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:46.890
 long thanks to that I can reduce pdm 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:49.080
 sacha here by pdm knowing cardon 

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:52.080
 second example of independence can 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.140
 to be modeled putting between two 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.220
 children given the godfather so I 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.890
 one by one 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.290
 I have outbuildings with two children 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:04.500
 but I find that his two children there 

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:07.980
 are going to be independent if the parent is 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.070
 observed so we have the example of 

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.530
 of invasion three variables 3 us in a 

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.510
 network beziers here I have the alarm 

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.120
 who has two children I call it started 

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.700
 barely people call me and marry 

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.440
 call here are going to be addicted to 

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.150
 priori it is something that we can 

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.800
 demonstrate but as we will see if 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:31.170
 I observe the parent who has the soul 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.270
 well they will become independent 

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.460
 that is to say that the calculation for example 

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.190
 of the probity of husband sacha alarm and 

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.740
 I'm going to be reduced to calculating 

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.750
 the politi de marie calls knowing 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.730
 only to what is given to me yet 

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.890
 once by my table to enjoy here 

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:50.310
 so it simplifies the calculation of a 

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:53.190
 conditional that involved before I 

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:56.850
 calls for a probability calculation that 

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.560
 is that I call so marie calls 

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.070
 were the places on appeal sacha to 

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.770
 the soul and did it again but if 

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.840
 we see dependence as existence 

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.480
 of a path in these two variables or one 

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.070
 could say that alarm is blocking the 

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.410
 path of dependence between people 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:19.110
 call and marry call reason the 

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.450
 mathematical derivation of this example 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.800
 there then again did not speak was 

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.340
 conditional is the probability 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.570
 marginal that involves what got me 

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.130
 green query variable for 

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.620
 which I want someone to enjoy 

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:34.110
 given what is observed so 

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.520
 so it's because if the producti 

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.230
 marginal but ras holy land and that 

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.240
 all these variables to divide by the 

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:43.230
 marginal probity only of the variables 

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:46.770
 on which one still conditions a 

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.420
 times I can reduce the calculation I can 

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.950
 rewrite the calculation is marginal like 

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:54.630
 a summation on probabilities that 

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:57.030
 involves more variables the variables 

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.560
 that I can not eliminated in that if 

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.620
 in fact it turns out I have to summit 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.420
 on s is sure it is so on earthquake and 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:08.700
 burglaries because in that six 

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:11.640
 burglaries as descendants 

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.440
 some of the variables that are 

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.680
 involved in my calculation the variables 

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.600
 who was observing same thing for 6 

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.850
 so I have to sum explicitly on the 

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.510
 value and by the same reasoning 

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.120
 I get 

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.790
 this calculation for marginal probity on 

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:31.080
 alarm and jean-paul only at 

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:33.690
 denominator then of that I can 

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.820
 rewrite his acolytes is marginal the 

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.670
 com or spouses as a product of 

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.910
 conditional the conditional ones defined 

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:44.190
 in my bezier network so i have 

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.170
 expects the probability of jan aps h at the 

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.050
 mpt times the mayor's probity call that 

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:51.320
 it's not his by adam and coming the 

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:56.250
 probability actually here rather than 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:58.350
 describe this part locality of calabria 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.960
 sacha earthquake and burglaries times the 

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:03.060
 practice messi tweet just to keep the 

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.440
 marginal in full since as we go 

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:10.020
 see your disappears so this kit has 

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.080
 observed here is that among others I 

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.760
 can take this probability of the 

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.150
 probity of marriage calls it challenge and 

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:22.320
 put it in front of the sum since 

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:24.150
 it does not involve values ​​are not 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.280
 involved are constant in relation to 

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.910
 the summation on the different values 

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:33.210
 of earthquakes and burglaries and so 

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:35.820
 i actually get to enjoy marie 

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.250
 call sacha alam once everything was 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.260
 here sow on the test of other terms 

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.820
 that I did not go out because I could have 

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.410
 come out end here too 

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.270
 but it's not important for the 

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.280
 derivation actually from this 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.930
 level what I observe is that I 

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.750
 when it is related to the numerator and 

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:55.170
 denominator the factors that corresponds 

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:58.140
 at the sums sure is sure so this is 

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.810
 once again I get the probity of 

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:04.080
 husband sacha alarm only so I have 

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:09.240
 managed to not use the value of 

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.500
 game barely ok and again what 

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.030
 did not allow me to do that that's 

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.570
 precisely the fact that by observing 

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:16.230
 alarm 

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:18.060
 the probability sure I call and on 

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.010
 marie calls breaks down into two 

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.160
 different factors so that I have 

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.290
 could detach them and the part in this case 

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.649
 which depends on both 

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:32.670
 I call your actually when is read by 

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:38.279
 the calculations that are made at the level of 

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:41.880
 denominator finally a third 

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:45.209
 example the relationship between two parents 

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.889
 given their children and we 

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:50.029
 also builds that we have a single child 

00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:53.759
 in two a year so we have a relationship 

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:54.899
 like that so here it's going to be a little 

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:56.730
 different 

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:59.819
 both parents will be independent 

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.980
 but if the child and not observed ok so 

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:03.509
 if the child is observed they are going to be 

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.259
 dependent but if the child is not 

00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:09.630
 observed the both parents will become 

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:14.160
 independent is an example of a 

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:15.959
 relationship of this style here here between so 

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.940
 the three random variables the three 

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:20.670
 void who here then actually in 

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:25.589
 this example the burglary and earthquake has 

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:27.180
 priori they are independent to do one 

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:29.370
 saw that if we want to calculate the 

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.740
 marginal probability gives some 

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.870
 variables we can ignore all dummies 

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.430
 whose descendants are not part of 

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.839
 variables in question variables 

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:39.300
 observed so if that would mean too 

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:43.199
 that I could if I wanted to calculate the 

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:46.440
 probability of burglaries and earthquake I 

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:47.760
 could united would have all these 

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.470
 variables also since their 

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.300
 descendants by this compromise in Cambrai 

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:56.910
 agenais 6 and then good if I break down 

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.220
 profile t marginal the aa 

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.380
 the product of the extreme policies of 

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.990
 Belgian tables is actually the 

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.910
 probability of these times the probability 

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.310
 why because it's up to the boxes 

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.370
 per year then s not opposing so 

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:14.519
 actually the probability of between 

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:17.130
 and it's between burglaries and earthquake 

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:19.649
 breaks down into a product that is not 

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.600
 it's just right 

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:23.959
 just cambria just two sites so 

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.000
 that a priori are indeed dependent 

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:31.410
 however they will become addicted if 

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.949
 I observe alarm and that means it means 

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:37.139
 that the probability of burglaries sacha 

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.620
 alarm and earthquake is not simple and 

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:40.540
 reliable it is not possible for 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.970
 if I watch to the soul of Thursday will say I have 

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.530
 no need for the value of earthquakes and that 

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.590
 as we will see it is due to the fact that 

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.630
 the probability of alarming his luck and and 

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.390
 she knowing burglaries and 6 she 

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.890
 is not simplified and because we're going 

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.660
 having to introduce ended in our 

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:59.260
 calculations and that it is not possible to 

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.910
 separate the contribution of c is from s 

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.470
 wants to get that they are now linked 

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.390
 together they are now dependent 

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.720
 in the calculation of the productivity 

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:10.360
 burglaries knowing alarmed earthquake so 

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.010
 in this case if we see that as 

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.330
 pathways of dependence between 

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.760
 variables that we will try to block 

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.570
 but in fact in this case also the fact 

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:22.420
 not to know alarm 

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:25.770
 that's what will block the path between 

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.770
 burglaries and site 

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.960
 so if we see exactly 

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.930
 specifically in mathematics 

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:38.140
 why are we addicted 

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.850
 if we look at the soul well again a 

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:44.560
 times a conditional policy that 

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:48.190
 is a marginal probability ratio and 

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.420
 so the probability of self here is fine 

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.160
 to be the probability of rising knowing and 

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.570
 this is the probability of s 

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.100
 that's it for the t2 so 

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.680
 actually it's marginal profit there 

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:59.020
 to calculate it I can ignore the 

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.030
 children here they die explains business 

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.770
 the product of the conditionals in question 

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.270
 to know how to enjoy the alarms his hunt 

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:07.030
 and sometimes the politics of 

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.860
 burglaries knowing his godfather there 

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.410
 has no parents so it's just the 

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.600
 death same thing for pes and there we 

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.660
 note here this term the seals man 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.760
 set s etc and it's not possible 

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.380
 so that's the term there is not the 

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.880
 gambling product on a term that depends 

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.980
 of these just a term that depends on 

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.300
 so it's because of it will never 

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.760
 possible to separate them 

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.440
 then two 

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.940
 to eliminate the part that just exceeds 

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.520
 of these to get a part that is 

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.470
 not just vice versa so that's 

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.240
 because of them specifically sounds the 

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.310
 mathematics does that we have a 

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.520
 dependence between both parents 

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:44.540
 burglary and earthquake and give them 

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.540
 child with a blade
