ELMIRA BAYRASLI: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.060
It's so good to
be here at Google.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.494
My name is Elmira Bayrasli.

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:10.660
I'm here to talk about my
book, "From the Other Side

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.020
of the World, Extraordinary
Entrepreneurs, Unlikely

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.540
Places."

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.220
It's a book that profiles
seven entrepreneurs

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.670
from seven different
countries overcoming

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490
seven different obstacles.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.690
And the journey that
actually took me there

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.320
is one that actually did not
start from entrepreneurship.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.670
It started from a place
where I have been passionate

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.850
about foreign policy.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.270
And that passion
for foreign policy

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.420
very much comes along with
my own personal story.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.060
My parents are
immigrants from Turkey.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.020
They immigrated
from Turkey to here,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.710
to New York City,
where I grew up,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.680
just across the bridge
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.910
And as, I think, just both being
here in New York City, but then

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.870
also being the
child of immigrants,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.022
you're very much made aware
of the rest of the world.

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:03.980
Always constantly questions
about where are you

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.560
from, and making
trips to Turkey,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.190
and really
understanding that there

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.510
was a world beyond New York City
and beyond the United States.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.470
And I think that curiosity
took me on a journey

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100
where I was very interested
in international relations

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.670
and trying to understand, well,
what were all the problems that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.550
were happening in places like
Turkey, which for a long time

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.070
really suffered from a lot
of economic backwardness.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.910
I remember going
on trips to Turkey

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.230
as a child where there
were no telephones.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.250
Television would
come on at 8:00 PM

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.520
at night, which I thought
was completely bizarre.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.280
There was very bad
infrastructure.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.480
Roads were a lot of dirt roads.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.430
They were single lane roads.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.765
And all of these things
really stood out in my mind.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:52.140
And so from the
earliest of ages,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.370
I thought, well, how do you
make countries like Turkey

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.270
become like the United States?

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.720
And so that question right there
itself put me on this journey

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.950
where I went and I
studied political science.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.050
I went to NYU where I got a
degree in political science.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.479
Then I did a graduate
degree at Columbia,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.910
where I focused in on
specifically the Middle East.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.690
And I ended up working
at the State Department.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.890
At the time that I graduated
from both NYU and Columbia,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.290
the State Department was
really the only opportunity

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.330
that you had to actually,
really work internationally.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.510
Globalization was just
getting off the ground.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.430
There was certainly no internet.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.110
Multinational companies
had not been multinational.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020
Certainly you could
find Coca-Cola

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.070
in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, and the Middle East.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.330
But there wasn't this phenomenon
where companies were actually

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.700
doing business in
different places.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.950
And so I took my degrees and I
went to the State Department,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.520
where I actually got
to work on the issues

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.450
that I thought really were
going to change the world.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.790
And we hear this word
a lot, especially

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.120
in the startup space,
about changing the world.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.100
And I believed that
that could actually only

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.840
happen through government,
through working at the State

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.660
Department.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.330
And I got to work on things like
Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.560
And it was a really
eye opening experience

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.520
being on the front lines,
and working on those issues,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.730
and developing the policies that
were affecting these places.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.120
And I was so excited about
doing that that I actually

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.280
decided in 2002 to pick
up and move to Sarajevo,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.540
where I got to actually
work on the issues

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.350
that I was working
on in Washington, DC.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.500
I got a position working at
the Organization for Security

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.370
and Cooperation in Europe
, which is the largest

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.340
international body with
working in Bosnia-Herzegovina,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.290
working on post-conflict
rehabilitation.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.280
So the OSCE was working on
things like property return,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.430
and rebuilding the
education system,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.770
and working on civil
society development.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.447
And that was just-- I
thought, this was it.

00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:04.780
I was on the front lines, and
this is exactly the things

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.100
that I wanted to do.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.650
Except when I went out
and I talked to people

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.770
throughout the
country in Bosnia,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.480
people always came back
and told me the same thing.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.230
The one thing that they would
remark is, we need jobs.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.830
How can you help us create jobs?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.780
And you hear this
question a lot.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.340
And it's certainly something
that wasn't unfamiliar to me,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.170
having been here in
the United States.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.000
I think we hear about jobs
in political elections a lot.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.880
It's certainly something
that matters to all of us.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.610
But this question
of job creation

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.200
and how it matters to
development and countries

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.360
like Bosnia, and
really to the world,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.050
really hit home when I actually
went out to Eastern Bosnia

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.820
and I came across an older
woman who really, like literally

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.200
berated me.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.430
And we were doing a civil
society development project.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.710
And she said to me,
you know, civil society

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.270
and these concepts of democracy
and human rights that you talk

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.880
to us about, that's
easy for you to talk

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.630
about coming from America.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.680
She said, but you don't realize
that our fathers, our husbands,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.790
our sons, our daughters
actually have to leave Bosnia

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.200
in order to have a job, in
order to earn some money.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.130
They're leaving.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.050
And when they leave,
we can't actually

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.040
repair anything that
has happened here.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.200
So can you think about how
can you help us create jobs?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.391
And that really spoke to me.

00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:40.390
And I thought, well, OK.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.380
Well, how do you create jobs?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.950
I had no idea.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.220
I hadn't thought
about business at all.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.547
The internet had just-- it
had exploded in popularity.

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:52.380
And I thought, OK, well
certainly technology

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.916
has to be a part of this.

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:56.290
And so I embarked
on this journey

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.340
to find out how do
you create jobs.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.400
Now, I think when everybody
thinks about creating jobs,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.730
they think about
starting a business.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.250
And this word entre-- I
had heard about this word

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.010
entrepreneurship.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.960
And entrepreneurship has
certainly become popular.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.420
In fact, I actually think
it's become this big trend

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.050
that everybody has romanticized.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.560
And I had just assumed that
if you were an entrepreneur,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.870
you were small business.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.650
And I thought, OK, well, let's
figure out how to do this.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.610
I came back to the United States
and I started on this journey

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.900
about how am I going to
learn about doing this?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.330
And I started working at
a nonprofit organization

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.780
headquartered here in
New York City that works

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.367
with entrepreneurs globally.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.200
And one of the countries
that they work with

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.340
is Turkey, which is a country
that I know quite well.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.040
And I started working
at this organization,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.300
helping them with their
media and communications,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.300
with their writing, which is
something that I excel at,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.680
so I wrote a book.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.730
But I hadn't known anything
about entrepreneurship

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.010
and what it really was.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.130
To me, entrepreneurship
was you set up

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.010
a business, you raise some
money, and that was about it.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.220
That's kind of what encapsulated
what entrepreneurship is.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.230
My aha moment, and one
of the first lessons

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.230
that I want to share
with you-- so I

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.030
want to share with you four
takeaways from my experience

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.190
of writing this book.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.830
My aha moment came when I
actually went to Turkey.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.300
And I had gone to Turkey, and
I went out to Eastern Turkey

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.630
to a city named Kars, which
is on the border of Turkey

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.050
and Armenia.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.680
And I went out to Kars after
reading Orhan Pamuk's book,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.271
"Snow."

00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.820
Orhan Pamuk is a Nobel
laureate, and he wrote this book

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.410
"Snow" that's set in Kars.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.570
Set in the 20th century.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.530
It's a love story.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.770
I highly recommend it.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.350
But in the book, he talks
about how backwards Kars is.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.240
And he talks about
the dirt roads

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.270
that I remember as a child.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.000
And he talks about
a wood block press

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.960
that the local newspaper
in Kars was using up

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.280
until about early 2000.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.110
And I had an opportunity
to actually talk

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.000
to Pamuk about this.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.880
And I thought, as a writer,
the way that you describe this

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.892
and you use that detail
of this newspaper press,

00:08:22.892 --> 00:08:24.850
it was so brilliant that
you put that in there,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.558
because it really gave
you a sense of how

00:08:26.558 --> 00:08:28.860
backward this place is
when the rest of Turkey

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.360
has become so commercialized.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.520
It's become so advanced.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.210
Turkey has become a member
of the most powerful

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.679
global economies in the world.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.010
And he said, I didn't
actually make that up.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.890
That's actually true.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.000
You should actually go
see it so I decided,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.800
OK, I'm going to go
out to Kars and I'm

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.270
going to go see this
wood block press.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.860
So I go out to Kars.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.140
I arrive in the second
closest city to Kars,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.550
because there were no
direct flights at the time.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.610
And it's about a two hour
drive from Erzurum to Kars.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.260
So I don't arrive in Kars
until about midnight.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.850
I speak Turkish, and if
anybody knows anything

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.420
about Turkish culture, it's
a very conservative culture

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.030
where men and women are, for
the most part, segregated.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.220
There are certain notions
about a woman's place

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.630
and what is proper.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.350
And so for me to show
up as a Turkish woman

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.810
at this hotel, which is a
dilapidated hotel-- paint

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.840
was peeling.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.620
There were a bunch
of moustached men

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.090
sitting in the lobby
smoking their Marlboros.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.030
And there's this silence when
I walk in and I ask for a room.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.560
Because what would a
proper Turkish girl

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.660
be doing arriving
in Kars at midnight?

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.060
What possibly could she want?

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.450
And so the hotel clerk
was actually very curious

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.720
about what I was doing there.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.930
And I just kind of
dodged his question.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:00.590
I got the key to my
room and I went up

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.540
and settled into my room.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.290
But of course, I couldn't sleep.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.515
And I decided, OK,
I'm going to log

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:08.390
what I'm writing, because
this is going to be

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.030
my big literary adventure.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.610
I'm going to go on the
treck of Orhan Pamuk,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.490
and I'm going to
record what I'm doing.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.930
And I pop open my laptop
and I start writing.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.480
And then all of a sudden, a
thing comes up on my computer

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.610
and says, choose the Wi-Fi
network of your choice.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.120
And I thought, Wi-Fi?

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.215
How in the world does
this place have Wi-Fi?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.260
It's such a-- I just
didn't expect it.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.610
It was such a-- it was
in the middle of nowhere

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.500
and so I hadn't expected it.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.010
And I was so excited
that I wanted to run down

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:48.640
and say, like to talk
to the front desk clerk.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.060
So I ran out into the hall
and I looked at the Wi-Fi.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.050
and i noticed that it was made
by a company called AirTies.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.400
AirTies is a wireless
router company

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.140
that also makes
wireless routers,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.890
but it also makes set-top boxes.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.090
And the founder is a
Turkish entrepreneur

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.160
who spent most of his
most of his career

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.990
actually in Silicon
Valley working

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:20.350
on microchips and hardware
for wireless communication.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.762
And I was so excited about this.

00:11:21.762 --> 00:11:23.220
So the next morning
I go back down,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.180
and the desk clerk,
again, he's very curious.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.430
He's pressing me, and
he's talking to me

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.799
like, what are you doing here?

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.340
And what are you
trying to find here?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.756
And I said, you know, actually,
I have a question for you.

00:11:32.756 --> 00:11:35.790
I'm really impressed
that you have Wi-Fi.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.280
And he looked at me, and
all of this curiosity

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.870
turned into such enthusiasm.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.970
And he said to me, oh, my god.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.667
He said, do you know that
the Wi-Fi is made by a Turk?

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:48.750
And I thought, oh, my god.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.030
How did he know that a Turk
is behind this company?

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.900
And I was taken aback.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.510
And he started talking about
Bulent, and Bulent's story.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.620
He said, yes.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.440
He said, it's AirTies.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.680
And apparently, he
said to me, this man

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.340
was living in the United States.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.260
He had immigrated from
Turkey to Silicon Valley.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.720
He said, he came back to
Turkey to create this company.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.080
He said, can you
bill believe that?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.420
And I thought to myself, I
hadn't really thought about it.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.610
And what I told him
is I can't believe

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.930
that you're telling me this.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.880
And he said, you know, he
said, our country is changing.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.550
He said, I can't believe that
this man would come back here

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.130
to start this company.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.070
He said, I think I'm going
to go and study engineering.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.100
And I'm going to think about
starting a company here.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.260
To me, that was my
aha moment where

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.290
I realized this is what
entrepreneurship is about

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.440
and what people are
getting excited about.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.550
Because I grew up
going to a Turkey

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.490
where everybody wanted to leave.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.670
Everybody either
wanted to go to Europe

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.620
or everybody wanted to come
here to the United States.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.280
And you know why they wanted to?

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.240
Because there were no jobs.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.250
My parents came to
the United States

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.140
because they needed jobs.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.650
And my father came here to
actually be an entrepreneur.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.636
And here was a young
person in the eastern part

00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:17.010
of the country
where there aren't

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.960
a lot of job opportunities, but
he was excited at the prospect

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.240
that he could
actually create them.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.820
And I thought, well, here is
why everybody's getting excited

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.000
about entrepreneurship,
because it allows

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.170
people to gain control
of their own income

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.460
and their own future.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.240
So I thought, OK.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.060
Well, here is what
the answer is.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.415
And so I set about my
journey to find out, well,

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:39.670
what is happening
around the world,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.730
and how are
entrepreneurs doing it?

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.630
Because when you think
about entrepreneurship here

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.050
in the United States, you
automatically think of Google.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.970
You think of the technologies
that have come out

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.180
of Silicon Valley.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.610
You think of the icons, not only
of Larry Page and Sergey Brin,

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.030
but you think about Steve Jobs.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.680
You think about Mark Zuckerberg
and you think about Facebook.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.120
And you think about all these
big technology companies.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.410
When you say the word
entrepreneurship,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.410
whether it's in a
place like Turkey

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.040
or whether it's in Africa,
Asia, or Latin America,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.860
entrepreneurship on
a different notion.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.990
It takes on this notion
that people are just

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.690
doing something small.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.570
I think microfinance
has become very

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.490
associated with entrepreneurship
outside of America.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.211
And it's this sense
that if you're

00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:28.710
outside of the
United States, you're

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.990
only doing something micro.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.920
You're starting a business,
and that's really about it.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.440
There's no talk of innovation.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.400
There's no talk of
venture capital.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.760
There's no talk of
this word scale.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.050
And there's certainly no
talk of this word unicorn

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.340
or technology.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.600
And I thought, well certainly,
Bulent saw something in Turkey

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.910
when no one else did.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.710
He started his company in 2004.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.780
And you have to
remember, technology

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.800
has really expanded
in the decade

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.610
since Bulent
started his company.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.040
And when you talk
about technology

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.460
in a place like Turkey
today, it's not so unusual.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.730
But in 2004 it was.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.480
Turkey had not really become
the economic power it had.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.710
And so why did he
take that risk?

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.470
Why did he recognize
that he could actually

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.320
build a scalable
company that has

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.732
received a considerable
amount of investment?

00:15:19.732 --> 00:15:21.190
So I decided to go
around the world

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.050
and really understand what has
been holding entrepreneurs back

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.120
everywhere else in the world.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.630
And what I came
across is this concept

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.580
that obstacles are really key.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.230
So we talk about talent and
we talk about innovation,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.800
but that's not something
that we in the United States

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.731
have a monopoly on.

00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:44.480
I actually have to
say, I think that there

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.300
are talented and innovative
people all around the world.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.340
But what's been holding them
back has been obstacles.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.980
Now, every entrepreneur
faces obstacles

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.900
in starting his or her business.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.870
But the seven that I actually
focus in on in my book

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.020
are ones that I found to be
true throughout every single one

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.680
of these countries.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.300
And ones that certainly
are starting to pop up here

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.840
in the United States.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.370
So I look at the
lack of talent, where

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.940
there's a lack of skill talent,
lack of managerial talent.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.552
I look at poor infrastructure.

00:16:19.552 --> 00:16:22.010
That's certainly something that
has held a lot of countries

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.870
back, where the
electricity doesn't work

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.880
and the roads are bad.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.730
I take a look at the lack of
collaborative space, which was

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.220
an interesting insight for me.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.030
And I'll talk a little bit
about that in just a bit.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.200
I also take a look at
the role and effect

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.890
that monopolies
and big businesses

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.140
have had on the
ability for people,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.090
whether it be in
Mexico or Nigeria,

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.510
to be able to start businesses.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.400
Established businesses
preventing others

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.080
from actually scaling up.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.430
I take a look at
corruption and the effects

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.270
that corruption have on
the ability of people

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.610
to start and scale
their businesses.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.430
I take a look at
the rule of law.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.890
And we actually don't really
consider the law and regulation

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.790
and the justice system
as being a key component

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.920
of entrepreneurship,
but it really is.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.310
And the last thing I look at
is the status quo, and how

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.334
the status quo is actually
really a huge obstacle, not

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.000
only around the world,
but it's actually

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.069
becoming a really big obstacle
here in the United States.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.170
And so I look at
these obstacles,

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.690
and certainly, my obstacle
of poor infrastructure,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.410
I think, it was where
do I start with that?

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.920
And where I actually did start
with that is I went to Nigeria.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.230
And here was the interesting
thing that I came across.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.430
I went to Nigeria where I think
Africans have long struggled

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.970
with poor infrastructure,
whether it be corroded bridges

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:50.532
and poor portways, bad roads.

00:17:50.532 --> 00:17:52.740
And I thought, well, here
is one of the things that's

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.380
really holding Africans back,
and particularly in Nigeria.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.771
So I went around in Nigeria and
I talked to a lot of people.

00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:03.270
And one entrepreneur
that I actually

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.340
came across, Tayo Oviosu.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.330
He runs a company called Paga.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.790
Paga is a mobile
payment company.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.400
And I was talking to Tayo
about how do you overcome

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.910
this problem of infrastructure.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.070
It's really one of the
challenges, don't you think,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.870
that's holding Nigeria back,
it's holding Africa back.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.660
And Tayo being the gentleman
that he is, he nodded to me.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.170
And I kind of understood
from his nod, it's just like,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.670
oh, here's this
white girl in Africa

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.380
and she thinks she actually
knows what our problems are.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.730
And what I didn't realize
is that I didn't really

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.590
understand what the
problems in Nigeria were.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.320
So poor infrastructure
is certainly

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.480
something that's
held Nigerians back.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.980
But it was only spending
time with Tayo--

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.030
and here is my second
point, my second aha moment.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:03.470
My second revelation is
that what you might think

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.400
is a problem might
only be a symptom.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.040
And entrepreneurs, the
really successful ones,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.754
aren't the ones that actually
go after the symptom.

00:19:13.754 --> 00:19:15.920
They're the ones who are
actually digging down deep,

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.690
really understanding what the
challenges in their communities

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.870
are and solving
that true problem.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.250
And I realized this when I
actually went with Tayo around

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.190
to understand how his
company Paga works.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.040
Everybody's excited
about digital payments

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.231
around the world, mobile money.

00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:37.730
The mobile phone, in particular,
when you talk about Africa,

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.396
everybody is excited
about the potential

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:42.510
that the mobile phone has
to help Africans leapfrog.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.800
Because they had bypassed
the Industrial Revolution,

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.370
but to actually leapfrog
and build their economies

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.350
and really become part of
this globalized 21st digital

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.600
economy.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.330
And for the most
part, mobile money

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.490
has helped Africans and
Nigerians a tremendous amount.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.670
One of the challenges
that you have in Nigeria

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.700
is that a majority of people
don't have access to banks.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.860
And so this concept of people
holding onto money where

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.690
there's-- you have the
cliche of, I store my money

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.640
in my mattress.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.680
That happens to actually be
true for most people in Nigeria.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.450
They don't have access to banks.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.100
The number of banks,
particularly in rural areas,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.210
is very, very low.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.790
So people are literally
holding onto hordes of cash.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.290
They either have it at home or
they have it on their person.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.700
And what happens in a
situation where you're actually

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.520
holding onto this
money is that you're

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.230
creating a tremendous
amount of insecurity.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.590
But what I also
realized is that when

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.880
you're holding onto
a lot of this cash

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.820
is that you're actually not--
cash becomes transactional.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.160
And you're not using money
as an asset to be invested.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.980
So people either want to
have it or get rid of it.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.580
They don't want to hold onto
it and go back into the society

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.700
where it's actually
going into things

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.190
like the development of
roads, or the improvement

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.971
of electricity, and the
cleaning up of the streets.

00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:16.480
Now, certainly
there's other factors

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.460
involved in trying to have
those things move forward.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.890
But what Tayo
actually tapped into,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.330
which a lot of other people
across Africa have tapped into,

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.720
the key for mobile money,
is that the problem

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.270
in a place like Nigeria
is when people are holding

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.650
onto that money and money
is not building as an asset,

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.670
and it's not being
leveraged, it's

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.230
creating the problem
of poor infrastructure.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.680
So the real problem
in Nigeria is a lack

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.930
of a financial infrastructure.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.680
This lack of a
financial framework

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.340
where actually people could
store their money safely, take

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.820
it out, and for it to build.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.960
So that people can save,
and they can invest,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.220
and they can do all
of these things.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.060
And I realized that, not
only in talking to Tayo,

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.980
but seeing how this mobile
money payment system works.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.600
And the way it works
is I can send you

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.310
a payment, phone to phone, and
we have those services here

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.940
in the United States.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.240
But here in the
United States, it's

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.080
just an electronic transaction.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.740
So it goes from me to
you, and then you to me,

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.320
or I can pay my Uber, or
I can pay for my lunch.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.310
And that's it.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.230
In a place like
Nigeria, there's still

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.394
the problem of cashing
in and cashing out,

00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:35.810
because you still
have to remember

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.070
there's this lack of banks.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.780
And so they have all of these
agents around in the country.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.320
There's thousands of
agents that Paga uses.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.670
People who run storefront shops.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.200
People who are
selling newspapers.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.060
People who are selling t-shirts.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.110
People who are
selling groceries.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.460
And these people act as
cash in and cash out points.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.940
And what I actually realized
is that these individuals

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.100
are starting to
actually create what

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.720
would have been bank branches
and an infrastructure

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.340
to allow people to
actually store their money

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.950
and keep it safe.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.960
And they're helping
to solve this problem

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.190
of a lack of a financial
infrastructure in very

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.510
incremental ways.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.150
I think there are a lot of still
challenges with mobile money,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.750
where it still doesn't allow
people for the opportunity

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.970
to take out loans and to
create an insurance system.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.050
And there's still other
elements of financing

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.720
that people haven't really
considered that banks do

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.650
and a financial system does.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.360
But really spending
time with Tayo

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.330
made me realize that
entrepreneurs are not

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.110
individuals who are simply
setting up a business

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.130
to get money.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.180
They're actually
solving a core problem

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.390
and addressing an
issue that's changing

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.620
the socioeconomic landscape
in their countries.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.310
They're making it
possible for people

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:58.200
to move into either the middle
class or move forward further.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.400
And that is kind of what
the big differentiator

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.410
of an entrepreneur is from
a small business owner

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.730
or somebody who opens up just
a diner or a mom and pop shop.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.890
So I take this knowledge
and I'm excited.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.910
I'm like, OK, so now I
kind of really get this.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.100
So entrepreneur is
not a small business.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.150
They're solving problems.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.060
They're moving the
needle forward.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.810
And so I go to India.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.890
And I go to India and I
come across an entrepreneur

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.410
named Shaffi Mather.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.160
Shaffi Mather started a
for-profit ambulance company

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.920
in Mumbai.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.390
And I thought,
well, I really want

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.320
to talk to this guy Shaffi,
because who in the world

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.320
would start a for-profit
ambulance in Mumbai.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.610
That just sounds like
there's a good story there.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.549
And there is, because
Shaffi started this company

00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:49.340
not because he was a
doctor, not because he

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.280
was working as a paramedic.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.960
He actually had no background
in health care whatsoever.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.430
His mother, one night after
he and his family had dinner,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.000
started choking.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.730
And they all started to panic.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.260
They didn't know what to do.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.250
Nobody knew what the
Heimlich maneuver was.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.990
She was choking, she
was gasping for air.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.240
So what Shaffi did
was he did something

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.800
that I think any of us
here in this room would do.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.580
He picked up the phone to call
India's equivalent of 911.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.920
Except no one picked up
the phone on the other end.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.270
The phone kept
ringing and ringing.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.610
And after a few minutes,
which is actually

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.530
a considerable amount
of time when someone

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.740
is in a distressed situation,
as Shaffi's mother was,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.360
he hung up.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.000
And he decided, I'm
going to take my mother,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.625
I'm going to put her
in my car, and I'm

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:43.590
going to rush her
to the hospital.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:48.540
She was OK, but
that event really

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.730
shook Shaffi to the core.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.070
And he thought,
here I am-- Shaffi

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.130
was a management consultant
in one of the big consulting

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.430
firms in Mumbai.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.620
And he had studied business
here in the United States.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.850
He had gone to school in the UK.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.220
And he'd been interacting--
he travels globally, right?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.261
He's a management consultant,
so he's interacting

00:26:11.261 --> 00:26:12.580
with people around the world.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.170
And everywhere he
went, everybody

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.560
kept talking about how
India is the Asian tiger.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.790
India is one of the
most powerful economies

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.660
in the world.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.840
We have to pay attention
to what India is doing.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.550
India's needed.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.910
It's become one of
the go-to countries

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.500
that if you want to talk to the
big players around the world,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.632
you go and you talk to India.

00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.090
And he thought,
how can we actually

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.170
be this global power
that everybody's

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:39.907
talking about when we can't
even call for an ambulance?

00:26:39.907 --> 00:26:40.990
And he thought about this.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.260
And he consulted
with his friends.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.910
And they thought,
OK, why don't we

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.189
try to actually see
if we can repair this?

00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:50.230
He went and he talked to
people in the government

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.810
to see if they would
actually do something

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:54.360
about the ambulance service.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.890
And when they didn't,
Shaffi decided,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.700
you know what, everybody's
doing these social enterprises.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.479
People are talking
about entrepreneurship.

00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:03.020
I'm going to do
something about this.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.290
I'm going to solve this
problem of a lack of ambulance

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.177
and emergency care in India.

00:27:08.177 --> 00:27:09.760
I'm going to start
with Mumbai and I'm

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.500
going to see where it goes.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.800
So he takes a year off.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.790
He goes to London, and he spends
time with the London ambulance

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.180
service.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.950
He learns everything
there is to know

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:24.600
about emergency care, which is
a lot of it is about logistics.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.420
And he works with the
London ambulance service.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.090
And he manages to get
a number of ambulances

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.810
donated to him in Mumbai.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.900
He comes to New York and he has
meetings with various hospitals

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.400
here.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.540
And he gets people to
volunteer and he gets donations

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.660
from them.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.210
He goes back to Mumbai.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.950
He raises some
money to hire staff.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:50.910
And he puts all the
elements of what

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.450
he thinks this is going to solve
the problem in India-- he's

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.140
going to solve this one problem
of a lack of a functioning

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.250
emergency care service,
at least in Mumbai.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.092
So what's the last
part that he needs?

00:28:03.092 --> 00:28:05.990
He needs a phone number
that people can call.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.262
He can't have a number
like 911 because those

00:28:08.262 --> 00:28:09.220
are government numbers.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.870
And because he's going to
run a for-profit company,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:15.776
he needs a different
kind of a number.

00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:17.400
And they have special
numbers like that

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.420
for individuals in India.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.770
They're four digit numbers.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:26.164
He goes to register for this
number and he gets sent around.

00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:27.580
And he knew-- he
told me, he said,

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.260
I knew that this would happen.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.887
He said, I grew up in India and
there's a lot of bureaucracy.

00:28:32.887 --> 00:28:35.220
There's a lot of people telling
you to go to this office

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.640
and go to that office.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.360
He said, so I had expected this.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.840
But after three
months, it started

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.500
to become tiresome having
to go from office to office.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.720
Finally, he's told that if
he wants that special number

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.450
that's given to nonprofit
organizations, then

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.487
he needs to go to New Delhi.

00:28:55.487 --> 00:28:57.070
He needs to go to
the capital of India

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.400
and he has to register with the
Ministry of Telecommunications.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.270
So he goes off to
the capital of India.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.430
And he finally finds
the guy where he's

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.630
going to get the phone number.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:12.460
And the guy says, I
have great news for you.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.890
I'm going to give you a
really terrific phone number .

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.930
It's going to be one that
it's going to be easy

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.060
for you to reach people.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.010
People are easily going to
remember this phone number.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.070
So Shaffi says,
that's fantastic.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.750
This is all falling into place.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.350
This is all going to work.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.320
Everything is going
to move forward.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:36.350
And the bureaucrat says how
much is it worth to you?

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:41.080
He asked Shaffi for the
equivalent of 4,000 US dollars.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.010
Now, Shaffi wasn't
surprised, again,

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.110
that this bureaucrat was
asking for what Shaffi he told

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.950
me was chai pani.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.680
Chai pani is money for tea.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.430
And it's something
that a lot of people

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.080
in India, but particularly
bureaucrats, ask for.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.010
The concept, you know,
you give a couple

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.085
of rupees and your paperwork
moves along a little quicker.

00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.460
And it actually
dawned on me when

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.310
he was telling me the
story about chai pani,

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:11.830
that that word to
grease a palm, it

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.710
must emanate from this concept
of trying to actually move

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.257
things along a lot quicker.

00:30:16.257 --> 00:30:17.840
There's really nothing
sinister in it.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.900
I think we do that here
in the United States

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.880
where we pay extra money
for expedited services.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.590
What he was shocked by was
this exorbitant amount of money

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.540
that he was being asked for.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.980
And he certainly said,
sir, that's certainly

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.290
really unreasonable for
you to be asking that.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.290
And the bureaucrat said,
no, if you don't pay me

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.460
the equivalent of
4,000 US dollars,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.660
I'm not going to give
you the number you want.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.409
That was the aha
moment for Shaffi.

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:51.200
And when he was telling
me this, I actually

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.010
went back to what I remembered
about this problem in Nigeria

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.680
where if you're an
entrepreneur and you're only

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.410
focused on solving a
symptom, you're not really

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.940
addressing the problem.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.350
And Shaffi sat there and
he thought, oh, my god.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.560
What have I done?

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.980
I have done all of this work.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.330
I have raised all of this money.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:14.590
And I'm about to launch
this startup that

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.420
is supposed to address this
problem of emergency care

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.390
in India, when the
problem in India

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.410
is actually not
about emergency care

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.600
and the capabilities
of us doing this.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.770
The problem is trust.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.300
The problem in
India is that there

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.710
is this level of corruption.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.600
And that there is
this expectation

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.290
that bureaucrats
will ask people who

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.780
are coming to them, either
for a license or an approval

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.800
or a patent or whatever it is,
and that people will pay this.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.001
And people in India, they don't
believe in the public services.

00:31:48.001 --> 00:31:50.500
They don't believe that their
elected officials can actually

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.450
deliver on the promises
that they have made.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.120
Or fulfill just basic
services and needs,

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.960
such as ambulance
care, or whether it's

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.680
operating the trains
or the buses on time.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.500
And he though, that is actually
the problem here in India.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.780
And I'm addressing
the wrong issue.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.650
How do I build trust?

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:16.130
And so that was the third
takeaway, which is Shaffi's,

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.430
was this concept of trust.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.210
But this is the one
thing that entrepreneurs,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.890
really successful ones, do.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.680
And it's what
distinguishes them.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.830
They develop trust
within the community.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.690
And Shaffi thought,
well, how do I do that?

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.290
And as he was
talking about that,

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.810
he thought about
the great companies

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.960
in Silicon Valley, particular
companies like Google.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.000
And he thought,
what are they doing?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.500
They're reaching out to people,
they're listening to people.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.958
And they're connecting
with people.

00:32:46.958 --> 00:32:48.200
They're building community.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:53.530
How can I do that now, now
that I've started all this?

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.380
And at that moment,
Shaffi thought, OK, here

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.710
is what I'm going to do.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.790
Rather than actually focusing
in on this concept of emergency

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.510
care and the lack
of ambulances, I'm

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.300
going to go out and
tell this story.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.050
So he looks at the
bureaucrat and he says,

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.470
I will not pay you that $4,000.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.120
And the bureaucrat
says, OK, dude.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.400
No problem.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.450
Here's a number.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.220
I'm going to give
you the number 1298.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.000
Now, if you think
about it, 1298 is not

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.610
a very memorable combination.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.202
You know, it's not something
you would actually remember.

00:33:21.202 --> 00:33:23.410
Shaffi decided that he was
going to take that number,

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.970
and instead of actually going
out and promoting the fact

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:30.010
that he has this ambulance care
that will answer your emergency

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.525
phone number, he
was going to go out

00:33:31.525 --> 00:33:33.400
and he was going to tell
the story about what

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.900
happened to him in that office.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.210
And he was going to talk
to Indians about the fact

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:42.520
that the reason that we're
not able to actually move

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.150
public services forward
is not because we're not

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:45.950
capable of it.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.680
Because we lack so much trust.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.840
And we're going to
build this trust up.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.320
And that is how India is
going to fulfill his potential

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.350
as this great global power.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:01.900
He went out with that message
and it resonated with people.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.370
People started
using the service.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:11.530
More states in India requested
Shaffi and this company, 1298,

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.320
to actually come and roll
out ambulance services

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.489
in their state.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:20.290
1298 now operates in all
of the states within India.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:25.670
And it's actually exported its
model to places like Singapore

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.863
and to Dubai.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.050
And I thought, OK, well this
is a great example of here

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.250
are the lessons
for entrepreneurs.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.710
And so off I went, and I
thought OK, well, here I

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.989
am in India and looking
at this concept of trust.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.507
How do you build trust in
a country like Pakistan?

00:34:46.507 --> 00:34:48.340
In a country where
there's tremendous amount

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.960
of insecurity, and
when you turn on CNN,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.190
there are all
these horrible news

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.920
reports about how there
are these bombings.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.420
And then just this
morning there was

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:04.590
a gunman who killed people at a
university campus this morning.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.810
How do you actually build
trust in a situation like that?

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:13.470
How do you even start a company
in such an insecure place?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.830
And I went to Pakistan,
and I spent time

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.840
with a number of
tech entrepreneurs.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.520
And there's actually
quite considerable number

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.050
of technology-based
entrepreneurs

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.420
in Lahore and in Karachi.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.400
And I spent time
with Monis Rahman,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.370
who runs a company
called Naseeb Networks.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.160
Naseeb Networks has
two online platforms,

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.520
the one being a dating
website, because you know,

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.120
if you're an entrepreneur,
why not start a dating website

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.020
in Pakistan?

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.990
The other one is a jobs website.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.040
And the jobs website
was started as a result

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.820
of the success of the
dating website in Pakistan.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.010
Because people
want to find love.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.720
And when I spent time
with Monis and understand

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.180
how does his technology company
work, what I actually realized

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.530
is how you build trust in
a country like Pakistan,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.730
and how do you address
this issue of insecurity,

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.970
was one of many of the
aha moments I have.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.060
But the one that I'll
end on is this concept

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.490
of the importance of space.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.400
And what Monis talked
about was, he said,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.110
the problem in Pakistan is
that there is this perception

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.690
that there is only
one narrative.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.140
That it's all about insecurity.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:33.060
When insecurity and this problem
of terrorism and violence

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.190
in this country is
only about 5% of what

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.130
happens here in Pakistan.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.560
The rest of it doesn't
actually get translated.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.280
And I said, but then
how do you actually

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.827
get people to actually talk
about what is going on?

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.910
He said, well, that's one
of the reasons I started

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.470
the companies that I did.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.600
He said, I came
back to Pakistan--

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.850
he went back to Pakistan
from Silicon Valley.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.160
He was working at
Intel where he was

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.020
working on building microchips.

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.380
And he left that
job, much like Bulent

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.760
left Silicon Valley
to go back to Turkey,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.200
because he saw an opportunity
where the internet was

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.020
going to change things.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.400
Technology itself is not
the one big factor that

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.250
is helping people
start companies,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.590
but it's helping
change perceptions.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:18.030
And what he saw was one of
the challenges in Pakistan

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.870
was not only geographically
is the country divided,

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.450
because it's in
such rough terrain.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.570
So the country is divided into
these four different regions

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.910
and these four
different tribal groups.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:32.200
And to get from point A to
point B is very difficult.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.020
The country does suffer from
a lot of poor infrastructure,

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.030
but there is just
not a lot of people

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.010
being able to come
together to share ideas.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.870
There's also the
challenge in Pakistan

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:48.432
where men and women are
segregated a lot of the time.

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:50.640
There are very few forums
for people to actually come

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.670
together in Pakistan.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.324
And those few forums are
really-- they are for men.

00:37:55.324 --> 00:37:56.740
You have the
military where people

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.160
are able to come together.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.120
You have the cricket
field where people

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.290
are able to come
together for games.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.380
And then there's the university
campus, but not a lot of people

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.710
have access to
university campus.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.069
And so he thought,
well, here the internet,

00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:12.610
everybody is getting
on the internet.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.693
This is going to be the
one medium that's actually

00:38:14.693 --> 00:38:16.400
going to be able to
get all Pakistanis

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.090
on the same platform.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.790
So rather than wait for a lot
of these Silicon Valley-based

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.300
companies to come
to Pakistan, I'm

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.260
going to bring these forums
to Pakistan for Pakistanis.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.850
And what I actually
realized in him

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.060
doing that is he's
helping to actually change

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.450
the perceptions, not
only among Pakistan,

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:40.370
but the greater world,
about what Pakistan is.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.590
And as a result of
what Monis did in 2004,

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.350
and what has
happened since then,

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.720
is that he's been able to create
this entire community of people

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.960
who are coming together to
build platforms on the internet,

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.460
but also get people in Pakistan
excited about entrepreneurship.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.670
Space continues
to be a challenge

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.770
for countries like Pakistan.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.780
And certainly, that's something
that needs to be addressed,

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.630
because you can't
just build companies

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.390
and interact with each
other just on the internet.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.664
I think here, being in
this building itself,

00:39:19.664 --> 00:39:21.330
I think you see the
importance of people

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:26.280
being able to come together to
interact and to share ideas.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:32.600
And that was one of those
big aha moments I had,

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.772
where I actually thought
insecurity was one

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:35.980
of these things holding back.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.282
It was actually the lack
of collaborative spaces.

00:39:38.282 --> 00:39:39.990
Because when you
actually think about it,

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.930
one of the things
that Monis said to me

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.750
is that, if you think
about it, Israel

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.630
has an insecurity problem too.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.730
But nobody would actually
say that Israel is not

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.291
an innovative place.

00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.540
And I thought he was right,
because Israel is actually

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.176
known as the startup nation.

00:39:54.176 --> 00:39:56.550
But in Israel, people are
actually able to come together,

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:01.100
and they're encouraged
to share their ideas.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.770
The last place that I went to
on my journey to write this book

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.540
is to Silicon Valley.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.210
And that whole concept
of space was actually

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.120
really solidified for me,
and really, it drove it home.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.970
Because when you think
about it, everybody

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.410
talks about how do we replicate
the story of Silicon Valley?

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.270
How do we create
the next Steve Jobs?

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.100
How do we actually
create the next Google?

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.380
And it really comes
down to space.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.850
There's a reason that
there is this campus here

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.260
and that Google creates these
opportunities for all of you

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.340
to come together.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.350
Because ideas are not
created in and of themselves.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.550
This myth that the entrepreneur
sits in a garage by him

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.680
or herself, that
is just not true.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.000
All of the great innovations
that have come about

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.300
have come about as a result
of people interacting

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.830
with one another, and
engaging with one another,

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.050
and iterating and building on
the various different ideas

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.560
they have.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.630
The secret sauce
of Silicon Valley

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.640
that everybody is
trying to unlock

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.320
is really not really a secret.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.110
It's actually about community.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.120
And it's the one thing
that actually, I think,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.230
Google has given to the world.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.660
It's been able to
bring people together.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.070
And for people to gather and
interact with one another,

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.580
which is one of the
reasons that Google

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.820
is one of the most innovative
companies in the world.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.445
And it's one of the
reasons that people

00:41:18.445 --> 00:41:19.890
look to it as an example.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.719
And so the secret sauce
of it is about community.

00:41:23.719 --> 00:41:24.760
I will end my talk there.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.080
I thank you very much.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.450
And I welcome you to ask
any questions that you have

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.140
if you would step
up to the mics.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.700
Thank you.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.937
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.857
AUDIENCE: Is this on?

00:41:37.857 --> 00:41:38.690
ELMIRA BAYRASLI: Hi.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.310
AUDIENCE: Evidently is.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.000
Hey, Elmira.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.720
Thanks so much for coming.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.740
I love what you've
been working on.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.150
My name is Bilau.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:46.750
My family is originally
from Pakistan,

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.720
so that last story kind
of hit home with me.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.890
So thinking about enterprise
as a whole and the value

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:57.340
that it brings,
everyone in this room,

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.600
I'm sure, being a part of
Google, values enterprise.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.600
But there's increasingly
been this conversation

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.500
about how does enterprise
actually trickle down

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.186
to the rest of society?

00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:10.470
And Oxfam recently
released some numbers

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.740
about the gap
between rich and poor

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.220
is increasing, even
in the US, well,

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.560
especially the US and the West.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:23.190
So as much as I love enterprise,
do you see in the long run

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.790
the value that's being
created by these entrepreneurs

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.100
in these developing
countries-- do you

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.620
see that having the same issues
that we're having in the West?

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.400
Will it eventually trickle down
and build value for society,

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.880
or will they just be in
another league, you know,

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.304
wealthy, sitting at the top?

00:42:40.304 --> 00:42:41.970
ELMIRA BAYRASLI:
Thanks for that, Bilau.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.220
That's a great question.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.160
I actually think
that entrepreneurship

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.940
is one of the greatest--
and I say that in my book.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.440
I think that
entrepreneurs have done

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.030
more than any
charity, philanthropy,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.200
or nonprofit organization,
or multilateral organization

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.730
that I've seen.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:03.360
Going back to what
I was saying before,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.750
entrepreneurs go in
there and they're really

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:06.380
solving the problems
and challenges

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.710
within their community.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.360
I think we want to tear--
there is this tendency

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.970
to want to tear down
people in Silicon Valley

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.077
and then blame them for
this growing inequality.

00:43:17.077 --> 00:43:18.660
I actually think
that those are things

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.170
that need to be addressed by
government and on a policy

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:22.820
level.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:26.907
I think what entrepreneurs are
doing is they are adding value.

00:43:26.907 --> 00:43:28.490
And what I said
before is that they're

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.820
creating new channels for
socioeconomic creation.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.630
So they're moving
people forward.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:35.500
So they're not
only creating jobs,

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.400
they're creating opportunities.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.600
And they're bringing
investments in.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.750
So whether it's Tayo in
Nigeria or whether it's

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:46.080
Monis in Pakistan, he's
brought in venture capital

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.210
money from the United States.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.330
And when you have people putting
those type of investments

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.162
there, there is a sense
of not only ownership,

00:43:54.162 --> 00:43:56.370
but there's this sense that
you want to actually make

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.820
something succeed.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.650
And so there's a
lot of criticism

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.450
of people who are
throwing a lot of money

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.360
at a lot of technology startups.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.600
I actually think that's
a really great thing.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.740
Does everything work out?

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.480
No, and are there cons?

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.430
Absolutely.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.890
But I think that
we need to really

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:14.510
be careful about how we
use this word inequality,

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.910
and how we throw it around.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.570
And not assign
that responsibility

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.014
to the entrepreneurs.

00:44:20.014 --> 00:44:21.680
I think that's actually
a responsibility

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.285
of people in leadership.

00:44:23.285 --> 00:44:24.160
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:24.868
All right, great.

00:44:24.868 --> 00:44:25.633
Thank you.

00:44:25.633 --> 00:44:27.091
ELMIRA BAYRASLI:
No more questions?
