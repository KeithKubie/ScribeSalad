  (brief metal guitar riff)

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.372 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  - Well, I actually
  had the pleasure

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.908 line:0%
 of opening for you,
 Brian, at Carolines--

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:16.843 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Yeah, I remember.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.077 line:0%
before you made the feeder jump.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.746 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
  The last one, such
  a funny moment.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.049 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I think I told you
 this on Oddball tour,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.617 size:84% position:42%
  but they told me,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.519 align:start position:0%
  "You want to work with
  Brian Regan this weekend?"

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.987
 And I went, "Yes, for sure."

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.990 size:84% position:42%
  But Carolines goes you
  have to be squeaky clean,

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
  and I was like, yeah, I'll
  figure it out for sure.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.162 size:88% position:44%
 And on the very first show,

00:01:37.563 --> 00:01:38.931 size:88% position:44%
  I was going squeaky clean,

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.433 size:84% position:42%
  and there's a guy
  in the audience,

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
  I think he was gone before
  you even got on stage,

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.372 size:88% position:44%
  but he was just giving it
  to me, we were just going,

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.574
 and I was trying to go
 back at 'em with like,

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.676 size:84% position:42%
  this guy's being
  a real jerk, huh.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.878
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I bet you I'm
 trying to be clean.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.881
 I'm like, "Yeah, why
 don't you go home

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.350 size:88% position:44%
  "and have sex with a man."

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.253 size:88% position:44%
  - Clean comebacks.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.355
 Look at this weirdo!

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.257 size:88% position:44%
 - Cool shirt, jerk.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.892
 Ha ha, this guy's a real jerk.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.161
(Brian laughing)

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.429 align:start position:0%
- I came back in the Green room,
and as Grant told you that,

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:11.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and my favorite thing
 about this story,

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.332
 and I thought was the
 coolest thing ever,

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:16.269 align:start position:0%
 was you went, "You can curse,
 it doesn't matter to me."

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.503
 - [Brian] Yeah, do your thing.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.038
 - The club was Giff
 was came down so hard,

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:23.176 size:84% position:42%
  and I was like, "Sir, you
  are a real bad guy, you."

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.443
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:25.378 size:88% position:44%
  "Ah, I don't like
  the kind of person

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.246
"you are at all, talking loud."

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You seem like a
 filthy man, a bad man.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.086 align:start position:0%
  I opened for Nate
  Bargatze in West Virginia,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.088 size:84% position:42%
  and he was like, "Hey,
  man, you gotta be clean."

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.858 align:start position:0% line:0%
  And I always kinda thought
  that thing of like,

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.560 line:0%
 how clean do you have to be?

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.329 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 So I cut out all my curse
 words, but I said God damn,

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:44.931 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and a woman in the
 second row just goes,

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.766 size:88% position:44%
  (whispering) "He said GD."

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.634
And that fucked with me.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.869 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, for sure.

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.103
- Like, that just threw
me into a tail spin,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.605 align:start size:88% position:13%
 'cause I was like,
 what else in my head,

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:54.140 align:start position:0%
 all I could think when I
 was for the rest of the set

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.542
 was what other words are bad
 that I don't know are bad.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.177
(Brian laughing)

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.080 size:88% position:44%
 - Well, I do like
 to work with people

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
 who are not super
 dirty in front of me,

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.084 size:84% position:42%
  but I don't like
  to censor people.

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:06.285 align:start size:75% position:25%
 - [Dan] Yeah.
 - Sure.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.320 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - So there's a
  difference between

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.190
booking somebody
who works clean,

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:12.992
 and asking somebody
 who you just booked,

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:14.460 align:start size:88% position:13%
 hey, you have to
 work clean tonight.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:15.595
- Yeah, 'cause that's--

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't like throwing
that on people.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:17.463 size:84% position:42%
  - [Jay] Sure, sure, sure.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:18.397
 - I don't want to censor you.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.332
 - Right, right, no, for sure.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.800
- [Brian] You know what I mean?

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.235 align:start position:0%
- No, that's what I loved about
when we talked in the back.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.469 align:start position:0%
You were like, yeah, I wouldn't
tell you how to deal with,

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:24.670 size:88% position:44%
 which I thought was
 such a cool thing.

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:25.905
 - That is a very cool thing.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.573
 - I had another comic
 before who was just,

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.041
I worked with him before
he went on the theaters,

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.944 align:start position:0%
  and it always blew my
  mind when I went on stage.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:35.281
I wasn't very dirty,
but when I got offstage

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.649
he asked me to come in the back

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:38.684 size:88% position:44%
 to go I need you to
 be squeaky clean.

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:40.152
 And it was one of those, like,

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.255
 this guy was getting
 ready to go huge, too,

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:44.890 align:start position:0%
 so the audience was so excited
 when he touches the stage,

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:46.425 size:84% position:42%
  it wouldn't have mattered
  what happened in front.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.828
 Same thing that I, you
 know, with you, Brian.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:53.333
I don't think I've ever
told you a story that,

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.269 align:start position:0%
  'cause I was so
  mortified as a young kid,

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.737
 that same weekend, you
 know this, don't you?

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.539
- I know this story, and
this is, this is, yeah.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:02.008
 This is a great story.

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.509 align:start position:0%
 - I mean, it's a terrible
 story, but it's a great story.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:04.944 size:84% position:42%
  - It's a terrible story,
  but the fact that Brian's

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:06.679 size:88% position:44%
 on the show and you
 can tell it to him.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:08.748 size:84% position:42%
  I think you've told the
  story before on the show.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.216 size:84% position:42%
  - [Jay] I'm sure.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.218 align:start position:0%
  - But it's a thing of
  being opening for someone

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.587
 and having just a
 fucking colossal ...

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.457
- It's a real story of
the beware who you tell.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.393
 Like, yeah, I'll get
 you and your friends,

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.761 size:84% position:42%
  or whoever into the show.

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:24.864
 When I first got to
 New York just trying

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:26.565 size:84% position:42%
  to find work that
  wasn't difficult,

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:28.868
and also as a fat, insecure guy,

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.704
 I tried to get a job
 at a weird strip club

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:33.406 align:start size:88% position:13%
 right across the
 street from Carolines.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.908 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I think it was more
 of a whorehouse.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:39.045 size:88% position:44%
  No booze, and it was just
  very bizarre, small place,

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and the women in
 there were scraggly.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.915 align:start size:88% position:13%
But when I went in there
and talked to the guy

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.116
 and told him I was a comedian,

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I became friendly with
 the bartender guy,

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:48.688
 and he would come see me do
 comedy shows once in a while.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:53.392
The guy who owned the place was
a much more seedy gentleman.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.327 size:84% position:42%
  He was a guy that
  would walk in--

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.728 size:88% position:44%
  - If you can believe that.

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:58.731 align:start position:0%
  - I liked the expression,
  a seedy gentleman.

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:01.400
 - Again, I'm pretty, you know,

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:04.637
I'll go into a dark,
weird place with things

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.005
and think things
are interesting,

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:08.674
or even dirty is great.

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:10.042 align:start size:88% position:13%
 However, this guy
 would just do a thing

00:05:10.075 --> 00:05:11.243 size:84% position:42%
  when the girls walked by,

00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:12.912
it was a very, like,
"Look at this new one."

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.814 size:84% position:42%
  Like, you know, like grab
  an ass cheek, or a tit.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:16.916
It was very odd.

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.118 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But they asked me
 when you were in town

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.686
 if they can come see the show,

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.555 size:88% position:44%
  so I said they're
  probably sold out.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.156
 But Carolines was nice to me,

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.392
and they gave him four tickets.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.095 size:88% position:44%
 He goes, "We're also gonna
 bring, there's four of us."

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:30.396
 - It's great watching.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.198 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm just watching
 Brian's face process.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.999 size:84% position:42%
  You say, "So this is one
  of the worst human beings

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:34.834 size:88% position:44%
 "I've ever met in my life."

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:35.768
(Brian laughing)

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.837 size:88% position:44%
  He brings three wildcards.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.305 size:88% position:44%
  You're headlining,
  and you're all--

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.140 align:start position:0%
 - It was more the bartender
 brought three people,

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:44.610 align:start position:0%
 one of them being the
 owner and two of the girls,

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:46.011 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but I did not know
 what was gonna happen.

00:05:46.044 --> 00:05:47.646
Where do they sit them?

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:48.647 size:84% position:42%
  Front and center.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.149
 - Oh, no, no.

00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:51.150
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:52.685
- You know what, though?

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.353
 But I can say this, it's like
 the Ghost of Christmas Future,

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:55.855
that show's in the past.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:56.756 size:88% position:44%
  Don't worry, Brian, this
  isn't happening right now.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:57.957
 - Oh, it's the best.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.959 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I'm getting an
 anxiety attack now.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.193 size:88% position:44%
 I'm going, how am I
 gonna handle this?

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:02.728 align:start size:88% position:13%
  It happened, like,
  many years ago.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:03.963 size:84% position:42%
  - What am I opening with?

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:07.833
 - I watched a hundred
 plus sets of yours,

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:11.404
 from TV, to live, to that
 weekend, I've never seen ...

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.806 size:84% position:42%
  In the middle of
  one of your bits,

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.208
 you just broke and were like,

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:18.244 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Miss, like how
  rude you're being.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.647 size:88% position:44%
  You gave her a talking to,
  which was legitimately ...

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.482 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I'm watching in
the back going like ...

00:06:23.515 --> 00:06:24.517
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.851
 I'm like, oh, my God.

00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:27.019 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm out of show business.

00:06:27.052 --> 00:06:28.320
- I'm like, this is gonna be so,

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.822 size:84% position:42%
  like, the club is
  gonna be like ...

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.190
 I mean, they couldn't have a
 piece of paper on their thing

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:32.792 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that says more guests
 of Jay Oakerson.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:36.262
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:38.431
- Now, Brian's on stage
and you're in the back.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.932 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And for those that
 don't know Carolines,

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:41.500
 it's like a back, and
 then it's a hallway,

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:43.002 size:88% position:44%
  so you're actually
  around the corner.

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.870 size:88% position:44%
 So you're listening
 to Brian on stage.

00:06:44.903 --> 00:06:46.972 size:84% position:42%
  Did you know when
  he broke his bit

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:48.874
that he was talking to
the people you brought?

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:51.977
- A 100%, there was no one else
it could have possible been.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.046 size:88% position:44%
  It was an audience
  that was all there

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:57.049 align:start size:88% position:13%
to see him
specifically, sold out.

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
 They put my guests,
 for some reason,

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.052
 right in the front of
 people that were like,

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:03.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I guess, they were
 more going for, like,

00:07:03.622 --> 00:07:04.757 size:88% position:44%
 the hook up of me
 getting them stuff.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.525 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Right, because
 when you said earlier

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:07.993 size:88% position:44%
 that they wanted to
 come see the show,

00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:09.762 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I immediately
 thought I don't think

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.199
 they're coming to see my show.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.400
 They were just going
 to see a comedy show.

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't think
 they're a fan of mine

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:17.703 size:84% position:42%
  so I'm not worried about
  them hearing this at all.

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:18.671 size:84% position:42%
  - I don't think
  this guy that was

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.272
pawing on these young women go,

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:23.075
 "Man, I wanna hear
 jokes about donuts."

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:24.276
 - He goes, come here
 (drowned out by Brian)

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:25.578 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - These wholesome
 donut sprinkled jokes.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.946
 - He goes, "Come here,
 baby, come here, baby.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.747
 "You ever heard a good
 Pop-Tart joke, baby?"

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.949
(Brian laughing)

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.684 align:start size:88% position:13%
She's like, "I don't
know, I like Pop-Tarts."

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:32.785
 - Yeah, well I got your guy.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.253
 (Dan laughing)

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.455
 - Did you, can you ...

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:38.224 size:88% position:44%
 - Have I got a guy
 for you, tit grabs.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:39.992
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:42.695 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You like jokes
 about station wagons?

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:43.529
- Oh, hell yeah.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.030
- I got the guy for you.

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:45.931
(all laughing together)

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:47.466
- When you're on stage--

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:50.402
 - He goes, "I like my whores
 filthy and my comedy clean."

00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:51.804
(Brian laughing)

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:54.273 align:start position:0%
 - He goes, "Aw, man,
 nothing gets me than a good,

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:57.076
 "clean observation and
 a good dirty girl."

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:58.310
- He says something astute like,

00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:00.145
 "It's all about the
 juxtaposition of life,

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:01.080
"you know what I mean?"

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.581
- You know what, dude, Francis,

00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:04.116 size:88% position:44%
 I didn't want to say this
 about you, you're balanced.

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:08.521
 You own a whorehouse and are
 on the board of St. Jude's?

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.990
Do you know when
you're on stage,

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
 'cause at this
 point you know what

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:15.361
an audience feels like
that's there to see you,

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.062 align:start size:88% position:13%
when something like that
is in the front row,

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:18.264 size:88% position:44%
 can you ...

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.632 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, I was just at
the Albany Funny Bone--

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.233 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's gotta be
baffling at that point.

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:22.468
- You know what?

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.736
- Yeah, that's what I'm
saying, can you tell?

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.137
 - To back up, I think
 I remember that night.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.772
 - Oh, if you probably
 do, I'll tell you why.

00:08:26.805 --> 00:08:27.706
 This story's not over.

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:28.941
- I remember being at Carolines,

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:30.309 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and there was a
  woman in the front

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:32.879 size:84% position:42%
  who was like just
  out of control.

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:36.282 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It was a prostitute
 that I brought.

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:37.349 size:88% position:44%
  I'm sorry.

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:38.751
(all laughing together)

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.019 align:start position:0%
 I don't know if I ever
 properly apologized for that.

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.253
(all laughing together)

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.022
- I didn't do the what
do you do for a livings,

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.256 size:88% position:44%
 I would have known.

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:45.591
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:08:45.624 --> 00:08:46.559
 Oh, I'm a prostitute.

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:47.760 size:84% position:42%
  Oh, well.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
- How great is it to
find out that a heckler,

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:52.231
years later, was just a
bad person? (laughing)

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:55.134
 - The best part of the story
 is yet to come in a moment,

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.870 size:88% position:44%
  was all I can't wait for
  now is the show to be over

00:08:57.903 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
 so I can go out and I'm
 going to yell at these guys

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.208
 out in the hall, in the lobby,

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.377
for like, what the fuck,
why would you do that?

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.012
 I got you in here as a guest,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:09.615 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you're making me
 look like an asshole.

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:12.685
 It takes forever for
 them to come out.

00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:15.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then, just the
guys end up coming out.

00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:17.723
 I didn't go out there,
 I guess, fast enough.

00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.858 size:88% position:44%
 And then the guys come out,

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:21.060
 and right away they're like,

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
  "Sorry, man, we're
  really sorry."

00:09:22.527 --> 00:09:25.431 align:start position:0%
And I go, "Yeah, man, you
should be sorry, that's crazy."

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.499 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I give 'em the speech
 I have prepared,

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:29.535 size:88% position:44%
  "I hooked you guys
  up and then you're

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:30.970 size:84% position:42%
  "gonna just talk
  during the show?"

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.871 size:88% position:44%
 And he goes, "Talk?

00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:35.808
 "Oh, you weren't in there
 for the very end, were you?"

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:36.742
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:37.843 size:88% position:44%
 I went, "What do you mean?"

00:09:37.876 --> 00:09:39.745
 He goes, "A lady next to us,

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:41.880
 "some sweet lady fan of yours,

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:44.249
"said to one of the prostitutes,

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:45.517 size:88% position:44%
  "she goes, wow, thank you,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.252 size:88% position:44%
  "you really ruined
  that show for me."

00:09:47.285 --> 00:09:49.321 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And then this Puerto
 Rican prostitute

00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:52.658
 was just like, bitch, and
 just decked her in the face.

00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:53.892
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:55.394
And then they go, "So
they were all removed."

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:56.195 align:start position:0%
  - This story is getting
  worse and worse and worse.

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:57.429
- [Jay] Yes, it's worse.

00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:00.666
- Dude, Brian, watching
his face go like this.

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:04.770 size:88% position:44%
 He's listening, and
 he goes, "Oh, fun."

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:06.438
- And then the knives came out.

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:07.373
 (Jay laughing)

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.173
- [Dan] You don't remember this?

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:09.408
So then the woman said--

00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:10.476
 - Yeah, there was a
 monkey knife fight pit

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.211 size:88% position:44%
 in the lobby they'd set up.

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.479
 - Oh, my God.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:14.747
 - [Christine] You'd
 think Jay would have

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.948 size:88% position:44%
  stopped picking up
  strays after that.

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:17.216 size:88% position:44%
 No.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.751 size:84% position:42%
  - That was not my
  last dance with--

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:22.087 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - Jay's invited some gnarly
 characters into our lives.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.589 line:0%
 - And so the next
 night, I invited ...

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:24.523 size:84% position:42%
  (Christine, Dan,
  and Jay laughing)

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:25.858 size:88% position:44%
 - So now we're at a Friday.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.126
(Brian laughing)

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.360
 - He goes, "I'm under
 the Manhattan Bridge.

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:30.062
 "I'm talking to some
 real sketchy fellows."

00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:31.397
(Brian laughing)

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.331 size:88% position:44%
 - They seemed cool, though.

00:10:32.364 --> 00:10:33.632 size:84% position:42%
  I'm doing a show tonight,

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:34.867 size:88% position:44%
  if you want to get
  some free tickets

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.135 align:start size:88% position:13%
 (drowned out by Brian
 and Dan laughing)

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.536
- I would say go to the
early one for tickets.

00:10:38.603 --> 00:10:39.738 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I had a four-person
 guest list,

00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:40.973 size:88% position:44%
  and it was the four people

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.241 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that legitimately made
 the show horrible.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:43.509
- That is crazy.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.044 size:84% position:42%
  I mean, I did not
  know this story.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.846
 - You don't get crazy people
 at your shows, now, right?

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.948
 - No, not usually, no,

00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:51.383 line:0%
 especially if I'm
 performing somewhere

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.652 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 where that's why
 you would be coming.

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.454 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  I mean, I'm not
  in a comedy club,

00:10:55.487 --> 00:10:58.657 size:88% position:44%
  so if I'm in a venue where
  you'd have to have a ...

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.692
You'd be coming there to see me.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:00.859 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:02.795 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - And also with
  the theaters, too,

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.563 align:start position:0%
  drinking is not constantly
  coming around to you.

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:08.767 size:88% position:44%
 I mean, there's money made,
 but it's not a bar business

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.002 align:start size:88% position:13%
  once you're in
  the theaters, too,

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.938
 which makes people not
 get so annihilated,

00:11:12.971 --> 00:11:14.206 align:start size:88% position:13%
 which is generally
 what fucks up a show.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:16.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - When do you
 think the last time

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:19.678 align:start position:0%
 a stack of fries was served
 at one of your shows?

00:11:19.711 --> 00:11:21.814
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.282 size:88% position:44%
 - When's the last
 time someone really

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
 ripped into a rib eye while
 you were ... (laughing)

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:25.551 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, who's the
  last time to dunk

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.752
a chicken finger
in front of you?

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:28.854 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I remember at
 Carolines one time,

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:30.055 size:88% position:44%
  and this was when I was at

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:31.924 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the tail end of doing
 the comedy clubs,

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.093 size:88% position:44%
 and there was a guy
 at the front table,

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.994 align:start size:88% position:13%
 same table that
 your guests sat at.

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:37.396
(all laughing together)

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:38.731
 - Hey, some say it's haunted.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.499
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:41.767 size:88% position:44%
  - They think it's
  a possessed table.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.168
 - That's right, it's
 a possessed table.

00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.436
 - They're afraid to move it.

00:11:44.469 --> 00:11:45.704
 - Ever story has to do
 with this one table.

00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start size:88% position:13%
  And there was a
  guy, heavyset guy,

00:11:48.073 --> 00:11:52.077
 and I was doing pretty good.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.078
 The front table you can see,

00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:54.379
 they're in the pool of light,

00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:57.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and waitress brought
 a cheeseburger

00:11:57.215 --> 00:12:00.052
in front of him and set
a cheeseburger down.

00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:04.790 align:start size:88% position:13%
And his eyes rolled into
the back of his head,

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:07.793
 and the cheeseburger
 immediately became

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:09.762
 the headliner to him.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:12.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And he completely
 stopped looking at me,

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:16.435
 and just turned and
 spent about 10 minutes

00:12:16.468 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start size:88% position:13%
just loving every moment
of that cheeseburger.

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:22.608 size:88% position:44%
 And I just remember
 laughing to myself,

00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.810 size:84% position:42%
  going this is so bizarre.

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:27.312
 Like, it's comedy to a point,

00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:30.582 align:start position:0%
  and then you're doing
  comedy over people eating.

00:12:30.615 --> 00:12:32.184 size:84% position:42%
  And then when he was done
  with his cheeseburger,

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:34.686
 he slid it away and
 looked back up at me

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:37.122
 as if, all right, back to you.

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:38.490
 (Christine and crew laughing)

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:39.591
 - I say that out loud.

00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:41.059
 - [Brian] Back to you, clown.

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:43.629 align:start position:0%
 - I say that out loud on
 stage almost every weekend.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.230
 At least at one show
 where I just look down

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:47.299 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and I just see
  somebody, exactly,

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:49.501
 cutting into a wedge
 salad or something.

00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:52.271 align:start size:88% position:13%
They're like, why would
you have something

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:54.406
 that's gonna cover the
 table in bacon pieces?

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:56.341
- To me, the thing that
doesn't make sense is,

00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:58.844 size:88% position:44%
 I can get over the
 food and the drink.

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:01.513 align:start position:0%
  It's when people are
  doing group long division

00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:03.015
 while I'm trying to do a bit,

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.817 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they have the checks
and they're like ...

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.418
You just watch that math happen

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.620 size:88% position:44%
  and you're like, I
  can't win in this.

00:13:08.653 --> 00:13:10.455
 - You want to say one of you

00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:14.226 align:start size:88% position:13%
  pay the tab and
  work it out later.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:15.294
 (Dan laughing)

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:17.229 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah.
 - Work it out later.

00:13:17.262 --> 00:13:19.064
 But to figure it out there is

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:22.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
 the most insulting
 thing as a performer.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.368
 Going really?

00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:24.903 size:88% position:44%
 And you can hear 'em going,

00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:29.107
 "No, no, I ordered the second
 beer but then I canceled it."

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.609 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, he goes, (speaking
  in a whispering voice)

00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:33.478 size:88% position:44%
 I think you triple charged
 us for a shot of (mumbles).

00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:34.947 align:start position:0%
 - You know what I was getting
 heckled by this weekend

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.949 align:start position:0%
  was you couldn't even tell
  what they were saying.

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:39.218 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was just (indistinct
whispering).

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:40.786
 And you go, "Are you
 guys good over there?"

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:42.387
 And they go, "We're
 just figuring it out,

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.322
 "just you keep going."

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.257
 - Yeah, don't worry about us.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.694
 I say, could you imagine if
 you went to a Broadway play,

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:51.129 align:start size:88% position:13%
right, and then 20
minutes before it's over

00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:53.031
 some guy crouched down
 next to you and said,

00:13:53.064 --> 00:13:54.933 size:88% position:44%
  "It's 75 dollars a piece."

00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:57.736
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:59.271
 - It's absurd!

00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:00.806 size:88% position:44%
  But that's what happens in
  a comedy club every night.

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.107
 - A crescendo of some
 (drowned out by Brian)

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.876 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, everybody's
digging in their pockets

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.645
while you're watching the final
act of a Shakespearian play.

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:07.679 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - That's the beauty
 of the theater,

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:08.914
 though, is like I said, again,

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:11.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're always coming
to see you particularly,

00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:13.518
or from whatever
it is, you know,

00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
 they're coming to see a comedy
 show where the comic ...

00:14:15.453 --> 00:14:18.357
 I mean, bombing, or
 just hearing silence

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.359
in a room and hearing the sounds

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:23.061 align:start size:88% position:13%
of a guy pulling
gristle out of his mouth

00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:24.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
 to wrap in a napkin
 or something,

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.932 size:88% position:44%
 or just the sounds of fries

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.768 size:88% position:44%
 being pulverized by
 teeth is jarring.

00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:31.003
 - I still hear it sometimes,

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.505 align:start size:88% position:13%
I heard it when it
goes completely silent,

00:14:33.538 --> 00:14:35.874 align:start position:0%
  you just hear someone
  swishing around ice cubes

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:38.210 align:start size:88% position:13%
 like you're impressing
 a Bond villain.

00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:41.914 size:84% position:42%
  And they're like, is that
  all you have, Mr. Bond?

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.882
 - And like, you look at 'em.

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.083 size:88% position:44%
  Like, you don't hear that?

00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:47.119 align:start size:88% position:13%
  You don't hear
  what you're doing?

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:48.520
 - They're just like, you suck.

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.656
 I don't know, maybe
 make me like you more.

00:14:52.724 --> 00:14:55.460
 - Years ago I was on vacation
 and went to this little town.

00:14:55.493 --> 00:14:59.731
They had a play, like
a local community play,

00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:02.968 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it was all these
long tables with chairs.

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:04.903
 And whoever put on the play,

00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:09.541
 it was just like in this old
 wooden, rustic structure,

00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:11.843 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but it's fun to see
 stuff like that.

00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:14.546
Well, they put bowls of Chex Mix

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.184
 throughout the entire theater.

00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:22.554 size:84% position:42%
  So everybody sits down,
  and all you're hearing is

00:15:22.587 --> 00:15:25.424
(loud, obnoxious chewing noises)

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:27.159
And I'm like, who approved this?

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.627
 (Dan laughing)

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.662 size:84% position:42%
  The whole play, people
  were chewing on Chex Mix.

00:15:30.695 --> 00:15:32.097 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They go, you know what
adds to Shakespeare,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.498
loud bar snacks.

00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:35.033
(Brian laughing)

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:37.369
 - Put some licorice nibs in
 that bowl or something, man.

00:15:37.402 --> 00:15:38.937
- How 'bout something soft chew?

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.906
I'll soft chew anything,
even a Charleston Chew.

00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:42.841
- And the chairs
were like metal.

00:15:42.874 --> 00:15:44.443
It was a concrete floor,

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:47.245 size:88% position:44%
 so anybody that sat down or
 got up to use the restroom,

00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:48.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
it was (metal
screeching on concrete)

00:15:48.813 --> 00:15:50.482
 - Sounds like a prison visit?

00:15:50.515 --> 00:15:51.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - And then when
  they did sit down,

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:53.385 size:88% position:44%
 (obnoxious chewing noises).

00:15:53.418 --> 00:15:55.053
Man, this is a great production.

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:57.956 align:start position:0%
  - You go, you guys really
  sussed this room out.

00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
 - What was, do you remember
 in your early days,

00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:03.028 size:88% position:44%
  like just hell gig
  still to this day?

00:16:03.061 --> 00:16:05.330 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, I started in the
black comedy circuit,

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:06.765 size:84% position:42%
  so I have so many
  just from being

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:09.067 align:start position:0%
 the one white guy in a
 place that would go haywire,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.337 align:start position:0%
 but then, let alone then
 jumping in the open mic scene

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.439
 and performing in
 basements of places,

00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:15.707 size:88% position:44%
  or places they don't think

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.975 size:84% position:42%
  you should have a
  microphone, even.

00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:18.643 size:88% position:44%
  - Do you guys know
  Betty's Fireside?

00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:21.146
 Betty's Fireside was
 a gig in New Jersey,

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.382
and it was notorious
for being a rough room,

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:24.616
and I had heard about it

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:26.218 size:88% position:44%
 before I even moved
 to New York City.

00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:28.854 size:84% position:42%
  So I kinda looked forward

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.356 align:start size:88% position:13%
 to eventually playing
 Betty's Fireside.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:35.627 align:start position:0%
 Betty's Fireside was a
 place where they had a band,

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.230
and then in front of the
band was the bartenders,

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.232 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then the bar, and
 then the audience.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:41.833
 The audience was all standing.

00:16:41.866 --> 00:16:44.436
 So for comedy night,
 nobody was seated,

00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:46.238
it was just packed with people.

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.041
 And I heard that the
 room can be rough.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:52.144
 So they wanted me to
 be the first comedian,

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.545 size:88% position:44%
 so I said, all right, fine.

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:55.847
 And I said, "Who does
 the off stage intro?"

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.582 size:88% position:44%
  And they looked at me like
  I was from another planet.

00:16:57.615 --> 00:16:59.284 size:88% position:44%
 (laughing) Off stage intro?

00:16:59.317 --> 00:17:01.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
- This guy, fuckin' what
do you think you are?

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:01.987
 Where are you?

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.188 size:88% position:44%
 Where do you think you are?

00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:03.989
You think you're in the
(drowned out by Jay)

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.457 size:88% position:44%
 - Saunter up there.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.391 align:start position:0%
 - What, you think there's
 another microphone somewhere?

00:17:06.424 --> 00:17:07.592 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh, I'm sorry, Liberace,

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:08.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
 we couldn't get
 the chandelier down

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.194 size:88% position:44%
 for you to play your tunes.

00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:10.829
(Brian laughing)

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:11.863 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm sorry, that
 that guy's lighting

00:17:11.896 --> 00:17:13.298 size:84% position:42%
  the candelabra right now.

00:17:13.331 --> 00:17:15.567
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.835 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't know what
 I was thinking.

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:18.370
 And I said, "Well, how
 does the show start?"

00:17:18.403 --> 00:17:20.772 size:88% position:44%
 They said, "You just get on
 stage and start the show."

00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:23.075 align:start position:0%
 So I was gonna be the first
 of the three comedians,

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:24.242
 and I said all right.

00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:25.944
And I thought I had enough chops

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:27.846 align:start size:88% position:13%
 where I could
 handle a rough room.

00:17:27.879 --> 00:17:31.149
 And so I just start walking up

00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:32.717
 the steps to get on the stage,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.687 align:start position:0% line:0%
  and this guy from the
  corner in the back yells,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.123 line:0%
 "You suck!"
 (Dan laughing)

00:17:38.156 --> 00:17:42.527 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 And I'm not at the mic yet,
 so I can't defend myself,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.162
so I have to like look and wink,

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:46.131 size:88% position:44%
 like, hey, I'll get
 to you in a second.

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:46.965
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:17:46.998 --> 00:17:48.500
- [Jay] Hang tight, bud.

00:17:48.533 --> 00:17:49.935 size:88% position:44%
  - Hang on, I gotta get to
  the microphone! (laughing)

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.870 size:88% position:44%
 - You have to give
 a politician point,

00:17:51.903 --> 00:17:52.704 align:start position:0%
where you go I hear what
you're saying and I'm gonna ...

00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:54.206
- Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.374 size:84% position:42%
  Give me a second, I gotta
  get to the sound system.

00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:58.477
 - There are issues,
 there are issues, sir.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.845
 (Dan laughing)

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:01.680 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So I'm still
 walking to the mic,

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.915 size:88% position:44%
  and a guy from the
  other side said,

00:18:03.948 --> 00:18:06.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
 "We think you suck
 from over here, too."

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:08.453
 So I was like double-barreled.

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:11.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I got to the mic and
tried to nice guy it,

00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:13.492 size:84% position:42%
  which was the worst move.

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:15.127
- Yeah, smell the fear.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.762
 - Oh, man, you know, I
 hit with the angle of,

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.831
 "Hey, c'mon fellas."

00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:22.868
(all laughing together)

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.003 size:84% position:42%
  "Come on, I've got some
  lighthearted comedy jokes

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:26.771
 "I'd like to share with you."

00:18:26.804 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You verbally put your
hands on your hips.

00:18:28.773 --> 00:18:29.574
(Brian laughing)

00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:30.976
You went, guys, stop it.

00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:34.779
 - Boys? Boys?

00:18:34.812 --> 00:18:36.448
- Boys, yelling is bad.

00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.649 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, that's not right.

00:18:37.682 --> 00:18:40.719 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Come on, guys, you
 know that's not right.

00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.654
And they just buried me.

00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:44.222 size:84% position:42%
  And it was one of
  the first times

00:18:44.255 --> 00:18:46.324
that I didn't do my entire time.

00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:48.627 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Everybody was supposed
 to do a half hour,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.462
 and I'm on stage 10 minutes in

00:18:50.495 --> 00:18:53.999
and I'm going this ain't
doing anybody any good.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.500
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:18:55.533 --> 00:18:58.336 align:start position:0%
  Me doing a half hour ain't
  doing anybody any good.

00:18:58.369 --> 00:18:59.604
 You know what I mean?

00:18:59.637 --> 00:19:01.206
 - The guy after you's
 got more to clean up.

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:02.707 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah, the guy who
 was following me,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.843
 like he's gonna watch
 30 minutes of this?

00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:06.278 size:84% position:42%
  He's gonna leave.

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.746 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - There is that funny
 thing when you're

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:10.015 align:start position:0%
 watching someone have a
 rough time in front of you,

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:13.552 size:88% position:44%
  and a part of you is like,
  you feel terrible for 'em.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.421
But then it's like, oh,
man, if they jump early,

00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:17.856 align:start size:88% position:13%
 it's gonna throw
 the whole thing off.

00:19:17.889 --> 00:19:19.824
You know, like that's
gotta be a scary thing.

00:19:19.857 --> 00:19:21.359 size:88% position:44%
  - There's been times where
  I've watched people eat it

00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:23.061
 so hard that you want
 them to jump early.

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:24.262
You want to be like, get
off, come on, come on.

00:19:24.295 --> 00:19:25.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - No, I know, that's
 what I'm saying,

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.966 size:88% position:44%
 'cause you don't want them
 to have to do the full time

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:29.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
 of like, man, this
 crowd might still ...

00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:30.969 size:84% position:42%
  The people who don't know
  me are gonna come in here

00:19:31.002 --> 00:19:33.705
thinking like this might
be this the whole time.

00:19:33.738 --> 00:19:36.675 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, 'cause it's
  amazing, still, you know,

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:38.677 size:88% position:44%
  I was just at the
  Albany Funny Bone,

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.445
which is in a mall, and
you really look out,

00:19:40.478 --> 00:19:42.480
 and you're like 30% of
 you are here to see me

00:19:42.513 --> 00:19:44.616 size:88% position:44%
  and everyone else
  just got a coupon.

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:47.252
 (Brian laughs)

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:50.355
 I was coming home on Sunday,

00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:51.790 align:start position:0%
 and I was like, "Are you
 staying for the Sunday show?"

00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:56.094 size:88% position:44%
  And he goes, "No,
  it's a hypnotist."

00:19:56.127 --> 00:19:57.295
 And I was like, "Oh,
 yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:19:57.328 --> 00:19:59.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's like a Sunday
 show at a club.

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:00.832
 And he goes, "You ever
 open for a hypnotist?"

00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:02.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And I was like,
 "Yeah, you haven't?"

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.768
 And he was, like, blown away.

00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:05.070
 You forget all the crazy shit

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.571
that you open for as a comedian.

00:20:06.604 --> 00:20:08.173 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - All these mall
 clubs, it really is.

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:11.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Add to the ridiculous
 menu eating,

00:20:11.442 --> 00:20:16.448
 now add like four bags from
 FootAction U.S.A., LeClaire's.

00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:20.619 size:88% position:44%
 - I filled in for
 a comedy hypnotist,

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.888 size:88% position:44%
  and nobody told me

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:25.090
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:26.592
or the audience.

00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:29.394 align:start position:0%
  - Wait, they were waiting
  for you (mumbles)?

00:20:29.427 --> 00:20:31.963
 - They thought that I was
 going to do comedy hypnosis,

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:35.100
 and I just ate it for an hour.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.502 size:88% position:44%
  And I walked off stage and
  you get that flop sweat,

00:20:37.535 --> 00:20:38.536 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and the first thing
 you want to do

00:20:38.569 --> 00:20:40.138
is go to the bar
and get yourself

00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:41.940 size:84% position:42%
  a double Jack and
  ginger something.

00:20:41.973 --> 00:20:43.375 size:84% position:42%
  And somebody came
  up to me and said

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:46.111 align:start size:88% position:13%
how come you didn't make
us act like chickens?

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:47.479
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They were all waiting
to be hypnotized.

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.749
 - What are you talking about?

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:53.852
 And they showed me the table
 tent that was on every table,

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.820
 Comedy Hypnosis Night.

00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:56.788
 (Jay laughing)

00:20:56.821 --> 00:20:59.124 size:88% position:44%
  Nobody knew, including me.

00:20:59.157 --> 00:21:02.193 align:start position:0%
  - It said relax your minds
  and prepare for comedy.

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:03.695
(Brian laughing)

00:21:03.728 --> 00:21:05.563 size:88% position:44%
  - More than a quarter of
  the people in the audience

00:21:05.596 --> 00:21:06.765 size:88% position:44%
  after 20 minutes was like,

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.433 align:start size:88% position:13%
 this guy's really
 long on the foreplay.

00:21:08.466 --> 00:21:10.435
(Brian and Jay laughing)

00:21:10.468 --> 00:21:12.404 align:start position:0%
 - Are we supposed to be
 paying attention to key words?

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.806
 Have I been asleep
 for 10 minutes and I
 don't even know it?

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:16.708 size:84% position:42%
  - Has he been programming
  us with these stories?

00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:20.445
- Yeah, all these goofy
the station wagon thing.

00:21:20.478 --> 00:21:22.881 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Maybe now we start
 making chicken noises!

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.416
 (Dan and Jay laughing)

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.650 size:88% position:44%
  - Do you think we're gonna
  wake up in a station wagon

00:21:25.683 --> 00:21:28.086 align:start size:88% position:13%
  that we've been
  in the whole time?

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.788 size:88% position:44%
 Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:33.024 align:start position:0%
But it was this innocent
question when the MC asked that,

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:34.759 align:start position:0%
 where he was like, "Have
 you opened for a hypnotist?"

00:21:34.792 --> 00:21:37.295 align:start position:0%
 You're like, "Oh, buddy, I've
 opened for a silent clown

00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:39.731 align:start size:88% position:13%
 "and his wife
 plays the piccolo."

00:21:39.764 --> 00:21:41.333
 And then what I like
 is then when you meet

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:42.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
 a comic that's been
 around the road,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.536 align:start position:0%
  they're like, "Oh, T.C.
  Hatter's still out there?"

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:46.037
 You're like, aw, fuck.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.074 align:start position:0%
 - That was my favorite thing
 ever was Chipps Cooney.

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:53.478
 He was featuring for
 me in Philly once,

00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:54.946
we're outside of Philly.

00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:57.182
 And as he was tying his cape,

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
 he goes, "So what
 have you been up to?"

00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:00.251 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I said, "I just
 opened for Dave Attell

00:22:00.284 --> 00:22:04.222
 "on the Insomniac tour
 on the East Coast."

00:22:04.255 --> 00:22:07.759 align:start size:88% position:13%
And he goes, "Yeah? Like
theaters and stuff?"

00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:09.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
I go, "Yeah, it was like
a bunch of theaters."

00:22:09.627 --> 00:22:11.763 align:start size:88% position:13%
As he's tying his
magicians cape, he goes,

00:22:11.796 --> 00:22:13.865 align:start position:0%
 "Ah, good to see that
 kid's doing theaters, now."

00:22:13.898 --> 00:22:15.767
(all laughing together)

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.569
 And then he ran back
 in the room, you know,

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.738
 whatever, 30 minutes
 later in his underwear

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.005
 with a fake shit stain in it,

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:22.273
holding his tuxedo in his hands,

00:22:22.306 --> 00:22:23.908 size:84% position:42%
  and he goes, "Hot crowd."

00:22:23.941 --> 00:22:26.144
(Brian and Dan laughing)

00:22:26.177 --> 00:22:27.712 size:88% position:44%
  He goes, "Hot, hot crowd."

00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:30.448 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, the thing
about opening or subbing

00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:32.884 size:88% position:44%
 for somebody who you didn't
 know you were subbing for,

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:34.419
 that was always the best with

00:22:34.452 --> 00:22:37.055 size:84% position:42%
  the black circuit
  ski trip shows.

00:22:37.088 --> 00:22:39.357
They would book them and
get these high budgets,

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.925 size:88% position:44%
  'cause they would be like,

00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:43.328
Chris Tucker and Martin
Lawrence are coming.

00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:44.863 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And then they would
 get the budget

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:49.868 size:88% position:44%
  and pay me and whoever I
  wanted to bring like $700.

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:51.369 size:88% position:44%
 And you'd get there
 and you'd be like,

00:22:51.402 --> 00:22:52.937
"Hey, where are the comedians?"

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.373
 They'd go, "I thought Chris
 Tucker was gonna," you know.

00:22:55.406 --> 00:22:56.808
 It was like, not that level,

00:22:56.841 --> 00:22:58.176
 but it was like they
 always saw those names

00:22:58.209 --> 00:22:59.644
 from Def Jam that were coming,

00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:01.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I was like, "No,
not only is it not them,

00:23:01.345 --> 00:23:02.480
 "it's also two white
 guys who didn't know

00:23:02.513 --> 00:23:04.115
 "that's what was happening."

00:23:04.148 --> 00:23:06.518 align:start position:0%
 And it would just go almost
 nightmarish every time.

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.719
- [Brian] That's rough.

00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:08.953 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I mean, that's just
 gotta be promoters

00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:10.088
 just being like, oh,
 we can, you know.

00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:11.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It's them snagging
 money, yeah.

00:23:11.622 --> 00:23:14.759
 They're getting like, $10,000
 budgets and paying out $700.

00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:16.394
 - [Brian] Man, oh man.

00:23:16.427 --> 00:23:17.629 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - If you would do
 two in a night, you
 would get like $1,000.

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:18.863
 I don't want to hold
 you up here too long,

00:23:18.896 --> 00:23:20.031 size:88% position:44%
  I know you got a
  long day of stuff.

00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:21.099 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, you're a legend,
you're hilarious.

00:23:21.132 --> 00:23:22.300
 - Thank you.

00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:23.234 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Thanks so much
 for coming on, dude.

00:23:23.267 --> 00:23:24.169 size:88% position:44%
 - Thank you very much, man.

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:25.670
 I appreciate the kind words,

00:23:25.703 --> 00:23:28.073 align:start position:0%
  and thanks for bringing
  back the horrific memories

00:23:29.874 --> 00:23:32.277
of the drunk prostitute.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.511 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm so excited
  on our radio show

00:23:33.544 --> 00:23:35.880
 that I was able to
 tell you that story.

00:23:35.913 --> 00:23:38.416 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's my number one
story of you gotta watch

00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:40.785
 who you invite to a
 show, man. (laughing)
