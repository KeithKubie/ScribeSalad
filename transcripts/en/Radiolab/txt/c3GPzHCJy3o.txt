Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey everyone. I'm Jad Abumrad. This is radiolab, the podcast. Every so often on a radio lab, we set aside the science and we set aside the big ideas and we just play some music or I should say every so often on the podcast we have that opportunity. So I wanted to do that again today. Also to invite you guys who, who like radio lab to check out this other series that I am hosting, a couple of different shows we're putting together on the wordless music concert series, which is a really, really innovative concert series here in New York. It's curated by a guy named Ronan vone. Basically what he does, it's very simple. He takes classical musicians, puts them on the same bill as rock musicians because it is his, uh, opinion and I agree with this that the music's do have something to say to each other.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So I'll be hosting a couple of those shows. I hope you can listen, but here is an excerpt of one of my favorite, favorite all time favorite bands that performed as part of the series. Stars of the lid is probably the inventor of a certain kind of, well, I don't know if they're the inventor, maybe Brian Enou is the inventor, but they perfected a certain kind of pop, ambient, serene, dreamy kind of narcoleptic thing that is particularly their own. And they performed recently at a, the good shepherd faith church as part of the word, this music concert series. They played two selections from their latest release and their refinement of the decline. So I want to play this for you. Now the people that are going to hear are, uh, Brian McBride and Adam Bryan bomb. They are the founding members of star, the lead, and they're going to be joined by Ella Bruce on Viola. Kate O'Brien on violin and Juliet Kent on Cello. Here they are stars of the lid at the Good Shepherd Faith Church in Manhattan. Uh, this next piece, uh, is called requiem for dying mothers.

Speaker 1:          21:50          two pieces by the bands, stars of the lid that was recorded recently at the Good Shepherd Faith Church in Manhattan as part of the wordless music concerts series to perform, as you heard were the founding members, Brian McBride and Adam. Brian Balm along with Ella Baroo Shun Viola Kate O'Brien on violin and Julia Kent on Cello. There was also, by the way, a visual artist Luke Savitsky showing tape loops, sort of like super eight tape film loops that he layer one on top of the other. To create these sort of like textual, uh, visual escapes to match the music. You can sort of vaguely conjure that in your mind and aid case. You can hear the complete wordless music concert at Wny C.
