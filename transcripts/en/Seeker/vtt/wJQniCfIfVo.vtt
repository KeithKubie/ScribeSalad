00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.310
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the U.S. Air Force.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.120
Tiny robots of the future will need tiny batteries,
tiny cameras and tiny motors, and scientists

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.950
of today are working on them RIGHT NOW.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.680
Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been quoted saying
that in 25 years, the computer in your phone

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.800
will be millions of times more powerful, but
will be the size of a blood cell.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.739
New nano-engineering is helping scientists
build the robot which that computer could

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.739
drive…

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.370
At the moment, when I think of crazy robots,
I think of the DARPA Big Dog or BINA48.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.510
But because of this new technique, future
robots could be the size of specks of dust

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.309
or smaller!

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.699
Engineers in China and Australia have created
a double-walled carbon nanotube motor!

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.839
They published their findings in the journal
Nanotechnology, and believe this could be

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.379
a big player in future nanodevices.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.059
We've talked about graphene before -- a super
strong one-atom thick sheet of carbon atoms.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.130
When you roll them into a tiny tube, you get
a carbon nanotube.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.450
Carbon nanotubes are exceptionally strong,
but when you roll TWO that fit together, the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210
engineers believe, a nanomotor could result.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.450
At the macro-level motors run when a magnetic
device is spun inside a tube of electrical

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.450
wire.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.259
The current in the wire creates a magnetic
flux which pulls the inner magnet around,

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.259
running the motor.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.720
But at the nano-level?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.159
No way is that gonna work, Jack.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.369
You can't solder a wire onto the outer tube,
and run electricity, so instead this double-walled

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.530
carbon nanotube motor works, because at the
atomic level, there's a thing called a "van

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.840
der Waals interaction."

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.260
A van der Waals interaction describe how atoms
interact with each other due to electrical

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.859
charge, which makes perfect sense when talking
about nano-scale motor engineering.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.720
In this case, when the researchers put the
two tubes together to these atomic forces

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.740
caused the inner nanotube to spin!

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.200
Then they had to figure out how to CONTROL
that spin, because a spinning tube isn't of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.280
much use on it's own.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.910
The researchers messed with the length of
the outer tube to change speed, and found

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.500
the ideal amount of space between the inner
and outer tubes to encourage rotation, but

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.440
in the end temperature is the keystone.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.330
At a fairly warm room temperature -- 300 Kelvin
(27C/80F) -- the amount of kinetic energy

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.440
or about f they regulate the temperature of
the room they can change the speed of the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440
rotation!

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.390
Obviously, their goal is to create a temperature-driven
motor made of double-walled carbon nanotubes

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.270
-- so we'll have to see where this goes.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.931
Nano-scale engineering isn't new, but the
idea of making a nanomotor is pretty novel.

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:43.500
Nano means 10 to the negative ninth power…

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.260
Or, one one billionth of a meter.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.260
It's pretty small.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.571
Working at that scale requires extreme precision
and if engineers can master the skills, then

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:57.560
it's only a matter of time before Ray Kurzweil's
blood cell computer is put into a blood cell

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.140
nanoelectromechanical system.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.580
We could augment our immune systems, rebuild
our bodies or even ingest new technologies!

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.580
Who knows!!

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.160
The future is going to be a crazy place.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.500
And I’m happy scientists are keeping their
eyes on it.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.010
You know who else is always looking at the
future?

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.440
The brave men and women in the United States
Air Force!

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.140
American Airmen are fueled by innovation,
and every day they go above and beyond to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.460
break barriers both professionally and personally.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.440
So, a big shout out to the U.S. Air Force
for supporting DNews.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.500
What do you think of all this?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:38.620
Freaked out by a microscopic robot or excited?
