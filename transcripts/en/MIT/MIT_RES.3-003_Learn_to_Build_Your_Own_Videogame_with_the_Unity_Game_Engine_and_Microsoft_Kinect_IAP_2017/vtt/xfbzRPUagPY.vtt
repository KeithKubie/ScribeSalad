00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.546
STUDENT: So I believe
this is kind of working.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:21.011
And this looks cool.

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:23.906
STUDENT: Can you do [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:27.858
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:39.714
STUDENT: OK.

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:43.686
[INAUDIBLE] how quiet it is.

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:48.033
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.940
Dance off.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.663
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:54.413
STUDENT: But yeah.

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:55.121
It's really cool.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.320
So we actually finally
got the Run Model online.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.330
And what it is, if you
look at the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.650
it's actually split into
a lot of different things,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440
like the pelvis.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.420
And then it goes into
legs and then knees.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.260
So basically what we did
is we moved it like this.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.720
For the wifi, we matched the
left hip and then knee to knee,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.360
and so.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
We just went through each
of the different parts.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.650
And also one thing
to keep note of--

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.560
STUDENT: Cool.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560
STUDENT: For easy access for
the arms and legs because

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.860
with Connect, it
would go weirdly.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.950
Like your arms would
be going backwards.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.290
ABHINAV GANDHI: At
first it was almost as

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.500
if my body was backwards.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.356
Like I was in Godzilla
suit in backwards.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:44.540
So I looked really,
really weird.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.096
Very scary.

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:48.390
The idea was supposed
to be Kinect.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.115
But we seem to be experiencing
some issues with the Kinect.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.314
But the initial
game with Kinect was

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.470
that, you would have to
move your body in order

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.860
to avoid the obstacles.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.321
KYLE KEANE: Giant Spiderman?

00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.205
STUDENT: Including
the Spiderman.

00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:03.758
He tries to tell people
he can't do anything.

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:07.217

Make sure to walk on them.

[STUDENTS GASPING]

00:02:21.026 --> 00:02:22.400
MARK VRABLIC: So
used this as a--

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.941
STUDENT: So if you kill too
many people, then you lose.
