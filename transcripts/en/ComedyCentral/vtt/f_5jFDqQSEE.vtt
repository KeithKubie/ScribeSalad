00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.903
here with a message
to Angelina Jolie,

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.707
our benefactor this week,
Donald Trump.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.309
(fanfare playing)

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.411
(cheers and applause)

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.186
-Hi, Chuck. How are you?
-You know my name is Chris.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.354
-Wonderful.
-(laughter)

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:24.358
-(soft music playing)
-First of all, Angelina,

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.827
I know what
you're going through.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.896
Divorce is the best.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.233
It's a lot, a lot,
a lot, a lot of fun.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.435
-(laughter)
-I've been through several.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.005
And let me tell you,
they go by so fast,

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.973
-so savor every moment.
-(laughter)

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.376
-And can I say something, Chuck?
-Well, you're already talking.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.378
-Can I? Can I say something?
-Yeah, you are talking already.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.380
I'm glad
that you've finally done

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.749
what all of America
has been wanting for years

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.218
and dumped that scruffy
pretty boy loser.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.554
Honestly, his movies
are absolute garbage.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.924
Although, I did have a few
laughs during <i>12 Years a Slave.</i>

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.792
-(audience groaning)
-Well, that's not a...

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.028
-That's a terrible thing to say.
-So much fun. So much fun.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.297
-It's not fun at all.
-TRUMP: So much fun, Chuck.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.067
-It was not fun at all!
-So much fun, Chuck.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.903
And let me tell you,
the timing is perfect

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:13.807
because I am about ready to get
a new wife, and it could be you.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:15.809
-(laughter) -I mean,
what have you got to lose?

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.778
What are you talk...?
You're married!

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.880
-Hey, have you seen Melania?
-Yes! She's beautiful!

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.616
Have you seen...? No,
she's a complete and total mess.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.618
-I don't... -Okay? I already?
-(audience groaning)

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.687
-These people are horrified.
-TRUMP: They love me.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.921
Are you kidding me?

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.424
I wear my mother's pearls
as a (bleep) ring.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:34.995
(laughter)

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.866
Imagine, imagine
a luxurious life as first lady,

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.968
constantly making love to me.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.170
And I'm a human pile
of candy corn,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.039
melting on the dash
of a dump truck.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:47.374
(laughter)

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.477
And I'd do you right.
I'd do you right.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.446
Angelina, I promise,

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.214
I'd love your international
group of babies

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:55.616
like they were my own.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.751
-My own little bowl of Skittles.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.019
Just think of the things

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.255
I could get away with
if I was surrounded

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.725
by your little
community college catalogue

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:07.761
-of multicultural bonbons.
-(laughter)

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:07.861
Angelina, let's make marriage
great again!
