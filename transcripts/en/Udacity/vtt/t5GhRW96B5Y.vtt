00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.800
Once you've learned how to pars JSON data, it's pretty

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.990
straight forward to be able to pars the rest of the

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.550
fields that we need. Since this isn't a course on

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.520
Java or JSON, we're going to provide you with the parsing

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.210
code in the gist below. And this is what the

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.800
gist looks like. There are three helper methods. The first is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.280
for formatting dates. The second is for rounding temperatures. The third

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.380
is for turning a forecastJsonStr, into an array of weather forecasts.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.780
Update the Fetch Weather Tasks to use these helpful functions. And

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.170
the do in background method should return a string array of

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.410
forecasts. You can log the output to check that the array

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.910
is correct. The format of one day's forecast should look like this.
