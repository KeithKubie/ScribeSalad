00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.970
At this point in the class, you've gotten a good idea of how jQuery works works.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.630
You've used the three main types of selectors, and

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.890
you've started navigating around the DOM with traversal methods.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.240
That's awesome.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.290
But now it's time to start making changes to the DOM,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.750
which is the whole purpose of jQuery.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.800
To that end, you'll be using the jQuery API documentation in the next lesson.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.190
And rather than going through each method one by one, I will be walking you

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.250
through a series of challenges where you'll be asked to take apart

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.310
the jQuery documentation to figure out how to make changes to a sample page.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.220
To get started, I want to walk you through the general format of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.040
the jQuery API documentation.
