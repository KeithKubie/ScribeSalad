JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Well, hello, everybody.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.262
My name's Jonathan Alferness.

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:09.970
I lead up some of our
mobile ads products

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.740
at Google, including AdMob.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.090
We're incredibly excited to
be here today at Google I/O

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.200
to have the opportunity
to talk to all of you.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.010
A lot of you in the
audience, I'm guessing,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.820
are app developers,
and you've been

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.160
through a series of just
enormous changes in this space.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.690
The mobile app business--
heck, the mobile businesses--

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.220
aren't even that old.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.700
And yet we constantly
see changes

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.410
in how users are interacting
with devices, how they're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650
engaging in mobile
applications, and it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.250
has a ton of implications
on these businesses

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.110
that we're building on
top of these experiences.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.610
We're here today to talk a
little bit about the changes

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.640
that we're seeing
in the industry.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.410
The best practices, and
how you can all best take

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.010
advantage of these changes,
and the tools and technology

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.640
that we're building at Google
across the whole number

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.060
of different areas to make
it easier for all of you

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.880
as app developers to
find the right users,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.010
to bring them into
your experiences,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.830
to engage those users, and
finally, to monetize them

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.155
in the ways that make most
sense for those users,

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:15.905
for your audience.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.070
It's clear that there have
been tremendous changes

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.360
in the mobile app economy.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.580
To call it a rapidly
shifting market

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.640
is itself an understatement.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.280
In the last 12 to 18 months,
we have seen enormous change

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.820
that's brought us from a world
in which most consumers were

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.890
either buying paid apps or
downloading free apps that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.120
had ads to a world
in which there's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.580
a lot more complexities.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.710
In fact, the first one
is underscored by users.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.160
The first change is underscored
by users themselves,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.280
because it's the users
in this world that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.300
vote with their thumbs.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.920
They're the ones choosing
the experiences they want.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.230
What we're seeing
now is more than 90%

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.670
of the apps being
downloaded are free apps.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910
These aren't exactly
like the free apps

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.630
that were being downloaded
18, 24 months ago.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.040
These are much richer
monetization models

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.580
that have ads, yes,
but also have things

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.677
like in-app purchase.

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:22.010
I think, as no surprise to
many of you in the audience--

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.050
especially any game
developers in the audience--

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.070
the second fact is that in-app
revenue has grown enormously.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.550
These are in-app purchases
that help users continue

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.170
to play games to download
customizable content

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170
for their experience.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.320
What we're seeing
is a dramatic rise

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.190
in in-app purchase across a
whole section of the audience,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.390
across a whole section of users.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.000
Last, and because of
these other changes,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.680
app developers are understanding
that it's not just volume.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.380
The conversation I'd have with
app developers and marketers

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.630
18, 24 months ago was one around
how do I drive as many installs

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.300
as possible, as
cheaply as possible?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.000
I want volume.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.520
I want to get to the
top of the app charts.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.290
But today, we understand that
the users that you acquire,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.600
the users that you bring into
the experience themselves,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.360
it matters who they are and it
matters what lifetime value.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.160
What are they going
to return to you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.430
in that experience
over the lifetime

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.820
that they use your app?

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.210
What makes a lot of sense is
that what app developers are

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.540
interested in here is ROI.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.070
Look, I'm willing
to pay whatever

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.860
it costs to bring in a user, as
long as that user spends more,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.040
returns more to me
in the experience

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.850
than I paid for them
in the first place.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.970
There's a lot of
sophistication under here,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.300
but the underlying theme
is that users matter.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.150
The more that we can
pivot around the user

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.840
and do the right thing for the
user, the better the experience

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.750
we can build, the better the
monetization we can build.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.335
Look, apps are here to stay.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:01.460
That's why you're all here.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.918
That's one of the
main reasons, one

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:05.850
of the big reasons we
have Google I/O. Apps make

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.850
for incredible
gaming experiences

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.700
on mobile devices--
fluid, immersive.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.290
I mean, we are talking
the kind of quality gaming

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.459
that you had on consoles
not more than two years ago.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.459
Apps make things like messenger
and email clients better.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.990
Apps make all kinds
of experiences,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.850
from retail and e-commerce
types of experiences all the way

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.790
through to the more than six,
I don't know, maybe seven apps

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.680
I used alone on my way
getting here to Google I/O.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.690
I used Gmail.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.450
I used our messenger client.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.600
Let's see, I used Uber
to get a ride down here.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.760
I used the Google I/O
app itself to figure out

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.850
where I was talking
this morning.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.730
And that just names a few.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.440
Apps are clearly here to stay.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.562
We continue to see this
huge growth, not just

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:51.520
in the number of apps,
the number of apps being

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.830
downloaded, but
the number of hours

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.660
spent by consumers in apps.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.850
The engagement in apps is
going up significantly.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.020
And with that, this
number shouldn't

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.440
be too much of a surprise.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:13.980
We expect $35 billion in app
monetization in 2014 alone.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.250
This massive usage
has consequences.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.800
It's a pretty nice
consequence, $35 billion.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.070
This also drives more
and more competition.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.550
Everybody wants a slice
of this $35 billion pie.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.190
What we're going to talk about
over the next 30 minutes or so

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.510
is what all of you can do to
better set up your chances

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.400
so that you have as good
a chance as possible,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.710
so that there's a level
playing field to basically vie

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.660
for that pie of $35 billion.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.920
What are the challenges
that app developers

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.600
face in building business in
this new mobile app economy?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.925
Well, we think that there
are three main challenges.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.950
First, as we talked
about at the beginning,

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.150
you need to find the right
users-- the high value,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.190
the high lifetime value users
who will engage in your app

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.660
over and over again, who will
return dividends back to you

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.940
as a developer.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.050
Not only do you have to find,
identify, and get these users

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.180
to download your app, but
you need to engage them.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.390
You've got to excite them.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.990
You want them to continue coming
back to your experience time

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.630
and time again.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.227
You want them to engage.

00:06:29.227 --> 00:06:30.810
And once you've done
that, once you've

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.630
built this virtuous
cycle, you need

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.800
to find ways to
monetize those users.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.860
The monetization piece is
undergoing a fundamental change

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.090
where it's not just one
monetization solution that

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.360
fits all, but it really
depends on who the user is

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.270
and what the user is willing
to do in your experience.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.412
Based on that, you should
be presenting the user

00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:52.245
with those right
monetization opportunities.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.250
Underlying all of this, we
believe that the more that all

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.110
of you embrace a single
unified platform,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.420
the easier all of this
becomes-- the easier it

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.390
becomes to track and
understand the value

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.780
of your users from
acquisition through retention

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.220
to monetization.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.910
The thing that's interesting
is that you are all--

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.200
many of you are developers.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.810
You're coders.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.210
You could certainly build
these tools yourself.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.990
But I would argue that
your time, your energy

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.150
is better spent creating the
differentiated experiences that

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.480
are the apps, that are
what you guys build.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.520
It's your bread and butter.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.130
That's why at Google, we
are working incredibly hard

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.250
to build a suite of tools,
of technology that creates

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.410
this underlying platform so that
all of you-- large businesses,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.580
small businesses, hundreds of
developers all the way down

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.230
to one or two-- can
have an equal chance

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.380
to fight for the
monetization, the $35 billion

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.120
that we talked about earlier.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.640
Let's break it down.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.860
How do you find the right users?

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.870
Well, in the gaming space,
we talk about our high value

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.880
users, our engaged
users as whales.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.200
The idea is that it is a
small percentage of users

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.880
who engage so highly
and spend through things

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.070
like in-app purchase
that they often make up

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.530
the vast majority of revenue
that a game developer sees.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.260
But finding these whales,
finding these engaged users,

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.770
is often challenging.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.430
At Google, we've been
working across our Adwords

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.110
stack-- from search
through display

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.450
and YouTube-- to give you tools
so that you can cast the very

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.850
wide net across hundreds
of millions of users.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.280
But so that you can identify the
most high-value users for you,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.380
for your experience.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.330
We are giving you tools so
that you can cast that net,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.950
you can find your whales,
and you can bring them

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.806
in without becoming
Captain Ahab yourself.

00:08:52.806 --> 00:08:54.930
On the search side-- you
heard a little bit of this

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.372
from Sundar yesterday--
we are doing a ton

00:08:57.372 --> 00:09:01.470
to make app discovery easier
across our entire set of search

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.490
products.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.650
Sundar talked about deep linking
in the organic side of search.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.460
We've done a lot to make app
discovery itself a lot easier

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.780
in search.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.870
But we've also done a
tremendous amount of work

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.580
on the search ad
side of the world.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.910
What you see up here
is a AdWords search ad

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.410
for App Install.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.476
This one's for HotelTonight,
a great partner of ours.

00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:27.100
What we're doing here
is we're bringing

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.840
in insights from Google Play.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.890
We know what users are
doing on Google Play.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.450
We know what they're searching
for when they go and download

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.650
HotelTonight, so we're
bringing those same insights

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.090
to our search ads advertisers,
our AdWords advertisers,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.580
and we're suggesting
relevant keywords that

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.900
will drive not just a
volume of downloads,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.800
but a volume of highly
qualified downloads.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.170
YouTube and video are
a tremendous channel

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.340
for growing awareness and for
showcasing to users the really

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.480
exciting things about your app.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.540
We see this happening
organically already.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.530
Tons of game
developers are already

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.540
leveraging YouTube
as a way to show

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.475
to the world what it
is that their app does.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.370
On YouTube, we have this
great advertising channel

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.610
known as TrueView, which are
these 30-second pre-rolls that

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.990
are shown before videos.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.540
But they put the
user in control.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.360
The user has the ability
to skip the video

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.160
if it's not relevant to her.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.550
What we're announcing
now is the ability

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.400
to take any TrueView
ad to attach a TrueView

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.190
companion for apps so that
those users watching the ad,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.560
watching the video
about your app,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.300
can take action right then,
can engage and download

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.030
and install your app from
right within YouTube,

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.340
from right within that video.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.390
This is going to be a
great channel because we

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.759
have pre-qualified these users.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:56.300
They know what they're getting
when they download these apps.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.140
Last, but certainly not
least, we have AdMob.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.320
AdMob has been an
incredible channel

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.560
for driving app install
for the last few years.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.430
We've driven millions
upon millions of installs

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.570
through in-app ads.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.750
We've done a lot of
work here on ad formats.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.390
We've got a lot
more work going on

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.350
on the interstitial site of the
world, on video clip download,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.610
but we've also done a
lot of work on targeting.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.780
As I mentioned
earlier, we're bringing

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.430
in insights from
Google Play to help

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.545
us find the right users
in the AdMob network.

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:34.490
The example we have behind
us-- imagine a developer

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.620
who has a photography
or an imaging app.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.740
That developer wants to find
highly qualified users who

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.760
will download their app, engage,
and use it time and time again.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.110
I mean, it costs money
to acquire users.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.970
We're bringing in
insights about the users

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.100
that we have an Android.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.050
What apps have they
download already?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.140
What apps are those users using?

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.750
The example behind me--
we can narrow that down,

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.270
that wide audience down to a
set of users who has already

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.980
downloaded, installed, and
engaged in various photography

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.050
imaging video apps.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.210
We're already seeing
that this is delivering

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.630
much higher conversion
rates to advertisers

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.860
who are adopting
this technology.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.490
So that's acquisition.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.500
It's easy enough to spend
money or via organically,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.680
find a lot of users,
bring them into your app,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.754
but it's just the
beginning of the story.

00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:27.420
The next thing you have to do is
you have to excite those users.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.154
You have to engage them
in your experience.

00:12:31.154 --> 00:12:33.070
It's not installs that
matter, but it's really

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.200
time spent in your app.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.140
But before you even
get there, oftentimes--

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.420
if you think about it from
a funnel perspective--

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.860
start at the Play Store.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.430
There are plenty
of opportunities

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.750
to increase conversions,
increase your downloads

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.380
at the Play Store itself.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.360
This is why we've taken
the powerful visualization

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.270
technologies from
Google Analytics.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.500
We've brought them into the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.760
and we can now show you what's
happening on the Play Store.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.330
You get to see how many users
looked at your app listing.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.930
If they looked at
the app listing,

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.220
did they download the app?

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.690
If not, maybe you want to
try some different images?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.940
Maybe you want to try bringing
video to the Play Store

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.450
to showcase the app further.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.222
But there's a
particularly scary stat,

00:13:23.222 --> 00:13:24.930
because maybe a lot
of users have already

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.500
downloaded your app.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.370
But what we know
is that 80% of apps

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.800
are download,
installed, and run once.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.450
Just once, and then
they're deleted.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.880
They're never run again.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.600
So re-engagement, bringing
users back to your apps,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.235
is a critically important
piece of this puzzle.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.790
We're doing an awful
lot here, as well.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.270
Again, Sundar talked about some
of the deep linking efforts

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.436
that are happening on the
organic side of the world.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.480
We're bringing this
to ads, as well.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.300
The example I have behind me
is for a search ad, for AdWords

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.070
advertiser, for HotelTonight.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.580
The idea, the premise,
is very, very simple.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.290
You've flown into San
Francisco, Google I/O,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.150
but strangely, you didn't
have a hotel reservation.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.510
You're an avid HotelTonight fan.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.770
So you search for hotels
San Francisco on Google.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.910
Because HotelTonight
has taken advantage

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:26.910
of the deep linking technology
that we have in AdWords,

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.760
they're shown as
the first result.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.510
They're shown as the
top commercial result

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.670
for the user's query.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.230
And when the user
clicks on the ad,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.770
not only are they brought
back to the HotelTonight app,

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.630
but they're brought back to the
right place in the HotelTonight

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.990
app that shows relevant
listings for Union Square in San

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.670
Francisco that's only
a half a mile away.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.190
That's a powerful way
to reengage your users

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.520
and bring them deeply
back into your experience.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.170
Of course, it works
on AdMob as well.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.836
In this particular
case, you can imagine

00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:58.740
a user is in the middle of
some entertaining experience,

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.190
and Hulu advertises to
them in interstitial.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:03.980
Come back.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.590
You're a big Deadbeat fan.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.880
We know that you
have more episodes

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.316
to watch in your binge
session of Deadbeat.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:11.690
When you click
through on the ad,

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.280
you're not just brought
into the Hulu application,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.920
but you're brought deep
into the Deadbeat results.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.830
It's just the beginning
of some of the ways

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.510
that we're stitching together
not just search and apps,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.150
but really the
web app continuum.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.570
We're also finding more
ways to weave users

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.210
through their paths
in apps alone.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.730
You're going to see
a lot more here,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.700
but this is going
to become a mainstay

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.565
in how users think about the
experience-- and I think,

00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:42.360
and about how all of you think
about bringing users back

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.380
to your apps, as well.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.980
Ultimately, it's
about monetization.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.810
You've worked very, very hard
to build a strong audience--

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.980
to engage them, excite
them, keep them coming back

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.760
time and time again.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.260
But the key piece
is monetization.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.620
How you earn more in this world?

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.710
Well, it's getting complicated,
and there's more and more

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.300
hybrid models that are growing.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.650
Remember, we've talked a lot
about how it's about the user.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.810
You want to deliver the
right piece of monetization

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.210
to the right user
at the right time.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.310
We're going to talk about how
these hybrid models get built

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.980
and how you can all leverage
our tools to build them

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.930
more easily.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.450
But before we do,
what we thought

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.790
we'd do is to break
down the three pieces,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.850
the three atomic
monetization elements as we

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.640
see them and talk a little
bit about them in isolation.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.620
First is e-commerce.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.560
Any of the retailers
or merchants

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.000
that I have in
the audience today

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.390
will know that this has been a
very, very fast-growing segment

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.760
of the overall
mobile apps business.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.140
It's taken us a little
while, because early

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.290
on in the development
of mobile, we just

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.244
threw these complex
forms at our users,

00:16:55.244 --> 00:16:56.910
and we expected that
they would pull out

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.520
their tiny little devices
and type in their credit card

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.180
information, their billing
address, and everything else

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.950
to get their $35 ChromeCast.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.319
But that's a lot of work,
that's a lot of friction.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.240
That's where tools like Google
Wallet with Insta-buy come in.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.720
It's a handy set of APIs
that's very, very easy

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.130
for any app
developer to plug in.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.700
We take those 20
forms, those 20 fields

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.300
that users have to fill in.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.050
And if the user is already
a Google Wallet user,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.460
well then it's just two clicks.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.790
Talk about reducing friction.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.320
It's tools like Google
Wallet Insta-buy that

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.050
have continued to
smooth things out,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.830
to reduce friction
for end users,

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.950
and have really helped to
grow the e-commerce businesses

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.920
in mobile and in
mobile applications.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.890
We've talked a lot so far
about in-app purchase.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.430
Game developers
understand how much value

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.310
is available through
in-app purchases.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.750
Again, it's often ways to enable
users to play the game longer.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.250
You've already
got engaged users.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.260
They will generally do this--
to download customization,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.640
extra weapons, cars,
levels-- goodness,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.790
all kinds of different things.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.510
There are tools,
there are technologies

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.000
that you can use to show
the right in-app purchase

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.780
to the right user
at the right time.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.870
It's critical that you figure
out who those users are.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.880
Because remember, in many
cases, it's fewer than 5%

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.240
of users who are
driving more than 90%

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.570
of this in-app purchase revenue.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:33.560
Last but certainly
not least is ads.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.140
Ads have been an incredible
channel for monetizing apps.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.910
AdMob as an ad network
has grown phenomenally

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.850
over the last couple of years.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.110
We now serve 200 billion
impressions a month.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.500
We're seen on over 900 million
unique devices in over 600,000

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.410
apps on iOS and Android.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.710
And we've paid out more
than a billion dollars

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.510
to our developers in the
last couple of years.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.910
But it's just the beginning.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.639
We're really excited about what
we can do with ads in apps.

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:06.680
We've seen a lot on the
banner side of the world,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.640
but we're growing
our inventory, we're

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.910
growing our demand in
interstitials, as well.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.360
These are these full
screen ad units.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.180
These full screen ad units
make it much easier for users

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.017
to understand what is going,
to understand if they interact,

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:21.100
what they're going to get.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.870
They pre-qualify
users much, much more.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.470
They are easy to dismiss.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.940
They tend to not get
in the way and disrupt

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.370
game play, for example,
like banners do.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.830
And they deliver
much, much higher CPMs

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.820
to developers, so all of you
as developers can think more

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.570
carefully, more
consciously, about when

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.340
you show interstitials.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.610
You can reduce the ad
load on your end users

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.970
significantly, driving
better user experiences.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.050
As we mentioned
earlier, video is

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.540
growing on mobile at
very, very fast rates,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.180
and it's a great
way to monetize.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.840
TrueView has been an
incredible video ad

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.610
format for Google
and for YouTube,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.580
and demand for TrueView
has grown significantly

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.230
over the last three
or four years.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.330
We're in the process
of bringing TrueView

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.700
to our mobile app developers.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.590
It's an interstitial ad format
that puts users in control,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.610
because if they choose
at the ad is irrelevant

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.140
for them, after five seconds
they can skip it and get back

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.300
to the experience
that they're in.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.120
But true view is great
for app developers,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.210
as well, because it
monetizes even more highly

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.330
than what we're seeing
with interstitials.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.849
As we continue to
roll out TrueView,

00:20:26.849 --> 00:20:29.390
we think you're all going to be
excited about what it can do,

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.370
not just for your
monetization, but what

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.580
it can do to keep your
users engaged and interested

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.180
in your app.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.710
So we've talked a
lot about the basics,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.050
but what we thought would
really help all of you

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.340
was to see this in action.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.540
We're really excited to
have a great partner with us

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.430
here today, PicsArt.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.654
Representing PicsArt
is Hovhannes,

00:20:50.654 --> 00:20:52.320
who's going to talk
through what they've

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.900
done to embrace this mobile
app economy and all the changes

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900
that we've seen.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.704
Hovhannes.

00:20:57.704 --> 00:20:58.870
HOVHANNES AVOYAN: Thank you.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.690
Hello, everyone.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.880
My name is Hovhannes Avoyan.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.410
I am a CEO and
founder of PicsArt.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.890
We've started PicsArt
in November 2011

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:15.210
with a group of 10 people, and
two and a half years later, we

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.240
have a team of IT professionals,
mostly software developers.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.360
What do we do?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.340
We started the company
with the mission

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.510
to enable anyone to create
extraordinary works of art out

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.860
of ordinary photos
and be discovered

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.060
to our network of creatives.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.630
Basically, it's a very
powerful photo editor

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.420
integrated with an artistic
photo sharing network.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.190
We built a tremendous community.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:52.970
We have about a 4.5 star rating
out of 2.5 million people.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.790
The application was installed
over 140 million times

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.300
on different platforms,
mostly Android.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.700
We have almost 45 million
montly active users.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.850
We are very proud
of our community.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.710
Why are we here?

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.080
Just to tell our
monetization story.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.670
PicsArt is a free application.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.910
We boosted up our business, and
we are profitable right now.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.111
We started with advertisement
as a single-revenue opportunity

00:22:21.111 --> 00:22:21.610
for us.

00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:26.500
A couple of months
ago, we started

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.370
implementing in-app purchase.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.600
In-app purchase is
very important for us

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.350
because it's allowed us to
diversify our revenue stream,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.200
but also, it provides
better experience

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.560
for our premium customers.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.980
Now, we are about split
between in-app purchase

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:45.380
and advertisement, which 20% is
coming out of in-app purchase.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.820
It's one of the growing
segments for us.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.750
We personally believe we
can be even more successful.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.170
What do we need for that?

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.610
We really need good analytics.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.760
We need the analytics
which help us to understand

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.330
who are our users, what they
do with our application,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.820
how our application performs.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.750
With all that knowledge, we want
to apply different monetization

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.230
strategies to different
kinds of users.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.530
We really hope that
partnering with AdMob

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.190
and having all
these new features

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.817
will help us to reach the goal.

00:23:18.817 --> 00:23:19.650
Thank you very much.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.610
We are excited to
be an AdMob partner.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.322
Back to you.

00:23:24.322 --> 00:23:26.030
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Thank you, Hovhannes.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.739
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:29.780
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: I
think that's a particularly

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.600
compelling example.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.310
But I think what
matters to all of you

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.770
is actually how this happens in
practice-- what we've provided

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.380
for tools and technology to
make all of this as easy for you

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.570
as it can be.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.400
And for that, I am thrilled
to bring up my good friend

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.030
and colleague, Babak
Pahlavan, who leads up

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.324
our Google Analytics products.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:51.240
He's going to walk you
through this in detail.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.430
Babak.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.070
BABAK PAHLAVAN:
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.170
Thank you very much.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.170
All right.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.440
Good afternoon.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.390
We have a lot of
folks in the audience.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.250
Good afternoon to our
folks on livestream.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.070
Let's talk about monetization.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.390
As most of you guys know,
earlier in the year,

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.240
we announced the deep
integration of Google Analytics

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.680
with AdMob.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.060
Together, the integration
between Play, AdMob, and GA,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.870
we are offering a
unified platform

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.630
that's job is to focus on
optimizing your monetization

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:36.110
strategy by really
focusing on your users.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.570
One unified dashboard inside
AdMob that would actually

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:42.595
help you to monetize,
promote, and analyze.

00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:46.410
The thing that we're
going to talk about today,

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:51.620
specifically, is around
how to further apply

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.430
the same philosophy
that we all have--

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.030
by focusing on your users, we
can build much better apps.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.800
That something that
we all understand.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.280
If I focus on building
apps that are really

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.790
tailored to my users,
engagement would just go higher,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.210
and I'd end up actually
building more delightful apps,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.570
and everyone is happier.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.880
How about applying
the same philosophy

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.530
on our monetization strategy--
focusing on your users

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.330
to better monetize?

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.820
Specifically, there's
a lot of techniques

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.310
that are happening in industry.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.580
But as we all know, the
[INAUDIBLE] is on the rise.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.690
As Hovhannes actually
mentioned, in-app purchase

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.570
is becoming the tool of
choice to better monetize

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.190
your products.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:42.430
In general, for
a lot of us, when

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.840
we talk about
monetizing our products,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.065
the high level categorizes
our users into two buckets.

00:25:48.065 --> 00:25:51.800
You have casual users that
download the products,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.400
they use it a little bit.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.300
You also have then
some of these guys,

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.500
they become engaged users.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.190
They become your frequent users.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.100
How do we monetize?

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.660
Normally, a lot of us,
we just use ad networks,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.710
we use AdMob and other
places, to place an ad

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.842
in front of our casual users.

00:26:09.842 --> 00:26:12.300
But for engaged users, we are
looking for something better.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.350
They would actually
want something

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.930
that would enhance
the experience.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:21.480
A lot of us use IAP to
sell them, the next eagle,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.155
the next soccer,
football, or something.

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:29.710
That's a high level story.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.340
As we look at it, a lot of
our highly sophisticated

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.910
developers, they end up
using a lot of the systems

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:41.370
that we offer to really
tailor their in-app purchase

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.350
campaigns, but on users.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.169
It's become sort of
difficult to use,

00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:48.210
and you have to have a
lot of developers in house

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:49.920
to pull that off.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.740
What we really want
to do is to not only

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:56.490
make in-app purchase
better and more optimized,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.880
not just for bigger
guys, but for everybody.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.120
We want to democratize access
to this technology for all.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.370
Let's go through an example,
so that we can actually

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.600
clarify the specific
that we're launching.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.880
I'm an app developer.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.740
I come to my AdMob's
main homepage.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.210
This is the main AdMob Home tab.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.630
I can see the lay of the land.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.930
I get to see how
much earnings I have,

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.470
my revenue conversions, and
also sessions and engagements.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.840
We have two demo apps
that we are using.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.370
These are real apps
that we've developed.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.000
They're in the Play Store, but
they use it for testing a lot.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.636
They're real, but it's our
zero, as you can imagine.

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:40.510
I have two apps here.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.530
I have Color Drips
and I have GameFans.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.689
They're doing sort of
well, but if I look deeper,

00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:47.980
Color Drips-- even though
the ads earnings for this one

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.680
is higher, the total earnings
a lot less than GameFans.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.910
I wonder why.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.920
I look deeper, and
realize that even though I

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.910
have in-app purchase
enabled in both,

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.360
this one is not doing as
well as the other one.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.600
I only can see 23
transactions that

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.240
are happening on Color Drips.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.930
I wonder why.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.250
I wonder what's
really happening here.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:14.302
When I look at my app, I have
an interstitial ad running here.

00:28:14.302 --> 00:28:15.260
It's a good looking ad.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.560
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.600
But the challenge
is that all my users

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.360
see the same ad, and the same
ad format and everything.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.219
I'm sure the ad network is
a good job of optimizing

00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:29.260
this as much as possible.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.410
But ultimately, all my
users are seeing this one ad

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.870
campaign for my in-app purchase.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.420
I wonder if we can do better.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.750
Let's analyze this.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.790
I come back to AdMob.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.920
I click on the Analyze tab.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.240
Then I come to the Audience
section and our locations.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.520
I understand globally what's
happening with my users--

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.960
where is everybody?

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.420
As I look at this
a little deeper,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.082
I notice that my
Brazilian users, they

00:28:58.082 --> 00:28:59.790
tend to be more engaged
with the product,

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.250
and they tend to buy something
from the in-app purchase

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.670
campaign.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.010
That's an immediate
insight that I

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.530
wouldn't have had
if I didn't use

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.930
Google Analytics inside AdMob.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.190
That's one insight that's born.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.179
I can see that Brazilian
users are engaged,

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:21.470
and they tend to buy something.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.470
I wonder if it has something
to do with the fact

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.450
that everyone is in
Brazil, and they're

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.760
taking a lot of good photos of
the soccer games, or football,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.720
as we call it.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.200
Let's see if I can actually
build a monetization campaign

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.660
exclusively focused
on these folks.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.900
Notice on the left
hand side, there

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.430
is a new option, a new
menu that we're enabling.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.830
It's called Audience Builder.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.640
If I click on that,
my hypothesis this--

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.820
if I can actually
build a campaign that

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.900
shows a difference
IAP purchase ad

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.770
to my engaged Brazilian
users-- if I could do that,

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.350
my hypothesis is
that I'm going to be

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.191
able to actually
earn more money.

00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:07.190
That's the goal that
Jonathan was talking about.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.481
We all want to earn more money.

00:30:08.481 --> 00:30:11.430
We want to monetize better,
but at the same time,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.700
we don't want to
sacrifice user experience.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.390
When I click on
Audience Builder,

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.056
this brings up GA's powerful
segmentation builder.

00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:22.180
For those of you guys that
are GA users on the web,

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.110
you're familiar with this.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.610
But this is now the
tailored version

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.530
of this, exclusively
on mobile apps.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.330
It's incredibly powerful.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:32.490
In fact, this is offering
250 plus dimensions,

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.090
and it can build 20
combinations of these.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.570
Now the math nerd in me wants
to know what's that number,

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.922
what's the permutation
count to that?

00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:44.630
It turns out it's
actually 4 to the power

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.670
47 different permutations
you can create.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.980
I've been told that's more
than the number of starts

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.750
we have in our known
universe, or more

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.490
than the number of sounds
that we have on planet Earth.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:02.350
But of course, we want to
give you back to power.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.392
The point is this is incredibly
powerful segmentation builder.

00:31:05.392 --> 00:31:06.850
I'm going to run
through an example

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.975
so you can see what it is
that we're talking about.

00:31:08.975 --> 00:31:12.070
By dimensions, of course,
I mean age, location,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.090
differently behavior
metrics, such as time

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.094
on app, language,
and yadda yadda.

00:31:19.094 --> 00:31:20.010
Let's go through this.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.950
Let's build an audience list.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:22.880
I come back here.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:28.100
I click on Behavior, and I see
that it says Session Duration.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.570
I want to focus on
users that are spending

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.150
at least 10 minutes with my app.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:38.010
So I put down 600 seconds in the
Session Builder, click on Save,

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.570
then I come back
to the demographic,

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.450
then I can see that there's
a Location option down there.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.210
I can just come down
and type in Brazil.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.730
Brazil gets typed,
and I press on Save,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.680
and as soon as the clicker
moves, we're running.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.805
Now what I've done
is I'm almost there.

00:31:58.805 --> 00:32:01.720
I've actually created a
segment, an audience list,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.060
that says only
focus on users, only

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.890
find me users that spend at
least 10 minutes on the product

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.337
and that come from Brazil.

00:32:09.337 --> 00:32:10.170
I'll give it a name.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:14.760
I'll call it Brazil, highly
engaged users, and off I go.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.510
Now I have an audience list.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.630
Now I come back to my
normal business as usual

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.450
with AdMob, the
Great Promote tab.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:25.630
I click on that, and I
can create a new campaign.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:30.000
I choose my creative elements,
then I come back here.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.710
There is a new option that
is getting enabled, called

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.010
Audience.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:39.270
I can click on Audience, and
lo and behold, my Brazilian,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.940
highly engaged users
should be there.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.700
The audience list
that we just created.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.500
I add that to my audience list.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.935
And notice you can create
all kinds of permutations.

00:32:47.935 --> 00:32:50.390
You can create all kinds
of different rules,

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:55.400
and add different lists
on the one campaign,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.270
or you can create multiple
campaigns with multiple lists.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.020
The power is in your hands.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.530
I click on Save, and
I click on Continue.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.460
What's really happening here?

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.570
It used to be that all
my users would just

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.980
see this one interstitial ad.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.900
Now, users-- using
this new campaign

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.350
that I'm running-- users
are coming from Brazil,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.230
but are also engaged.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.355
They've spent at least 10
minutes with the product.

00:33:21.355 --> 00:33:23.450
They're going to see
something different.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.530
They're going to see an IAP
campaign that's exclusively

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:28.110
focused on them.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:34.090
Just imagine how many
different campaigns

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.150
you can try out,
how much power is

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.390
now back in your guys' hands.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.200
It's not difficult.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.000
It's super easy to use.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.480
Again, we wanted to make
sure to democratize access

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.840
to this technology to everybody.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.220
Key takeaways--
Google is working

00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:01.060
on building an integrated,
cross-platform,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.570
very easy system
to ultimately help

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.380
you developers more successful.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.890
We are committed to making
you guys more successful.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.060
As we announced
earlier in the year,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.449
deep integration of GA within
AdMob is the first step.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.650
We have a lot more work
to do, we understand,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:25.050
but we are committing real
resources behind this effort.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.159
Second takeaway here
is it's imperative

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:31.159
that you spend time
understanding your users,

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.460
not just to tailor your
app, but also to tailor

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.989
your monetization campaigns.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.520
It ends up paying
off significantly.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.409
Third, with Google
Analytics inside of AdMob,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.270
you have an immense
amount of power

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.110
to really understand your users.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.073
But now, more and
more, take advantage

00:34:50.073 --> 00:34:51.489
of all the
technologies that we're

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:56.199
enabling inside GA for apps to
really tailor your monetization

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.180
campaigns.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.154
Make sense?

00:35:00.154 --> 00:35:02.320
One last thing I wanted to
actually talk to you guys

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.660
about, if this slide
loads-- there's

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.676
a lot that we're doing
across Google for mobile apps

00:35:09.676 --> 00:35:12.050
developers, and we're trying
to consolidate the knowledge

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.180
base for this.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.360
You have a MOOC-- you
have a Massive Open Online

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.647
Course that we offer
at Google Analytics.

00:35:18.647 --> 00:35:19.980
It's going to go live in August.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.570
This one's going to
be exclusively focused

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.195
on mobile apps.

00:35:22.195 --> 00:35:23.770
Make sure you sign up for that.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.019
We're going to talk about
the best practices, the best

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:29.350
strategies that you can learn
in order to be successful.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.480
Last time, we ran the
MOOC on levels general GA.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.750
We had 135,000 people who
signed up, and 35,000 graduated.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.850
We expect the same sort of
turnout for this one, as well.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.090
Yeah, that's on that.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.064
That's the link for this,
for Analytics Academy

00:35:44.064 --> 00:35:44.730
with Google.com.

00:35:48.314 --> 00:35:50.480
For those that haven't
signed up for AdMob, go ahead

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.938
and sign up with
AdMob, and you get

00:35:51.938 --> 00:35:54.360
to have access to all the great
stuff we just talked about

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.880
over the next couple months.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.410
Thank you so much,
and that's it.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:58.920
Thank you.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.061
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:05.060
BABAK PAHLAVAN: I think
we have about 10 minutes

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:06.252
for a few questions.

00:36:06.252 --> 00:36:08.168
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: We
have time for question,

00:36:08.168 --> 00:36:10.400
but we're also happy to
just take them individually

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.476
if you guys want to
come up front later.

00:36:12.476 --> 00:36:14.100
Any questions that
you guys want to ask

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.050
in part of the broader audience?

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.425
BABAK PAHLAVAN:
Also, we're going

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.310
to have office hours
at 3:30, by the way.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.750
So Google Analytics and AdMob.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.399
We're going to be
on the second floor.

00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:24.440
We're going to be answering
questions one by one.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.600
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Our
developers, our teams

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.380
down there helping you
guys, but yeah, go ahead.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:27.880
Question.

00:36:30.657 --> 00:36:32.240
Everything that we
talked about today,

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.781
essentially all of
the announcements,

00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:36.540
are things that are either
out now-- so the AdMob Google

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.390
Analytics integration,
for example,

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.210
is something that you can go
download and play with today.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.439
Or things that are rolling
out in the next quarter.

00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:45.480
BABAK PAHLAVAN: Specifically
the Audience Builder

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.750
we were talking
about, so that one's

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.291
going to be available
sometime in Q3.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.250
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Questions?

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.423
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:55.423 --> 00:36:56.389
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.500
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Should the
targeting tools be automatic?

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.209
Do you want to--?

00:37:02.209 --> 00:37:04.083
BABAK PAHLAVAN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:06.800
The question was shouldn't
these things be automatic?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.520
Absolutely, we believe in that.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.357
There are two modes to this.

00:37:10.357 --> 00:37:12.940
One is that a lot of developers
actually want to have control.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.710
They're the ones that
they know the users,

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.168
and they want to
segment, they want

00:37:16.168 --> 00:37:19.730
to build some of the campaigns
that are highly optimized

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.200
the way they think about it.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.030
They set up the rules, and then
the rest of it is automated.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.340
However, in fact, on GA,
we announced something

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.060
that we call a Smart List.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.880
This is for general web
marketing campaigns.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.610
That allows you,
now-- we actually

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.472
pick the right set of users
automatically for you.

00:37:38.472 --> 00:37:40.180
I can imagine the same
sort of technology

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.610
is going to make its way
to app developers, as well.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.110
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
I'll be a blend.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.840
We will try to do as
much of this for you

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.150
as we can, automatically
through experiments and testing,

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.800
et cetera.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.860
But you will always be able to
find some set of insights that

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.110
automated machines can't.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.810
We encourage you guys to take
a look at the data yourselves

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:03.390
and try to ferret out those
valuable opportunities, too.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.070
Yeah, go ahead.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.924
Sorry, let me take-- there's
a question at the mic first,

00:38:08.924 --> 00:38:11.090
and then I'll come back to
the gentleman in the hat.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.180
So from the mic, first.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.180
AUDIENCE: Are you guys
looking at doing anything

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.269
with native ad formats?

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:16.560
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Absolutely.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.730
We've been working hard
at AdMob across a bunch

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.880
of our different channels to
find the right native solutions

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.020
to bring to bear.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.050
We're experimenting with a
number of different varieties

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.650
right now to find what works
best integrated into apps.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.580
I don't have anything
for general availability

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.550
to announce just yet.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.230
We can maybe chat
briefly after this.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.570
But my expectation is that
in the next quarter or two,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.010
we'll have a general
availability beta.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.510
Thank you.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.469
That's a good question.

00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:46.176
Now to the gentleman
in the hat, and then

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:47.460
I'll come back to the mics.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:56.080
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: AB
testing in the Play Store.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.020
BABAK PAHLAVAN: Yes.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.530
There's a number of
efforts on that front.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.210
The question was, are
we going to enable

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.000
AB testing
experimentation for apps?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.360
In fact, you can do that right
now using Google Tag Manager.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.100
If you use GTM for
mobile apps, we actually

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.000
enable you to do AB
testing for mobile apps.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.212
Not just on Android, but
also on iOS, as well.

00:39:16.212 --> 00:39:18.170
You're going to see us
integrating these things

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.787
further and further
inside the app,

00:39:19.787 --> 00:39:21.120
so integration becomes seamless.

00:39:27.909 --> 00:39:30.200
I know that the Play team is
looking at that, actually,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:35.470
to enable different
strategies all together.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.760
You raise a very good point.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.300
Do I know if paid works
better, or free works better,

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.434
or [INAUDIBLE] work better?

00:39:40.434 --> 00:39:41.850
You can imagine
that we're working

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.401
toward enabling you guys
to really figure that out.

00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:46.900
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Back to the mic.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.320
AUDIENCE: Are you guys planning
to add more transparency

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.890
in terms of the search terms,
how people are actually

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.360
discovering your apps
on the Play Store?

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.560
Because right now, it's
a complete black box.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.220
You don't really
know whether you

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.930
get discovered by featuring,
by search terms, et cetera.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.830
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
It's a good question,

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.011
and you're not alone
in asking the question.

00:40:07.011 --> 00:40:09.260
We don't have anything to
announce there specifically.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.140
I think the thing
that is closest

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.140
is in bringing those insights
over AdWords so that search

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.050
advertisers can leverage
some of the same key words,

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.110
so that might be a
bit of a round robin

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.130
approach to gaining
some of those insights.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.320
We'll make sure the Play Store
team keeps hearing the feedback

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.875
and thinks about providing
that form of analytics.

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.500
BABAK PAHLAVAN:
Because it makes sense,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.050
your question makes sense.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.234
AUDIENCE: It is there on
the web for years already.

00:40:34.234 --> 00:40:35.400
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Exactly.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.600
AUDIENCE: And I don't
really understand

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.410
why it's not there
in the Play Store.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.910
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
My guess is it's

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.889
nothing more than
prioritization and getting it

00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:41.930
to the top of the stacks.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.050
So that's why we'll
lean on them when

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.425
we give it back
to Mountain View.

00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:46.040
Thank you.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.890
Other questions?

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.239
Go ahead.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:50.237
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:21.029 --> 00:41:22.570
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.556
So we have house
ad support in AdMob

00:41:24.556 --> 00:41:25.930
that allows you
to take advantage

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.471
of exactly what
you're talking about.

00:41:27.471 --> 00:41:30.600
If you have a number of apps
that you deliver, and you have

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.030
AdMob in all of those apps,
you can set up house campaigns

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.040
to cross promote
to your other apps,

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.650
and you can actually
yield manage that

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.160
across some of your
house campaigns,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.820
as well as your
third party demand.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.900
What we're starting to talk
about with Google Analytics

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.570
integration is that
you can do much

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.820
more sophisticated segmentation
and decision engine type

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.415
logic to figure out
who gets what, as well.

00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:51.345
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:55.081 --> 00:41:56.080
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Yep.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.950
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: It's free.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.700
It's your inventory, right.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.490
You're just giving up additional
monetization opportunities

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:12.255
to show your own ad, to show
your own cross promotion.

00:42:12.255 --> 00:42:14.990
Yeah.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.960
Make sure you stop
by the office hours

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.720
if you'd like that are
starting just in a few minutes.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.982
They'll walk you through
what you need to do there.

00:42:22.982 --> 00:42:25.190
BABAK PAHLAVAN: But imagine
with this new capability,

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.197
you can actually now-- I mean,
ultimately, monetization,

00:42:29.197 --> 00:42:30.280
we're not concerned about.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.446
We want to create the best
experience for the users,

00:42:32.446 --> 00:42:35.030
and then if you end up actually
promoting different apps

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.090
we download using
Play Store, so there's

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.950
monetization for
us from that angle.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.740
Not necessarily on
the app side, but--

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:42.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:48.462 --> 00:42:50.420
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Look,
many of our customers

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.410
are already doing this,
so it's a great thing

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.294
to take advantage of.

00:42:53.294 --> 00:42:53.960
Other questions?

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.168
I see another one at the mic.

00:42:55.168 --> 00:42:57.790
AUDIENCE: So this deep linking
solution that was announced,

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.880
is that specific for
Android only, right?

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.964
It's not available on iOS?

00:43:01.964 --> 00:43:03.421
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
It is currently

00:43:03.421 --> 00:43:04.900
an Android-only offering.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.862
We're looking deeply at what
we need to do on the iOS side.

00:43:08.862 --> 00:43:10.570
I don't know this off
the top of my head.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.050
No, it is Android only right
now, it's a great question.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.680
We'll let you guys know when
we have a solution for iOS,

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.180
as well.

00:43:18.606 --> 00:43:20.980
BABAK PAHLAVAN: Something to
call out, actually, on this.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.260
Our objective is to create
the cross-platform solution.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.580
We understand that
app developers would

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.490
like to be-- when
you're an app developer,

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.950
you want all the different
platforms, right?

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.820
You're not Android
exclusive a lot of times.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.820
Because it's Google, you
have a lot more access,

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.977
you have a lot more freedom,
you have a lot more acceleration

00:43:40.977 --> 00:43:41.810
that you can deploy.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.660
But then we're always interested
to work with other platforms,

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.800
because once again, we
believe that's the only way

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.814
you guys can
successful altogether.

00:43:48.814 --> 00:43:50.730
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: We're
running low on time.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.440
Why don't we wrap up.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.770
If you guys have
additional questions,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:53.670
you'll find us up front.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.586
Thank you guys, again.

00:43:54.586 --> 00:43:56.420
BABAK PAHLAVAN:
Thank you so much.
