00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.970
Everyone needs sleep, but for many birds,
by necessity this has to happen while perched

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.910
on a branch or other place that must be gripped.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.510
Anyone who has ever fallen asleep reading
and found her book on the floor knows how

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.230
difficult it can be to hold onto something
while snoozing.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.020
So how do perching birds do it?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.891
Powered by tendons, the feet of grasping birds
(think perching birds and raptors) have a

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:39.030
pair of them in the back, flexor digitorum
longus and flexor halluciss longus, which

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.330
are connected to deep flexor muscles in the
leg.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.590
The digitorum branches and works the three
toes in the front, while the hallucis works

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.960
the back toe, known as the hallux.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.280
Both stretch over the ankle, and when the
bird lands and the ankle bends, this forces

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.460
both tendons to automatically pull, thus clenching
the toes closed.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.750
As long as the ankle is bent, the tendons
and toes are locked into place.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.180
For perching birds, this results in a dependable
grip that lasts even when sleeping.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.030
Raptors use this automatic response for another
purpose as well – grasping prey.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.619
As the raptor approaches its victim, its legs
are outstretched, but when it lands, its ankles

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.770
bend, pulling the tendons and closing the
toes – resulting in a firm grip on its dinner.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.319
Even in flight, as long as the bird’s legs
are bent, the tendons and toes remain locked

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.740
on the prey.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.759
Not all birds have this feature, and for those
forced to sleep on the ground, some have developed

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.880
another adaptation to slumber safely – sleeping
with one eye open.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.930
Known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, some
birds, like mallard ducks, can keep half of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.750
their brain (and its corresponding eye) alert
while allowing the other half to take a break.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.329
With the mallards, they often rest in a row,
with the ducks on the ends closing the eye

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:08.060
next to their neighbors, but keeping the eye
facing potential danger open.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.300
Like the mallard ducks, dolphins and whales
often sleep with one eye open in order to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300
avoid being eaten by sharks.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.849
The ability to stay partially conscious also
allows them to continue to get air while sleeping.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.400
How dolphins handle this is to put one half
of their brain to sleep, while the other half

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.320
is still conscious and functioning.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.970
They then alternate which side is sleeping
periodically.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.780
They stay in this state for approximately
eight hours a day.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.379
Doing this allows them to be conscious enough
to control their breathing and periodically

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:58.799
swim to the surface and get air, while still
giving their brain the rest it needs.
