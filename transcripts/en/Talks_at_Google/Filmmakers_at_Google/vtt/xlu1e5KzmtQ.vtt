00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you for joining us
for an exclusive screening of "Last Call of

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.060
the Oasis."

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.140
And we are joined here today with the director
of the film.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.670
I'd like to introduce to you, Jessica Yu.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.900
[applause]

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.810
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Thanks, guys.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.810
Thanks so much.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.340
And I would love if you have any questions.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.520
As you can see, the film kinda covers a lot
of ground.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.020
So, I imagine there could be a lot of different
questions as well.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.470
Anybody have anything?

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.110
Yes, please.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:44.620
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Well, us being
here in California, specifically Bay Area,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.760
which probably has a pretty good regime of
enforcement--at least that's the public perception

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.719
among Bay Area people--that we've got the
strong management districts and water is--.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.969
Although, we try to conserve, it's not like
a local problem--at least that's the Bay Area

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:04.969
perception.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:05.969
Could you talk about that?

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:06.969
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Sure.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.020
Well, what's interesting is that everything
about water is connected, right?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.759
So, you might have a strong water district
in one area, but if there's a lot of water

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:16.759
pressures--.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.520
You know, there's the chapter in the film
that's about water in California in agriculture.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.159
And I just remember being--.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.939
I mean, I grew up in Northern California and
I remember growing up.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.209
We were very aware of drought, but drought
was always something that felt like it was

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.319
a periodic thing.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.119
We have a really dry year.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.509
Then you have the bucket in the shower and
you got the low-flow shower head that just

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.360
feels like someone's spitting on you.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.229
[chuckles] We did those kind of measures.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.719
And what was really stunning to me working
on this film was seeing that we have a lot

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.719
of the same problems.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:57.729
But the time frame in which really dire consequences
will be happening is really short.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.459
So in the film, we talk about California.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.450
What people are taking into account is the
use and reliance on ground water.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.869
So, in agriculture, hey, you know, you get
low rain fall that year, we're just digging

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.950
deeper into our ground water sources.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.780
And the tricky thing is no one knows how much
is left.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.160
You can tell how much is taken out, but anytime
you're taking water out of the ground then,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.200
of course, the quality of water gets compromised.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.612
And then a lot of this is water that's just
not being replenished at the rate that it's

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.640
been taken out or not replenished at all.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.940
So that's the real big mystery.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.450
So, when we had Jay Famiglietti, who's the
professor there who is using NASA technology

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.160
to study levels of ground water, when he said
that the aquifer under the Central Valley,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.440
where a quarter of our produce is grown, maybe
there's low end 60 years that those aquifers

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.020
could be depleted, I just remember feeling
like, walking out there a little stunned thinking,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.770
"This isn't far off.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.780
This is a generation."

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.290
So, I think that's the wake-up call of all
of California.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.720
Yes.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.150
Questions?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.580
Hi.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.890
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Absolutely beautiful
to watch and look at.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.180
And I learned a lot about this, so thank you
very much.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Thank you.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.220
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I do understand,
I mean, most projects like this there's only

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.550
so much you can put in.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.020
So, is there anything that you really look
back at putting so much work into this going,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.890
"I wish this could've gone in there, but it
just can't?"

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.900
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: That's a really good question.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
OK.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.900
So, two things.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.900
One is that--.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.970
And actually, I don't know if I wish we could've
put it in there, but a big issue that is not

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.290
really covered in the film is the whole area
of water law.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.710
I mean, this is one problem.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.900
You could talk about conservation.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.960
You could talk about changing agricultural
practices.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.200
But the truth is, and especially in the United
States, from state to state, the ownership

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.850
of water and how people can access it--it's
different in different regions.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.090
And anytime you talk about taking someone's
water rights away, it's a huge mess.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.709
Like, Robert Glennon, who's one of the experts
in the film, he talked about how--.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.600
He said if you want to be employed for the
rest of your life easily, go into water law.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.790
It's gonna be--.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.790
And it's, that's--.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.259
I think it's scary because, even apart from
politics, I don't know legally how you can

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.639
stop things from being gummed up in the courts
when the time frame is so small.

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.349
The other thing that I wanted to put in the
film was the section on Singapore.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.629
When we first went to Singapore, I was interested
in trying to make more of a connection between

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.820
water supply--quantity--and quality.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.389
And so, this whole issue of sanitation was
really big for us.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.250
So, we went there to go to the World Toilet
Summit.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.250
[laughter] And it sounded like such an exciting
event.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.070
And they have all this new toilet technology.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.789
A lot of it is about waterless toilets, but
it's also addressing the need for greater

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.740
sanitation because you have two point six
billion people around the world who don't

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.740
have access to sanitation.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.710
And so, you have a lot of water-borne disease.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.759
You have pollution of water resources.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.259
And it's a terrible problem.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:16.050
So, we filmed with a wonderful Singaporean
former businessman named Jack Sim.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.270
And he calls himself Mr. Toilet.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.830
And he's got such a great story because when
he turned 40, he decided--.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.850
He had 14 companies and he had this epiphany
where he thought, "What am I doing this for?

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.449
I could just keep doing this, but what's my
life about?"

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.240
So, he decided to look at where was a cause
that had the greatest need.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.059
And he ended up turning to sanitation because
it's such a taboo.

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.309
So, that's what he's been doing for years.

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.719
We filmed a little segment about him.

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.270
Couldn't fit it into this film, but we cut
a short that was just at Sundance and it was

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.270
called "Meet Mr. Toilet."

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.199
So, that one had a happy ending because we
were able to do something separate with it.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.199
Yes.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.830
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Hi.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.169
Jessica, thank you for sharing "Last Call
at the Oasis" with us here at Google.

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.389
I was curious.

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.159
The film is coming out in May, being released
by Participant Media.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.469
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Actually, the film is being
released by ATO, which is a distribution company

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.400
called Art Takes Over.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.069
Participant was more of the funding entity,
but everyone's working together to get the

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.069
word out.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.069
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: OK.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:21.069
Great.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.080
So, Participant is well-known for other provocative
documentaries like "Inconvenient Truth," "Food,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.550
Inc.," and I was curious as to what type of
action are you hoping people to take after

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.809
watching this film?

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:39.559
Is it largely to inform the public or are
you hoping to actually influence some of these

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:40.559
water issues?

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:41.559
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: OK.

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:42.559
That's an excellent question.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:47.380
And actually, if you have more specific questions
along those lines, Lynn Hirshfield from Participant

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.380
is here.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.719
She's sitting at the back table there.

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:55.240
Well, the interesting thing about water is
it's such a multi-faceted issue.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.779
And at the end, people said, "Well, are you
gonna have a list of things that people can

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:01.490
do, actions you can take?"

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.080
And it's hard because there's actually--.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.490
It's a strength in that there are so many
different things that we could do.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.469
So, I think it can look like a pretty desperate
picture until you realize that because most

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.569
of us really aren't doing too much to address
water, that it if everyone were to do something,

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.930
we could really make a big difference.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.259
So, the point is, I think, that what we were
looking at is changes that you could do on

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:34.349
the micro level--swapping out your lawn, taking
shorter showers, getting more efficient appliances--to

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:39.669
the macro level of trying to affect policy
and making changes like, in your own companies

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:41.280
or places of business.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.199
And there's international issues.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.749
So, there's so many different levels.

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:49.590
And there was a good quote I read the other
day, which was, "There's no silver bullet.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.830
Think silver buck shot."

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.360
I thought that was such a great quote because
I think the tendency is to want, "OK, what

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.789
do we need to do and have one solution."

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.259
With water, it's so connected to everything.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:06.430
It's hard to point to like, change a light
bulb or one prescription like that.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.399
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Great.

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:09.800
I have one other question.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.199
It's a different topic.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:17.939
But is that reclaimed water product that Jack
Black was hawking, is that actually real or

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:19.639
was it just a comedy bit?

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:22.270
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: The whole thing was an experiment.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.020
We weren't suggesting that recycled water
should be sold as a bottled water product.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.589
But because it has such a negative perception,
we thought, "Let's try to give it all the

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:34.450
advantages of a bottled water product."

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.789
So, it's funny 'cause people afterwards, it's
almost succeeded too well.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.419
They were like, "Where can we buy the recycled
water?"

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.950
But it was just to see what does it take to
overcome the perception of what's good for

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.950
you and what's not.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.950
I mean, there's that incredible irony that
it's probably the purest water that you can

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.380
get out there, but everyone is just so turned
off by it.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.210
In Orange County, where we got the recycled
water for the experiment, they liked some

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.020
of the ideas so much that they want to use
that in their own campaigns to help spread

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.050
the word.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:12.250
So, we're hoping that that is one of the concrete
advances that the film can help move forward.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:19.330
So, we're hoping that that's something that
communities can use to help their people embrace

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.330
that idea.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.330
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Yeah.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.320
It would be a funny film tie-in that at the
end of the screening, you can go and try out

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.320
some of this water yourself.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.330
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: We've been thinking about that.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.380
I still have a whole bunch of Porcelain Springs
in the office.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.450
[laughter]

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.550
I tried it actually when we were in Singapore.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.340
What they do, it's sort of interesting.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.130
They bottle it and any sort of like you go
to a public meeting or place where there are

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.420
government officials, and they just serve
that there.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.060
So, they get a lot of free publicity of, everyone's
drinking what they call New Water.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.880
And we had it there and it's funny.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880
It almost tastes--.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.290
You know how distilled water feels different
on the tongue?

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.000
It's a little, almost like dry, which is a
strange sensation.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.710
It's like that, but just incredibly clean.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:03.710
Thanks.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:04.710
Anybody else?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.270
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Hello.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.600
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Hi.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.720
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Thanks so much.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.740
That was really interesting.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.820
I enjoyed watching that.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.870
I had a question about water filters.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:22.960
So, I don't think that came up too much, but
one of my thoughts was, "Well, if I put a

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.810
water filter on my tap, that might alleviate
some of the issues and I don't have to have

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.810
bottled water."

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.810
What do you think about that?

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.970
Do you think that's something that's--?

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.340
I know a lot of people already do that.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.640
So what are your thoughts and do you think
that that's a way to help solve the issue?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.640
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Sure.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.650
I mean, I'm not a water filter expert, but
Peter Gleick, who is one of our main experts--.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.030
I remember everybody--.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.810
It still comes down to feeling like, "Well,
what do we drink?"

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.270
And he said he's asked that question all the
time.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.760
He generally says that--I'm speaking for Peter
here--but if you live in a municipality, your

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.370
water is tested a lot more than your bottled
water would be.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.300
So, I think bottled water as being safer is
a bit of a fallacy.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.740
But he said if you're worried about your water--sometimes
people think their water tastes funny--it's

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.740
probably their pipes.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:14.390
Put a filter on the end and that can certainly
help with taste.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.650
And if you're concerned about other things
in the water--.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.310
I think the issue though of the new contaminants
is something that is not really addressed

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.340
by either of those processes very well.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:31.700
So, that's where the very intensive processing--the
recycled water--goes through is more successful

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.450
at removing things than what we generally
have out of the tap or in bottled water products.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.450
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: Yeah.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.940
And the other thought was would the filters
even catch a lot of the stuff that's newer,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.220
contaminants that were found.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.220
[chuckles]

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.100
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: You know, when they talk about
trace pharmaceuticals and parts per trillion,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.150
like the guy at the sewage plant says, "You
know, we're state of the art and this is not

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.510
what we're built for."

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:58.400
So, that's something that we need to do to
address in new infrastructure.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.540
But it's weird, right, because you see in
the film, we don't wanna pay for--.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.700
It's very unpopular the idea of "let's pay
for a new switch treatment plant."

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.370
I mean, it's just politically very difficult
to get that point across.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.660
But if you look at how much we're already
paying for bottled water, we're spending that

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.660
money.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.680
We're just not, we're spending it individually.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.100
It's like the difference between wanting to
improve public schools and sending your kids

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.320
to private school.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.130
I think it feels more immediate for people.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.160
So, if they can do it, they just pay for it
there.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.810
But I think if we would upgrade the entire
system, we could do better for everybody.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.910
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: You talk about
the conservation and the effectiveness of

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.980
those measures.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:46.780
So, I just maybe wonder if all economics on
water is right, for example the price of the

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.460
water is the correct, maybe in the future,
do you see we pay like, three or four times

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.850
of the both price of either residential or
agriculture?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.310
&gt;&gt;Jessica Yu: Oh, that's a great question.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:01.470
And actually that's something, that's a point
that I wish we could have made clearer in

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.470
the film.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.820
We had it in there for a while, but OK.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.720
In Singapore, where they've really managed
their water problems extremely well, and it's

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.350
public education and it's also like just forcing
them, "This is what we're doing."

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.140
And they have a lot of--.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.500
They're always developing new technology.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.680
Well, the cost of their water is passed on
to the public there.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.560
So, if you ask the average Singaporean the
cost of their water bill, they'll probably

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560
know.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.540
In the US, the average person on the street,
it just doesn't really register.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.980
So, I think that if you pass along the cost
of the water to the public, they'll conserve

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.010
more and they'll be more aware of it.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.450
I think it's inevitable that some pricing
will have to change, but again, it's politically

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.650
extremely unpopular, especially in this country.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.810
Like, in Fresno, where--.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.760
I mean, that's Central Valley, it was only
last year that they even had water meters

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760
put in.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.050
So, people had no idea how much water they
were using.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.940
And there was a huge protest when they finally
said, "You know, guys, we actually should

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:06.770
figure out how much water we're using and
make people pay for it."

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.510
So, anybody have anything else?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.030
And afterwards, if you have any questions
for me or Lynn, we're here.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:19.890
And you can also look at, we have the social
action part of the Participant umbrella--it's

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.900
called Take Part--and there's a lot of resources
and information in there.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.560
So, thanks so much again and thank you, Matt
and Jennifer.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.530
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Let's give Jessica a round
of applause.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.860
[applause]
