00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.666
The weekend is over.
We are now in 3.091.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, announcement: this Wednesday
there will be no lecture,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
instead, celebration of learning:
test number two.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
These are the room assignments.
We moved them just a little bit,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
moved the dividing lines, rather.
It's the same rooms,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we wanted to make a little more
room in here and in the Walker gym.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, there are more people being
asked to go to room 1-190.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then, this is the group to go
to the Walker gym,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
third floor of the Walker Memorial
building. And then,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the front half of the alphabet
please report here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And, if you take the test that one
o'clock, don't go to 6-120 because

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we won't be there.
We are putting everybody in 26-100.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:24.620
That way there are plenty of
vacancies. So,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.240
I'm just going to go quickly over
the comments that I give before

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.870
every test just to put everybody in
the right frame of mind.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.490
The coverage is lecture 7-17.
So, that will start with ionics,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.120
and go through the generation of
x-rays, but not Bragg's law or

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.740
anything like that.
So, remember, you've got to bring

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.370
five things with you: your periodic
table, table of constants,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:11.540
something to write with, a
calculator, and your aid sheet.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:02:00.060
And, you know,
I'm going to make a bold suggestion.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.130
For some of you, why don't you
write your recitation instructor's

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.190
name on your aid sheet?
Because I'm going to tell you what

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.260
I'm going to do.
If I don't have a recitation

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.330
instructor's name on the exam,
I'm not going to grade it. You know

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.390
why? Because I've got 630 of these.
If you don't put the recitation

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.460
instructor's name on the exam,
it means you are in no hurry to get

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.130
it back.
That will save me time.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.390
We'll just take all those,
and just put them aside, and we'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.660
just grade the ones for the people
who really want to get them back the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.930
next day. And,
we'll get around to the other ones,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.190
I mean, someday. So, I think after
two months, it's not unreasonable

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.460
for us to expect you to put the
recitation instructor's name on the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.730
exam. The purpose of the test is to
provide you with feedback.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:03:07.460
So, we want to just tell you,
are you mastering the material?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:55.230
Are your study habits effective or
not? That's all we're trying to do.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.470
So, this is not an aptitude test.
It's not an admissions test.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.710
I just want to see if you're
mastering the material.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.950
And if you are, I'm going to say
congratulations,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.190
keep up the good work.
And if you're not, I'm going to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.420
send you a message saying,
if you keep up at this level,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.660
you're going to fail this class.
You need to get that information on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.900
a timely basis.
What are the test taking strategies?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.140
Read the paper first,
identify the easy questions,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.380
work in your schedule, don't do
number one because I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.850
made it number one.
Do number one only because it's the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.570
easiest one for you.
It will be a confidence builder,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.280
soothe the nerves, and so on. Show
your work. Show your work.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.990
Don't write cryptic answers because
if you get them wrong,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.710
we can't give you part score.
But, if you give us lots of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.420
information, I don't mean volumes of
information, but if you give us a

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.140
few ideas as to how you are
approaching the problem,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.280
then we can give you partial credit.
Work parametrically.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.850
Try not to immediately start going
for your calculator.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.420
And, please bring something to
compute with. I was astonished in

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.990
the first test the number of people
that had no calculator,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.570
or the calculator was not working
and so on. We have a few,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.140
but this is a large class. I don't
have enough calculators for

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.710
everybody. Don't grade the test.
If you feel you are not doing as

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:41.886
well as you'd like, don't give up.
You just leave the grading to us.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And, you are not competing with
your classmates.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
50 is a pass. Everybody can pass.
There's no success coming at the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
expense of the classmate.
And, as always, do your own work.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You've got an aid sheet, you've got
your tables of constants,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
you've got your periodic tables,
there's no reason to resort to any

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:49.880
kind of intellectual dishonesty.
And, our goal is to have them back

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.640
to you on Thursday in recitation.
So, good luck. I want you just to

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.410
show me what you know.
And, I think it's appropriate that

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.170
we don't have a weekly test tomorrow.
So, I know there's a lot of

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.930
disappointment when I say this,
but there will be no weekly test.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.700
We'll catch up afterwards. OK, so
last day we looked at the selection

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.460
rules for reflection in cubic
crystals and saw that we could

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.230
identify, distinguish different
crystals from one another on the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:35.260
basis of the patterns
in the line spectrum.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:25.830
Towards the end we talked about
symmetry. And I think I gave you

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.660
the page here on the lab book of
Danny Schechtman when he first

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.490
started to see that he's got
fivefold symmetry.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.330
And, so the music at the beginning
I was playing,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.160
Take Five by Dave Brubeck,
I was looking for songs in 5/4 time.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:06:07.253
So, I had this one as well.
Remember this one? [MUSIC PLAYS]

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Count it: one,
two, three, four,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
five, one, two, three,
four, five. But then they wimp out

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and they go to 4/4 here.
Now it's a disco song. I guess

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
they feel that people can't dance to
5/4 time, and it had to be danceable

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
or else it wouldn't be marketable.
But that's 5/4, very strange time.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:24.540
OK, today we're going to move on to
our discussion of solids,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.080
ordered solids. Up until now,
I've been treating crystals as

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.630
though they're perfect.
I've been treating crystals as

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.180
though they're perfect in two ways,
perfect crystals in terms of

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.720
chemical composition,
perfection in terms of chemical

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:56.440
composition.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.500
And that's to say that we're looking
at pure materials,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.000
and also perfection in terms of
atomic arrangement.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:07:09.120
And so, that means we are treating

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.370
them as though they are defect free.
Two types of perfection: see, we

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.620
are talking about chemical
composition and we are talking about

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.870
atomic arrangement.
Both are critical in determining

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:41.940
the performance of material.
But, real engineering materials are

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
not perfect. They contain
impurities. And,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
we've seen that there are desirable
in impurities such as dopants,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and there are undesirable impurities
such as contaminants.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And, part of what were doing in the
last unit was studying how to manage

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
impurities in such a way as to get
desirable properties.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Well, the same thing happens with
defects. In some cases,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
we have atoms not always found at
their lattice points.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:57.710
Atoms sometimes misbehave.
They don't go where they're told.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.420
And that can lead to consequences,
mechanical failure. But, if we are

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.140
clever about it,
if we learn how to manage defects,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.850
we can engineer performance that is
minimally damaging.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.570
And, in some cases,
we can enhance the performance of a

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.280
material. So,
we are going to get tailored

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:35.026
properties through defect
engineering.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:23.150
So, that's what I want to introduce
today. So, we're going to go to the

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.310
handout because this is a lot of
taxonomy here,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.470
and sort of definitions.
So I thought we could just read

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.630
along together.
So, the defects are classified on

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.780
the basis of dimensionality.
So we're going to look at zero

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.940
dimensional point defects.
Then we will go to one-dimensional

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.100
line, two dimensional interfacial,
and three dimensional bulk defects.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.260
So, the first thing is point
defects, start at zero dimension.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.420
And, these are localized
disruptions in the regularity

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.830
of the lattice.
How local at the level of one

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.490
lattice site, at the level of one
lattice site. And,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:59.160
so there's three types we're going
to look at. The first one is the

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.830
substitutional impurity.
And, if you flip over on the

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.490
backside, I've copied this cartoon.
And so, here's a substitutional

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.160
impurity atom.
We've seen this already when we put

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.820
phosphorus into silicon.
One example: it occupies a normal

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.490
lattice site. So,
there is the dopant that we've seen

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.160
before. And, I'll show you towards
the end of the lecture,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.870
boron in diamond.
Substitutional,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.620
it actually sits at the normal
carbon lattice site.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.370
They are also alloying elements
such as magnesium in aluminum.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.120
There are very few metals that are
used in commerce in pure form.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.870
Most metals are used in the form of
alloys, that is to say solid

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.620
solutions. So,
for example, this aluminum can is

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.370
dominantly aluminum and contains a
certain amount of magnesium and a

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.120
certain amount of silicon.
And, this is designed to give it

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.070
the properties it needs.
One of the main properties that we

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.210
need in this can stock is the
ability to have very,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.350
very rapid glide of the atoms.
If you look very carefully, there's

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.490
no seam on the bottom of this can.
This is made out of a single sheet

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.640
of aluminum. And so,
the sheet moves over a dye,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.780
press punches down, up, down,
and forms the U-shaped right

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.920
circular cylinder,
and then a second piece is crimped

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.620
onto the top.
You can imagine the high speed at

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.870
which the atoms are gliding over one
another, and part of what gives us

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.120
the ability to deform is the
alloying. So,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.370
magnesium is purposely added to
aluminum. We have seen colored

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.620
golds. And, one example is nickel
going into gold,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.870
which will turn it from its very
buttery, almost buttery ductility

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.120
into something that's got a little
bit of strength to it.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.370
I mean, you don't want a ring that
if you put it down on the dresser it

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.880
starts to deform.
So, we have to give it some strength.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.660
And, in this case,
we can alter its color.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.440
So, this is nickel atom sitting on
the FCC site normally occupied by

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.220
gold, again, a substitutional
impurity. And,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.990
here's the last one.
We learned about 7-Up,

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.770
and the lithium citrate in 7-Up,
suppose you're on call and you're

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.550
administering saline in the hospital,
and it's supposed to be 5% sodium

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.330
chloride in water.
But if there's a lithium impurity

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.110
substituting for sodium in the
sodium chloride lattice,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.750
it's going to dissolve.
And if you've got some sodium

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.250
deficient patient and you give them
some lithium chloride,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.750
it's going to be a bad day at the
office. So, substitutional

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.250
impurities can have deleterious
effects. So, those are examples of

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.750
substitutional impurities.
The second type is the interstitial

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.250
impurity. And,
it occupies the position between the

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.750
lattice sites.
And, if you go to the cartoon,

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.250
you'll see this highlighted. And,
the interstitial impurity, obviously

00:11:48.250 --> 00:12:07.466
this atom is small.
It has to fit into the void space

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.500
between the atoms.
So, we did the calculations.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.500
We know that a close packed FCC
lattice is 74% matter,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.500
and 26% void. Well, that 26% void
is not just randomly distributed.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.500
It is the nothing in between the
atoms. So, I could take all the

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.500
atoms away, and I could give you a
lattice comprising the

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:21.660
interstitial sites.
You understand the concept.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.990
A lattice is simply points in space.
So, instead of putting gold atoms

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.330
there, let's put the space between
the gold atoms.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.660
And, imagine what we can do.
So, here's an example of an

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.990
interstitial atom.
It's small, and it's obviously an

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.330
impurity because it's different from
the composition of the parent

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.660
material. And,
so, there are desirable and

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.990
undesirable. So,
an example of a desirable element is

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.330
carbon in iron.
Carbon in iron is the basis for

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.720
steel.
Without carbon and iron,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.180
we wouldn't have steel. And,
the interesting thing about carbon

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.630
in iron is that the radius of the
carbon atom is actually greater than

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:09.080
the radius of the interstitial site
in iron, greater than the radius of

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.540
the interstitial site in iron.
So, therefore, when the carbon goes

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:33.146
into that interstitial site,
it actually distorts the lattice.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:24.260
It presses back on the parent iron
lattice. And,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.530
through this distortion,
strengthens the material.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.790
Another example is hydrogen in
lanthanum nickel five.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.060
It goes into the interstices in
this compound.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.330
Lanthanum nickel five has voids
that are large enough to accommodate

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.590
hydrogen. And,
hydrogen can go in this,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.860
acts as a sponge, and hydrogen at
peak loading can go

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.550
in at this level.
We have a huge amount of hydrogen

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.660
going in here.
The density of hydrogen in

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.770
lanthanum nickel five at saturation
is greater than liquid hydrogen

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.880
itself. And, this material is under
investigation along with others like

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.990
it in the context of hydrogen
powered vehicles.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.100
If we're going to put hydrogen in
cars, if at some point fuel cells

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.220
become practical,
what is going to be the mode of

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.330
storing hydrogen?
Do we want compressed hydrogen?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.440
We're going to have to have all
sorts of protection in

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.880
case of a collision.
Well, this might be a safer way of

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.660
putting hydrogen in the vehicle.
So, interstitial packing is

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.440
advantageous in this case.
But, if we get our wires crossed,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.220
and instead of putting hydrogen in
lanthanum nickel five,

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.990
we put hydrogen in iron,
that leads to deleterious effects.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.770
Hydrogen in iron embrittles iron.
And it loses its ductility,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.550
becomes very brittle, and can fail
prematurely. And this is also

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.330
germane to the hydrogen economy.
In this country, we can deliver

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.110
energy through the electric grid,
and we can deliver gas through gas

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.850
pipelines.
You cannot send hydrogen through the

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.570
gas pipelines because the gas
pipelines are stable with

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.280
hydrocarbon contents,
but not stable with hydrogen.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.990
Hydrogen under pressure will
embrittle those pipelines.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.710
That means that we would have to
build a new infrastructure to pipe

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.420
hydrogen over long distances.
And, that infrastructure cannot be

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.140
made out of steel because steel will
be embrittled. It's not

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.880
going to be cheap.
These are cost issues.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.660
You need to know this because
people are going to ask you.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.440
You're from MIT. They're going to
ask you help make policy.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.220
You can't just get on board and say,
well, we'll fix it somehow.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.990
Hydrogen is very small. It goes
places where it's not supposed to be.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.770
OK, then the third type of defect
is called the vacancy.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.550
And that's simply an unoccupied
lattice site different from the

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.330
interstitial. It's a site that's
not occupied. And so,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.110
here's the cartoon. You see this is
a regular atom that hasn't been

00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:11.953
placed on its proper site.
And, we have a vacancy in that

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
location. And so,
there's two types of vacancy

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
formations. The first is when the
material is being solidified,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
whether it's solidifying from the
liquid, whether it's vapor

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
deposition, or whether it's a
solid-solid transformation.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So, in some instances, all of the
sites don't get filled.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And that there's an extreme case,
such as the wall of a nuclear

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
reactor vessel where under high
bombardment of neutron flux,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
over time, atoms are literally
dislodged from their

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
lattice positions.
And, you put this on a regular

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
maintenance schedule because you can
imagine over a certain period of

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
time the material starts to look,
at the atomic level, more nearly

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
like Swiss cheese.
And so, that's not good.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So, vacancies are present.
And, they're always going to be

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.500
present.
Tom, do you think we could switch

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.500
the video over to the document
camera, please?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.500
OK, what I've got here is,
well, actually it's an object of art.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500
This was made by an artiste in
Montréal back in the 1960s.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:52.500
And, all it is, is two pieces of
poly methyl methacrylate that have

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.500
been milled and joined.
And, in between here are 2,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:22.750
00 ball bearings.
So, we just have 2000 ball bearings,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:28.250
and I'm going to try illuminating
from the bottom,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.750
see that make things better.
Much better. And now, if I learned

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.250
how to focus, OK,
good, and now we're going to zoom.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:44.750
OK, so now, what do you see? You
see atoms packing.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:50.250
These are hard spheres.
And, they're packing in ways that

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.860
indicate the way atoms would pack.
You see, here's regular crystal

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.590
arrays. Here's some disorder.
Oh, this is even the gas phase.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.330
Look at this, see, we have
everything. OK,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:06.060
so now, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to anneal.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.790
So, I'm going to lift this up.
And, annealing would be the

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.530
equivalent of tapping this.
OK, I'm giving thermal energy to

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.260
this because thermal energy causes
atom motion. Look at the impact.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:36.320
I have annealed out so much of the
defects.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:25.460
And now, look at large,
regular regions. There's a surface.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.920
I see a few gas atoms up there.
And, look, vacancies.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.380
There will always be vacancies
above zero Kelvin.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.840
You can come to my office anytime
you want. I defy,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.300
I challenge anyone to anneal all of
the vacancies out.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.760
There will always be a few
vacancies in here.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.870
And, sometimes vacancies coalesce.
There is a divacancy.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.620
There's another divacancy.
This is a good day for divacancies.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.370
The Red Sox win the World Series.
A lot of unusual things are

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.120
happening here.
OK, so let's take a look.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.870
There is an expression for the
vacancy population in any crystal.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.620
So, what I'm showing you, this is
what's going on in steel.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.370
This is what's going on in that
aluminum beverage container.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.120
This is what's going on in the
airplane wings that you look out

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.880
over when you fly: vacancies.
OK, so what's the population of

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.660
vacancies? And,
the calculation of vacancy

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.440
population involves what I'm going
to give as equilibrium,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:40.220
meaning it's in equilibrium with the
surroundings in terms of temperature.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:58.706
It's at thermal equilibrium,
equilibrium population of vacancies.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:53.210
And, this is in a crystal.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.640
And so, what we're going to do is
it's a comparison of the binding

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.070
energy, comparison of the binding
energy to the energy of disruption

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.490
because you can imagine the binding
energy of an atom is the negative of

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.920
the energy to form a vacancy.
How you form a vacancy? You can

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.350
imagine, you go in with atomic
tweezers and you pull an atom out.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.780
And, what bonds do you have to
break? The bonds that bonded

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.310
that atom to others.
So, this is minus the energy of

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.930
vacancy formation.
And, the disruptive energy is,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:33.560
in our case, a thermal energy. And,
so, there's a way of expressing this.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.180
And, we're going to say,
it's given by the following.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.800
We're going to compare these two in
an exponential not unlike the one

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.430
you saw earlier in the course.
So, I'm going to define the

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.060
fraction of sites that are
unoccupied, which will be the ratio

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.680
of the number of vacancies per unit
volume to the number of

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:13.826
sites per unit volume.
So, the nv is number of vacancies

00:20:43.200 --> 00:21:11.600
per unit volume,
and big N is the number of atomic

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:26.200
sites, number of atomic
sites per unit volume.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.000
OK, and that's going to be given by
the ratio mediated through this

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
exponential of the energy.
And, I loosely move energy and

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
enthalpy back-and-forth.
This is the enthalpy of vacancy

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
formation energy over
the thermal energy.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:57.530
And, how do we get a rough measure
of the thermal energy?

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:03.070
Product of the Boltzmann constant
and absolute temperature.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:08.610
So, what are we doing? We are
taking this onto the temperature

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:14.150
distribution, and we are saying,
where is this required energy in

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.690
relation to the average energy of
the system, and in particular,

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:25.230
the high end tail. So, and then,
it has a pre-factor, A, and A is

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:44.126
just an entropic pre-factor.
And, it's not equal to one.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
A will take values between a tenth
up to about ten.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
It's typically on the order of,
oh, four, five, something like this,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
but in some cases it can even be
less than one.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So, this is a relationship that
tells us what the fraction of

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
unoccupied sites is as a
function of temperature.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:54.280
So, we could go in and calculate
what the effective bond energy is

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.560
because we know what the thermal
energy is. So,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.850
we could work backwards and
calculate that.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.140
So, I did a sample calculation.
I was wondering, what should be the

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.420
vacancy population in,
say, a piece of copper?

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.710
So, I said, all right, copper,
it happens that the enthalpy of

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:35.020
formation of a vacancy is 1.
9 electron volts per atom.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:25.230
And, the pre-factor is equal to 4.
. I had to look this up in tables.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:30.460
This is not from first principles
calculation. So,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.690
I said, OK, let's look at room
temperature. At room temperature,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.920
I plugged these numbers in and I got
the fraction of vacant sites as ten

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.150
to the minus 21.
Well, if you multiply by the

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:51.380
density of copper,
that turns out to be 85 vacancies

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.620
per cubic centimeter.
I mean, this is vanishingly small.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.870
This is almost the inverse. This
is almost none,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.120
right, because we have roughly
Avogadro's number of atoms per cubic

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.370
centimeter for condensed matter.
So, this is really, really low, ten

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.620
to the 21, ten to the 23.
There's 100 difference, and sure

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.870
enough, there it is,
85. There's so few you could give

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.120
each of them a name.
And then, so then I said,

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.370
well, what happens if we go to the
melting point, at the melting

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.290
point of copper?
OK, I'm not going to melt copper.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.880
It's like ice at 0¡ C. It's copper
at the threshold of melting but

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.470
still solid. If you do the
calculations at the melting point of

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.050
copper, you get 7.
5 times ten to the minus five,

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.640
which now turns out to be about 70
parts per million on an atom basis.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.230
So, for every million copper sites,
you can expect about 70 of them to

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.820
be unoccupied.
So, now we are starting to get up

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.410
to real numbers because that would
give us a vacancy population of six

00:24:54.410 --> 00:25:12.620
times ten to the 18th
per cubic centimeter.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
That's substantial.
This is the kind of stuff that

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
would be perceptible if this were a
dopant. If this were a dopant

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
concentration,
this would alter the electrical

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
properties of silicon.
And, here's the way to look at this.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
What's going on here?
What's going on is this critical

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
ratio, this is so important.
The ratio of the binding energy to

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
the thermal energy,
at room temperature,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:31.330
this ratio is about 50 to one.
It's about 50 to one.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.990
At the melting point,
it's about 10 to one. And,

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:40.660
that's what's going on. You are
shifting the distribution way over,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.330
and giving yourself the ability to
rip the copper atoms out of their

00:25:45.330 --> 00:26:03.126
sites. So, that's interesting
to know.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:54.570
OK, Tom, may we go back to the
computer please for graphics?

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.140
Thank you. OK, so now, I want to
talk about point defects in ionic

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.710
crystals because there's a special
twist here. With an ionic crystal,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.280
if you've got sodium chloride, you
can't just remove a sodium ion

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.850
because you violate charge
neutrality. So,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.420
when you make vacancies in an ionic
crystal, you have to take them out.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:37.306
You have to make those vacancies by
removing atoms in neutral units.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:26.120
So, let's look at the various types.
The first one is called Schottky

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.240
imperfection. And,
it's the formation of equivalent,

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.370
not equal, but "equi-valent" numbers
of cationic and anionic vacancies.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:38.490
And, there's the other cartoon on
the backside of the handout.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.620
So, here's the Schottky
imperfection where you see - the

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.740
video graphic is not so good.
If you squint just a little bit,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.870
you'll see, this is not just an
array of dark spheres,

00:26:50.870 --> 00:27:10.406
but there are light spheres in
between the dark spheres.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And, the light spheres represent the
anions, and the dark spheres

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
represent the cations.
And, what you are seeing here is

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
the pair. We are missing both the
anion here in the midst of four

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
cations, and the cation over here,
in order to preserve charge

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
neutrality. Now,
they don't necessarily have to be

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
side by each. I mean,
the cation vacancy can be way over

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
here, and anion vacancy could be way
over here. But globally,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:27.150
it's the same number.
And, so let's look at how that works.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.460
One way to describe that is to
think about, instead of removing the

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.760
cation and anion,
the other way to think about this

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.070
mathematically is to say,
suppose I take, here's nothing.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.380
I'm going to take some nothing.
But, it's not any old nothing.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.690
It's FCC nothing.
And, I'm going to dissolve the FCC

00:27:48.690 --> 00:28:07.513
nothing into sodium chloride.
So, let's do that.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:57.110
You'll get the idea.
Conceptually, it's so cool.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.230
So, how do I make, I want to make a
sodium chloride vacancy pair.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.350
So, what I do is, instead of
ripping out a sodium,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.460
and ripping out a chloride,
what I do is I take nothing,

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.580
which I represent as null, and I
dissolve it. So,

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.700
I'm going to take nothing,
but I'm going to have some nothing

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:21.820
that goes to the cationic site,
and nothing that goes to the anionic

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.940
site. So, this is V,
is a vacancy on a sodium site,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.540
and a vacancy on a chloride site.
So, this is charge neutral now.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.630
OK, we said, well, it's only
nothing anyways.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:40.720
Well, let's think about it.
If you look at sodium vacancy,

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.810
sodium vacancy is charge zero, but
it's on a cationic sub lattice.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.900
It's zero, but everywhere around it,
it's got neighbors of comparable

00:28:50.900 --> 00:29:09.600
charge, except this is in a land of
plus one for V sodium.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:29:01.590
So, if this means it has an apparent,
I'm going to put quotation marks

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:07.190
here, it has an apparent charge of
minus one. Zero in a land of plus

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:12.790
one is relatively negative.
And, what about the chloride?

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:18.390
The chloride vacancy is zero in a
land of minus one.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:36.713
So, a zero in a land of minus one
is effectively a plus one.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:29.190
So, let's put that down.
So, this is, I want to put here,

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:34.390
this indicates that this is locally
minus, and this indicates it's

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.590
locally plus. The way I remember
these is, this slash reminds me of a

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.790
minus sign. And,
the plus is sort of like the

00:29:44.790 --> 00:30:03.113
crosshairs of the plus sign.
That's how I remember it.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:54.610
OK, and we can do the same as we did
for the vacancy fraction,

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.220
and compute a Schottky fraction.
What's the fraction of Schottky

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.840
defects? It's going to be the
number of Schottky defects divided

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.460
by the total number of sites.
And, it'll be an equation of this

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.070
form, some pre-exponential times the
exponential of the ratio of the

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:17.690
energy to form the Schottky defect
divided by the product of the

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.870
Boltzmann constant and temperature.
And, for sodium chloride,

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.620
the Schottky energy is on the order
of about 2.5 electron volts.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.370
And, that's about double what it is
for copper. So,

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:33.120
and that makes sense.
It should take more energy to make

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.870
a vacancy pair than it does to make
a vacancy. And,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.620
Coulombic forces of attraction in
ionic crystals are more intense than

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.370
metallic bonding forces in metal
crystals. I want to show you one

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:48.120
other one. This is what's going on
in the oxygen sensor of your

00:30:48.120 --> 00:31:07.406
car. It's zirconia.
And, I'm going to show you later how

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.500
you manage the defects in zirconia
to advantage. So,

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.500
how do I make a vacancy in zirconia?
The dominant vacancy is Schottky.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.500
And, I'm going to write again null.
I'm going to dissolve nothing into

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.500
zirconia. So,
going to make a zirconium vacancy

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.500
and two oxygen vacancies.
I have to preserve the

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:22.930
stoichiometry of nothing.
Nothing counts here,

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:28.790
OK, because what's the local charge?
This is zero in a land of plus four.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:34.660
So, it's apparently minus four.
And, every oxygen is a zero in a

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:40.530
land of minus two.
All of the oxide ions are minus two.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:46.390
This oxide ion vacancy is zero.
Zero in a land of minus two is plus

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:52.260
two, apparently.
So, I have minus four apparent,

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:58.130
two times minus two apparent, charge
neutrality, and this is now

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:15.460
equivalent numbers of cation
and anion vacancies.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:32:07.550
Very cool. OK,
so there's another way,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.110
though. There's another way to make
vacancies, and that's called the

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.660
Frenkel imperfection.
And, it's the formation of an ion

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.220
vacancy and ion interstitial.
So, that's shown over here where a

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:38.206
little cation, you see the cation?
See this cation's gone over to

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.500
another cation.
There's an interstitial in here.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.500
You see the little cation? Cation
left and went over here?

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:17.500
But see, it didn't leave.
It didn't leave the crystal.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.500
It moved to another place in the
crystal. So, I don't have to worry

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.500
about compensating with the ion of
opposite charge because the total

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.500
cation population hasn't changed.
But, I have created a cation vacancy.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.500
So, this is what the issue is here.
And so, with Frenkel, clearly with

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.500
Frenkel, Frenkel occurs in crystals
where you have wide variations in

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.500
the radii. So,
for Frenkel, the condition is that

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.500
the radius of the cation must be
either substantially larger than the

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.500
radius of anion or it must be
substantially smaller than the

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.000
radius of the anion.
If you have ions that are roughly

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
nearly equal in dimension,
the interstitial site isn't big

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
enough to take the ion.
So, let's look at that one.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
A good example of this is silver
bromide. Silver bromide forms

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Frenkels because,
as you know, bromine is big.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Bromide is huge, and silver is
small. And when it loses an

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
electron, it's smaller.
So, I've got a small cation,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
and a honking big anion. And so,
there's lots of room in there.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:55.830
And, here's the way we'd write that:
silver sitting on a silver site now

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:01.660
wants to move.
And see, it's neutral because

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:07.490
silver is plus one in a land of plus
one. So, I can even put a little x

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:13.330
there to show that it's neutral.
So, silver on a silver site now

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:19.160
becomes silver on an interstitial
site. And, an interstitial site is

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:37.586
zero. And, silver is plus one.
So, now, it's apparently plus one.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:28.460
And, what's going to do to charge
compensate? It's going to leave

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.930
behind a vacancy.
Obviously, it jumped off this site.

00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:35.390
So, there is a vacancy. And that
vacancy is what?

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:38.860
The vacancy is zero in a land of
plus one. So,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.330
zero in a land of plus one is
apparently minus.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.790
This thing makes sense.
It's consistent. And, likewise,

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:49.260
we can write a formula for the
fraction of Frenkel

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.420
sites in a crystal.
It would be the number of Frenkels

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.280
divided by the total number of
atomic sites for that,

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:03.140
which then will equal A times some
exponential expression of the ratio

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.990
of the formation energy for the
Frenkel defect divided by the

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.850
product of the Boltzmann constant
and temperature.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.710
And, the Frenkel energy,
what do you think? It's going to be

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.570
closer to that of the Schottky
energy, or closer to that of the

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.750
single atom vacancy?
It's about one electron volt.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.250
It's closer to that of the single
atom. And, it's typically the

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.750
cations. It's typically the cations
because normally the anions are the

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.250
big ones. Fluoride is the one
exception, OK?

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.750
But generally,
it's the cations that are going to

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.250
go interstitially.
The last one is the F center.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.750
The F center, they don't talk about
in your books,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.250
but it's a really cool one.
I like this one. The F center

00:35:51.250 --> 00:36:06.366
occurs in non-stoichiometry.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:36:02.720
It may surprise you,
but it's possibly to have sodium

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.450
chloride that isn't 1:1 sodium and
chlorine. It's possible to have

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:12.170
something that is chlorine deficient.
So, let's see,

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.900
what would happen if we were to
dissolve excess sodium?

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.630
I'm going to dissolve excess sodium
into sodium chloride.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.070
Well, I can't dissolve a neutral.
Sodium chloride will not accept a

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.210
neutral. So, what's the only way I
can make sodium soluble in sodium

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:34.350
chloride? I have to convert it into
sodium ion. So,

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.490
I'm going to make a sodium ion.
And, I'm going to be left with an

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.640
electron. What am I going to do
with that electron?

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.780
Where is that electron going to go?
Think. You've got valence bands

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.920
that are filled.
Do you see a parallel between this

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.250
and putting phosphorus into silicon?
You've got this extra electron.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:59.750
This thing has bonding capability.
This is a fifth wheel, didn't know

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:04.250
what to do. So,
one way to model this is I'm going

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:08.750
to now to give you the full notation
as to put sodium on a sodium site.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:13.250
So, now this is sodium plus. I've
got an electron,

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.750
and what? I have to make a vacancy
on a chloride site in order to

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:22.730
compensate for this excess electron.
And now, let's look at the way this

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:28.190
thing is going to operate.
I've got sodium ions in some FCC

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.660
lattice. Here's a chloride vacancy
that's been created to compensate

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:39.130
here. So, this is VCl.
And, where is this electron going

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:44.590
to be? Its electron is not attached
to any one of these sodiums.

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:50.060
Do you know of another example
where you ended up with something

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.530
that was apparently positive and
motionless in a crystal with an

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:13.593
extra electron that was attracted by
Coulombic forces?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:38:05.880
If you had to model this operation,
what model might you choose? You

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.770
could use a modified Bohr model to
model the electron motion around the

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.660
vacancy in an F center.
Yeah, this is really cool.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.550
This is really cool. It's called f
center because it comes from the

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.580
German farbe, which means color.
These form color centers because if

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.760
you go through the Bohr model,
the energy levels in here are in the

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.940
visible. And so,
the different crystals we can

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.110
identify, if you take sodium
chloride, lithium chloride,

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:37.290
potassium chloride, they're all
white salts. But,

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.460
if we create vacancies by injecting
energy, say in the form of an

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.640
electrical shock,
we will dope the crystal different

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.820
colors. And the colors change with
the identity of the crystal because

00:38:46.820 --> 00:39:06.173
the energies are going
to be different.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:57.390
OK, good, so that's the end of point
defects. Now,

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:04.790
let's look at line defects.
Line defects are very important

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:12.190
because they answer this question.
Data made line defects necessary.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:19.590
People in the early part of the 20th
century were trying to figure out

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:35.246
what the ultimate yield
strength of a metal is.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:31.180
So, let's take a look at,
say, two planes of atoms. And,

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.360
I'm just going to, for simplicity,
connect these with little struts to

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.540
indicate that there's some bonding
going on here.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.720
And, I want to ask the question,
what is the shear strength, the

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.900
magnitude of the shear strength
necessary because these two planes

00:39:47.900 --> 00:40:07.366
to slide over one another?
This is going to be involved in the

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.500
yield of a crystal.
Well, one way of doing this

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.500
calculation is to say,
let's look at, say, bond strength

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.500
between pairs of atoms.
So, look at pair bond strength

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.500
times the bond density,
right? If we take pair strength

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.500
times bond density,
that should give us some round

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.500
number that would be representative
of how much energy it takes for us

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:28.250
to be able to shear the material.
And, this quantity that we're

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:34.750
looking for is the yield strength,
denoted sigma sub y. And what we

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:41.250
find is that the measured value of
the yield strength is on the order

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:47.750
of only about 1/10 of the yield
strength as determined by theory.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:53.610
Something is way wrong.
Well, this was solved by Orowan.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:58.840
Orowan was a professor in Budapest
in the 1930s. After World War II,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.070
he ended up here at MIT and he
finished his career in the

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:09.300
mechanical engineering department.
He was a brilliant theoretician in

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:14.530
the area of strength of metals,
failure in metals. So, the story

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.760
goes, this is the apocryphal story,
is that Orowan came home one day

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:37.720
from the university and went
up to his apartment.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:28.330
And there was a long hallway and a
runner, a carpet,

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.660
a long carpet, along the hallway.
And the chambermaid was just

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.990
finishing cleaning,
and she was going to put the carpet

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:38.320
back. She had moved it out of the
way, and she was going to move it

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.660
back. And so,
he came up and offered to help her

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.990
move the carpet.
And she told him to get out of the

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.330
way. And instead,
what she did is rather then drag the

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.660
carpet in order to displace it,
what she did is she went to the far

00:41:51.660 --> 00:42:10.986
end of the carpet and
made a little kink.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:58.440
Made a little kink in the carpet,
stamped her foot, and propagated the

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.880
kink all the way down.
And then: made a second kink,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.330
stamped her foot, and propagated the
carpet all the way down.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.770
So, what's the difference?
What's the difference? Well,

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:12.220
with Orowan, if we stand at this end
and pull, we've got the coefficient

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.660
of friction along the entire length
of the carpet.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.100
It takes a huge amount of energy.
If, instead, we invest a little bit

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.550
of energy to make the kink,
and then propagate the kink,

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:42.100
we can move the carpet in these
small amounts.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:29.710
So, what we've done is now all we
have to come up with is the amount

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.420
of energy to lift off that little
patch of carpet.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.140
And it will propagate very easily.
He looked at this and he said, that

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.850
could explain what's going on here.
So, I've got a little cartoon that

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.570
shows, actually it's showing the
caterpillar moving here.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.280
But, can you imagine if this is the
plane of atoms such that there is an

00:42:48.280 --> 00:43:07.226
extra plane sandwiched
in here that ends?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:55.860
And now, if I want to shear the top
three rows of atoms versus the

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.730
bottom three rows,
instead of having to break every one

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.590
of these bonds,
I have to break them all.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.460
I have to break them all.
Look at here. All I do is I break

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.330
this one, and then I break this one.
And then I break this one, and then

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.190
I break this one.
And so what I do is I break one

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:19.060
bond and just keep propagating it.
And that's the dislocation. That's

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.460
the dislocation.
It's a line defect that involves the

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.380
misregistry of atoms.
And through this, it allows us the

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.300
ability to deform metals at values
substantially below those of the

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:38.220
entire crystalline,
makes sense now. So,

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:43.150
here's another cartoon showing the
same thing. And,

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:48.070
how do these dislocations move?
These dislocations move along

00:43:48.070 --> 00:44:06.206
close-packed planes in close
packed directions.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:57.300
Tom, may we go back to the document
camera, please?

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.610
OK, so here is,
I'm going to now go to top view,

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.920
top lamp. Look at this. This is
face centered cubic.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.230
Where are the bonds going to be
strongest? This is going to be like

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:14.530
rafts of atoms moving.
Where are the bonds going to be

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.840
strongest? They're going to be
strongest in the plane

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.750
with the most bonds.
So, that's going to be the 1-1-1

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.250
plane because the 1-1-1,
if you look at this atom here,

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.750
you see the hexagon starting?
There's the hexagon.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.250
Train your eye on this one.
One, two, three, four, and then

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:36.750
there will five,
six. So, this is a close-packed

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:40.250
plane. It's got six nearest
neighbors in the plane,

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.750
three above, and three below.
This is the 1-1-1 plane. It goes

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.250
up the diagonal,
OK? It goes up the diagonal.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.750
So, this is the plane that has the
most bonds. If there are the most

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.250
bonds in the plane,
that's the plane that has the

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:58.160
greatest strength and will not give.
And, doesn't it go axiomatically

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.490
that if I have the most bonds in the
plane, then normal to the plane I'm

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.830
going to have weakest bonding?
So, we have these strong rafts of

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:11.160
1-1-1 planes that want to slide.
Now, within the plane, how does

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.490
something move?
This is like pushing the wet noodle

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.830
question. So,
if I'm in this 1-1-1 plane,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:39.793
which direction am I going to move?
I'm going to move along the

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
direction where I have the greatest
strength, the greatest rigidity,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
and that means along the direction
where I have the greatest number of

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
bonds. So, this is along the 1-1-1
direction, see,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
excuse me, the 0-1-1 direction.
I'm in the red plane, and then this

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
is across the diagonal of the face.
So, I'm moving in the close packed

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
direction in the close packed plane
because that's where the

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:51.870
bonds are most dense.
So, Tom, may we go back to the

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:55.620
computer video please?
So, here's the set of directions.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.370
I just showed you FCC. The highest
density plane is 1-1-1,

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.120
and the close packed direction,
that's the direction where the atoms

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.870
touch. You know this.
They touch along 0-1-1.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.620
In BCC, it's the complement.
The highest density plane is the

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.370
cube diagonal that contains that
central atom. And,

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.120
the closest packed direction is the
body diagonal. That's

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:23.330
where the atoms touch.
Simple cubic it's the face and the

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:29.990
face. So, this is now the origin of
mechanical behavior.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:36.660
This is the origin of mechanical
behavior. I can look at this and I

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:43.330
can tell you how the material will
deform. So, if I take the set of

00:46:43.330 --> 00:47:00.193
close packed planes moving in close
packed directions.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Together, this represents the slip
system. And this is how the

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
material deforms.
And so, we'll come back to that

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
next day. I see we're getting close
to the end of the hour.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
So, let me jump ahead here,
jump through this, we'll go through

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
that. I'll show you that another
time. All right,

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I'll talk to you about defects and
crystals.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:25.660
I talked to you about boron.
You know what happens if you dope

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:31.330
silicon with boron?
You end up with something that is a

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:36.990
p-type semiconductor.
It's shy one electron,

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:42.660
generates a hole. This is the Hope
Diamond. What makes the Hope

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:48.330
Diamond so precious is not only its
size, but it's blue.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:48:06.993
And, how did it get to be blue?
It got to be blue by boron doping.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:47.000
It's boron doping at around one part
per million. And what this does is

00:47:47.000 --> 00:48:00.000
it puts an acceptor level about 0.
eV above the valence band.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.500
And with the acceptor level about 0.
eV above the valence band, we now

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:09.000
have transitions that give us this
beautiful blue color.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.500
So, what you're looking at is -
these are not Hope Diamonds.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.000
This is just some 51 little units
by Cartier. And,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.500
this is the rest. This is in the
Smithsonian. So,

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.000
if you're in Washington sometime and
you want to study boron doping,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.500
well, you can go and see this at the
national gem collection.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:36.000
And you can stand with your
contemporaries and explain to them

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.500
the boron doping and how it makes
the thing blue.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.766
All right, good luck on Wednesday.
