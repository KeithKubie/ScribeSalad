00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
when can I be very original about it but
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.499
when can I be very original about it but
the impressive thing is of course that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
the impressive thing is of course that

may have been described many times

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899
may have been described many times
 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.809
may have been described many times
before but it's an extraordinary thing

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819
before but it's an extraordinary thing
 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.760
before but it's an extraordinary thing
to a witness that first bugs you know I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770
to a witness that first bugs you know I
 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.860
to a witness that first bugs you know I
know it's a yeah

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.760
it's a little one cannot really describe

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
it's a little one cannot really describe
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.180
it's a little one cannot really describe
it because it's so impressive

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.380
my first comment was to after the thing

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
my first comment was to after the thing
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.790
my first comment was to after the thing
went off was was to a an MP who was at

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800
went off was was to a an MP who was at
 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.370
went off was was to a an MP who was at
the door of the main control bunker I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380
the door of the main control bunker I
 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.420
the door of the main control bunker I
don't know why he was there but you know

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
don't know why he was there but you know
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580
don't know why he was there but you know
he was supposedly to control access but

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
he was supposedly to control access but
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.460
he was supposedly to control access but
you wouldn't know who was to be let in

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
you wouldn't know who was to be let in
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.960
you wouldn't know who was to be let in
it was not to be like that I know about

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970
it was not to be like that I know about
 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.979
it was not to be like that I know about
it he after they explosion he no one had

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
it he after they explosion he no one had
 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.400
it he after they explosion he no one had
told him what to expect and he was just

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410
told him what to expect and he was just
 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.699
told him what to expect and he was just
just totally white and so my comment to

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709
just totally white and so my comment to
 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.560
just totally white and so my comment to
him was that the world will soon be over

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570
him was that the world will soon be over
 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.870
him was that the world will soon be over
and of course it was that comment the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
and of course it was that comment the
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.300
and of course it was that comment the
wall was in behavior was that impressed

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
wall was in behavior was that impressed
 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.130
wall was in behavior was that impressed
upon you by the blast I mean presumably

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140
upon you by the blast I mean presumably
 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.780
upon you by the blast I mean presumably
you knew what no the fact that it was

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
you knew what no the fact that it was
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.210
you knew what no the fact that it was
that it worked anyone think like that it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
that it worked anyone think like that it
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.220
that it worked anyone think like that it
worked and such an enormous blast yeah

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230
worked and such an enormous blast yeah
 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.930
worked and such an enormous blast yeah
at 6 miles away it takes about 30

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
at 6 miles away it takes about 30
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.240
at 6 miles away it takes about 30
minutes for I'm sorry 30 seconds for the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250
minutes for I'm sorry 30 seconds for the
 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.250
minutes for I'm sorry 30 seconds for the
sound wave to travel that distance and

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
sound wave to travel that distance and
 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.090
sound wave to travel that distance and
of course a corresponding number of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100
of course a corresponding number of
 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.190
of course a corresponding number of
micro seconds for the light to reach him

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200
micro seconds for the light to reach him
 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.030
micro seconds for the light to reach him
so after the flash of light had begun

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040
so after the flash of light had begun
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.190
so after the flash of light had begun
damn I I stood up he got a better view

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200
damn I I stood up he got a better view
 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.199
damn I I stood up he got a better view
of the rising mushroom cloud and then

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209
of the rising mushroom cloud and then
 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.990
of the rising mushroom cloud and then
realized the shockwave had another front

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000
realized the shockwave had another front
 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.819
realized the shockwave had another front
then we got back quickly got back down

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829
then we got back quickly got back down
 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.949
then we got back quickly got back down
on the crack but it is a rather curious

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959
on the crack but it is a rather curious
 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.029
on the crack but it is a rather curious
thing to see the something happened and

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039
thing to see the something happened and
 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.810
thing to see the something happened and
then you don't are not aware of it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
then you don't are not aware of it
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.240
then you don't are not aware of it
really until 8 minutes rather I'm sorry

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250
really until 8 minutes rather I'm sorry
 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.090
really until 8 minutes rather I'm sorry
30 seconds later I said eight minutes

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100
30 seconds later I said eight minutes
 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.170
30 seconds later I said eight minutes
because that's the length of time it

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
because that's the length of time it
 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.830
because that's the length of time it
takes lighter

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840
takes lighter
 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.720
takes lighter
reach of the Earth from the Sun

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730
reach of the Earth from the Sun
 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.940
reach of the Earth from the Sun
did you see the sound wave traveling

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950
did you see the sound wave traveling
 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.290
did you see the sound wave traveling
towards you did you see anyone no no

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
towards you did you see anyone no no
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.350
towards you did you see anyone no no
there's nothing there's nothing to

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360
there's nothing there's nothing to
 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
there's nothing there's nothing to
observe there was just this suddenly

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170
observe there was just this suddenly
 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.790
observe there was just this suddenly
this pulse of wind and then the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
this pulse of wind and then the
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.320
this pulse of wind and then the
reverberation of the sound in the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330
reverberation of the sound in the
 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.440
reverberation of the sound in the
mountains nearby he can just rumbled on

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450
mountains nearby he can just rumbled on
 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:58.630
mountains nearby he can just rumbled on
like heavy thunderstorm if I had been

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640
like heavy thunderstorm if I had been
 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.920
like heavy thunderstorm if I had been
standing I don't know if I'd been

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930
standing I don't know if I'd been
 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.720
