00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.640
PROFESSOR: All right,
you know the drill

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.120
from the previous
couple of weeks.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.030
Get your piece of paper out,
and write down what you think

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.700
were important concepts
for the last week or so.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
OK.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.910
Let's see what you
have on your papers.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.970
AUDIENCE: Center of mass can be
used to find the total force.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.010
PROFESSOR: So the concept
is center of mass and things

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.080
you can use it for.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:07.110
So I'm going to generalize
that to "systems of particles."

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.180
And what you've just
said is, center of mass

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.040
is one thing that
comes from that.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.724
Anybody, on this subject
of systems of particles,

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:16.890
anybody else have something?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.194
AUDIENCE: Angular momentum?

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.360
PROFESSOR: Angular momentum.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.900
So what about it?

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this concept
of the summation of the hi's,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.100
equal to H at the system,
and that you can use that.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.720
Anything else about systems
of particles that we learned?

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.920
AUDIENCE: Newton's third
law between the particles?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.378
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
Newton's third law

00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:48.900
can help to support things
out, and a consequence-- you

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.200
found center of
mass, that's useful,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.340
but you take the derivative
of the center of mass,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.080
what do you find out?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:08.646
rG here, dot times the
total mass is what?

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:10.930
AUDIENCE: Momentum?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.786
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's momentum,
but it's momentum of what?

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:15.407
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.740
PROFESSOR: Well, it's the
momentum of the entire system,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.240
right?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.680
And so this is the
summation of the Pi.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.240
That's kind of important.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.840
And finally, take
another derivative,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.820
what did you learn about that?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.596
Pardon?

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:34.450
AUDIENCE: Forces?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.825
PROFESSOR: What kind of forces?

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:36.300
AUDIENCE: External.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.508
PROFESSOR: All the external
forces are in the system.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:39.360
All of them.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:49.087
So powerful things came out of
thinking about center of mass.

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:50.545
All right, what's
something else we

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.878
did in the week that wasn't
around systems of particles?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.540
Yes.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.550
Actually, say your name
when I call on you,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.600
I'm gonna try to learn
more of your names.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.433
AUDIENCE: Christina.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.040
PROFESSOR: Christina, right.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.465
AUDIENCE: So, when you're
looking at equations,

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:09.405
for example, like
the force external

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:14.255
is equal to the change
in angular momentum.

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:15.871
Looking at what
pieces go where, so

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:17.412
if you have a defined
moment, does it

00:03:17.412 --> 00:03:18.640
go on this side or that side?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.720
PROFESSOR: OK, and I'd put that
in the category of free body

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.970
diagrams, are you thinking of?

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.655
So, constructing
free body diagrams.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.915
OK, what else?

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:43.030
AUDIENCE: Eddie.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.786
PROFESSOR: Eddie?

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.888
AUDIENCE: The two different
methods for finding torque.

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:53.905
PROFESSOR: So, let's go a
little further with torque.

00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.690
What do you use the torque for?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.320
What do you want
to find torque for?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.350
To get-- let's generalize
this to equations of motion,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:14.570
so both for forces, and moments.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.649
Two different kinds
of problems that we

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.497
are able to do by being
able to find the torques.

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:24.080
Anything else?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.307
It's important this week.

00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:30.223
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean,
this isn't a math course.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.190
Yeah, you've got to be able to
solve differential equations,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.690
yeah.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.960
Maybe you're actually
onto something here,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.010
but let's put it in the context
of what kind of equations

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.260
we work on a lot on this week.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.810
What kind of
equations of motion?

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.720
I don't mean like
second order linear,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.960
I mean we're doing dynamics.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.710
We're doing dynamics
of what kind?

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.000
AUDIENCE: Acceleration?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but also,
a lot of examples this week,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.356
were they rotational problems
or translational problems?

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:13.230
AUDIENCE: Rotational?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.530
PROFESSOR: Right, kind of
a heavy emphasis this week

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.080
on angular momentum, right?

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:33.595
So, using-- That's
a pretty good list.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.620
My own list had
most of that on it.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.350
Let's see where my list was.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.060
Center of mass, r
dot, r double dot.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.790
I wrote these as equations.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.260
So this thing in
particular, the summation

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.490
of the external torques
with respect to some point,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:09.850
for a particle, is dh
dt, plus vA, cross P.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.980
And we were just beginning
to do sums of collections

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.550
of particles,
rigid bodies, where

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.690
you have maybe more
than one particle,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.510
the summation of the
torques is the H-- capital

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:35.259
H-- for the summation of the h
of i's, dt plus vA in o cross,

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:36.800
and here's where we
learned something

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.750
up here that you can do down
here that was really helpful.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.033
What crossed with what?

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:42.820
AUDIENCE: P.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.420
PROFESSOR: Which P?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.890
PROFESSOR: This
one up here, right?

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.780
And that's actually this.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.620
So this is cross P of the
center of mass of the system.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.730
OK good, that's a
pretty good list.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.005
So now, let's do a problem.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.080
So here's the problem.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.370
It's a rigid rod, with
a mass on the end,

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.050
and the rod's massless just to
make it easy for the moment.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.920
But this is now a rigid body.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.692
There's a torsional spring here.

00:07:30.692 --> 00:07:34.240
And the torsional spring
resists angular displacement

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.000
with a torque that's equal
to the spring constant times

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.070
the theta that you
push it through.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.950
So it generates a moment,
a restoring moment.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.650
When you push it away, it
tries to push this thing back.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:52.190
Gravity is also acting, so
it's a pendulum as a rigid body

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.100
and a torsional spring.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.550
So the first step-- I want
you to eventually find

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.590
the equation of motion.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.600
And I want you to start by
doing a free body diagram.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.270
But before you go
to work, I'm going

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.320
to give you a little quick
mini-lecture on free body

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.550
diagrams.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.220
So, the first thing you
do is assign coordinates.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.320
Maybe draw is not-- really
assign the coordinates

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.390
for the problem.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.707
Determine the number
of degrees of freedom.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.290
We haven't talked
about that much yet.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.850
It will become much more
important in the subject.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.460
The number of degrees of
freedom-- but I'll say it once,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.890
and will do much
more with this--

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.010
the number of degrees of
freedom is the same thing

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.440
as the number of
independent coordinates

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.535
you need to completely
describe the motion.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.065
And the number of
independent coordinates

00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:54.650
that you need is equal to the
number of equations of motion

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.940
that you'll get.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.500
So this problem, how many
coordinates does it take--

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.170
and this is planar motion,
it's confined to the board.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.160
How many actual
coordinates does it

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.120
take to completely describe
the position of this thing?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.305
I see a one, how
about-- anybody else?

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:16.930
What's the one?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.242
What would you choose?

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:21.180
AUDIENCE: I think I'd
probably go with polar.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.606
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well
what coordinate itself?

00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:24.980
What is the single
coordinate you

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.980
would use to define the
motion of the system?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.355
I hear a theta.

00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:31.690
Everybody agree?

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.640
Theta of t, if you can
figure out theta of t,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.050
you know this position of
this thing for all time.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.560
That's all you
need, is one degree

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.070
of freedom, one
coordinate, and in terms

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.630
of choosing the
coordinate system to use,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.790
basically you were
saying, use what?

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.494
AUDIENCE: Polar

00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:47.285
PROFESSOR: Polar
coordinates centered here.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.596
But-- there's your
inertial system,

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:54.220
but you're going to
go with this point.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.200
This is our A point,
and is it moving?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.900
So if we use
expressions like this,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.682
what will happen to that term?

00:10:02.682 --> 00:10:04.120
It goes away.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.856
AUDIENCE: So if you
were using Cartesian,

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:07.320
would it be two
degrees of freedom?

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.910
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.064
And we'll get to that.

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:12.730
If I divert to that,
I won't finish what

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.010
I've got planned for today.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.295
It's important and we're
going to come back to that.

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:17.420
Has to do with constraints.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.660
So you assign the coordinates,
determine the number

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.940
of degrees of freedom,
assign positive values

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.230
to all rotations, displacements,
velocities, linear velocities,

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.840
and rotational velocities,
in the problem.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.500
Positive values of those.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.360
And from that, you
deduce the direction

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.600
of the resulting
forces and moments.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.560
And this will help you
get the signs correct,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.410
especially when you
have multi-body problems

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.900
like two masses with a
spring in between them.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.370
Which way do the
forces go on each mass?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.560
In this problem, there's
only one coordinate,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.170
so what we're really saying
is assign a positive theta,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.760
and assume a positive theta dot.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.030
What are the resulting forces
that end up in your free body

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.840
diagram?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.410
So now, I want you to
draw the free body diagram

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.370
for this thing, and up
here, final statement,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.510
put in all forces and moments.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.240
Don't leave out anything,
because you know

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.520
they're not going to matter.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.520
Because it'll get you in
trouble as the problems

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.130
get more complicated.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.790
OK, draw your free
body diagrams.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.115
OK, so we're going to get
in groups of three or four,

00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:35.410
and compare notes here.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.020
You guys are kind
of a natural group--

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.015
check each other's stuff
and come up with a final.

00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:45.265
AUDIENCE: We were having a
debate about whether or not

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:47.750
you were asking us for the free
body diagram of the system,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.500
or if you were asking
us for the free body

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.350
diagram of the mass itself.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
are there moments

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.150
and things involved up here?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.275
Like that torsional spring?

00:11:58.275 --> 00:12:00.899
AUDIENCE: When you are including
the entire system there, yeah.

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:03.030
PROFESSOR: OK, so
this is a rigid body.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.840
I kept saying this
is a rigid body.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.220
Happens to have a
single mass point in it,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.380
but it's a whole,
single, rigid body.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.405
And do the free body
diagram for the rigid body.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.370
PROFESSOR: Can you
show me something?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.917
Where are you at-- what's
your best shot at this so far?

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:29.975
AUDIENCE: The free body
diagram needs [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:29.975 --> 00:12:33.310
And we say the spring force
is producing the moment.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.685
PROFESSOR: So what's your
body that you're working with?

00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:39.849
What's the definition
of a rigid body?

00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:41.390
AUDIENCE: Mass on
the end of the rod?

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.230
PROFESSOR: OK, so you're still
thinking about the particle.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.430
But if you don't think
about the particle,

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.090
it's kind of hard to get that
torsional spring involved.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.110
So you need to think of this
as a single, whole body.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.370
One whole, rigid body.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.011
And now, just draw a stick in
here, and put the forces on it.

00:12:56.011 --> 00:12:58.010
Doesn't matter where the
mass is for the purpose

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.840
of the free body diagram.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.676
That comes into the--

00:13:01.676 --> 00:13:07.070
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you
just use the r cross force?

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.190
And get the force in
the ball from the--

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.176
PROFESSOR: So you're
getting into the equation

00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:13.050
of motion part of it.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.370
This is only about assuming this
thing has some dynamic moment

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.100
in time, and draw the external
forces and moments that

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.240
act on the object.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.194
And the object is this
full-length stick.

00:13:27.194 --> 00:13:28.610
AUDIENCE: So in
that case, we just

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.692
have the spring force
acting, in opposition

00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:36.885
to [INAUDIBLE] the weight?

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:39.030
PROFESSOR: You have
weight, for sure.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.630
You have the spring, puts
a moment on the system,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.030
and there are yet
potential other forces.

00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:12.400
PROFESSOR: I'll give you a
couple minutes, because there's

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.450
a little confusion
around whether it's

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.980
a particle or a rigid body.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.700
It's a rigid body.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.470
You've got to deal
with the whole body.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.330
All right, let's
see what you've got.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.240
Where's your free body diagram?

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.200
AUDIENCE: This right here.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.020
PROFESSOR: OK, tell me what you
have for forces and moments,

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.620
just point to each one of
'em and say what it is.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.190
AUDIENCE: So, we have the
weight of the this end,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.200
and we assume this is massless.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.320
PROFESSOR: Yup, but it's rigid,
so it's all one system now,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.384
you have one rigid body.

00:14:41.384 --> 00:14:43.300
AUDIENCE: So the center
of mass is right here,

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.130
because there's-- [INAUDIBLE],
and then we have reaction

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.780
forces at the pin, and then we
have the moment from the spring

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.280
there.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.863
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.954
AUDIENCE: We have the
balls moving forever--

00:14:57.954 --> 00:14:59.620
PROFESSOR: So, you've
gotta convince one

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.150
another who's right, here, so--

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.566
AUDIENCE: Well, it depends on
which way the ball's moving.

00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:06.460
PROFESSOR: So, that's why
there is a little system.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.470
There's a rubric that
I-- I recommend you just

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.150
use the system.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.660
This is basically a system for
getting equations of motion,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.565
and this is important, that one.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.910
So then if you
know it's positive,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.470
then you can figure out which
direction the reaction is.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.700
All right, I hate
stopping all the fun.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.200
You guys are doing well.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.390
There is great value in
talking to one another,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.010
and convincing one
another of what

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.020
the right way to
do something is.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.600
You'll have two different points
of view, and talking it out,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.440
It's amazing how fast
you can make progress.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.680
So do that, do that when
you're home solving problems.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.270
So what was the assignment here?

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.460
Draw a free body diagram.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.070
Let's do it.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.400
So it's a rigid body.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.350
All one body, even though the
mass is all concentrated down

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:11.380
here, the forces-- what are
forces that are on this thing?

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.390
Give me one.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.890
Wait, mg, right?

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.185
OK, what else?

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.351
AUDIENCE: Normal force?

00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:20.350
PROFESSOR: Normal force.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.790
Where?

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.665
AUDIENCE: On the top.

00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:24.910
PROFESSOR: OK, so you're talking
about a reaction force up here?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.850
And have you chosen
a coordinate system?

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.550
We already kind of
decided, didn't we,

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.010
on polar coordinates
for this, right?

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.480
So are the reaction
forces known?

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.690
To start with, no.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.880
So what's the cleverest
way to assign them

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.716
on your free body diagram?

00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:45.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.790
PROFESSOR: Well, and associated
with your coordinates, right?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.700
So, I would have two
reaction forces up here, one

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.810
in each of which directions?

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.740
AUDIENCE: Radial.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.475
PROFESSOR: Radial, and?

00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:00.350
AUDIENCE: Tangential.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.970
PROFESSOR: OK, and the positive
radial, positive tangential,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.920
like that, right?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.230
So I would say, I have
an unknown F theta force,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.750
and I have an unknown FR
force, and I draw them

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.579
in the positive directions
because I have no clue.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.900
So just make them positive.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.910
You assume direction for them.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.250
Force is here, g there,
what about the tension

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.053
in the string?

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:29.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.700
PROFESSOR: Does it
belong in this problem?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.520
Why not?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.910
The rigid body-- it's
an internal force.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.380
It's the little
fij fji thing, it's

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.300
those things that cancel
internally, right?

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.410
So you don't have
to deal with it.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.450
It's not an external
force to the rigid body.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.090
So this is great.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.160
The next step in this is to
find an equation of motion.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.570
Gotta to be speedy about this.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.870
So, what--

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.825
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:04.600
AUDIENCE: Moment.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.350
PROFESSOR: Moment.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.690
You'd use moment to do it.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.012
About what point?

00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:10.322
AUDIENCE: About the
point up at the top.

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:12.155
PROFESSOR: All right,
so if we call that A,

00:18:12.155 --> 00:18:14.502
you'd use angular
momentum, and torques,

00:18:14.502 --> 00:18:15.460
and that sort of thing?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.110
Is that what you're saying?

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.890
Moments about it?

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.014
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was
just wondering if you

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:19.305
were gonna draw it up on there.

00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:21.400
PROFESSOR: No, I'm gonna
have you do it yourself.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.440
Do it.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.529
So now--

00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:26.070
AUDIENCE: Well, is she talking
about how there's the moment--

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.060
the resistent moment.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.925
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:18:28.925 --> 00:18:30.590
Did we forget that one?

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.560
So which direction is it?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.408
Clockwise, or counterclockwise?

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:38.900
AUDIENCE: It's clockwise.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.400
PROFESSOR: All right, so there's
a moment about this point that

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.630
is-- we know what it is.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:50.110
It's in that direction that
has value kt times theta.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.280
Any time you know what it is,
don't just make it an unknown,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.980
write it out.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.730
You know it's that, and you
know it's in this direction.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.470
And we're going to write--
how many equations of motion

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.010
will we get?

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.766
PROFESSOR: And we've
chosen polar coordinates.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.760
You could do this using forces.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.251
Just Newton's second law.

00:19:11.251 --> 00:19:12.750
But then you have
to solve for what?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.980
If you write force
balance, F equals ma,

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.480
you have these up here,
and you don't know them.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.480
So the reason to use
torques in this problem

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.210
is because, are these going
to appear in your answer?

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:28.840
No.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.511
So that's the reason
to use torques.

00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:31.010
Yeah.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.230
AUDIENCE: Is that
k-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.710
PROFESSOR: This is k
sub t to distinguish it

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.640
as a torsional spring.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.390
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
multiplied by L--

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:45.770
PROFESSOR: No, it doesn't
have an L, it's right here.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.920
It's a spring who gives a moment
resistance to being deflected.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.210
kt theta is units of torques.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.120
And this isn't units of
force per unit displacement,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.480
this is units of
torque per radian.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.110
OK?

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.610
Yeah.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.526
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.160
PROFESSOR: Well, you have
assigned polar coordinates,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.470
and my assumption was
that-- I drew it right here.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.762
There is positive theta hat.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.006
Right?

00:20:19.006 --> 00:20:21.310
AUDIENCE: So isn't
our torque negative?

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.410
But see, I've
drawn-- this negative

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.590
is accounted for by the
direction of the arrow.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.240
So let's now write the
equation of motion,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.870
and to do the
equation of motion,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.970
you're going to say that
the sum of the what?

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.720
AUDIENCE: Torques.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.250
PROFESSOR: External torques.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.650
About what point?

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.350
AUDIENCE: A.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.216
PROFESSOR: A is equal to?

00:20:43.216 --> 00:20:45.077
AUDIENCE: dH dt?

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.660
PROFESSOR: And I'll
use the capital H,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.360
because we're now working
our way onto rigid bodies.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.776
We could have more
than one point,

00:20:49.776 --> 00:20:53.230
we could have more than
one mass point, dH dt plus?

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.880
AUDIENCE: v.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.030
PROFESSOR: vA cross P, and
what's that in this problem?

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.930
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.870
PROFESSOR: That guy
conveniently is 0.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.650
So, do it.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.060
You can now do this problem.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.270
Figure out, write down
an equation of motion,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.016
using some of external
torques and-- so

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:11.640
you're gonna have to
figure out angular

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.150
momentum and some torques.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.370
I hate pulling you guys away.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.780
Lots of good thinking going on.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.880
All right, drag yourselves
away, help me out here.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.094
Which groups figured out
the external torques?

00:21:37.094 --> 00:21:37.760
What do you got?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.656
Tell me what to do here.

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:41.520
AUDIENCE: We have
the one for gravity.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.770
PROFESSOR: Tell me what it is.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.140
I wanna write the terms down.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.720
AUDIENCE: It is
negative Lmg sine theta.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:53.854
PROFESSOR: Minus mgL sine
theta, in what direction?

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.185
AUDIENCE: k hat?

00:21:56.185 --> 00:21:57.810
PROFESSOR: Others
agree with that term?

00:22:00.607 --> 00:22:01.107
Hmm?

00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:02.023
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.790
PROFESSOR: Wait a second,
just one term at a time here.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.105
The gravity term, do we
have the sign correct?

00:22:11.105 --> 00:22:12.890
And then we have the
moment arm correct?

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.580
So this is the moment
arm, r cross force.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.530
Looks like minus k to me.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.540
mgL sine theta.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.819
Looks pretty good.

00:22:21.819 --> 00:22:22.610
What other torques?

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.540
AUDIENCE: The moment
from the spring.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.580
PROFESSOR: Moment
from the spring.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.530
Tell me how to write that.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.810
AUDIENCE: That's in the negative
k hat section, so minus m hat.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.690
Well, then [INAUDIBLE] kt theta.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.180
PROFESSOR: kt theta,
also in k hat direction.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.960
And our free body digram,
the forces produce moments.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.110
Is everybody happy with that?

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.360
Are we done?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.600
Any questions about it?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.650
Why it's used the way it is?

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.870
OK.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.160
Now we need this piece of it.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.220
So what's the H?

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.970
For rigid body, the
summation of all the

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.670
bits-- how many bits are there?

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.050
Just the one.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.290
And that's sum r,
cross P. Can somebody

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.160
tell me what they
got for the p, is

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.310
the momentum of our
little mass here,

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.840
with respect to an inertial
frame, which is also

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.590
A because it's not moving.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:37.520
And r is L. So this is
L r hat cross m, what?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.110
L, theta dot is its velocity,
mass times velocity,

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.210
and its direction?

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.210
Theta hat.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:51.450
r cross theta is k,
so this looks like mL

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:57.190
squared theta dot k hat.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.900
Are we all in agreement?

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.416
dH dt?

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.243
This k changed direction, so
the only time-dependent thing--

00:24:06.243 --> 00:24:08.360
AUDIENCE: I think
you're missing a dot.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.100
PROFESSOR: Oh, thank you,
we're going to need that.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.354
All right, the derivative is?

00:24:14.354 --> 00:24:15.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:21.130
PROFESSOR: OK,
that's equal to that.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.070
It's all k's, you need just
one equation out of this,

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.500
you don't have to break it
down into subcomponents.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.820
And you can collect
it all on one side.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:41.540
mL squared theta double dot plus
kt theta plus mgL sine theta

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.370
equals 0.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.800
And that's a second order
nonlinear ordinary differential

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.010
equation, which you could
linearize for small motion.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.782
It's just a pendulum, OK?

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:54.718
Good.

00:24:54.718 --> 00:24:57.820
We got one other one I want
to do before the hour's out.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.715
I got a big piece of cement
pipe on the back of a truck.

00:25:05.715 --> 00:25:08.710
It's not tied down.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.490
The truck's moving at
3 meters per second.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:20.220
And the rotation rate
of this piece of pipe

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.550
is 6 radians per second.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.570
And the truck's
accelerating, minus 1/2

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.750
a meter per second squared.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.880
It's actually breaking.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.550
The guy's in trouble, right?

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:39.500
So the first thing here is--
omega 6 radians per second,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:46.490
does it matter, with respect to
what, the truck or the ground?

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.470
I haven't told you.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.860
Talk in your groups, and give
me a quick answer to that.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.219
What do you think?

00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:27.260
AUDIENCE: Doesn't matter.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:27.770
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.070
AUDIENCE: Doesn't matter?

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.320
PROFESSOR: So Kristen
thinks it doesn't matter.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.370
Anybody wanna counter that?

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:36.870
Why not?

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.900
So, you're saying that this
could be omega with respect

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.980
to the truck?

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.280
Or it could be omega with
respect to this fixed frame,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.510
and the answer will be
the same in either case?

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.982
Christine, right?

00:26:51.982 --> 00:26:52.815
AUDIENCE: Christina.

00:26:52.815 --> 00:26:54.880
PROFESSOR: Christina, alright.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.588
AUDIENCE: So earlier,
we had that problem

00:26:56.588 --> 00:26:58.909
with-- there was
an r, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.950
and then there was another
[INAUDIBLE] over here.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.455
You had to know what this
omega was with respect to what,

00:27:04.455 --> 00:27:06.760
because this arm's
rotating also.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.262
And so, with this, you have
your one xy-coordinate system,

00:27:10.262 --> 00:27:11.720
and while the truck
is translating,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.960
the truck's not gonna
be in rotation itself,

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.395
so it's staying in the
same coordinate plane,

00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:17.565
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:17.565 --> 00:27:19.106
PROFESSOR: So your
argument is if you

00:27:19.106 --> 00:27:21.314
were were standing on the
ground, seeing it rotating,

00:27:21.314 --> 00:27:23.840
you'd say-- you would see
it rotated at the same rate

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.240
as if you were
riding on the truck.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.965
Everybody agree with that?

00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:29.840
Does it matter that the
truck's accelerating?

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.591
PROFESSOR: No, it's only whether
or not the truck's rotating.

00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:42.380
If the truck's not
rotating, then rotation rate

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.130
seen from this frame or
just a translating frame

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.500
will always seem the same.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.110
Even if you're accelerating.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.960
OK, so we've done that one.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.240
Now, I want you to find the
velocity of point G, given

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.950
this information.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.704
So, whip it down
quickly, how you

00:28:00.704 --> 00:28:01.870
would approach this problem.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.360
See if you can solve it.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.520
G is the center of
mass of that big pipe.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.310
OK, we're gonna run out of time.

00:28:13.396 --> 00:28:14.520
Who's got an answer for me?

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.960
I think they've
got it sorted out.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.250
Kristen?

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.916
AUDIENCE: So, we have
velocity of the truck, minus

00:28:20.916 --> 00:28:22.930
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.805
PROFESSOR: All right,
so let's be systematic.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.190
You have to pick some
points, and did you

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.610
use a rotating frame?

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.622
Use an equation that requires
a rotating reference frame?

00:28:35.622 --> 00:28:39.439
AUDIENCE: No, because the
translational [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:40.980
PROFESSOR: So I
assume you're talking

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.710
about-- we're looking at
the velocity of G in o,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:50.210
is equal to, in general,
the velocity of some point

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.030
A that you're
gonna have to pick,

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:56.850
plus the velocity of
G with respect to A.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.890
And this thing has two
possible components, right?

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:10.130
One which is the derivative of
GA, dt, ignoring the rotation,

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:17.330
plus-- OK.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.180
What's this term
in this problem?

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.930
Well, we haven't picked
the point A. Where

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.880
are you going to pick point A?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.490
There's dumb points,
and there's good points.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.334
What?

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:29.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.070
PROFESSOR: Front of the truck.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.903
Well, it's possible.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.450
Christina, what do you think?

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.065
AUDIENCE: I couldn't-- on
the bottom of this part

00:29:40.065 --> 00:29:40.597
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:40.597 --> 00:29:41.930
PROFESSOR: The point of contact?

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.249
Is that what you're saying?

00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:43.790
Anybody else?

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.380
What do you vote for?

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.781
Where do you want to put A?

00:29:45.781 --> 00:29:47.505
AUDIENCE: Point of contact.

00:29:47.505 --> 00:29:49.050
PROFESSOR: Point of contact, OK.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.600
If you're using this equation,
and you're using these pieces,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.720
you are using the concept
of a rotating frame.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.260
If there's any omega
in the problem,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.227
you'd better have a
rotating frame somewhere.

00:30:01.227 --> 00:30:02.810
Unless you're using
polar coordinates,

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.890
which is sort of a
degenerate rotating frame.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.840
So at this point, we're
going to make A here.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:17.160
And you have a coordinate
system, little x1 y1,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.730
and attach the A. So you
have an A x1 y1, here z1.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.650
And is it rotating?

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.720
Is it a rotating
coordinate system?

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.986
Well, if it's not,
then you can't do this.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:46.740
This assumes-- this term
here is the velocity

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.250
at which this point
and this point

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.420
are moving relative
to one another,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.825
as if you were
sitting on the pipe.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.160
Ignoring the-- you
don't see the rotation,

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.880
you're moving with the pipe.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.220
It's assuming you have then put
a reference frame on the pipe

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.330
that moves with the pipe.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.800
So does the little reference
frame, reference frame Axyz

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.890
move with the pipe?

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:15.970
It better, or you
can't use the equation.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.880
So this is attached to the pipe.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.580
And as it rolls, you have
to allow that xyz frame

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.640
to move with it.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.870
OK.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.260
So in that frame,
what's this term?

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.340
This is 0 because the two
points are fixed in the pipe.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.164
And what's this velocity?

00:31:35.164 --> 00:31:36.580
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.040
PROFESSOR: 3 meters per
second in what direction?

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.310
We'll do it in an
inertial frame if we want.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.870
And then what's this term?

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.730
So it's 6, and we
said it doesn't

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.070
matter what frame it is,
it's all the same rotation

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.820
rate, radians per second.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.700
In what direction?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:03.250
k hat cross, the
radius is capital R,

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.120
what's this direction?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.040
And now this is at
an instant in time.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.110
At this particular
instant in time,

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.320
you've cleverly drawn the xyz
system so it lines up with them

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.000
after so it makes
the problem easy.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.320
So at the moment, it's
either in the big J hat

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.840
or in the little j hat.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.190
It's easiest if you do
it in big-- call it big

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.520
J, because then you're done.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:33.280
So, k cross J, I
think negative I.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.020
And so this should
work out to be

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:44.830
3 meters per second positive
I. 1 and 1/2 times 6 is

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.370
9 and a minus.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:54.340
9 meters per second
in the I direction.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:59.200
So you are at minus
6 meters per second.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.110
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
radius from point G?

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.610
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:08.010
PROFESSOR: Wouldn't it be what?

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.490
AUDIENCE: Does it
matter if it's negative?

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.800
PROFESSOR: Ah, it matters a lot.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:20.920
You have to exercise great care
when you pick the R vector.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.310
And the R vector
goes from your origin

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.800
to the point you're
talking about.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.950
So the origin, that's your
frame, and that's the point.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.230
And when you draw the
arrow, the R vector,

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.660
it goes from A to G.
That's its direction.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.230
And it has-- its length
is capital R long.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.110
Yeah, that's a really,
really important point,

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.680
which way the arrows go.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.850
OK, and so now we're
done with that.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:56.130
Let's see, we've
got a minute or two.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.690
Let's talk about
the acceleration.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.560
Let's do the acceleration of
this problem, acceleration

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.330
of G in o, and this
is just an exercise

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.360
in remembering the terms.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.889
Full 3D vector equation
for accelerations.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.934
What's the first term here?

00:34:13.934 --> 00:34:14.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:19.780
PROFESSOR: How about before
we even get into-- we're

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.759
not in polar
coordinates in this.

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.300
AUDIENCE: The
acceleration of A in o?

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.610
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's just work it out.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.340
I start with this one
myself, acceleration of A

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.150
with respect to o.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.270
What's another term?

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.389
AUDIENCE: Acceleration
of G with respect to A.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.250
PROFESSOR: So the
acceleration of G

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:40.050
with respect to A, but
no rotation, right?

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.650
That term.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:44.889
Plus, how many more
terms do we have to go?

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.510
Three, OK.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.360
Give me one.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.316
Somebody else?

00:34:49.316 --> 00:34:50.839
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:52.005
PROFESSOR: What's your name?

00:34:52.005 --> 00:34:53.190
AUDIENCE: Stephen.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.600
PROFESSOR: Stephen.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:00.400
You've got a 2 omega,
and omega is-- let's

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.099
get this unit vector in here.

00:35:03.099 --> 00:35:04.140
Well, actually let's not.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.280
2 omega cross r,
let's just do that.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.465
OK?

00:35:08.465 --> 00:35:09.340
Give me another term.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.701
Somebody else?

00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:16.410
AUDIENCE: Omega
cross [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.870
PROFESSOR: Omega
cross omega cross r.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.655
And got another one.

00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:23.571
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
and in fact, we'd

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.210
better be a little
more careful than that.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:44.550
So it's really the velocity
of G with respect to A.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.721
And does it have
rotation in it or not?

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.090
This is the no rotation.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.710
This is the speed at which
the points are moving apart

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.000
from one another, right?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.110
Omega cross omega cross
r, we've got-- one, two--

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.630
I think we need another term.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.960
Omega dot cross r.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:17.030
And the r is rGA, this r is GA.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.554
OK, so what's the
acceleration of this?

00:36:20.554 --> 00:36:21.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.255
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:36:22.255 --> 00:36:23.607
AUDIENCE: Negative half.

00:36:23.607 --> 00:36:25.065
PROFESSOR: So this
one's minus 1/2.

00:36:28.844 --> 00:36:29.510
What's this one?

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.800
So you're in the
frame of the pipe now,

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.180
and this is the speed at
which the acceleration of G

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:43.830
with respect to A. It doesn't
move, it's fixed length, right?

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.760
This one, what's the velocity
of G with respect to A,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.175
without rotation involved?

00:36:54.070 --> 00:37:02.690
OK, and this one is omega k
cross, and this is our, again,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.640
omega k cross.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.360
And this RG, it's R in what
direction at this instant?

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.260
J, right?

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.610
So we could work that out.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.120
And what about this one?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.210
What direction is omega dot in?

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:26.810
k cross R, at this
instant, J again.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.370
Do we know that value?

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:29.570
No.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.860
That might be something
we have to figure out.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.902
So you could now crank this out.

00:37:35.902 --> 00:37:37.610
That'd be the acceleration
of that point,

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:40.180
but you'd find out that
we don't have that.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.978
Now, how would you go about
finding out what omega dot is?

00:37:45.978 --> 00:37:48.338
AUDIENCE: Equations of motion?

00:37:48.338 --> 00:37:50.870
PROFESSOR: You
get the gold star.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.090
Equations of motion.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.620
You need to come up with
equations of motion.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:06.270
And how many equations of
motion would we end up writing?

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.750
This is equivalent to asking
how many degrees of freedom

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.320
are there.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.220
I hear 2, I hear a 1.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:24.930
Now, there's a lot of
nuances to this discussion.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:30.100
Anytime you're given a
fixed value for something,

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.170
that coordinate is constrained,
that parameter's constrained.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.100
We're given the
motion of the truck.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.310
It's completely specified.

00:38:47.481 --> 00:38:49.730
You could just substitute
numbers in for those things.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.650
I mean, like this,
it pops up as 1/2.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:39:00.210
I think this thing will
boil down to one equation.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:06.110
And you need to pick some set
of coordinates to describe it.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.530
So if I'm looking
for omega dot, I'd

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:11.630
probably work with
torque about that point.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.860
Isolated to just
this object, and this

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.560
is some of the torque
around this point,

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.320
and see what happens.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:29.460
Some of the external torques
gotta be equal to what?

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.420
DH dt, and then you have
to sort out this term.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.300
So in this problem,
you know-- what's

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.290
the direction of this velocity?

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.690
I. What is the unit
vector associated

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.930
with the linear
momentum of that pipe?

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.090
What direction is the
linear momentum of the pipe?

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.600
What's the velocity?

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.150
What is this answer?

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:02.760
What's the momentum
of that pipe?

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.980
Mass times that velocity, right?

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.160
Remember, the velocity
of the system, the pipe

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.850
may have all its
mass around the rim,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.370
but the velocity of the
momentum of the pipe

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:21.080
is the total mass of the
pipe times the velocity

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.144
of its center of mass.

00:40:22.144 --> 00:40:24.060
And that's the velocity
of the center of mass.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.284
So its linear momentum has what
unit vector assigned with it?

00:40:29.284 --> 00:40:33.930
I. And what is the unit
vector was associated with vA?

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.625
I. I cross I is?

00:40:35.625 --> 00:40:36.650
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.566
PROFESSOR: So this is
one of those cases where

00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:41.080
they're parallel paths,
and that term drops out.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.060
So you could come up with
it very quickly and easily.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.430
Equation of motion.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:47.100
OK.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.290
Very good.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.460
See you on Tuesday.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.111
Next Tuesday lecture
time will be review.

00:40:54.111 --> 00:40:56.360
I think it's gonna be more
like one of these sessions,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.940
and then quiz Tuesday night.
