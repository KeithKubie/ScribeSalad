00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.440
I’m sure when you think “biggest television
events” around, you think of the 1 billion

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.190
people who watched India vs Pakistan in the
2015 Cricket World Cup… right?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.190
No.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.230
No, I can’t say that I do.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.230
Oh.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.530
Uh, the Moon Landing at 530 million, worldwide?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.160
No, I think of the biggest television event
everrrr, the BIG GAME!!!!!!!!!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.039
A piddly 115 million!

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:29.979
Hey there sportsfaaaans, Trace and Emily here
for DNews to talk about sportsball and science.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.950
You probably know, today is Superb Owl. number
El-Eye.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.050
American Football’s greatest event.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
And with all those people in one place, you
bet your deflated Brady-Ball there’s a ton

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.550
of science going on.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.300
Stadiums are one of the few times a large
number of people gather to a controlled place,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.910
so while most of them are focused on the field,
we can use this rare mass gathering to do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.940
some cool studies.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.790
For example, on January 8, 2011, earthquake
monitoring equipment registered something

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.340
strange in the Seattle area -- a tiny earthquake.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.300
(Seriously, really tiny).

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.370
According to researchers at the Pacific Northwest
Seismic Network, eight Seattle Seahawks football

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.149
games register on their nearby seismometer
during their study -- it’s across the street

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.469
from the stadium.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.500
Their short write-up, published in Seismological
Research Letters details how they spotted

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.500
it.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.350
The equipment was so sensitive, a write up
on the PNSN’s website said, that they of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.859
course, could detect the rumbling of all the
fans, but they could also detect cars coming

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.310
and going, and use the data to tell if the
team was losing.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.260
After a few losses, the “less raucous”
crowd rumbled a lot less.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.630
Though, in 2013, the researchers registered
a 1-to-2 magnitude rumble emanating from the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.630
stadium.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.639
The team was on the rebound!

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.920
This wasn’t the first time sports caused
a little rumble.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.090
At Louisiana State, there was a 15-20 minute-long
seismometer trigger in 1988 -- it was widely

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.840
reported in the media, and has become known
as “the earthquake game.”

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.359
And these two stadiums have a couple things
in common, they hold a lot of people--

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.030
LSU had 79,431
And the Seahawks had 68,387

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.770
An average of about 74 thousand humans.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.770
Right!

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.310
So, back to the Superb Owl -- using marketing
stats on who watches the big game, we can

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.370
estimate the average weight of say -- 74,000
fans… (a little more than the Houston stadium

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.900
where El-Eye is going down).

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.532
… at least 13.5 million pounds of human
(6.1M kg).

00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:22.210
Jumping up and down.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.890
Maybe more!

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.600
Seismographs can actually detect incredibly
small movements in the Earth.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.920
These human “quakes,” while fun for the
media to report on, weren’t actual earthquakes,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.570
because they weren’t inside the Earth’s
crust -- they only imparted force onto the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.570
crust.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.950
The thing is, people aren’t just jumping,
they’re also shouting and breathing and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.950
talking.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.120
That’s a lot of people air moving in and
out.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.700
On average, we breathe a little over 2 cups
of air at a time (500mL), this is called the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.080
tidal volume.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.010
Meaning, in a stadium, with 74,000 people
they’re collectively sucking in 9,774 gallons

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.100
(37,000L) of air at any given moment!

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.570
That’s 105 pounds pounds of air (47.5kg)!

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.570
Just from breathing normally!

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.750
Technically, a bit less because, fun fact,
humid air weighs less than dry air.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.040
Actually, riffing on that.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040
Human breath is hot--

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.430
Yes, about 94 degrees

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.850
and completely saturated with water

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.290
Yes, it’s 100-percent humidity in there.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.100
So, the exhalation of 37,000 liters of hot,
humid air would contain about 1.5 liters of

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.100
water!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.100
GROSS.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.170
Human water.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.190
In fact, an informal study done at Louisiana
State University compared readings inside

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.080
and outside their stadium during a game and
found humidity spikes from all those breathing

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080
meatbags.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.950
But look, this is the Superb Owl.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.460
If they’re in that stadium, they’re probably
also shouting.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.180
The current Guinness Record-holder for loudest
stadium is the Kansas City Chiefs.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.240
In September 2014, they shouted at 142.2 decibels
-- louder than a jet flying over.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.510
And while a lot of people argue over who’s
louder...

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.720
It’s not actually a great measure of power.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.310
The further from the sound you get, the lower
the relative intensity.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.730
For example, a person on the opposite end
of the football field from someone hearing

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.210
a 142 decibel reading would only hear 113
decibels.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.000
One, is a jet taking off and the other is
just a regular old rock concert.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.290
In the end, masses of humanity can do something
to affect the world around us.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.609
If we stick together.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.430
Or just… breathe a lot.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.750
Yuck.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.540
No matter the American sport, we gotta have
a ref, ump, or someone who gets all uppity

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.370
and is usually wrong.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.520
Are all refs just bad?

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.520
Or what?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.520
Find out here.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.070
Who you rooting for in the Superb Owl?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.070
Barn?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.070
Screech?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.070
Northern white-faced?

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.070
Southern white-faced?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.070
Hedwig?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.070
Tell us in the comments.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.160
That “superb owl” thing just kills me.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.540
And thanks for watching DNews.
