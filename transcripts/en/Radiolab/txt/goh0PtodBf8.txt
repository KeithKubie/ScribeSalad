Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab and today we still desperately looking, seeking symmetry as you say, oh, not well yet. We have looked at love, failed, looked at brain veiled mirrors, failed chemistry of light, so we thought, well for the last stop on this trip, if we were to go anywhere to find or look for deep unity, a deep oneness and symmetry, maybe the beginning of everything moment zero, we found ourselves a physicist. I get, it's Neil degrasse Tyson. I began with a very, very basic question. If you look at me and I look at you and you seem to be made of stuff and I seem to be made of stuff and here we are on here are tables and chairs. Is it surprised you in some deep way that we are all here made of stuff? Yes. It's, it's not so much surprise understates it. It's shocking. Really Shocking, Huh? What is, what is shocking that there's any matter in the universe at all? Meaning that this conversation shouldn't be happening deeper mouth deeper than just whether or not we'd be having this conversation. It's whether or not any of this would exist. Earth, the galaxy and the like.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Whew.

Speaker 3:          01:17          Okay. So, um, if you go back 13.7 billion years ago, that's my shoulder Gliser again, the physicist and he says, if you rolled back the history of the universe, no more stars, no molecules, no atoms can play the movie backwards. Now, all the way to the beginning, just after you know,

Speaker 2:          01:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:39          Bang, you have what we call a primeval soup. This soup was actually, it was made of light, universal of white, very high energy. And out of this energy does heat these interactions, you suddenly get

Speaker 1:          01:58          that these are belches, Jad belts, belches of matter. The light is doing this. Yes, this is the one that equals MC squared is all about cause energy is just a form of matter and vice versa. I feel like I should know what you're talking about, but I don't. Okay, let's, let's start. Let's start a little simpler. There's light all around us. We're in a studio. It's visible light. So this light has no mass has energy. Even o m [inaudible] crank up the energy of the light. Go to ultra violet x-rays, and there's a point in x-rays where you have a high enough x-ray photon, it will spontaneously turn into a particle electrons. In fact. Oh, so you're saying if you crank up the e the energy of the light high enough, it'll suddenly just turn into mass. That's correct. So just picture the soup

Speaker 3:          02:52          really intensely hot, and it's belching out now to do electrons Zumi around [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:01          forks, neutrinos continuously churning, churning, churning. Over time, all that matter clumps together in more and more complex forms until you finally get us. Sounds. Maybe simple, doesn't it? Chat? Yes, but there's a but coming, I can smell it. But, and here's the big knew. Back in 1928 1929 there was this physicist, young guy called IRAC. He's doing some math and he's thinking about this whole business of turning light into matter. Okay? Now he's puzzled by something. But there is a law in physics called the law of conservation of charge, which simply means this, my unit rolls off your tongue quite nicely, doesn't it? It does. So here's what it means.

Speaker 3:          03:44          Whenever you create something, if it you beginning, you have zero electric charge at the end you have to have zero electric charge to that is you cannot create electric charge. You have to keep the balance,

Speaker 1:          03:57          make something in the universe that has a positive charge or a neck like make an electron. Okay, just make one right now. Yeah, gone. That electron has a, you remember, remember this from eighth grade, a negative negative one bay make, make two electrons. Now make three electrons negative three. Now if the universe is to stay in balance, you need to have something that has a positive charge. You've got three minuses on one side and you have nothing else. Second, if this is true, how would you even make an electron? The sheer fact of creating an electron puts it out of balance. Well here, here's the middle story here. Well, no, Paul, Dereck, that well, how about this? What if every time you created an electron, you created an entire electron? What every particle could have an equal but opposite in tight particle.

Speaker 3:          04:50          That is a particle that looks very much the same, but essentially it's electric charge is reversed.

Speaker 1:          04:56          It would look the same. Like really look, yes. You'd have to measure their properties to know that they were different. Is it a mirror image or am I think of it as a mirror image. There's a thing called quantum spin and it would just be spinning the opposite way, but charge as the most obvious difference. For example, the anti-matter cousin of the electron because the electron is a negative charge. This little guy should have a positive charge. Exactly. But in every other way it'd be the same. Right. And no one ever seen one. He just thought that there probably would be one. Yes. And why did he think this? Math, math, math.

Speaker 3:          05:29          It was a solution to the his equations. And that's the beauty of theoretical physics. I solve equations. You can sometimes find out about the world. And then yes, a few years later

Speaker 1:          05:39          bought a bing, they found the positron, the anti-matter version of the electron. Oh yeah. No, it's deep. It's deep. How did they do that? Like [inaudible] see it?

Speaker 3:          05:48          Well particles. Um, you know, they're very tiny, right? You can't really see them. So all you do is uh, you, you create little systems in the, you get like a vapor and you put the vapor in a tank, he says, and when the electron or the Ante Electron shoots through the vapor, the particle destabilizes the vapor and makes little bubbles. Okay. You can see these little bubbles appearing out of [inaudible] series. Really an amazing thing. So you can't see the particle itself, but you can see its shadow. It's road trip. It's road trip. Yeah. So then he says, okay, imagine you get this little piece of light and heat it up really hot so that it spawns all as we've learned, not one particle but two matter anti-matter pair, but them in the a vapor tank and you put a magnet in there, you can tell if it's going to the left or to the right if it's a positive or negative charge. [inaudible] cooler. It is cool. You see two particle tracks that each curl opposite directions and if they have the same rate of curl, yeah, that means they have the same mass

Speaker 2:          06:54          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          06:55          So if we go back to our picture of the early universe of the soup, which, and you named all of those particles, does that mean that for every particle that you named there is, it's opposite floating around there as well. Exactly. Do you have electrons? Anti electrons. You try and answer a neutron Proton Anti-proton this is all very beautiful. And you'd say, great, I have a very democratic universe, you know, has many particles and antiparticles and everybody's happy. All your problem is the following. When an electron and a positron meet, they will find each other and uh oh

Speaker 2:          07:25          quite a bit.

Speaker 3:          07:27          And they will annihilate you winning. They'll find it because they'll find their original other hand. No, no. They wouldn't need to know. Just find another kind like that's correct. That's correct. So Chad, now imagine that we're in the very early universe. I am a teeny bit of matter. And you may be opposite. I'm an anti cro, which anti-coal anticoag. And so the program, which is sitting here and I see you across the, he's now I'm positive. Charge your name. We charge charges together. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:58          you see, it doesn't work out too well for us. But you know, hey, wait, wait. This is actually a rather profound puzzle because if Paul Dirac was right and half the universe is matter, the other half of the university's Andy mattered and we all bumped into each other, the less we just did. Well eventually I guess we would just not, we would just become, I don't what, Oh, I don't know. Hmm. We would not be here. Damn. Just blink out. And there'd be nothing. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          08:29          Really nothing. Nothing on there.

Speaker 3:          08:32          So it's a field of view, mostly not mostly just

Speaker 4:          08:37          radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation.

Speaker 3:          08:54          Shocking.

Speaker 4:          09:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:10          well, there's something wrong with this theory because we're talking to each other. So something, something's wrong with this notion. Yes. And what's wrong is an imperfection in the laws of physics that we know of now, and that, uh, is responsible for this bias. Which means what day was that? There was a little more of of matter, but we call matter than than anti matter or, yes. There was to be precise to every billion particles of anti-matter. We had 1,000,000,001 ah, articles of matter. Oh my God. Really? Yes. Oh, that's tiny. Excess of one in a billion is enough to create everything that exists. Now, the little guy, we would call that an asymmetry

Speaker 5:          10:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:05          so everything we see in the universe, all the stars, all the suns and the moons and the graft and the mountains and us all though we're the left. We're the extra stuff. Yes, we are the result of this asymmetry. Has Anybody dealt with the real question that's provoked here? It's like, why was there more of one stuff kind of stuff. Then the other kind of stuff, so there you go. That is one beautiful question, but we don't have any on any final answer yet. You don't know because you see, you don't know. We do not know. That's right. Which is okay. Not knowing is a wonderful thing in science. Otherwise it could just retire.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Can I tell you my favorite lawyer joke told to me by a lawyer? Yeah. I have to like spread this because it's the best one. 98% of lawyers give the other 2% of bad name. Well, that's the go music. The go music meaning go away. Anything else? Or here's a different place to go to our website, radiolab.org where you can read more about anything you heard in this era. You can see those amazing Lincoln picks and other things we've got there on symmetry. And of course you can subscribe to our podcasts, which we usually get to hear the show.
