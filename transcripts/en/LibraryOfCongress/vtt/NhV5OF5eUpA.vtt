by our special guests, Roy.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.210

I feel that we are a part

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.710

accessible and relevant source

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.690

the Embassy of Israel

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.530
and the Library of Congress.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.630
And, now for the star
of the afternoon,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.710
it is my absolute pleasure to
introduce to you Roy Horowitz,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.610
an Israel leading actor,
director, dramaturge

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.190
and lecturer for theater and
universities around the world.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.440
Aside of being a good friend,
he is also extremely talented

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.020
as you are about to
see in a few minutes.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.460
Roy also teaches
in acting schools

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.280
and won distinguished awards
and honor scholarships

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.770
for his theatrical work.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.250
In the past, he was a manager
of theater in Israel as well.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.030
Some more fun trivia about Roy.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.280
He is a vegetarian,
he likes dogs

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.190
and sometimes he can be a bit
childish which we love the most.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.730
And, most importantly, he's
very, very happy to be here

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.490
with you today, so
please welcome the awesome

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.290
Roy Horowitz.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.090
&gt;&gt; Oren Ben-Yosef: Aaron,
can you please join me.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.270
Yeah, there's a lot of good
stuff from Israeli theaters.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.860
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: I understand

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.600
that you only get 12,000
materials everyday so,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.100
I'd like to add some more.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.510
Thank you so much.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.810

These are programs

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.510
from the latest shows,
productions of --

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:32.180
[ Inaudible ]

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.140
&gt;&gt; Aaron Taub: Roy
the stage is yours.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.800
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz:
Thank you so much.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.690
&gt;&gt; Aaron Taub: Thank
you very much.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.240
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Not only
that I'm happy, I'm really,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.490
I'm thrilled, I'm excited, I'm
overwhelmed actually, just,

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.160
you know, crossing from
this enormous building

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.310
and collections is really
something which is breathtaking,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.690
so I'm honored to be here

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.620
and thank you everybody
for having me.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.820
What I'm about to do, actually
it's, it's a mission impossible,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.050
I would like to try and
portray or to say what's there

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.790
to be said about the
theatrical scene in Israel

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.490
which is really very
intense, very alive

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.610
and kicking and very diverse.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.390
And, I would like to shed
some light about what's going

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.980
on in the field of theater in
Israel, because I truly believe

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.350
that it has a lot to offer
to communities outside Israel

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.210
and I'm very happy to actually
to take part in the effort

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.960
of trying to portray
a bit or not a bit,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.920
a substantially different
profile of Israel

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.560
from what it's usually pictured,
you know, in global media.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.050
I think at least in
the field of theater,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.060
we really are very
original and special

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.790
and as I've said,
have a lot to offer.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.000
What I'd like to do, because
we only have some 40 minutes

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.080
and then we'll open it
for a Q&amp;A, is that I would

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.070
like to combine, you know,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.320
all the different sides
of my schizophrenia.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.860
I would like to be a bit of
an academic at the beginning

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.280
and give you some data
and some information

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.000
about the theatrical theme.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.290
And, then being mostly an actor,
I brought with me some texts

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.660
and I would like to just read
to you and show some clips

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.690
which I think will do a better
service to the point I'd

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.320
like to expose you to some of
the most important playwrights,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.190
Israeli playwrights nowadays

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.180
and to let the work
speak for itself.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.120
Maybe I'll start with just
some general data as I've said,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.730
Israeli, is really
a theatrical empire.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.960
In Tele Aviv alone,
we have every evening,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.570
some 50 different shows
and the venues are packed.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.540
Israelis flock to the venues
and I think it's the 10th

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.990
or 11th year in a row that
Israel has the highest rate

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.020
of theater goers in
the world per capita.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.150
Please bear in mind that
what keeps the industry going

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.570
in places like, yours, Broadway,
New York or the Western London,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.430
not the local people but
mostly the tourists, you know,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.740
that allow mousetrap
[inaudible] to run forever.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.680
In Israel, these are the
Israelis who come and flock

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.350
as I said, to the venues
and we have a very intense,

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.760
some may say, maybe a bit of
inflation, very intense scene

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.350
and it is very diverse
as I've said.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.070
We have shows not only in
Hebrew, but also in Arabic,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.570
Yiddish, in Amharic,
in Russian, in English

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.810
and I think it's just a
matter of time until we have,

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.610
we'll find that we'll
also add shows in French

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.050
with all the French newcomers
to Israel in recent years.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.990
Israel is very unique,
we have some kind

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:11.300
of abnormalities I think or some
very specific characteristics

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.090
which I think I'd
like to point out.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.970
First of all, I don't,
to best of my knowledge,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.680
I think Israel is the only
country in the world to have,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.070
for example, it's national
theater established long ago

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.370
before the establishment of
the actual state, you know,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.540
our national theater,
Habima which I come from,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.290
was established in 1917
in Moscow, in Russia,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.550
whereas the state of
Israel came to life

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.070
in 1948, some 31 years later.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.240
Israel is the only country
in the world to have,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.880
to have its national theater not
functioning in the capital city

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.320
of Jerusalem, but in Tel Aviv.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:56.490
Jerusalem is not yet ready
for the revolution of theater.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.550
And, Israel is, as I've said,
is really in love with theater

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.180
and I think this might
be explained by the fact

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:08.390
that theater is relatively a
new phenomena to Jewish culture,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.290
Jewish culture and Jewish
life, whereas the rest

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.530
of the Western world have
been experiencing theater ever

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:20.040
since Ancient Greece, you
know, some 2,500 years ago.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.770
Jews started dealing or enjoying

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.140
or practicing theater
less than 200 years ago.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.940
We are very new to the business
and I think that in comparison

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.370
to ordinations, the fact
that we are very new to it,

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.360
maybe explains why we are still
very much in love with it.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.110
Whereas, the rest of the
world, you know, came to terms

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.100
with theater, it's one way
among other forms of, you know,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.660
of a day or a night outside.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.930
Israel is very much
celebrating the fact

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.940
that we are finally allowed to
enjoy an evening in the theater,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.980
because for many, many,
generations, the orthodox,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.170
Jewish authorities rejected
the sheer concept of theater.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.100
Theater was something which
was identified with then,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.270
with the gentiles something
which is not done, you know.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.090
Jews had been thanking the
Lord for many generations

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:21.580
for making them [inaudible]
yeshivas and synagogues and not

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.800
of this [inaudible] of mockers
as they call the theater.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.850
They're not going to theaters
or to circuses, God forbid.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:37.410
So, and some 150
or 200 years ago,

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.800
as part of what we call
the national renaissance,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.530
[inaudible] the national
secular revolution

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:51.890
which took part some 150 years
ago, theater actually managed

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.030
to put its foot in the door

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.280
and we started practicing
theater as well.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.580
At the beginning, just
for your knowledge,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.500
it was allowed only one
day in the Jewish calendar,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.560
we already have one,
how do you say,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.200
one day which is freaky and, you
know, pulling and they allowed,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.700
if you want to do your shows,
use this day of the year

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.810
where we, we get drunk
and we change costumes

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.630
and do your shows
during that day,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.530
but you know the slippery slope?

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.460
Once it was allowed, it
was inevitable and it ended

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.370
up with what I described
at the beginning,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.010
that today you can have
theater performances in Tel Aviv

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.120
at 10:00 in the morning, at
noon, at 2:00, at 4 p.m.,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.750
at 6 and at, in the evening,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:47.940
its' really incredible,
what is going on.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.810
And, the thing diverse
from the national theater

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:58.880
to municipal theater, to
independent groups to children

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.490
in youth companies,
to independent artists

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.170
to dance theater, you
have the whole range.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:16.730
One thing, one fact which I
find interesting is that 77,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.900
I checked the numbers, 77% of
the repertoire which we present

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.490
in Israeli theater is based on
original, original new writing

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.090
where the most of the what
is being produced is Israeli

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.430
dramaturgy[DJ1], Israeli plays.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.860
Besides, you know, we do
of course, the classics

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.380
and the last musicals, you know,

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.300
the most updated
musicals from Broadway.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.000
Everything, there is
a place to, everything

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
but 77% original writing.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.660
You know, let's just
jump into the water.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.550
I would like to give you some
examples before my time passes.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.330
Now, it's tough choices.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.230
You know, what I
start with him, yeah,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.690
I'll start with Honoch
Levin is the most,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.010
Honoch Levin is the most,

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.270
considered to be
the most important,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.160
influential Israeli playwright
ever, he died at the age

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.420
of 56 unfortunately at the,
this year we are going to,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.130
it's going to be 20 years
that passed he away.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.830
He died in 1999.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.660
But he left us with an
enormous amount of plays, some,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:36.170
over 70 plays he managed to
write, not to mention hundreds

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.320
of poems, of children's books,
sketches, lots of materials,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:47.240
all his writings is something
which holds some 17 volumes

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.370
in the library and I would
like, and he is considered

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.280
and I think rightly
so, one of the most,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.140
even influential playwrights

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.420
of the 20th Century,
not just in Israel.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.490
For example, in France
nowadays there are no less

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.740
than 6 productions of
his plays running now.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.620
The world actually
begins to know

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.990
that there has been a very
good work done in Israel

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.200
in translating his
plays in many languages

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.920
and there are productions
all over the world actually

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.330
and I brought some examples just

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.070
to show you what it's,
what it's all about.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.530
I would like to start
from a play

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.000
which long ago became some
kind of Israeli classics

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.840
by Hoch Levin, named Krum.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.630
And, I would like to read
to you the opening scene.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:47.390
We have, it's a very
typical Honoch Levin scene.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.030
We have, we meet, we've
have a Jewish mother

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.810
and all Jewish mothers tending
in an airport in a terminal,

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.110
waiting for her son to
come back from abroad

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:02.280
and she is very excited and she
waits for him and in he comes

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.030
and that's the dialogue,
very, prepare yourself

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.920
to a very Jewish humor I think.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.420
So, the mother says, oh,
the plane just landed.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.580
In another minute,
I'll see my son.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.030
Oh, here he comes.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.990
The son steps in
and said, and says,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.780
I didn't' make it abroad mother.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.310
I didn't make money
and I didn't get happy.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.070
I didn't have fun, didn't get
ahead, I didn't get married,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.460
didn't get engaged and
I didn't meet anyone.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.600
I didn't buy anything,
didn't bring anything.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.450
All I have in my suitcase is
dirty underwear and toiletries,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.930
that's it, I've told
you everything

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.350
and I want you to
leave me alone.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.470
[ Laughter ]

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.580
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Oh, I'm sure
he's planning a surprise for me.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.300
No! No, mother.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.730
Definitely a little
surprise for mom.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.040
No! No! What are
you yelling for?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.700
Someone wants something
from you?

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.440
You came back to fight?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.150
They are aggravating me already.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.880
You are lucky I don't
like to yell in airports.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.390
Let's go. They leave and a
day after, I skip a little,

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.680
the day after, they
sit in their apartment

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.770
and they have lunch together
and he says to her, mother,

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.490
I can't stand people looking
at me while I'm eating

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.420
and pinning all their
hopes on me.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.630
Whose hoping?

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.590
Who even wants anything
from you?

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.630
Looking at me and pinning your
hopes on me day and night.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.560
What does he want from my life?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.860
I'm looking at a fly.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.240
In my own house, I'm not
allowed to look at a fly?

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.170
The fly is going out
to eat in a restaurant.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.420
Go! Go, into the restaurant, the
meal you start eating as a son,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.360
you'll finish as an orphan.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.380
He walks out and the
neighbor walks in,

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.430
the neighbor is the devil of
this play, her name is Felicia

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:59.850
and she comes in and she
says, hi, hello Mrs. Krum,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.460
I just saw your son going
out looking very angry.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.980
No, excited, he's excited
because he came back

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.180
from abroad yesterday.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.260
Okay, if you say so.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.450
He didn't bring you anything?

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.720
I have everything.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.800
A little TV set.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.730
I have one, yes, made in Israel.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.220
You can see very well on it.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.670
A leather coat, a
wallet, a handkerchief.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.980
Oh, well. Mrs. Felicia, my son
came back from abroad strong

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.110
and healthy, that's what counts.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.830
He is healthy, he works
and supports himself.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.530
What else can I ask for?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.630
He even managed to save some of
his salary for a trip to Europe.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.680
We are not arguing about
Europe now Mrs. Krum.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.750
It's true that he
went, even though,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.250
everybody's going these days.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.550
What's the big deal?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.130
A plane takes you, a plane takes
you back, but he went, he went,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.070
the question is, is a person
traveling to achieve something.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.440
Is he even progressing
towards something?

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.050
Is he building something?

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.070
And especially, is he moving
towards some happy event?

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.920
Look, I'm absolutely not
disappointed in my son.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.220
He is talented.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.900
Of course, no need to jump
into disappointment right away.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.780
You can always keep on waiting
and hoping, but the question is,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.760
for how long, a person
doesn't stay 40 forever.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.350
My son's 38!

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.270
If you say so.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.100
And for God, there is still
the strength to wait, to hope.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.210
Of course, there is
strength Mrs. Krum,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.400
the question is whether
there is a point.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.950
As long as he's healthy
and feels good.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.540
Healthy and feels good, Mrs.
Krum, everybody's healthy,

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.290
the question is, what a
person does with his health.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.770
Does he know how
to take advantage

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.080
of the time he's healthy?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.610
Does he have something in hand
to justify his healthiness

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.090
and second of all, who
can say I'm healthy?

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.310
I'm mean sickness is
always laughing at us.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.380
Pardon, I have no complaints.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.680
To each his own.

One person becomes a doctor and
another becomes a decorator.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:10.590
The main thing is that you
are happy, and she leaves.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.850

alone and summarizes.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.110

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.800
please could you excuse?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.510
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.130
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.660
But excuse me, Mr.
Magician, excuse me for.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.900
What's this about?!

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.310
It's just about my wife.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.900
Pardon? My wife.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.810
Ten minutes ago, you were so
kind as to saw my wife in two.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.640
Yes? Are you waiting
for something sir?

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.190
No, but my wife.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.280
Yes? You sawed her in two.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.740
Yes, you said so.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.300
Well, and she's still sawn.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.150
Yes, and what's this about?

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.890
Well, I wanted to ask, I
don't presume to know anything

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.270
about magic, but when are you
sticking her back together?

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.910
Pardon? I mean, when are
you sticking the two parts

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.210
of my wife back together?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.830
I'm not sticking anything sir.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.670
This isn't a weld shop.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.970
Sorry, sorry.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.280
You're welcome.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:24.410
But. Yes? My wife, she's in two
pieces and you need to stick,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.620
sorry, to put her back together
like she was before, sir,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.000
you remember don't you?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.940
She volunteered 10 minutes
ago for you to saw her,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.440
you sawed her and
now we are waiting

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.410
for you to show us the trick.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.030
Trick?! There are no
tricks with me sir.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.550
I'm a magician.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.220
All right, and my wife.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.520
What about her?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:46.610
She's sawn, she can't leave like
this when she's sawn in two.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.460
So, why don't you take
her to the emergency room?

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.880
Based on your description I
understand that she is in need

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.490
of some medical attention.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.950
What, what, what, what,
but the trick, the trick!

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.780
You are starting
with the trick again.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.490
I tried politely and guess
what a pain in the ass.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.190
You stick my wife back
together right now!

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.790
Firstly, don't shout at me,
because if you're annoying me,

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.340
I can turn you into a rabbit
and secondly, with regards

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.350
to your wife, if she
really is sawn in two,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.580
then she's probably dead,
there's no surprises here.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.620
Dead?! She's sawn
in two isn't she?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.040
But you are a magician!

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.710
What's that got to
do with anything?

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.600
I can also saw my wife in two.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.900
No need to.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.770
I've already done it.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.400
This is the black
humor of Honoch Levin.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.090
Lots of his plays and
sketches have been translated

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.830
into English and you can
easily find them out.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.710
I would like to go
to another example.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.480
Actually, you know, if I have
to point out, I think I did it,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.030
yesterday I gave another lecture
somewhere else and I was asked

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:07.700
about the most characteristic
thing which I can define

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:15.540
to Israeli dramaturgy and I said
it, I think it's the ability

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.890
or skill to inject humor even

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.370
into the most heavy
subject matters.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:29.580
I think we have this incredible
ability of, maybe it's some kind

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.540
of survival mechanism, I don't
know psychologically what,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.160
to deal with even the
heaviest stuff with some humor.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.760
And, I think this is a very
good example [inaudible] is the

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.120
representative of I think
the younger generation,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.160
the next one to Honoch Levin.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.810
And, I would like to read to
you a scene from her first play,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.030
she wrote several plays to
this day which is called,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.140
"The Guide to the Good Life".

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.430
And, I think this example
will serve me for two things,

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:06.970
one is to show you that
it's a combination of humor

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.770
and serious matters and
the other one is you know,

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:17.080
Israeli theater has two
central preoccupations,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.730
one is the Holocaust which
we might come back later on

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.920
and the other one is of course
the current events, you know,

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.530
in the political situation and
the neighborhood we live in.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.030
And, what she does here is
that I think she manages

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.860
to show us what is
living in Israel nowadays,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.620
especially for young people.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:45.200
The scene I'm about to read
is the character is a woman

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.820
in her 30s, she's a single lady

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.270
in her 30s longing
to get married.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.900
Her name is [inaudible]
and it starts

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.420
with her calling this company,
I'm sure you have it here too,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:03.250
these coupons or Groupons,
this special offer companies.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.570
She calls them, she saw
an ad and she calls them

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.570
and it goes like this.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.040
&gt;&gt; What's the name of the play?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.840
&gt;&gt; The Guide to the Good
Life by [inaudible].

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.730
It was a major hit in Israel.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.190
Hello? Beauty Bargain?

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.410
Hi, yes I'd like
some information.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.710
The slimming soap

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.320
that liquidizes body
fat, is it painful?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.710
Okay. And, the body fat
that melts away, what,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.750
does it just wash
off in the bathroom?

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.200
Great! I'd like to order
one of those please, yeah.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.460
Oh, one more thing, the
electronic breast muscle shaper,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.620
it doesn't actually
electrify your boobs does it?

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.210
How do you attach
it to your breasts?

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.000
Oh, vacuum?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.330
Lifting and refirming and
does it enlarge them as well?

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.820
Oh, that's what the
natural capsules are for?

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.310
Oh, yes, could you put
them on the list please?

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.140
And, they don't give
you cancer do they?

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.080
Tested on what, ferrets,
otters, what's a ferret?

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.630
A rodent. Oh, ferrets,
they're called ferrets.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.010
Yeah, they're very smelly.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.530
What do I get with it?

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.400
An, electrical vibrating bell

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.270
for shaping the abdominal
muscles?

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.280
For how much extra?

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.830
Oh, undetectable under
any item of clothing?

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.130
Yes, that's fab.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.360
One less thing, those wonder
drops, Viva Young and Viva Lady,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.700
how can using them
create perfect harmony

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.000
with your partner

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.030
and significantly improve
your quality of life?

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.090
Oh, the libido, whoa.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.890
And, a youthful energy?

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.620
Yeah, that's lovely youthful.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.090
Yeah. Yeah, that's
really amazing.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.280
Yes, I'd like the ladies and
the men's too, just in case.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.520
Hold on a second, don't
add this all up yet.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.720
The lifting cream for the
forehead, how high does it lift?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.520
Oh, what a brilliant idea.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.280
All right, all right,
put it on my list.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.790
Yeah, yeah, and total it all up.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.960
I see, I see, can I
pay in installments?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.080
Okay, I'll pay in
18 installments.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.860
Yeah, that way I'll
hardly notice it.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.690
Gosh, what a wonderful deal.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.960
A beauty bargain
indeed, thank you.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.870
A few days later, it's
the middle of the night,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.560
she knocks hysterically

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.940
on a friend's front door
and says to her, hi!

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.820
Thank you, I don't know what
I would've done without you.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.120
I had no one to call.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.270
My mom would kill me if
she knew I got arrested.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.120
You are an angel.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.420
All right, all right,
[inaudible]

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.870
and tell me slowly
what happened.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.630
How come you were
at the policemen

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.510
and why the hell
were you detained

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.040
as a dangerous terrorist.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.120
Because they thought I
was a suicide bomber.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.120
What?! I bought this electric
vibrating belt for slimming

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.420
and shaping the abdomen.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.560
You can wear it under any
piece of clothing and it's,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.290
it's completely undetectable.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.520
I have it on at home,
at work, wherever.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.720
I had a date in the grill bar,
the guy was inside already.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.920
I was about to go in when this
security man shouted at me,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.760
hold it ma'am, stop right there.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.410
What's that under your shirt?

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.080
And, I said, nothing, you know,

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.550
because it's none
of his business.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.210
You know, it's really
none of his business

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.400
and then I keep walking and so
then he jumps me, he pushes me

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.730
to the floor and starts yelling,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.760
a suicide bomber,
a suicide bomber!

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.230
He tried to rip my shirt off.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.650
Pervert! So, I bit him and
then, then he handcuffed me

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.510
and started shouting
at me in Arabic.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.190
[ Foreign Language ]

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.110
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: And, then the
police came and shoved me away

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.260
in case there were
anymore bombs around.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.990
Can I stay at your
house tonight?

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:50.530
Please? Living in
Israel nowadays.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.170
You can't even wear this belt.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.030
Maybe we'll go the next,
you know what, maybe a clip,

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.410
not just my own presentations.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:06.700
This is a clip of, a short clip
of a very witty comedy written

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.000
by another playwright,
named [inaudible].

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.950
Actually, I understood that
just recently a week ago,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.080
there was a production of, "Oh
God" by her which just closed

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.630
in the Mosaic theater here.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.150
She is considered to be one

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.690
of the really very
talented, we lost her too.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.230
I don't know what it is
with Israeli playwrights,

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.110
she too died of cancer
at the age of 59.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.190
But she left us with
some very rich comedies

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.940
and I was very happy to hear
that the Oh God did well here.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.010
This is a comedy which is
called, House Husband I think.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.310
[ Foreign Language ]

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.870
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: In
Hebrew, house husband,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:50.120
how would you translate
it, I think, stay at home.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:55.320
It's about an ex, about a
pilot in the Israeli Airforce

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.580
who just retired, you know, they
retire pretty early in their 40s

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.930
and is coming back to his
family which the family members,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.740
his wife and his daughters are
not used to having that at home.

And, having him at home now

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:16.990

not easy or not simple for them.

comedy once again another huge

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.630
success at the Comedy Theater in
Tel Aviv and a have a short clip

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.200
of it with English
subtitles luckily enough,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.060
so you can see it.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.870
Are we good the lights
and everything,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.020
it's, maybe we should.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.880
Here, it speaks for itself.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.390
But what's with the sound?

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.190
Oh.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:38:39.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.850
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz:
Okay, that's it.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.150
Yeah, I think her plays
[inaudible] comedies can

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.720
translate very easily and I
could tell from your reaction.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.680
She has another one, by the
way, called, "Family Business",

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.890
about once again we come
back to the Jewish mother,

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:58.130
the Jewish mother who refuses to
accept her daughter's plan not

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.370
to attend the, the [inaudible],
the past of her eve meal

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:07.550
and she attends to go abroad
with some of her friends

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.220
and her mother refuses.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:13.880
There's no such thing as not
attending the annual setter

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.410
and says, over my dead body.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.000
And, literally she
keeps her word in order

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.240
to prevent her from growing.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.350
So, this is a [inaudible].

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.620
I think mentioned before that
we are very new to the business

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.990
and you know, something which
is I find interesting is

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.170
that you know, unlike
the enormous contribution

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:43.040
of Jewish artists to the fields
of music or of literature

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.430
where you cannot imagine, you
know, the history of literature

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.880
without a Jewish
contribution to it.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.110
In the field of drama, all the
great masters are not Jewish.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.790
I think if I'm to think
of a Jewish great master,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.510
I think that maybe the
first name that pops

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.320
into mind is maybe
[inaudible] but then we speak

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.100
about the mid of
the 20th Century.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.210
Jews haven't been practicing
theater and we are very new

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.070
and we do our first steps
and I think it calls for lots

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:16.730
of originality I
think in doing it.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:21.210
As I said, before, there are
two central preoccupations

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.450
for Israeli theater.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:27.060
One is as I've said, political
issues as we have lots

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.090
of political writing going on.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.770
Some of them, of these plays,

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:37.060
I understood yesterday even came
here, arrived to Washington,

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.340
made all kinds of
debates here too

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.680
when they were performed
here, but there is a lot

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.770
of political writing going on.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.740
And, the other one as
I said, the Holocaust.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.540
I think the Holocaust maybe,
it's a bazaar term to use,

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.610
but I think it's the
most popular topic

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:01.350
or historical event
over 100 Israeli plays

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.320
which can be characterized
as Holocaust plays.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.570
I think that maybe the most
well-known, famous one is,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.860
"Ghetto", Joshua Sobol which
won many prizes and got some,

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.600
over 70 productions
all over the world.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.190
But there are many, many, many
productions which deal with,

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.270
you know, first generation,

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.240
second generation,
third generation.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.510
Also, lots of them has these,
as I've said, this ability

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.070
to try pretty much
like you remember,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.340
maybe the controversial female
film from a couple of years ago,

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.280
"Life is Beautiful", by Roberta
Benigni which allowed itself

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.790
to combine some kind of
comedy with the tragedy,

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.380
that tragedy of the Holocaust.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.870
We have lots of plays which
go the same direction.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:54.410
I see that we are running
out of time and I was asked

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:57.310
to allow you for some Q&amp;A.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.750
And, actually theater for me is,
is always about the dialogue,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.580
so let's open it and
please don't leave me alone.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.880
Yeah, please.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.660
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the Jewish
theater is relatively new,

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.900
but there's a tradition
of Yiddish theater?

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.200
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: That's right.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.350
&gt;&gt; You say that the modern
Jewish theater is totally

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.110
unrelated to the tradition.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.020
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: No,
I'm not saying that,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.830
I'm saying that the Jewish
theater, with all due respect

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.860
to the Yiddish theater, it's a
matter of just 150 years ago.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.110
All these [inaudible]
they are all very new

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.750
relatively speaking.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.210
We are speaking about theater
which started, you know,

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.270
Goldfaden established
his, which is considered

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:44.750
to be the godfather of Jewish
theater, he started his company

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.800
in 1876, so we are very.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.100
This is [inaudible].

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.450
This is considered, so we are
only speaking about the history

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:59.200
of Jewish theater in
Yiddish ever since then.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.330
The great miracle of Habima one
of the historical achievements

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:07.470
of Habima for instance, when
it was established in 1917,

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:12.440
it was the first Jewish
theater to do theater for,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.420
by Jewish people, for
Jewish people in Hebrew.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.880
You know, the holy language.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.980
Up to this point it was
only done in Yiddish.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.480
But the whole history is
something of 150-200 years ago.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.780
That's the whole legacy

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.310
of Jewish theater
you know in Yiddish.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.700
I know that at a certain
point, you know, in 2nd Avenue

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.640
in New York, there
was some over,

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.150
I think 100 Yiddish theaters,
you know, and there was

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.860
such a prosperity
between the two World Wars

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:42.180
of Jewish theater in the states.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:47.290
But it's, all in all, it's
a very new phenomenon.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.710
Yes, please.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:57.820
&gt;&gt; On, the same thing of,
Yiddish tradition, Yiddish humor

00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.120
and theater, I think

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.640
that actually explains
the Israeli love

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.450
for theater currently
because it's irreverent.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:11.870
It's Israeli's love up close
and personal interaction

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:16.390
and irreverent and it's
all comes together.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.690
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz:
I totally agree.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.990

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.290
Yes, please.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.890

with you about.

Agree or disagree?

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.490

contributions

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:38.400
to theater pushed American
Jews invented the musical.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.380

musical, yes, yes, but.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.680
&gt;&gt; This is theater too.

I was talking is the field

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.920
of drama maybe.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.370
You know, if you talk about
the graced masters of drama,

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.170
you refer to Shakespeare.

Ancient Greece,

of programs, the program of the
comedy and I saw to my horror,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:17.690
exactly one Israeli,
one new Israeli play.

all kinds of musicals too

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:30.560
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Cautious,
thank you, that I'm not sure

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.440
that every play that
wasn't produced it's only

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.210
because of its political
content.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:38.980
I think there are some of
the considerations, you know,

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.110
and calculations that
theater directors

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.710
and managers do are
sometimes has to do something

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.890
with artistic merits you know.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:52.670
And, I'm not that sure that all
of the plays that were denied

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.750
in Israel are really
masterpieces.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:04.070
&gt;&gt; An example, as a
general observation.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.770
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: You are
right, you are right in the,

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:11.820
you mentioned the name of our
current minister of culture

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:16.440
and once again without going
into, you know, not stepping

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:25.710
into any mine here, you arrived
that there is maybe some decline

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:31.160
in the last year or two, people
are more cautious because,

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.860
you know, you know, unlike the
system here, most of the theater

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.720
which deals with private
money, most of the theater

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.250
in Israel is subsidized
either by the government

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:47.690
or by the municipalities, so
it's, and it calls for some,

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:51.530
you know, it's complicated.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.850
And, I think you are right

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:59.250
with some observations regarding
this [inaudible] period

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:02.840
which might, she came
into clashes with artists

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.730
and maybe some of
them got frightened,

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:11.570
but the situation is far from
there is not real censorship.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:17.150
And, I'm not familiar with any,
you know, good writing, good,

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:23.740
well-deserved, you know,
well-made play which was denied

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.320
or someone would
turn down because

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.190
of a fear of political content.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:32.730
I'm not aware of such cases.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.030
Yes.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:40.820
&gt;&gt; Since LC Globe is one of
the cosponsors of this event,

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.910
can you talk about
specifically gay themed plays

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.430
that have been produced.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:45.730
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Yeah,
there is a first of all

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:49.040
at any given time I think you
can find at least 1 or 2 plays

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.800
which has some relevance
to LBGTQ issues.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:59.450
There is a small French theater
which works at a gay center

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:05.920
in Tel Aviv and specializes
in gay themed plays.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.430
Right now, they are putting,
I think for the fourth time,

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:13.070
Angels in American, a
new production which is

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.790
about to open once again.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.710
There is a thing, you know,
in Tel Aviv, it's some kind

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.020
of a gay capital as we all know.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.640
We are about to host a
Eurovision as you may know,

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.670
the Eurovision Song
Contest this coming May.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:33.750
In Tel Aviv is really some
kind of a gay, gay paradise.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:38.130
Certainly, you know,
in comparison

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.740
with rest of our neighbors.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.160
So, there is, there is
constant activity, you know,

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.170
in this, in this world.

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:52.730
And, even in the repertoire,
in the established theaters,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:59.260
you know, they do from time to
time, I myself directed a play

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:04.550
which is called, "Volunteer
Man", by an American playwright,

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.440
very talented American
playwright.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.180
He got an ABBY award for this
play and named Dan Clancy,

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.190
I directed four of his play by
now in Israel and it was done

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.210
in our repertoire of theater
and it tells the story

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:22.840
of a volunteer man, a
gay man who is coming

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.630
to assist a dying patient in
a hospital and actually deals

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.170
with the questions of amnesia
and ending of your life

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.960
and it's an encounter between a,
very you know, drugged addict,

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:41.250
very homophobic man and this
feminine, very sensitive teacher

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:45.430
of gay theater come
to assist him.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.770
So, there is, and
as I've said before,

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:54.980
anytime you can find
open productions

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:58.790
which has disappeared anytime.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:02.120
&gt;&gt; What's the name of
the theater, the gay.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.180
&gt;&gt; They are called,
I don't know how

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.240
to translate it into English.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.510

Tahel stands for --

[ Inaudible ]

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.420
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: It's
a homo-lesbian theater,

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.570
but in Hebrew is shrines a bit.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:18.870
Yes?

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:23.860
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you about, in
Israel, are there other theaters

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:30.020
that are done in Russian,
English, in Arabic in part

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.440
and I want to know about that.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.340
And, you've mentioned just now
the government subsidy issue

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:45.050
and that man in the back grabs,
obliquely referenced shame

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:51.490
which is not Weisman's workshop
playing in Mosaic now where the,

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:55.850
apparently the, the
Jewish Arab theater

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.950
in [inaudible] is
closed or something.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:01.100
And, I know the Kennedy Center
brought a Palestinian play

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.640
from a company in Jerusalem.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.590
I just would like you to talk
about that and I mean the state

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:17.020
of different, different ethnic
group theaters and the issue

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.370
of the need for government
subsidies

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:23.720
and if the government subsidies
is shutdown then the theater is

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.020
shuts down.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.340
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Once again,
the story we have done due

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.550
to the best of my knowledge
is not, they didn't shutdown

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:32.820
because of their
theatrical activity,

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.380
but because there was some
issues as with, with some events

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.410
that took place within the
facilities of the theater

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.940
which are something
against the Israeli law

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:47.590
or of encouraging some kind of
terrorists groups or something.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.470
I don't want to really go
into it because I'm not that,

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.350
an expert, but it hasn't
got to do with anything

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:58.510
with their repertoire which was,
there is not real censorship

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:01.150
on which plays you perform.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:04.430
There isn't and there
was by the way in Israel,

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.010
censorship, up to 1988.

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:08.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.380
&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: Whom I've
mentioned before has some

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:17.010
clashes with the censorship back
then in the 70s and insisted

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.720
in performing some of
his satirical plays

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.800
without permission and that
was a big deal back then,

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.660
but ever since 1988,
it was cancelled,

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:32.360
this comedy of censorship.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:39.690
What I can say is there are
companies which specializes

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.090
in productions, in as I've
said, in [inaudible] there are

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:50.450
at least two subsidized Arabic
theaters besides the [inaudible]

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:51.840
which is about to close.

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.210
There is the Gesher
theater which some materials

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:59.920
like I've brought here which
functions, is bilingual theater.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.960
It was established some
25 years ago by new,

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.950
by Jewish immigrants
from Russia.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:11.230
They came as a company pretty
much like Habima back then.

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:16.190
They came and they performed
in both Russian and Hebrew.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:17.490
They started performing

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.220
in Hebrew while they still
didn't know the language

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:24.370
and they had to write a text
in Hebrew, in foreign letters

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.450
and so they function regularly.

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.720
There is, and there is,
you know, in recent years,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:36.490
there is a very large population
coming from South Africa

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.190
in the city of Ra'anana and they
established their own English

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:44.430
speaking theater which is now
started to be, you have to prove

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.800
that you function on your
own for two years in order

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.750
to start getting some
subsidy from the government

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:56.080
and they just now
joined the this list

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.430
and they will be started,

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:00.140
starting to be supported
as well.

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.140
So, there is, a very,
I'm not that of an expert

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.310
because I focus mainly on
the Hebrew speaking theater

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:10.930
but I'm quite aware of the fact

00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:13.630
that it is being
supported as well.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.370
&gt;&gt; To follow up in the
occupied territories,

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.790
is there Hebrew theater,
is there.

&gt;&gt; Roy Horowitz: I
don't believe so.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.530
I don't believe there are.

don't, I don't believe so,

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:33.270
but because of some, if I
spoke about history and I spoke

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:37.300
about the love hate relationship
with the Jewish tradition

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.440
and the making of theater,

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.900

population, a large population

of the settlers are coming for
more religious, part, you know,

society and I am not aware

of any established theater
or company which functions.

they host productions
