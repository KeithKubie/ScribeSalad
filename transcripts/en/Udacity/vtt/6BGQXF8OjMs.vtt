00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.690
Fantastic work.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.925
You've now created a master
resume spreadsheet.

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.280
Selected keywords and
phrases for a target job.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.170
And tailored your career
experience to fit on one page.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.370
You have also organized your resume
sections in a logical order.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.770
Your final step is to perfect
the visual style of your resume.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.020
Though this stage may seem tedious,
it helps communicate your attention to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.560
detail and can be an opportunity
to show your personality.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.428
To begin, be sure your name is
the largest text on the page.

00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:30.320
Make titles, sub-categories, dates and
locations distinct from one another.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.980
To do so we recommend using
text formatting like bold,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.910
italics, spacing and size.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.210
Though some may choose to use color
to make text visually distinct,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.240
keep it minimal and subtle.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.850
We found that color works best,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.120
if it all, when used after you've
explored the limits of text formatting.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.930
If you aren't graphically gifted
simplicity might be your best bet.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.710
Keep text aligned to the left side and
use the entirety of the page.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.480
If you're short on space,
widen your margins.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.930
Use single spacing and font that are
easy to read and not overly stylized.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.460
Review the checklist on the instructor
notes to see if your resume

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.040
is up to par.
