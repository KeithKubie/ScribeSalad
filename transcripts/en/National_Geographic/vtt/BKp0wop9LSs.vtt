00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.370
( intro music )

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.676
( muffled radio noises )

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.415
( swooshing sound )

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.221
( electronic hum )

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:27.127
( audience applause )

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.164 line:0%
Well I'm really
happy to be here

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:36.135 line:0%
with everybody this
evening and share with you

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:40.706 line:0%
a bit of a potpourri
from an alien planet.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.908
From an alien planet
that is near and dear

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:45.478
to our hearts because
we live on it.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.181
And because we live on it,
we think we know about it.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.783
But the truth is
that there are huge,

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.287
vast tracks of the
surface and particularly

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.290
the subsurface that are
really unknown to us.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.260
And so each one of
these little planet-lets

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.364
that go to make up our
planet actually harbors

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.466
life forms and conditions
that are radically different

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.703
from what we experience
on the surface.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.041
And my way of substituting
for getting into

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.643
my rocket ship and cruising
the galaxy looking for

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:21.681
cool life forms, which is
what I grew up wanting to do,

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.350
is to have stayed
closer to home because

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.086
I don't have a rocket
ship yet, come on NASA.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.755
( audience laughter )

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:33.426
And try to explore templates
for the kind of life that

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:37.396
we might find on the planets
in our own solar system

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.966
and what kinds of signatures
would those leave.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.835
Well, National
Geographic has played

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:44.870
a big role in my life.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.574
And I had my first
magazine subscription

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:51.511
as a little kid, courtesy
of my cousin in 1968.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:56.983
Early on in my
attention to caves,

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.551
they sponsored some of
our work, and this is

00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.289
the centerfold from
the January 2000 issue.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.325
I actually was able to
be a centerfold model.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.693
( audience laughter )

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.895
And looking as glamorous
as I usually look

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.533
in these kinds of
deals, and there I am

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.169
with Diana Northup
and Mike Spilde,

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.038
two colleagues from the
University of New Mexico,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:23.009
and I'm diving for phlegm ball
mats totally suited up.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.145
If you've read the
magazine article

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.448
this time around you
will know that we are

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.517
still working on that
system 15 years later

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:35.254
and we are still mystified
by the tremendous

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:38.357
amount of biological
activity in what is to us

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.492
an extremely toxic environment.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:42.628
This is why we're all duded up,

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.198
because we are kind
of life form, humans,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.334
and higher animals find
this kind of environment

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:49.468
very toxic.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:51.336
But we are still
looking at snottites,

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.005
these are the famous snottites.

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.407
And I'm gazing lovingly at them.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.708
( audience laughter )

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:56.943
And taking samples of them,

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.210
which we will haul
back to the lab

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.945
and then try to poke
them with sticks

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:01.914
and get them to grow and look

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:05.084
at their DNA guts
and all that kind of stuff.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.487
But this is not where my
caving career started.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.155
It actually also
started by way of

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:12.825
a National Geographic special.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.429
It was called "Mysteries
Underground" in 1992.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:18.898
And that same year, with
several other colleagues,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.667
I had published a
paper suggesting that

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.603
the best place to
look for life on Mars

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:26.205
was not on the surface of Mars,

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.940
but would be in the subsurface.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.142
And I was looking for a way

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:30.843
to get into the subsurface
of Earth

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.312
to see what we could find
down there.

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.948
And I was way too poor
to actually do drilling.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:37.816
We couldn't get
anybody to pay for it,

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.453
and we saw this National
Geographic special,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.422
and it said a couple of
really important things

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.890
about the cave.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.159
It said it was pristine,
that it had been dug into,

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.161
which meant less contamination.

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.529
That it had a lot of sulfur,

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.331
and we already knew
that Mars was a very

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.666
sulfur-rich planet.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.869
And the third thing was
that one of the geologists

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.906
from the USGS Geological Survey

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.542
said that he thought he
had seen some kind of

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.778
little microbial life forms
on some of the formations.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:06.946
And so we were sold,

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.514
and we called him
up and we said,

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.815
"You don't know us
but we're from NASA

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:11.951
and we'd like to
go into your cave."

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.922
So we trained for
three hours ( laughs ),

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.725
which if we had known
then what we know now,

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.259
of course this was
completely nuts,

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.094
and then we went
on an expedition

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.429
for five days into this cave.

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:26.899
Now this cave is a huge system.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:30.870
It's 138 miles of
mapped passage so far.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.239
And exploration
is still underway.

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.308
Of course we were captivated by

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:38.010
many of the scenes that you see.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.579
This is a beautiful
image of what's known

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.515
as the Chandelier Ballroom.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.685
These are big selenite crystals.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.821
But really the quarry
that I am always after

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.557
is shown in these
orange materials

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.392
behind where the
young man is standing.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:55.194
This brown stuff in the middle,

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.130
it's not as spectacular,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.665
but this is where
the real quarry lay.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.536
And there are some of
my little friends now.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.871
These are all
microorganism types

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.339
that are unknown to science.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.142
In fact, virtually everything
we find in the subsurface

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:12.244
is unknown in the databases

00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:15.181
that we have
of surface life forms.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.350
The tiny ones there,
we call them the tiny guys,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.584
isn't that original?

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:19.818
( audience laughter )

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:23.021
These guys are about
100 nanometers across.

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.125
One of your hairs is about
a 100 micrometers across,

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:29.295
so this is a thousand
times smaller than that.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.764
And these are some of
the smallest life forms

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:33.933
that are clearly
growing and alive

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.567
that have ever been found.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.370
The ones with hairy
bits sticking off them,

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.072
we call them smurfs ( laughs )
for obvious reasons.

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:42.174
And then the others
are the death stars.

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:43.643
( audience laughter )

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.644
Well these are just
a few of the microbial forms

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.045
that we see in the subsurface.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:49.615
And this is really
what got us going,

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.451
and really caused me
to focus my career

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.787
from a lot of the
surface extreme systems

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:57.289
that I had been
looking at up until

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.858
that point in my career.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.761
I just wanna dazzle you
with cool stuff, okay?

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:05.097
So one of the amazing
things about caves

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:08.200
is just how big the
spaces can be underground.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.802
Here's a couple of examples.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.870
And if you've never
been to Carlsbad

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.772
or Mammoth Cave
or any of the beautiful

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.407
show caves around the world,

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:17.310
this is probably what
you are looking at.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.444
Something like that.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.012
But there are many
other peculiar

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.447
and amazing structures.

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.282
So, see all
that white material

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.816
when you're actually there

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.652
it sort of sparkles like sugar.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:29.488
There's 18 kilometers of
this river underground.

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:31.957
This is Snowy River
in Fort Stanton Cave,

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:36.195
about only an hour and a half
away from my campus.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:38.197
But the thing that
gets us about this

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.666
is not just the
spectacular mineralogy,

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.235
but all those dark
streaks on the wall.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:44.503
That's where the real action is.

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:46.139
And you can almost
hear them calling.

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.940
They're saying, "Hey, hey,
stupid, we're up here."

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.609
( audience laughter )

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:51.644
In their tiny little
microbial voices.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.812
( audience laughter )

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.647
And when we take
samples of those,

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:57.149
we can find that
sure enough they are

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:00.119
made by bacteria that
make their living

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:04.490
off a chemical
transformation of minerals

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.026
that contain the
element manganese.

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:09.796
This is a pretty exotic
way of making your living.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.097
They don't eat sandwiches
for lunch like we do,

00:07:12.097 --> 00:07:14.300
they eat rock and minerals.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.270
And this is ubiquitous
in these kinds of systems.

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.639
This is one of my
colleagues crawling through

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.075
some of that beautiful
white material.

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.711
In this material,
besides its beauty,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.714
it also contains
fossilized microorganisms.

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.916
So we can see that
the cave is preserving

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:33.352
not only the live guys,
that we can go in

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:35.754
and look for now,
but also the potential

00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:39.959
for preserving that material
into the future to be tested.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.262
This is a potpourri of
some of our little friends.

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:47.566
The upper left hand
is spots of goo

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:50.703
and little colonies,
and all of that is alive.

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.705
There are probably two
or three thousand strains

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.641
of microbes in there,
not a single one of which

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.211
is very closely related to
anything on the surface.

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:02.314
This is in a lava
tube cave in Hawaii.

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.850
The upper right hand side is

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.986
what under some
circumstances would just

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:10.122
turn into an ordinary
stalagmite dripping water,

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.958
saturated with mineral, and
yet in some circumstances

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.529
it turns into nests of
so-called cave pearls.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.529
Why?

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:18.830
We think it's biology.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.533
We think it's the gooey
biofilm that microbes produce

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:24.936
that actually causes
that to occur.

00:08:24.936 --> 00:08:27.873
In a mine in northern Minnesota,

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:30.176
called the Soudan mine,

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.878
there are bore holes
very narrow

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:35.080
that go down
to much deeper levels.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.149
And when you sample
those deeper levels,

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.886
you still find microorganisms.

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:42.588
They are even more exotic
in making their living

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:45.658
in a totally
non-oxygen environment.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:50.363
This is a salty, briny iron
mush that they're living in.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.531
And you can see little
bubbles of their activity

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.600
coming up from below.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.971
In that same mine, on a
March afternoon in 1962,

00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:02.274
the miners were told
that the mine closed,

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:05.811
and they threw down all their
stuff and left in disgust.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.281
50 years later, what we
find are these structures

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.984
that you can see, this
tower of dark material,

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.753
actually growing on one
of those miner's jackets

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:17.356
that had been
discarded on that day.

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.958
And this is entirely
composed of iron

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.795
and manganese-utilizing
microorganisms

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:25.664
and the minerals
that they excrete.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:28.133
If you go to southeast
Alaska and are lucky enough

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:30.936
to be able to find one of
the caves that exist there

00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:33.439
in the Tongass National Forest,

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.441
and you take a sample
of some of the material

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.476
there and you bring it
back to the laboratory

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:40.546
and look at it with a
scanning electron microscope,

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:42.948
you will see this beautiful
forest of crystals.

00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:45.451
All of those filamentous
things that you see

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:48.687
weaving through
them are microbes,

00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:51.657
and the microbes
are facilitating

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.527
the creation of these
beautiful structures.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:58.464
Here, these pool, out
of which these fluffy

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:01.400
foof balls, or poof
balls we call them.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.002
This is the Poof Ball Sea.

00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:06.605
And this is a system
that is always

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:08.607
right around or below freezing.

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.475
So you can see that
the temperature range

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:13.412
within which we can
operate is really great.

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.614
This system is in Ukraine.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:18.316
This is one of the
largest gypsum caves,

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:20.853
in the rock type
gypsum, in the world.

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:24.623
It's between 90 and 100
kilometers of passage,

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.191
so it's a very big system.

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.161
And it's covered by these
screaming red towers

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.197
that look sort of
like stalagmites.

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:34.400
And the color is
indeed as brilliant,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.403
as you can see from the
knife that's in the picture.

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:39.371
And when we look
at those with

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:42.674
an electron microscope,
we see this is not just mineral,

00:10:42.674 --> 00:10:44.476
that it is composed
of these tulip-shaped

00:10:44.476 --> 00:10:49.915
microorganisms all glued
together with iron compounds.

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.417
We don't know who those are.

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:55.220
Even something like granite,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.890
and this shows a granite
cave in northern Spain

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.726
with colleagues from Spain
and Portugal and Brazil.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.630
Just looks like an
ordinary granite surface.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.065
But actually the granite
itself is sort of

00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:10.502
a yellow color, and that
gray color that you're seeing

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.772
is really composed
of these little guys.

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:16.441
So fluffy strings of bacteria

00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:19.611
are making their living on
the inside of this granite cave.

00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.880
And they are producing
beautiful little

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.017
silica-containing speleothems,

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.686
or decorations as
they're called.

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:30.689
Tiny little stalactites
and stalagmites.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:34.459
And they are doing that
because by their very

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:38.931
life processes they're helping
to dissolve that granite.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:41.367
So individually
they're very tiny,

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.003
but in the aggregate
they're incredibly powerful.

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.939
Even in ice, which is
particularly important

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:49.975
when we come to think
about icy bodies

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:52.945
in our own solar system
and the potential

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:55.014
presence of life
in those systems.

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:58.217
This is Aaron Curtis, one
of our graduate students

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.087
at New Mexico Tech, who's
doing his dissertation work

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.387
on the ice caves

00:12:02.387 --> 00:12:06.391
around the volcano
Mount Erebus in Antarctica.

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:08.427
And not only are these
magnificent caves

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.763
with beautiful decorations
in them just like

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:13.532
you would find in
a limestone cave perhaps,

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:17.002
but there are also life forms
in those ices.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:19.939
Here's one that looks
like a twisted candy cane.

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:22.975
So there is nowhere
that is bug free.

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:24.109
( audience laughter )

00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:25.411
No matter what you
hear on TV about

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.878
how you should live
a germ-free life,

00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:28.313
you should not believe that.

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:29.247
( audience laughter )

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:33.118
I wanted to give you
a glimpse of a mystery

00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:35.821
that we are pursuing
and have been pursuing

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.957
for about 15 years.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:40.225
And you can see some of
the macroscopic evidences

00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:43.461
of it in this beautiful
little cave decoration here.

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:46.899
This is a copper mineral
called chrysocolla,

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:50.335
and it is a
beautiful blue color.

00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:53.538
And when we first saw
these we were entranced

00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:56.008
and thought, "Gee, they
seem to be gooey",

00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:57.409
and they were gooey.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:00.045
And we took samples of
them and lo and behold

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:03.181
they had many
microorganisms in them.

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:05.784
Since this initial effort,
we found them

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.420
in many different caves
around the world.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.658
And they often contain
structures that look like this.

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:15.760
These look like empty
mesh stockings, right?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.464
But we don't know what they are.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:22.567
We don't know what kind
of life form they are.

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:25.036
They all have the same pattern,

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.504
although there are variations.

00:13:26.504 --> 00:13:29.274
And now we've found
them in probably about

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:31.843
50 or 60 different
caves around the world

00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:34.012
in all different
kinds of chemistries,

00:13:34.012 --> 00:13:36.548
all different kinds
of temperatures.

00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:38.650
All different circumstances.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.519
Some are shallow, some are deep.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.421
We don't know who these are.

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:44.289
They're not fungi,
they're not amoebas,

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:45.758
they're not bacteria.

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:47.058
We don't know.

00:13:47.058 --> 00:13:49.828
So 15 years of pursuing
what I think of

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:52.931
as the wild<i> boojum</i> right
here on this planet,

00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:55.901
even with all of the
science that we have

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:58.369
at our disposal, and
we still have aliens

00:13:58.369 --> 00:14:00.206
right here underneath our feet.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.143
I want to end with
this spectacular image

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.513
by a wonderful cave
photographer, Carsten Peter.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.450
This is the Naica system
in Chihuahua in Mexico.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.086
National Geographic
has done a wonderful

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.521
article on that in 2008.

00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:17.990
There have been two
National Geographic

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.824
television specials
that we've been

00:14:19.824 --> 00:14:21.826
privileged to participate in.

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:24.964
And yes, those
crystals are that big.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.632
And the reason that we're
in these little orange suits

00:14:27.632 --> 00:14:30.068
is not to keep us warm
as you might think,

00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:32.704
but to actually keep us
cool enough to work in there.

00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:35.774
So are essentially in
suits packed in ice

00:14:35.774 --> 00:14:39.545
in order to keep us from
dying from the heat in there.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:43.581
The heat ranges from
about 105 degrees

00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:47.852
to perhaps well over
140 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:14:47.852 --> 00:14:50.623
And this is just not
survivable for humans.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:54.994
And yet this entire system
has microbes everywhere.

00:14:54.994 --> 00:14:58.497
It has them in the walls,
on that orange material.

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.465
And particularly
interesting to us,

00:15:00.465 --> 00:15:02.601
it has them in little
tiny fluid pockets

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.969
within the giant crystals.

00:15:04.969 --> 00:15:07.505
And because the crystal
growth rate has been

00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:10.375
measured and also age
dated, we know

00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:13.278
that the samples that we were
able to take in some of those

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:16.982
crystals are at a
time depth of between

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:20.485
about 10 and perhaps
about 50,000 years.

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:23.421
So we have been able
to go into the crystals

00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:26.825
and use these little
pockets of time capsules.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.328
And not only were
we able to find DNA

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:32.431
and organic remains
of microorganisms,

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:35.200
but we were able to
actually bring a lot of them

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.536
into culture alive.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:39.404
So we're very excited
about this because

00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:42.507
this shows that
microorganisms can tolerate

00:15:42.507 --> 00:15:44.375
significant periods of time,

00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:47.012
geologically significant
periods of time,

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.648
in a state of
relative inactivity,

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.983
and yet still remain viable,

00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:54.720
still remain life-containing,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.156
and still able to be brought
back to life so to speak

00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:01.126
once they get released
from these materials.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:06.064
So our own mini solar
system underneath our feet

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:11.003
is acting as practice
really as we try to do

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:12.838
what my colleagues
have suggested.

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.540
And that is take our
knowledge, take our science,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.209
take our melding of
the discipline of science

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:20.678
with the magic of
exploration and the beauties

00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:22.948
of what we see and
what we experience

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:25.917
and combine those
together in order to

00:16:25.917 --> 00:16:28.253
advance our knowledge
of the universe.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:29.988
So we are right on
the cusp of this

00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:31.389
kind of exploration.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:33.425
And the work that I
and my colleagues do

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.760
will hopefully help
to give us models

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.363
for how organisms
can make their living

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:40.598
in this amazing
array of planets

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:42.434
that we have in our solar system

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:44.636
and this amazing
array of planets

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:47.172
that we apparently have
in our galaxy and our universe.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.273
Thank you.

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.608
( audience applause )

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:52.644
( outro music )
