00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.740
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. Welcome everybody. I'm
really delighted to introduce our guest today,

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.740
Nick Davies, who as you all know is one of
Britain's finest journalists and a multi-award

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.030
winning. He's been Author of the Year and
Britainâ€™s Journalist of the Year and Feature

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.350
Writer of the Year.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.650
He's a freelancer. He's been a freelancer
for many years. He works mainly for The Guardian

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.120
and The Observer. And in recent years, he's
best known I think for his book, which he

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.100
left on some of the desks here. "Flat Earth
News," which I'll pick up a copy of and read

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.449
the blurb on.

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.480
"An award-winning reporter exposes falsehood,
distortion, and propaganda in the media."

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.410
And more recently has been very heavily involved
in bringing the story of WikiLeaks to The

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.670
Guardian and to other people around the world.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.460
So, I think you were gonna talk mainly about
"Flat Earth News" and WikiLeaks and then at

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.700
the end we'll have time for some questions.
So, Nick thanks very much for coming and the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
floor is yours.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.920
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: OK. It is an extremely unfair
arrangement. You're all eating. I haven't

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
eaten since God was a boy.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.280
[laughter]

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.950
Also, I made the terrible mistake of going
on a fitness week last week in Crete. They

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.100
work you very hard in order that you become
fit. And the result is I have a twisted ankle,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.619
a jarred wrist, a trapped nerve in my back,
and various other ailments.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
[audience chuckles]
So I hope you feel sorry for me. Now, WikiLeaks.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.659
I got very involved in it. As a result of--.
Oh my God, there's lots of people coming in

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.869
here. As a result of all the secrets that
we published last summer, a lot of people

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.960
looked at journalism and said, "This changes
everything."

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.130
And I want to argue that that's completely
wrong. What the whole WikiLeaks adventure

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.290
tells you is actually that you need conventional
journalism more than ever. And my starting

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.290
point--.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.421
Excuse me. I'm slightly asthmatic and not
breathing terribly well. My starting point

00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:14.710
is the subtitle of that book, "Flat Earth
News," which is that the book is trying to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.960
explain why it is that a profession whose
primary purpose is to tell the truth so frequently

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.760
puts out stories which contain falsehood,
distortion, and propaganda, and why we so

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760
frequently fail.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.830
So, before I get into WikiLeaks, what happened
there and what that tells us, by way of setting

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.220
the context and maybe giving you a confession,
I want to look at what's wrong with conventional

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.100
journalism. And a lot of people from--. Let
me just explain the title of the book: "Flat

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.100
Earth News."

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.550
What that refers to is the thought that for
hundreds of years, thousands of years, most

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.420
people took it for granted that the Earth
is flat because it obviously is. But once

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.730
somebody started checking, they discovered
that what was widely accepted as being obviously

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.790
true wasn't.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.100
Now, what I'm arguing is that the mass media
are full of those kinds of statements-- Flat

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.990
Earth stories. I mean, there are some which
are notorious, global falsehoods, like for

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.680
example, almost everything that was said about
those notorious weapons of mass destruction

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680
in Iraq.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.960
And a huge proportion of what we told the
world about the millennium bug was completely

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.720
false. You get into running stories. It's
terrifying, for example, to look at the war

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.320
against drugs and the way that that multi-billion
dollar operation is based on assumptions about

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.480
drugs which are actually false.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.380
It's based, for example, on the proposition
that heroin is toxic and bad for you. The

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.490
reality is that heroin is very addictive,
but it's a benign drug. You can take an awful

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.720
lot of heroin without doing yourself any harm
at all for your entire life.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.760
What does the damage is the black market,
which is created by the false assumption that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.790
the heroin is bad for you. It's a ghastly
misunderstanding. And it's the media that

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.990
feeds the falsehood to the government. And
you get all these little stories that just

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.850
come and go-- the 24-hour falsehoods.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.710
Things--. I mean, there was a lovely little
example a few months ago, just happens to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.070
come to mind, about a woman who was appointed
to be the Chief of Police in a small town

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.980
in Mexico. Do you remember this story? It
was all about how this fortunately rather

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.009
attractive woman was gonna take on the big
drug cartels single-handed.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.880
Great story. Now if you actually read beyond
the headline and the intro to what she said,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.070
what she actually said is, "My responsibility
is crime prevention. I'm gonna be checking

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.191
things like whether there are bolts on windows.
If somebody tells me there's a drug cartel

00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:35.400
in the town, I won't even report it to the
state police or the federal police, whose

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.580
job it is to look after it. It's nothing to
do with me."

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.060
Lone Woman Takes on Drug Cartel. It's a great
story. It happens to be false. Now, why do

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.760
we do this? The interesting thing is that
most outsiders who look at what news organizations

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.669
do are themselves victims of Flat Earth style
explanations as to why we get it wrong.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.310
So, a lot of people think that we are the
victims of our proprietors, who lean down

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.240
from on high and inflict their politically
motivated lies on us. And therefore, like

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.659
good puppets, we obediently put it into print.
There is a certain amount of that which goes

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.510
on. The two words "Rupert" and "Murdock" inevitably
come to mind.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.659
[laughter]

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:18.009
But actually, there's very little of it--very
little. Far, far less than people imagine

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.919
and certainly far, far too little to explain
the generality with which news media failed

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:23.919
to tell the truths.

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.529
A lot of people think that we are similarly
pushed around by advertisers. We need their

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.699
money. They won't give to us unless we tow
some particular line that they want us to.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.370
I have to tell you, in the national media,
I've never come across a proven example of

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.370
that happening.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.319
I've come across examples of advertisers occasionally
trying it on and being told to remove themselves,

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.561
but in slightly more foul language. So, what
is it that actually is going on in news organizations

00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.620
that means that we are failing?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.710
In a line, what's happening is that news organizations,
overwhelmingly in the developed world, have

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.680
been brought up by big corporations which
understandably have seen these news organizations

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.309
as a source of profit.

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:10.270
And therefore, they have implemented a series
of changes, which in a line have shifted the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.249
priority so that instead of the priority being
editorial, journalistic, it is now commercial

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:21.529
and profit-making. And this has an enormous
range of impacts on the way we operate, almost

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:22.889
all of them destructive.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.430
So, there's a big structural thing, which
is that these new owners are interested in

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.189
increasing the amount of money they can make.
There's nothing controversial about that.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:35.949
So, they tend to try and cut their costs by
reducing the number of staff involved. And

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.180
they're trying to increase our output so that
they can earn more advertising.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.509
That's a very noisy sandwich. So, we did a
big piece of number crunching when we were

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.180
researching "Flat Earth News." I hired some
innocent, long-suffering academics from Cardiff

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.039
University. Good guys. Specialists.

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:58.330
And one of the things they did was to go through
the annual reports of all the Fleet Street

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.629
companies, looking for information about how
many journalists were being employed on our

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:06.129
national newspapers--each of them. And where
there were gaps, they spoke to executives

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.129
to fill it in.

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:12.099
Then, I sent them off to do an extremely tedious
job, which was to go to the newspaper museum

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:16.999
and measure the physical space that those
journalists were filling. And we collected

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:21.809
all the numbers from 1985 through to the present
date. And when we crunched them all together

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:27.120
and took a bottom line figure, which is not
perfect, this figure, but it's a very interesting,

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.680
albeit crude, indicator.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.620
What we found is that your average Fleet Street
journalist today is filling three times as

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.779
much space as he or she was in 1985. Now,
if you flip that 'round and look at it from

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.539
the operational point of view, the reporter's
point of view, what it means is that as a

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.789
crude average, we have only a third of the
time that we used to have to work on our stories.

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:55.219
And time matters. Time is the most important
working asset that reporters have. You take

00:07:55.219 --> 00:08:00.210
time away from reporters. It's like taking
the steel away from the manufacture of automobiles.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.449
You can't do it. And we then followed through
to look at what happens.

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.310
This is a simple structural point, right,
about commercializing news rooms. What happens

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:16.409
when you take time away from reporters in
that way? So, we took a sample of 2000 about

00:08:16.409 --> 00:08:21.309
the United Kingdom, which had been published
by the best newspapers in Britain, i.e., the

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:22.309
quality press.

00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:25.860
Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Independent. We
threw in The Daily Mail. You wouldn't want

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.280
to call it a quality newspaper, but it's powerful,
[audience chuckles]

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.139
so we thought it ought to be in there. So
that gave us--.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:35.029
So we took two random, one-week periods, pulled
2000 stories, one at a time and asked themselves

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:41.740
a question, which is this: Insofar as this
story has a central, factual statement, is

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.930
there evidence that that statement has been
checked? Now, I'm right at the beginning I

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.440
said, "Our job is to try to tell the truth."

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.730
But that's our primary purpose. So, our primary
function is checking. It's just basic. This

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.500
statement is false. We don't want it. This
statement is true. We'll use it. That's the

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.300
primary function. So when you ask this question,
you know the answer you will get. It's gonna

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.310
be a 100%.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:09.930
The answer they actually got was 12. 12% of
the stories in the best newspapers in the

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.050
country had shown evidence that their central
factual statements had been checked. Do you

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.410
see what happens when you start to take time
away from journalists?

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:22.150
OK. Taking those same 2000 stories, we did
another exercise, which was very long and

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.930
convoluted, which was to find the origin of
the raw material--the information--from which

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:32.000
those stories were built. Now, the answer
ought to be that the journalists are contacting

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.610
human beings and extracting information or
documents or whatever from them, that the

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.620
journalists are going out and finding it.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.660
What we actually found was that that was true
funnily enough in the same percent. Only 12%

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.100
of the material in these stories was actually
being generated by the journalists themselves.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.990
There was 8% where we just couldn't quite
bottom it.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.149
We couldn't quite find out where it had come
from. It was off the record; It was obscure

00:09:53.149 --> 00:10:00.009
or whatever. But 80% of this stuff was coming
from two, secondhand sources. The first of

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:05.579
those is the wire agencies-- Reuters, The
Press Association, AP. And on the other hand,

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:08.050
the public relations industry.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:13.720
And these two overlap. A lot of material pushed
out by people like Peter Barron. We'll run

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:20.170
on Newswise. OK. Now, if you put all this
together, you get a picture of journalists,

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:26.009
instead of being active information gatherers,
going out and gathering information and checking

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:31.470
it, they become passive processors of material
that people provide for them.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.300
And they don't check it. So, if the Prime
Minister wants to stand up and say there are

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.120
weapons of mass destruction all over Buckingham
Palace Road, it gets churned out and pushed

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.779
into press. We don't check it. We just take
it and put it in. I started using this word

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:45.850
to summarize this.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.040
Churnalism, rather than journalism--the unchecked
recycling of second-hand material. And just

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.631
to explain, those two second-hand sources,
what's wrong with them, the wire agencies.

00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:01.230
A lot of reporters who work for someone like
Reuters are very highly professional, very

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.529
often brave people who will go into extremely
dangerous spaces to get information.

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:10.350
But there are two reasons why Reuters, or
all the other agencies, won't tell you the

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.470
truth about the world. The first and most
important is that they have no idea what it

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.160
is. If you think--. Does anybody know how
many countries there are in the world? It's

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
a rhetorical question.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.259
Nobody knows. But there's about 200. Is Palestine
a country? Is Taiwan a country? There are

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:28.351
people killing each other trying to get the
answer. But it's about 200. And I did a huge

00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:34.230
grid, looking at all the countries where Reuters
has representatives producing television news

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.230
and text news.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.889
So the first thing, in terms of text news--words--there
are 80 of those 200 countries where there's

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:44.440
nobody from Reuters, and also nobody from
the Associated Press, right? Now bear in mind

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.699
80% of news is coming from PR and wire agencies.
These are hugely significant providers of

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:51.699
news information.

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:56.029
And there are 80 of the world's roughly 200
countries where they don't have anybody. In

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.410
the countries where they do have people, generally
speaking it's one or two people in the capitol

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.370
city with tens of millions of people in the
population, thousands and thousands of square

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.370
miles.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.190
They cannot possibly know what is going on
in their patch. For example, in October 2001,

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.600
September 2001, when the terrorist attacks
happened in New York, Reuters' representation

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.250
in Afghanistan consisted of one man who was
doing television news and text news.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.500
And television news is even better. Of the
roughly 200 countries, there's only 80 where

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.329
they have people. Countries like, for example,
Saudi Arabia, Ireland, Canada, the Congo,

00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:33.360
don't have anybody there. So, we get news
from there only if something really freakishly

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.079
unusual happens and the local people put it
out in whatever format and we pick it up.

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:43.509
So, it's inherently unlikely that Reuters
and the other agencies can tell us the truth

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.959
about the world or their patch, because they
don't know it. Furthermore, if you actually

00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:51.290
look at the detail of what they do, they're
not interested in telling you the truth. They

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.839
do a different thing, which is accuracy.

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:59.319
So, what agency reporters are paid to do is
to report what people say. That's what the

00:12:59.319 --> 00:13:03.980
good agency reporter does. Our job, as the
recipients of this agency copy, as it comes

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.949
into our newsrooms, is to check to see whether
what those people are saying is true.

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:12.940
But as we've discovered, that's happening
in a very small proportion of cases. So, put

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.519
those two things together, it is alarmingly
easy for people to manipulate news coverage

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:23.529
simply by saying whatever suits them. It flows
through the wire into our newsrooms and then

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:25.019
into the newspapers or telly.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:31.620
And then, a lot of what it carries is product
of the public relations industry. Now, you

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.379
have to understand what's wrong with PR. To
some extent, to some small extent, PR people

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:43.060
lie. Don't listen to this bit, Peter. PR people
get terribly upset if you accuse them of lying.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:49.250
But is it certainly my experience that if
you put a powerful PR person in a corner and

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.660
give them no other option, they will certainly
lie. 'Cause actually, more than WikiLeaks,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.959
the thing I've been doing for the last two
or three years, is the phone hacking saga

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.279
at The News of the World.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:02.019
And there is no doubt, and I'd like to say
this on the camera so that it can be repeated

00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:06.589
so they'll know it, News International, Rupert
Murdock's News International have consistently

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:11.269
lied about that. And they have lied to their
colleagues and the rest of the press.

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:16.620
Lied and lied and lied. So, they will do it.
PR people will lie. But that's not the generality

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.769
of what's wrong with PR. Most of the time,
what they're doing is telling us truths, but

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:26.410
they're selecting those truths which serve
their interests. And for that reason it's

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.410
unreliable.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.300
Just as a single example, I had an interesting
conversation when I was researching the book,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.040
with a guy who runs the press office at one
of the big central government departments.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.129
I won't tell you which one it is, but it's
like education or the home office or transport

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:44.129
or whatever.

00:14:44.129 --> 00:14:49.259
Excuse me. And he was saying that they have
a system where. So if you imagine, they have

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:52.620
units all around the country. So, if it's
education, it would be schools. If it's the

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.930
home office, it would be police stations.
If it's health, it would be hospitals.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.709
And in these units, the local management have
a rule that if anything occurs on their patch

00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:04.399
which could possibly generate bad publicity,
they have to inform his press office in the

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:06.810
center, somewhere close to here in Central
London.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:11.220
And then they produce what's called a "Forward
Line" that they put into their computer in

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.939
the press office, so that if a journalist
rings up and says, "Well, what about this

00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:17.700
embarrassing incident in Nottingham or wherever?"
They've already got their answer prepared.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.389
Now the reason he was telling me this is he
was saying, "We never use it." 'Cause what

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:27.120
the press are writing about are the stories
that we select for them. We give them the

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.009
stories and they write them. So, and he said
just recently in his department, there had

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:35.850
been a little incident in one of his--whether
it's a school or a hospital or a police station

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.660
or a prison--where a married couple, a man
and a women, were running in this place together.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.089
And they'd had an argument and on the work
premises, the man had taken an axe and attempted

00:15:44.089 --> 00:15:48.120
to chop his wife into quite small pieces.
Now, that was a story worth reporting for

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.449
one reason or another. So they'd done their
Forward Line and we never got to hear about

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:54.959
it. In the meantime, they set up a photo opportunity
with the Minister, talking about them putting

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:58.500
an extra &nbsp;Â£10 million into producing tarmac,
or whatever it is, and we turned it into a

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.500
story.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.680
You get the picture. While I was researching
this book, there was a beautiful little example

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.720
of all this at work. Where this was the summer
of 2006 and the World Cup football in Germany

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.819
was about to start. And although it's riveting
to read my book, it's very boring actually

00:16:13.819 --> 00:16:14.819
writing it.

00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:20.339
So, I was--. [chuckles] So, you keep drifting
online to what's going on. So I went to the

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:25.689
Guardian website. And there was a story there.
And this story had been put out by the Press

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:30.350
Association. That's the biggest news agency
covering the United Kingdom. Absolutely dominant.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:36.990
And this story from the Press Association
said that an English football fan was so nervous

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.249
about England's likely performance in the
coming World Cup that he had taken out an

00:16:41.249 --> 00:16:46.310
insurance policy, which meant that he would
be paid a million pounds compensation if he

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:51.550
suffered emotional trauma as a result of our
boy' performance.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.920
Now, it's a funny thing being a journalist
because you're always looking for things that

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.350
aren't quite in place, that aren't quite right,
'cause that's the clue that there's a story

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.519
there. So, there was something about this
story that was rather striking, which was

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.260
the guy's name, the football fan.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:10.490
He was called Paul Hucker. Now, it just struck
me looking at that name that if you were Mr.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.380
and Mrs. Hucker, and there is the lovely Mrs.
Hucker pregnant with child and about to give

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.650
birth and you're having the conversation about
what to call the child, you would know two

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.650
things.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.351
First, that you wouldn't call it a name beginning
with an "F," or a "P," [whispers]because the

00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:26.170
child would be a little Phucker. [regular
voice]So therefore, I thought, "I don't trust

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.610
this story." In fact, it turned out that Paul
Hucker had cruel parents. He really was called

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.140
P. Hucker. But nevertheless, on that false
clue--

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.590
[laughter]

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.980
I started looking at this story and there
are obvious questions. Is there really a football

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.870
fan this neurotic that he would really, seriously
need an insurance policy to go through the

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.870
World Cup?

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.840
Is there really an insurance company that
does these things? What's all this about?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.570
Now, I then went to the idle journalist's
best friend, which of course you all know

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:54.690
is Mr. Google. So I put old poor Hucker's
name into your search engine. And he popped

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.309
up on several other occasions in stories,
in newspapers.

00:17:59.309 --> 00:18:05.440
And always stories about insurance and always
about the same insurance company. And in each

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.529
of these stories he was celebrating the value
of the insurance policy he had got. So I phoned

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:14.180
the insurance company. And I said, "Could
I speak to Paul Hucker?"

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.810
And they said, "Yes. Putting you through."
I said, "Hang on a minute. I've got to write

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.690
him a letter. Which department is he in?"
"Public relations and marketing."

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.690
[laughter]

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:27.250
OK. So, this story is what you might technically
call "totally false." It is the PR man. He's

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.570
a nice guy. I've since had a little bit of
contact with him inventing a joyous little

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.250
tale that will run on PA and because we recycle
this stuff without checking, it will run everywhere.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:42.770
So for the next 24 hours, I watched this story
spread through printed papers, news websites,

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.450
radio and television all over the United Kingdom.
And in the second 24-hour period, it went

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.940
global. You could see it all over the English-speaking
world, in Australia, in Canada.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.450
You could see it in all sorts of foreign languages.
There was a 'me-me-me-me Paul Hucker me-me-me-me-me

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.440
a &nbsp;Â£1million" all around the world as journalists
recycle this stuff. And if you want to understand

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.090
why we told the world there were weapons of
mass destruction all over Iraq and all those

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.240
other things, Paul Hucker is as close as you'll
get to the answer.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.211
It's that churnalism process. OK. Now, there
are all sorts of other things that go wrong

00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:14.700
in newsrooms. I'm just trying to give you
the core of it. No, step back. Let's go to

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:21.270
WikiLeaks. I'm a freelancer. I sit at home
with a sort of finely-tuned eye for a story

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.740
with which I may be able to put some bread
on the table for my starving children.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:31.140
So, I'm sitting there. You know the sequence
here is that it is alleged that a young US

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:38.029
soldier based in Iraq called Bradley Manning
removed cartloads of material. And it is interesting

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:42.940
from our point of view in this context that
had he tried to--this is all alleged, alleged,

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.850
alleged. Bradley Manning is an unconvicted
man and it's important we hold on to that.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:53.360
But this whistle blower, whoever he is, if
he had tried to remove the quantity of secrets

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:59.120
which he was later to disclose in hard copy
form, he would've needed a truck and it would've

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.120
been quite obvious that he was doing it. You
know how the whistle blower is alleged to

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.120
have done it with.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.780
Do you know about this? He works in a little
room where only a very few people are allowed

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.880
in this US Army base outside Baghdad. And
inside the base, there are some computer terminals

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.070
which are hooked into private, indeed secret,
communication networks.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.460
One is basically diplomatic and the other
is basically US Intelligence. And his job

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.870
is to go in there and somebody will task him.
"Find out everything we know about such and

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.890
such a village, or such and such an individual."
And he dredges it up. OK. Now, this is not--.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.220
This is funky American stuff. So, while they're
doing that, they're allowed to play music

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.799
through their headphones. So, he's watching
this stuff, this anonymous whistle blower.

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:43.730
He becomes more and more concerned that what
he's seeing is routine evidence of the United

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.799
States being on the wrong side of the moral
barriers, committing crimes, doing all sorts

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:49.000
of appalling things.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.350
And he comes to the conclusion that the world
should be told about this. And so, when he--.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.789
He's a big Lady Gaga fan. So he starts to
take in CDs, which are clearly marked "Lady

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:02.750
Gaga," but which are in fact blank. He slips
them into his computer, sticks in his earphones,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.260
does a bit of lip sync, and starts downloading
small truckloads of secrets onto his CDs.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.610
And he takes them out and he takes them out
and he takes them out. And he gets away with

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.669
removing more classified material than any
human being has ever removed in the entire

00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:20.400
history of this particular planet. He also
succeeds, this anonymous whistle blower, in

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.159
conveying this information to WikiLeaks.

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:28.929
The job is done. However, there is then the
most ghastly security breach from the whistle

00:21:28.929 --> 00:21:33.260
blower's point of view, where he becomes lonely.
He goes online and starts instant messaging

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:39.299
a guy in California called Adrian Lamo and
tell him, "This is my job. This is what I

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:42.529
do. Here's all the stuff, the Lady Gaga disks.
I've just disclosed all this stuff to this

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:45.049
white-haired Australian."

00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:50.330
And the guy in California, who he's instant
messaging with, goes to the FBI. And this

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.799
goes on over a period of two or three days,
the IM-ing. And you can see on the third day

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.710
it's a different pair of hands on the keyboard,
asking him questions. And at the end of that

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.750
third day, Bradley Manning is arrested and
accused of being this whistle blower.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:07.490
OK. That happened in May. Mid-June, I'm sitting
at home reading the paper. And there's a little

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.659
story in there from our friends at Reuters
that says the Americans have arrested this

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:16.650
guy. They've accused him of leaking massive
secrets to WikiLeaks and this man is now being

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.200
held in some sort of dungeon in Kuwait.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:25.179
Now, just as an example of how churnalism
operates, that story has gone out from Reuters

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:30.059
all 'round the world, following the footprints
of Paul Hucker. And then journalists get onto

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:32.980
the next exciting adventure 'cause they have
no time to stop and think.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.610
Because I'm sitting at home with my feet on
the desk and with the starving children and

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.020
all the rest of it, it's really a very, very
simple thing to say, "Hang on a moment. Perhaps

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.870
the story isn't that the man who's been arrested.
The story's the secrets." If it's true, there's

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.309
been this huge hemorrhage of confidential
information.

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:54.899
Let's go and find out about it. So, cutting
a long story short, I set out to track down

00:22:54.899 --> 00:22:58.910
this guy I had never met, Julian Assange.
I told I had heard of WikiLeaks. And there

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.980
may have been one or two other reporters trying
to do this as well. But it is a striking fact

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.610
that on the whole, people didn't try to do
the story.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.770
They just did the churnalism. You with me?

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.059
[Nick Davies clears throat]

00:23:10.059 --> 00:23:14.720
It took four or five days to find him because
at that stage, Julian was very concerned that

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.830
he might be the target of some kind of attack.
So he was lying very low. So I contacted people

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:25.390
who I could establish had previously worked
with him and tried to motivate them to put

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:26.390
me in touch with him.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.409
Eventually, after four or five days, one of
his associates called me and said, "Don't

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:35.409
tell Julian that I'm telling you this, but
he is in Brussels. He's gonna try and speak

00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:39.940
at a press conference in the European Parliament
tomorrow." That was a Monday.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.580
And it was late on Sunday night I got our
permanent correspondent in Brussels to agree

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.899
to go to the European Parliament building
on the following day. He listened to this

00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:52.570
press conference, grabbed Julian, took him
into a small cupboard and said, "Will you

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.799
meet this guy Nick Davies." Julian says, "Yes."

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:59.410
I go out there on the Tuesday. And we then
had a long conversation, me and Julian. Which

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:07.409
takes us closer into our subject area because
I had to try to persuade him not to do what

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:12.529
he normally does, or has been doing, with
information, which was to post it on the WikiLeaks

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:13.529
website.

00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:20.320
To argue that, journalism can help in a way
that ordinarily the activity on the internet

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.919
doesn't help. And it's interesting actually
that from the point of view this question

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:30.080
that Julian himself took very, very little
time to agree because I think he already recognized

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.760
that the WikiLeaks model wasn't working.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.600
You know the Links part of it is a safe corridor
through which material, at least in theory,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.899
can be passed to him without its being traceable.
I think that was working reasonably well.

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:45.320
What wasn't working was then posting that
material on the WikiLeaks website and imagining

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.429
that the world would come to it and analyze
it, download it, rewrite it, distribute it.

00:24:50.429 --> 00:24:51.429
It wasn't happening.

00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:55.740
It wasn't being looked at. It wasn't having
any impact and he knew that. And before I

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.659
started this argument, he'd already started
looking for ways to hook up with the mainstream

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:03.700
media so that it was relatively easy in a
sense for me to persuade him into this.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.430
And let me just finish this through the narrative
and I'll look at the issues. So, we talked

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:14.740
for six hours basically nonstop. Blah-bi-da-blah-be-da-ba.
And it was a very discursive conversation.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.360
And some of it was about this central thing
of should we do this, but also we were going

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.490
off into long loops about the contents of
the material, which he had, and exactly how

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.399
it should be used and da-di-da-di-da.

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:29.320
At the end of this six hour conversation,
we came up with an agreement. It turned out

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.600
that the secrets that he detained naturally
fell into four packages of information. In

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.600
fact, I can remember him telling me quite
early on in the meeting, he said, "One of

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.070
the things we've got is the whole, complete
record of every operation involving the US

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.500
military in Afghanistan since they went in
in October 2001."

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.350
And I went, "Holy moley." And so I said, "What
else have you got?" And he said, "Well, we've

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:57.669
got the entire US military record of every
operation they've been involved in in Iraq

00:25:57.669 --> 00:26:01.740
since they went in there in March 2003." I
said, "Fuck."

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.740
[laughter]

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:09.850
And then he said, "And the next thing is much
bigger. It's an archive of tens of thousands

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:15.200
of cables sent by American embassies all over
the world to the State Department in Washington,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200
DC.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.340
And this goes back over the years. Some of
them as far as 1966." Well, I'd run out of

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.760
swear words. This is just vast, vast quantities
of secret material. The fourth thing, which

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.720
was never quite as riveting, was the personal
files of the prisoners who'd been through

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.720
Guantanamo Bay.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.980
Still, I mean, on a normal day a pretty exciting
leak. But on this particular day it looked

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.620
rather small. So, there were these four packages
of information. And what we agreed was that

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.870
we would set up an alliance of The Guardian
and The New York Times to process this information

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.710
and to publish it.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:51.880
And part of the reason--. I'll explain it
to you. Are we all right for time? Yeah. I

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.909
was saying to him that I did indeed think
that there was a risk of some form of attack

00:26:55.909 --> 00:27:00.740
on him. There were possibly, in theory, four
kinds of attack that could be made on him.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.620
One was physical attack to try and kill him.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.070
Both of us agreed that that was actually extremely
unlikely because US Intelligence agencies

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.450
may have a history of brutality, but they're
not stupid. And if in this situation you go

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.730
out and kill Julian Assange, you're gonna
create a huge scandal, worse than the one

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.700
you're trying to suppress and you won't suppress
the scandal.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.060
It's just not gonna happen. Then, there was
the possibility of legal attack, that the

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:28.950
Americans would go to court and suppress any
attempt by The Guardian to publish and/ or

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.070
arrest all the people involved. Now these
were live risks. And this was one of the very

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.960
important reasons for linking in with The
New York Times because media law in the United

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.639
States is much, much more generous to journalism
than it is in this country.

00:27:40.639 --> 00:27:46.220
This country's media law is particularly obstructive
of the free press. And it would be easy to

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.710
go to court and suppress publication. But
the First Amendment of the United States means

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.300
that it's highly unlikely to happen.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.289
Furthermore, if by going with The New York
Times calculation was that Barack Obama's

00:27:56.289 --> 00:28:00.990
White House, specifically wouldn't do anything
particularly aggressive to the most powerful

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.460
democrat paper in the United States. So that
there was a political as well as a legal advantage

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.890
to tying up with The New York Times.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.580
And that also had an influence on our thinking
about the third kind of attack, which was

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.649
a technical one that they might try and, I
dunno, crash his website or do something spooky

00:28:15.649 --> 00:28:19.940
to his servers. In the same way, if you think
of it politically and you're linking up and

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.519
forming a powerful alliance in the United
States, it's less likely that they're gonna

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:24.770
do something like that.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:30.230
But what we really knew, what this was really
about, we were launching an information war

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.990
going back to what I was saying about journalism.
We were provoking an attack if we publish

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:40.480
this stuff from the most powerful news manipulation
machine in the world.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.950
If you look at the PR industry, look at the
American government. They're absolutely at

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:47.970
the top of the pile. It's massive. OK. So,
we had those different kind of lines of attack.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:52.049
I'm slightly getting lost here as what I'm
trying to tell you. So we agreed that we would

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:53.889
create this alliance, go through these stories.

00:28:53.889 --> 00:28:58.090
A few days later a dash of people gets brought
in and off we go. We do this thing. Oh, I

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.080
just wanted to tell you this one tiny little
thing. But this is just, it's color. We agreed

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:08.049
that the first package would be the Afghan
war logs. And I needed to get those back to

00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:09.080
the UK immediately.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.750
We were both somewhat worried about security
and so we agreed that we wouldn't use our

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:18.340
phones. So for example, my girlfriend called
in the middle of the meeting and she knew

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.539
I was meeting Julian. So, I had to say to
her, "It's all a disaster. He won't cooperate.

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:24.269
He's useless. He hasn't got anything." Just
in case we were being listened to. And with

00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:29.440
the same kind of logic, there was a concern
that if I took a laptop or a memory stick

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.779
back through customs the next day into the
UK, I might get stopped and they'd nick it

00:29:34.779 --> 00:29:35.830
off me.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:41.120
So, Julian came up with--. 'Cause I'm a dinosaur.
And Julian understood entirely how to deal

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.350
with this. He said, "OK. Here's what we do.
I will create a website. It'll exist only

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.710
for a few hours. I will place the Afghan war
logs on this website. It will be encrypted

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.240
and you will have a password.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.010
So you go back to the United Kingdom and then
you get access to the website." So, we're

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.929
sitting in this cafe. And he then took one
of the paper napkins on the table, which had

00:29:58.929 --> 00:30:03.230
the commercial logo of the cafe on it. And
so with a burrow he hooked together some of

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.770
the words in the cafe in the logo.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.990
And I then put that in my pocket. That's the
password. He did the same, put another in

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.970
his. So if I get stopped, 'cause I'm going
back into the UK, it looks like something

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.210
I'm gonna blow my nose on. It doesn't look
like the biggest leak in the history of mankind.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.210
[laughter]

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.760
And so, it was achieved. We downloaded it
and decoded it and da-di-da-di-da, off we

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.870
went. OK. I just wanted to stand back a bit
and make the points, which is that if you

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.820
compare what happens when you simply post
material on the internet to what happens when

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:34.299
journalists deal with it, you can see that
we bring value to it.

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:41.139
In the first place, what he was handing us
was raw data. And what we did was to find

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:48.159
meaning in it, what we would call stories.
This was just an endless log of tiny incidents.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:52.399
And it's only when you word search it for--.
We started off, for example, searching for

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:53.450
civilian casualty.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:58.580
And we found examples of civilian causalities
which hadn't been reported. That's to say,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.970
Afghan civilians killed by coalition forces.
And we discovered that they use one of those

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.860
wonderful US euphemisms. They called it an
'escalation of force' when they murder the

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.899
family trying to fight through a checkpoint
or something.

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:13.509
So we started searching on 'escalation of
force'. And while we were looking at that,

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:18.100
you see, as you pull that together you're
beginning to get a picture, story, meaning.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.730
We also came across references to civilians
sometimes being killed by a particular outfit

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.130
called Task Force 3-7-2.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:30.019
So, if my particular job was to research TF372,
and they turned out to be a unit which was--at

00:31:30.019 --> 00:31:34.549
least part of its function--was to assassinate
people, which I think in any country in the

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:39.220
world remains illegal. But they were going
out and targeting Taliban leaders in villages

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.220
and killing them.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.860
And very often in the process of killing them,
they would kill the dozen nearest civilians

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:50.120
to them. So, there were details in there.
So, you're converting raw data into stories

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.789
by finding meaning, patterns. So that's the
first thing we did. The second thing is that

00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:56.539
to some extent, we were able to check.

00:31:56.539 --> 00:32:00.779
So there was an underlying question here.
Is it possible that this material is completely

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:08.130
phony? That somebody is trying to set up Julian
Assange and WikiLeaks and/or us? And this

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.049
is all bullshit and when we publish it we're
gonna be the world's greatest laughing stock.

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:16.090
After The Guardian- New York Times alliance
was formed, about a week later, Der Spiegel

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.850
for various reasons came on board. And that
was a good fluke because it turned out that

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:26.910
they could get access to a massive US military
material, which had been provided to the German

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:30.630
Parliament in order to debate the future of
their involvement in Afghanistan.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:36.100
And I believe what they did was to take random
time slices and compare the material that

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.640
the German Parliament had with the material
which we'd been given. And there was 100%

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.730
overlap. So, we were able to check that it
was authentic. So, the second thing we give

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.070
after meaning is credibility. I've forgotten
the other two.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.070
[laughter]

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:57.130
Oh, I know. This is very important. [chuckling]
The third thing we do. So, meaning, credibility.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.960
The third is that we can make the material
safe. Now, very, very early on, within 24

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.561
hours, the journalists who were dealing with
this, that's me and a couple of others at

00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:11.030
The Guardian, very quickly realized that there
was some material in this Afghan database

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.200
which we couldn't publish.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.380
It would be unsafe. There were actually two
different kinds. Some of it was operational

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:21.570
detail about how coalition forces do their
job, which might expose them to attack by

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:26.090
the Taliban. You don't want dead soldiers
on your hands. Not at all.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.340
The other was that it was clear that there
were reports which described US military units

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:36.799
going into villages, which were named, and
identifiable individuals giving them assistance.

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:39.360
It might be quite low grade, just to say,
"Yes. The Taliban were here last night.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.299
There was a group of them. They stayed in
that house and we know they've gone on to

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:47.809
that village." And the fear was if you publish
that then some old guy with a white beard

00:33:47.809 --> 00:33:52.340
who is identified is gonna be dragged out
of his house and have his throat cut. And

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.570
you can't do that.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:59.269
Right. This became a huge problem because
I was responsible for liaising with Julian.

00:33:59.269 --> 00:34:04.150
And about three days into this whole thing,
I raised it with him at a follow-up meeting

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:09.290
in Stockholm. And he said a most extraordinary
thing. He said, "If an Afghan civilian helps

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:11.940
the coalition forces then he deserves to die."

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:17.389
And he went on to explain that he regarded
them as collaborators, informers. Now, this

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.940
was a--. Then other journalists had similar
conversations with him. It became a running

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:26.339
problem throughout the period of research.
And the problem is partly a moral one. You

00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:28.310
can't publish stuff that gets people killed.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.290
It's also a political one. If we're going
to make this alliance with The New York Times,

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.919
fend off all forms of attack within the information
war, what you can't do is publish stuff that

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:38.069
gets people killed.

00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:41.600
If you think the main form of attack we were
anticipating here was propaganda, PR that

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.280
would be fired at us and we were saying to
each other weeks before publication, we know

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.790
exactly what the Americans will say, they
will say 'by publishing this information,

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.159
you are helping terrorists'.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.210
It's perfectly clear. That's the obvious thing
they're going to say. And it doesn't matter

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:59.329
if they say that because we're not. We're
telling the world about civilian casualties

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:04.050
and murder units and all these other things
that genuinely they need to know. We're not

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.050
helping terrorists.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:10.710
But, if he puts stuff on his website, which
gets people killed or could conceivably get

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:15.130
people killed, then we start to lose the information
war. Can you see? It's such a powerful PR

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.099
line. Such a powerful stick to beat us with.
And right at the end, in the last week before

00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:25.540
we published he agreed to withhold 15,000
documents from this huge cache of 93 on the

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.970
basis that that would protect people whose
names were in there.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.450
We publish. For 48 hours, it was extremely
exciting. You could almost hear the world

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:38.339
talking about these issues which we were raising,
these stories which we had found. And that's

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:41.140
why journalists are journalists. You want
impact. It was very exciting.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.420
And I think it was on day three that The London
Times, owned by Rupert Murdock, hostile to

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.780
The Guardian, published a front-page story
in which they said, "We have found material

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.520
on the WikiLeaks website which can clearly
get people in Afghanistan killed."

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.829
And then the whole story started to unwind
as this powerful PR machine moved in. And

00:35:58.829 --> 00:36:02.930
then they encapsulated it in a single line,
"WikiLeaks have got blood on their hands."

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.670
Now, it has to be said that we do not know
of any case of anybody actually being killed.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:13.960
But in political terms, in PR terms, the damage
was done. The fact that there was material

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:19.109
there that could get people killed was extremely
damaging. And we started to lose ground in

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:23.310
the information war. OK. So, what I'm saying
is we can give it meaning.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.190
We can give it credibility. And we can make
material safe. Nothing that we published has

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:32.570
ever been said to have jeopardized anybody's
life. And the final thing that we do is that

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:38.260
we give it impact. That The Guardian's website
now is getting 50 million unique users a month.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:43.810
The New York Times is a higher number. Der
Spiegel is enormous. It's been up 120 million.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:48.970
So, when you publish simultaneously on those
three websites you hit an awful lot of people.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:52.880
And then in the wonderful world of the internet,
it carries on. So, I'll stop talking and let

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.599
you, but I just want to summarize it.

00:36:56.599 --> 00:37:07.829
Here's how I see it. Any medium of communication
is liable to be abused. When I was a child,

00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:11.550
the first television set started appearing
in sitting rooms. This is in the mid-1950s

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:15.730
in the United Kingdom. And all the Mamas and
the Papas said, "Isn't it a wonderful thing?

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.020
Now our children will be educated."

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:23.610
And now, television is full of shit, isn't
it? It's full of low-rate, lowest common denominator

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:29.940
commercialized garbage and a little bit of
good stuff. In the same way, I believe our

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:36.310
perception of the internet will change. To
see it as in many ways an information sewer.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:42.650
It picks up and distributes falsehood just
as far and just as fast as it picks up and

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:48.000
distributes truth. And nobody checks. And
nobody makes sure it's safe. It's just out

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.760
there. I don't suppose we'll get to talk about
this now but it's a microcosm of that.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.510
The second chapter in this WikiLeaks saga
is what happened in Stockholm when Julian

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:02.640
Assange had a dispute with two women, which
led to their going to the police. And that's

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.000
the simple truth about that. A dispute between
one man and two women who were supporters

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.410
of WikiLeaks, who adored Julian.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.400
Something went wrong between them and they
went to the police. Now, I do not claim to

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.740
know what went on in those bedrooms. I wouldn't
begin to say that Julian has committed a crime.

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.990
I don't know the facts and I don't understand
the law. But what I'll tell you is this.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:29.140
All of the claims that that incident is in
some way the result of a conspiracy by the

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:34.770
Pentagon, or the CIA, or dark forces that
it's something to do with dirty tricks, all

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:42.839
of that is built on a series of statements,
every single one of which is false. And that's

00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:43.839
the microcosm of it.

00:38:43.839 --> 00:38:48.869
Those statements have run through the internet,
particularly through Twitter, being conveyed

00:38:48.869 --> 00:38:51.850
by people who don't give a damn whether or
not they're telling the truth. They don't

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.369
give a damn about whether they destroy people's
lives. The damage that has been done to the

00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:00.920
reputation of those two women who've been
widely smeared, but one of them in particular

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.150
as a CIA agent.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:07.240
Two of them have been smeared as guess what?
Feminists. Can you imagine anything more appalling?

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.480
How those women will survive in emotional
terms, or professional terms, I do not know.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.770
It's been disgusting to watch it. Really,
really offensive.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.770
And then what is particularly offensive to
me, coming back to "Flat Earth News" is of

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:23.310
course, that started flooding into the mainstream
media as well. Just as a single example, I

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.930
must stop talking, in amongst the many falsehoods
that have been put out about that incident

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.690
by Julian Assange and his closest supporters,
which includes his lawyers in Sweden, where

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:37.060
he was found guilty of misleading the London
court, a simple, simple thing.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:43.220
He stood up and said in various television
interviews, "This smear against me is so effective

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:50.750
that three out of every four pages on the
internet which mentions my name, also mentions

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:55.900
the word rape." Now, how long would it take
any human being Tweeting, or any journalist

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.670
writing a story to check that?

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.540
Less than a minute to use your search engine.
There's Julian Assange and the last time I

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.240
did it, there was something like 37 million
references. So, if three out of four pages

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.940
also include the word rape, when you add that
you're gonna get something like, what is that?

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:15.260
About 29, 28 million. And do know what I got?
Two. So it's an exaggeration ten-fold. But

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:20.050
that simple statement so easy to check ran
everywhere in the internet because nobody

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:24.910
out there is even attempting to check. They
don't give a damn. And it ran through the

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.270
mainstream media because we don't check enough.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:32.809
But compare the two really rather lousy performances.
I'd bag the journalists over the internet

00:40:32.809 --> 00:40:38.339
any time. OK. Thanks for listening to me.

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:39.339
[applause]

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:50.109
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We'd love to see you when
you're fully fit. [chuckles] Great. We've

00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:54.720
got about 20 minutes for some questions. I
just wanted to kick off with one question,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.280
taking you back to journalism.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.059
I think all of us recognize the problem that
you're describing. I think the question is

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:06.480
who is to blame for this situation? And in
short terms, am I to blame? Or are you to

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.089
blame? I would suggest that journalism has
it. Journalism newspapers have a great deal

00:41:12.089 --> 00:41:13.089
of responsibility.

00:41:13.089 --> 00:41:19.150
If you see any story written about Google,
negative or positive, you will see about a

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:24.589
thousand replications of our story around
the world in which you describe. And it seems

00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:30.440
to me that journalists are wasting an awful
lot of time just duplicating massive amounts

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.880
of stories.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.470
Wouldn't it be far, far better to perhaps
take modest use from one simpler source and

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:39.160
then spend more of your time digging in and
doing good stories, pulling resources--. Who's

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.910
to blame for this problem?

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.800
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: You're like a bloody journalist
tucking two stories into one.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.800
[laughter]

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.710
Two questions. No. So, the first question
is who's to blame? I think I see in the balance

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:58.079
of things, it is more the journalists than
the PR machine. I mean, if PR is actually

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:00.800
lying, then I think we should give them a
great big moral kicking.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.060
Where all they're doing is to select the truths,
I think that we should be in a position where

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.180
we say, "Actually, we're not interested in
the story. You've chosen to serve up for us

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.280
today with these pretty little quotes and
photographs and everything neatly arranged

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.280
for us.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.950
We're going out and finding our own stories."
And occasionally, there will be an overlap.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.110
We'll take your story 'cause in our judgment,
that's what people need to know. But because

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:24.480
of our vulnerability, all this structural
problems I'm talking about, we fail to do

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.910
that. So, we fail to defend ourselves against
you.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:33.290
And I think we're structurally likely to be
manipulated by you. So, it's not the fault

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.329
of the individual journalist. Journalism is
full of good people doing a bad job because

00:42:36.329 --> 00:42:41.869
they work for bad organizations. But the bad
organizations are bad because of those commercial

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:42.869
problems.

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:44.180
What was the other thing? Oh, yeah. And I
think we could make life a bit better if we

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:48.140
were a bit more honest with you. The obvious
thing we should do is that when we receive

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.660
a story that's running on one of these wires,
news wires, watches or whatever, we should

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.869
simply take it and put it in the paper.

00:42:54.869 --> 00:42:59.869
But what we do is we take it and then rewrite
it and put a staff reporter's name on the

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:04.630
top of it and then put it in the paper. Now,
that is A: a complete waste of time, as you're

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.140
suggesting, and B: it is also dishonest in
respect of our readers because we haven't

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.490
been out and gathered this story.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.490
We haven't checked it. I mean we might conceivably
have made one phone call and tack a quote

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:18.040
on the end, but why bother? I agree with you.
I would like to see a world in which we said,

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.741
"OK. There's a bunch of stories that everybody's
covering, so we'll just run the agency. So

00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:25.410
that frees up our time to go out and find
some other stories which are much more important

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.450
that really reflect the values of the paper."

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:31.710
It's very distressing to see the way that
the newspaper's focus in on a tiny number

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:36.700
of stories and all report the same stories,
while failing to cover masses of other stuff

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.780
which is fascinating and interesting and important.
You ask yourself for example what's happening

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:46.951
in the reporting of the UK at the moment of
the poor.

00:43:46.951 --> 00:43:51.319
So, depending on how you measure it statistically,
between 20 and 25% , probably the population

00:43:51.319 --> 00:43:55.089
of this country can reasonably be described
as poor. There was a report recently about

00:43:55.089 --> 00:43:59.000
how 27% of the children in Manchester are
living in not just poverty, but severe poverty.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.369
That means not enough food. That means improper
clothing. How much time do we spend reporting

00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:09.500
the lives of that fifth through a quarter
of the population? Almost none. The Guardian

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.790
I think uniquely has a reporter who is dedicated
to covering poverty in this country.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.400
And that's good for The Guardian, but it's
not nearly good enough. I think we should

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.819
have at least a fifth of our staff out there.
Whereas we cover the world of the rich, look

00:44:21.819 --> 00:44:26.790
at all the celebrity bullshit and OK and Hello
and all these people are pumping it out through

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.090
PR so it's designed to make them look like
better people.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:33.200
It needs to use a technique that's especially
bullshit. So, I would love it if we would

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.359
run more agency copy, free up time, go out
and find different stories, not the ones that

00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:38.880
everybody else is running.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.300
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Right. Here's a question.
Sir. Go ahead.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:49.099
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Right early on,
you mentioned that 12% of stories showing

00:44:49.099 --> 00:44:50.540
that they had their facts checked.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.540
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Right.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.280
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: How do you distinguish
between someone who has checked their facts

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:02.310
thoroughly 97 times and not included, not
cited their sources or not included references?

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:09.140
I mean, in scientific journalism, it's very
common in the paper that people actually want

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.430
to see who you've called to check those.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.410
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: It's a good question. And because
I didn't do this, the academics in Cardiff

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.800
did it, I don't have a particularly good answer
for you. But I can answer it in this way.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.490
That when we published the book, most of the
newspapers in Fleet Street went berserk and

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:30.270
were extremely aggressive in trying to pull
it apart. And they particularly attacked,

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.070
or tried to attack, the research that had
been done by these four academics in Cardiff.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.220
And they never laid a glove on them.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.470
I mean, there was an awful lot of hot air
and insult, but they were not able in any

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:45.280
case to say, "Look. Here's a story which you've
logged as being unchecked, but in fact it

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.530
was." But how quite the detail of the methodology,
I don't know.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:56.530
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Hi. Thanks for
giving a new synonym for blogging, journalism.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:57.530
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: What was that?

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.210
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Blogging. The technical
industry is full of what you're describing.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.660
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: The tech industry, yes.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.839
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: The tech blogging
industry. So, you know this is kind of a recent

00:46:04.839 --> 00:46:09.380
example. So what I'm thinking about is that
what was it like in the 1800s?

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.040
What was it like in the 1700s? Is this a new
phenomenon in journalism, or are we losing

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.870
our touch over a few hundred years or before
that? I mean, Rome must have had something

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.870
similar.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.599
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: What do you mean? Is our tendency
to put out stories which are false or distorted

00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:24.599
new?

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:25.599
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Yeah.

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:28.520
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: The pattern has shifted. So,
if you go back to the 17th or the 18th Century

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.339
when the term hack was invented, journalists
basically had press cards for the same reason

00:46:34.339 --> 00:46:36.609
as police officers in Kenya wear uniforms.

00:46:36.609 --> 00:46:40.980
It's a means of extracting money from people.
So they would sell themselves to politicians.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.800
If you give me enough money, I'll write a
story in your favor. It was completely financially

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.280
corrupt. Now, financial corruption among journalists
is very, very unusual now.

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.230
I can think of one case that was going on
in the New York Post that was very--. So it's

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:59.530
changed. If you go through the long era where
William Randolph Hearst kind of proprietor,

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:04.369
Beaverbrook, these were often people who owned
newspapers for political reasons.

00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:09.070
Beaverbrook was completely explicit that he
owned papers like The Daily Express in order

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:14.000
to make propagandas. So these are very politicized
owners. And so therefore, the world isn't

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.390
necessarily a better place, but it is very
much a different place.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:22.050
And what happens is that that generation of
politicized propagandists gets replaced by

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:26.570
these big corporations whose primary interests
is commercial, not political. And therefore,

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:33.270
the nature of the damage they do is different.
So, it would be extremely difficult to quantify

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:37.119
which was the age of least reliable information.

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:41.100
We don't have the raw material going back
over those years. But it's very important

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.900
to recognize that it's different because most
MPs, when they talk about what's wrong with

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.770
the press, are still using the Beaverbrook/Hearst
model. They still think it's to do with proprietors

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.020
telling us to write false things.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.660
And it isn't. Therefore, any solution that
they might come up with, for example to do

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.960
with how many owners own the press, will miss
the point. I've said in the book that it wouldn't

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.180
matter if Rupert Murdock resigned and was
replaced by Rupert Bear. His newspapers would

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.740
carry on, publishing false stories because
it's structural.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.230
[whispers] PR.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.230
[laughter]

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:15.710
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I'm interested
in your thoughts on the phone hacking scandal.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:20.920
And in particular, it seemed to me that the
story got stuck until The New York Times got

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:26.619
invested in it and moved it on. And why did
it take a US organization to move on a British

00:48:26.619 --> 00:48:27.619
scandal?

00:48:27.619 --> 00:48:31.780
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: OK. You're right. So, we started
publishing stories about the phone hacking

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:38.200
in July '09. And we were met with a combination
of two things. First, from almost all of Fleet

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.140
Street, complete silence.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.109
No other newspaper wanted to run this story
because most of them also had been doing similarly

00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:48.950
illegal things, and/or they supported the
Tory party and didn't want to upset Coulson.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.180
The second thing that we were confronted with
was, as I mentioned before, lies.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:56.859
There was some really bitter lying told by
News International and a great deal of concealment

00:48:56.859 --> 00:49:00.940
from Scotland Yard and from the Press Complaints
Commission. So, we kept publishing stories.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.520
I would think that between July '09, when
we published the first one and September 2010,

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.950
when the New York Times published, we probably
ran 20 or 30 stories.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.460
And we were beginning to tear holes in the
official version of events. But it was just

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:20.220
us. And we felt not just that we weren't having
an impact, but also that we were politically

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.770
very isolated. We were still very vulnerable
to the smears and lies that were going on.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:29.849
So, I would've told you this some time ago,
but as things become public, my editor contacted

00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:34.480
the editor of the New York Times, Bill Keller,
and said, "Look. There's this fantastic story

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.430
here. It's got the Royal Family. It's got
private investigators. It's got tabloid journalists.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.900
It's got law-breaking. It's got useless cops.
It's a great story." So, they then sent people

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.760
over, a team of three who spent five months
working on it. And again, it's all right to

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.950
say this now. I think it doesn't matter, but
I briefed them endlessly. I mean, I was giving

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.750
them so much information they started calling
me Nikipedia, 'cause I was the go to source.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.750
[laughter]

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:01.210
So, we worked on it together. And they were
very good journalists. They did a very good

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.470
job. And there were two things that happened.
A: to my great relief, they confirmed that

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:08.670
what we had been saying was true 'cause there
was always the horrible risk that they say,

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.780
"Actually, you've got this completely wrong."

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.390
And they came up with several bits of new
information. Crucially, do you remember they

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:17.000
got one--. I had about a dozen News of the
World journalists who were talking to me,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.580
but all off the record, terrified of losing
their careers. And they got this guy, Sean

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:26.400
Hoare, who's a lovely bloke, to come on the
record and say Andy Coulson, the Prime Minister's

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.640
right hand man, knew about this.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:32.940
Now that's a brave guy. And he got smeared
'cause he had a problem with alcohol abuse.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:37.339
So, instantly they bring that out and start
trying to damage his reputation. But anyway,

00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:41.650
so I don't think it would be fair to say it
took an American news organization to do the

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:44.770
job because it was a partnership between the
two of us.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:48.270
It was more a question of spreading the story
out. And since then, if other journalists

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:54.950
come to me for help, I help them without limit
really because I don't want The Guardian to

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.770
be isolated. And what really counts is getting
the truth out. And now, we're on a roll. I

00:50:58.770 --> 00:50:59.770
mean, they're in retreat. Does that answer
the question?

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.130
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: It does, but why
didn't you publicize the cooperation then?

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:07.730
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Because, I said in brackets
that I don't mind doing it now, but I wouldn't

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:14.030
have done at the time, we were working in
a very hostile, very political landscape.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:19.661
And one of the things that the News International
was saying was, "Oh, well this is just The

00:51:19.661 --> 00:51:20.661
Guardian.

00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:23.470
They're liberal. Ignore them." And they were
winding up Tory MPs to attack us and they

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:27.880
were saying that to the--. There was an irony
here that they were complaining that the only

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:34.599
MPs who were complaining about the phone hacking
were Labor MPs. But that was because being

00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:37.640
somewhat politically motivated, they had targeted
Labor MPs.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.910
Therefore, they were the victims. Of course
they were most likely to complain. So, at

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:47.270
the time, we didn't say the New York Times
have been working in partnership with us because

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.630
it would have left us isolated with one other
party. But as it was, we got through that

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:51.630
phase. Do you think that was wrong?

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:52.630
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I think it brings
up the question about transparency.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:53.630
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Yeah, 'cause you see--.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.910
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: The WikiLeaks stuff
was very public about the cooperation, so

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:01.099
you knew who all was working on it.

00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:04.920
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Well, yes and no. See, I don't
think journalism is necessarily transparent.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:08.591
It's a game. One of the differences--. Julian
talks about scientific journalism.

00:52:08.591 --> 00:52:12.190
Everything, all sources must be disclosed.
That doesn't work at all. I spend most of

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:16.619
my life working off the record. I've got so
many secrets in my head I've stopped talking

00:52:16.619 --> 00:52:17.619
to myself.

00:52:17.619 --> 00:52:18.619
[laughter]

00:52:18.619 --> 00:52:22.090
So, and you have to be able to work off the
record and say to people, "You're my source,

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.650
but I won't disclose it." And in a sense,
that was what was going on between what the

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.740
New York Times and The Guardian.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:30.390
To some extent, we were a source of information
for them. They then went off and did their

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:36.030
own work and discovered several crucial things,
particularly Sean Hoare, that we hadn't got.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.140
So we were an off the record source for them,
except that now we--.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:43.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: PR company. It was effectively
a PR company, except that they were checking.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.920
Sir.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:51.599
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: So, the statistics
of 12% of stories appear to be fact-checked.

00:52:51.599 --> 00:52:56.970
Do you think, or maybe you have facts or at
least you have an opinion, that that implies

00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:01.359
that there's some core group of one in eight
journalists are very good and they almost

00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:03.319
always fact check and everyone else is terrible?

00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:09.690
Or is it closer to the other end of almost
everybody only fact checks--?

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.990
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: I would think--. I mean it's
not a question we tried to answer, but based

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:20.420
on my experience in newsrooms, I would say
the answer is it's circumstantial. I don't

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.359
know very many people who went into journalism
just to fuck up and tell lies.

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:27.950
People go into journalism. Actually, it's
one of the few good things that's happening

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:34.200
in our profession. It still attracts very
bright, energetic, idealistic people who want

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.810
to tell the truth about important things.
And so, if you give them the chance they will

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.810
do.

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.760
So, I don't know, in a random kind of way
on Monday morning they get a chance to do

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.170
their story properly. They get the whole day
to work on it. And they produce something

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:48.290
good. On Tuesday, they give them five stories
in a single shift and they don't know whether

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:49.400
they're coming or going.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:52.980
It's random. Just depends on the circumstances
in the newsroom I would think.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.700
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: I was gonna ask,
you talk about shifting patterns and two quick

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:59.119
questions. You talk about shifting patterns
in journalism. Where do you see this changing

00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:00.869
in the next five years?

00:54:00.869 --> 00:54:06.940
And the second question is we all know about
the phone hacking scandal. We all know the

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:12.220
sort of garbage that Fox spits out and yet,
the viewership, the readership of The Sun's

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:17.430
just increased. People watch more and more
Fox News. How can you explain this from the

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:18.430
consumer point of view?

00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:19.430
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: What was the first question
you asked me?

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.010
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: The first one is
the future of journalism in five years.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.192
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Oh, not a big subject at all.

00:54:23.192 --> 00:54:24.192
[laughter]

00:54:24.192 --> 00:54:28.510
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #5: What's the role
of the journalist in five years? And the second

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:29.510
question is--.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.799
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: Why are these things so popular,
the crass? Yeah, OK. So, let's take the first

00:54:32.799 --> 00:54:36.650
thing first. See the future of journalism
under two headings. If you look at it purely

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.730
from a journalist's point of view, you couldn't
work in a more exciting time by comparison.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:46.050
Before the internet came along, I wrote stories
for a newspaper which maybe printed 400 thousand

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:50.880
copies. And within 24 hours, that story had
gone. Now, we've got these 50 million unique

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.820
users hitting the website and furthermore,
my story is there forever as far as we know.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.940
So the potential impact is great. It's really,
really exciting. If my editor was here, he

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.680
would underline what he calls the mutuality
of journalism, by which he means cooperation

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.480
between the professional journalists at the
core and the whole network of readers and

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:12.600
others who can work with us on stories using
Twitter or crowd-sourcing or whatever it is.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.530
So, I think journalistically, it's the most
exciting time in the history of the profession.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:22.840
But, heading number two, commercial. We're
in terrible, terrible trouble. So, you probably

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:28.400
know if the internet relentlessly takes away
our readers to websites which give news or

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.150
pseudo-news for free, therefore they won't
pay to buy newspapers.

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:36.791
And if what you're trying to sell is general
news, they also won't pay to read it on a

00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:40.240
website. The only exceptions to that are when
news organizations sell highly specialized

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.950
information which isn't available elsewhere.
So our income from our readers is drifting

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:45.950
down.

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.309
Every single newspaper in this country. Almost
every newspaper in the developed world. And

00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:55.970
in addition, possibly even worse, we're losing
our advertising revenue. So, there was a single

00:55:55.970 --> 00:56:00.750
12-month period recently where The Guardian
lost 25% of its advertising income, just as

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:01.750
an example.

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:05.460
The biggest employer in Europe is the National
Health Service. That used to be, I think I'm

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.210
right in saying, our biggest, single source
of advertising. Whenever the NHS wanted to

00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.250
hire a doctor or a nurse or administrator,
they would advertise in the quality press.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:16.780
That's big, big bucks. Now they have a website
and they put it out there. It doesn't cost

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:21.090
them anything and they precisely reach the
market that they're after. If the NHS are

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:24.262
watching, I think it's a very bad policy.

00:56:24.262 --> 00:56:25.262
[laughter]

00:56:25.262 --> 00:56:28.180
It's a very, very strange time because what
I'm trying to describe is the internet has

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.920
broken our business model. And nobody knows
what a future business model for journalism

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.920
looks like.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.260
And yet at the same time, we're all having
a party because it's a fantastic time to be

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.329
a journalist. So, it could be, I don't think
in five yearsâ€™ time. I think if you look

00:56:40.329 --> 00:56:45.730
20 years into the future, it is conceivable
that journalism will be dead, that the profession

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:47.901
won't exist anymore because there won't be
a business model to sustain it.

00:56:47.901 --> 00:56:52.040
There is no God-given rule that professions
have to survive. When was the last time you

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.690
came across an arrow maker, who used to be
quite big chaps? So, and if there's a business

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:00.220
model out there, if any of you can see it,
tell us 'cause we're looking.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.099
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: To be honest, a whole other
subject. I hope you can get us back to debate

00:57:04.099 --> 00:57:05.099
that subject for a sec.

00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:09.789
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: There's something about popularity.
Well, there's been a seismic cultural shift,

00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:14.540
hasn't there? Really since 1979 in the way
that people perceive themselves in the world.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.000
I mean, it's shifted away from people thinking
about themselves politically.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.119
So when I was at university, it was commonplace
to talk about class and capitalism, even in

00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:27.140
the mainstream media. It was commonplace to
hear people define themselves in social terms.

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:32.569
I'm working class. I'm a trade unionist. And
all this has drifted down and being replaced

00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:36.770
by people's perception of themselves as consumers
and their interests in the world have changed

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:37.770
accordingly.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:41.500
And so, because of their commercial organizations,
the kind of subject matter which we cover

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:46.880
has changed away from--roughly speaking--political
news towards entertainment stuff--Big Brother

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.750
and reality shows and soap operas and celebrities.
You get a huge shift.

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:57.510
And that's something to do with Thatcherism
and Reaganism the destruction of socialism.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:02.589
I would say that the fact that socialism has
been taken out of the mainstream is absolutely

00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:07.099
crucial part of that big shift. So you've
now got a demand for pseudo-news, for news

00:58:07.099 --> 00:58:09.560
as entertainment, for garbage instead of the
real thing.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:14.800
That leaves a significant minority of the
population, probably all the people in this

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.160
room, who care about the world and want to
know the truth about it. So, it would be wrong

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:23.950
to paint the whole world as having gone down
the drain in that way. There's still a significant

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:25.809
minority who we're trying to reach.

00:58:25.809 --> 00:58:30.730
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #6: Just thinking about
the role of journalists, it seems as if journalists

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:35.490
are required to do more things these days
than they used to be, like print journalists

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:41.270
who maybe used to have to know how to do shorthand
and type, now maybe having to use content

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:42.640
management systems and so on.

00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:48.069
TV journalists are having to maybe edit their
own material or film themselves. Do you think

00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:52.670
that's true and if so, if you think that's
had a good or a bad effect on the reliability

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:55.280
of having to spend time fact checking?

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.589
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: It's a problem. It's particularly
clear in television news where it used to

00:58:59.589 --> 00:59:04.319
be the case the reporter would go out with
a cameraman and a sound man and then once

00:59:04.319 --> 00:59:07.869
they put together their piece, that would
be edited back at base by somebody else.

00:59:07.869 --> 00:59:14.290
That reporter will certainly no longer have
a sound man. He may be carrying his own camera

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.990
and then he's expected to edit his own footage.
The result? He has even less time to do his

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:22.049
work properly. Even less chance that he'll
go out and find a significant fact that hasn't

00:59:22.049 --> 00:59:25.940
already been reported and even less chance
that he'll check those facts that he is collecting.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.480
And that's driven by commercial--. It's a
good example of commercial considerations

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:37.360
damaging the editorial function.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:45.200
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you have a last question?

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Is the story over
for Andy Coulson or is there more to come?

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.200
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: On the phone hacking?

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.200
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #7: Yeah. Does his
departure effectively answer that kind of

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200
consequence?

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: No. So, if you can measure
it in terms of time span, we're probably about

00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.010
two-thirds of the way through the phone hacking
saga. It's got another 12 to 15 months to

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:56.829
run. And the engine that's now driving it
is no longer The Guardian.

00:59:56.829 --> 01:00:02.240
It's the new police operation. Operation Weeting
at Scotland Yard, which finally, finally has

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.560
done what the two predecessors failed to do.
It's put serious resources in. It's there

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:11.000
to take on the most powerful news organization
in the world. And it's investigating. Now,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.940
we don't know whether they will come up with
evidence that shows that Andy Coulson was

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.410
in any way complicit in crime.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:21.990
And it's important to say that we haven't
found that evidence and that as things stand,

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:26.369
he's an innocent man. But if anybody is going
to do that, it's going to be Operation Weeting,

01:00:26.369 --> 01:00:27.687
who I now trust. I didn't trust it when it
was set up, but I now trust them. I think

01:00:27.687 --> 01:00:29.599
that they're doing a straight job with a lot
of resources.

01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:39.380
If it turns out that Andy Coulson was guilty
of complicity in crime, then that will reflect

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.000
to some extent on the Prime Minister. I don't
think it'll reflect quite as much as some

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.799
back bench Labor MPs want it to, but certainly
they'd be entitled to say, "Well, your judgment

01:00:47.799 --> 01:00:54.619
wasn't that great. And for Christ's sake,
this guy had resigned for this scandal. Shouldn't

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:55.619
you have checked?"

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:57.270
So there'll be some questions, but I wouldn't
have thought they'd be particularly powerful

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.270
or lethal.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.470
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you very, very much
indeed, Nick. We got some low value PR freebie.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.859
I don't know if it'll suit you in any way
whatsoever, but thank you so much.

01:01:05.859 --> 01:01:14.750
&gt;&gt;Nick Davies: I'm so moved. Thank you.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.010
[applause]
