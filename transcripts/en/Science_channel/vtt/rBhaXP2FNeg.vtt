00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.834
Narrator: AIR HOCKEY
WAS DEVELOPED

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:08.334
IN THE LATE '60'S
AND EARLY '70'S

00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:11.300
BY A GROUP OF AMERICAN
BILLIARD ENGINEERS.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.000
WHEN IN PLAY, THE PUCK FLOATS
ON A THIN CUSHION OF AIR

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.334
PROPELLED BY PLAYERS
AT EACH END.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:20.467
WITH NO FRICTION,
THE PUCK MOVES FAST,

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.634
MAKING AIR HOCKEY
A HIGH-SPEED GAME.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:28.667
IN A GAME OF AIR HOCKEY, THE
PUCK LEVITATES EVER SO SLIGHTLY,

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.234
MADE POSSIBLE BY A CONSTANT
FLOW OF AIR

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:34.868
FLOWING THROUGH PERFORATIONS
IN THE PLAYFIELD.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.267
THE PLAYFIELD IS MADE FROM
A LAMINATED COMPOSITE MATERIAL

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:40.901
THAT'S BEEN PRINTED
WITH AIR-HOCKEY GRAPHICS.

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:46.868
A COMPUTERIZED DRILL CUTS INTO
THREE PLAYFIELDS AT ONCE

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:48.801
IN THE SAME
CONSISTENT PATTERN.

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:55.267
THE SIZE OF THE HOLES ARE
A LITTLE LARGER THAN PIN HOLES,

00:00:55.267 --> 00:01:00.801
CREATING OVER 4,600 PERFORATIONS
IN EACH AIR-HOCKEY PLAYFIELD.

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:07.133
AN AUTOMATED TOOL
CARVES GROOVES

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:11.300
IN A SHEET OF MEDIUM-DENSITY
FIBER BOARD.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.167
THE BOARD WILL SERVE AS A BASE
FOR THE PLAYFIELD.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.167
AIR WILL CIRCULATE
IN THE GROOVES,

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.300
AND EXIT THROUGH
THE PLAYFIELD HOLES.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.868
NEXT, SAWDUST IS BLASTED
OUT OF THE GROOVES.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:30.100
THE GROOVES' FIBERBOARD
MOVES THROUGH A GLUE APPLICATOR.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.467
THE RUBBER ROLLER
COATS THE TOP OF THE BOARD

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.267
WITH A SMALL
AMOUNT OF GLUE,

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:36.534
SO IT DOESN'T SEEP
INTO THE GROOVES.

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:43.133
AS THE BOARD EXITS, TECHNICIANS
MOVE THE BOARD ONTO A STACK.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.300
ONCE THE BOARD IS IN
THE CORRECT POSITION,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.534
THE LAMINATE IS APPLIED,

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:53.234
AND ALIGNED WITH THE GROOVES
IN THE FIBER BOARD.

00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:00.534
A CARDBOARD COVER IS PLACED
ON THE LAMINATE FOR PROTECTION

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:04.367
AS THE STACK
MOVES THROUGH A PRESS.

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.234
THE WEIGHT OF THE PRESS
SQUEEZES THE STACK TOGETHER,

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:10.167
ENSURING ADHESION
AS THE GLUE CURES.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.234
MEANWHILE, A CRAFTSWOMAN
APPLIES STICK-ON GRAPHICS

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:18.200
ONTO THE SIDE APRON BOARDS.

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.934
SHE OPENS A PRE-CUT SLOT
FOR A COIN DOOR,

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.100
AND EXPOSES A HOLE
FOR A BOLT.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.601
SHE CUTS OPEN A SLOT
FOR MAINTENANCE ACCESS,

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.434
AND REMOVES THE PANEL
THAT WILL SERVE AS A DOOR.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:40.734
SHE NUMBERS THE DOOR
AND THE SIDE APRON PIECE

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.801
SO SHE CAN MATCH THEM UP LATER
DURING INSTALLATION.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.567
AFTER APPLYING ARTWORK
TO THE END PANELS,

00:02:49.567 --> 00:02:52.701
ANOTHER TECHNICIAN ASSEMBLES
CURVED CORNER PARTS...

00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:58.133
...AND LINKS MENTAL BRACKETS
TO THE SIDE APRON PARTS.

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:03.334
HE INSTALLS A BRACKET
FOR A PUCK DEFLECTOR

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.434
IN THE CENTER
OF THE END PANEL...

00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:11.434
...AND SCREWS DOWN
THE CORNER CONNECTORS.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.868
HE SETS THE END PANELS
IN AN UPSIDE-DOWN POSITION

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.834
ON THE WORK SURFACE,

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.234
AND ATTACHES THE SIDE BOARDS
TO THE CORNER CONNECTORS.

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:28.000
THIS COMPLETES
THE TABLE APRON.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:34.467
A LOCKED DOOR IS INSTALLED
IN THE PLYWOOD FLOOR.

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:37.534
THIS WILL SERVE AS AN INTERIOR
STORAGE COMPARTMENT.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:44.734
NEXT, A CRAFTSMAN
INSTALLS THE COIN DOOR,

00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:46.601
AND SECURES IT
INTO PLACE.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:52.167
HE MOUNTS WIRE SPEAKERS
THAT PROJECTS SOUND EFFECTS

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:54.367
TO A COMPUTERIZED
OPTICAL SYSTEM

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:57.701
THAT TRACKS
THE PUCK'S MOVEMENTS.

00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:00.834
ONCE THE STRUCTURE
IS FITTED WITH WOODEN PANELS,

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:05.834
THE GAME'S FLASHING LIGHTS AND
SENSOR ACTIVATORS ARE INSTALLED.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.200
AT ANOTHER STATION,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.901
A TEAM FLIPS A PLAYFIELD OVER
TO WORK ON THE BACK.

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:15.234
ONE TECHNICIAN ATTACHES A BOARD
ABOVE THE OPEN GROOVES,

00:04:15.234 --> 00:04:17.267
CREATING A CHAMBER
FOR AIRFLOW.

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:23.734
THE MOTOR AND FAN ARE INSTALLED
OVER THE SMALL OPENING.

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:26.067
THIS SYSTEM WILL BLOW AIR
INTO THE GROOVES

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:29.834
AND THE PLAYFIELD
PERFORATIONS.

00:04:29.834 --> 00:04:31.667
THE PLAYFIELD
IS TURNED OVER,

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.267
AND LOWERED ONTO
THE TABLE STRUCTURE.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:38.767
NEXT, ALUMINUM BUMPERS ARE
ATTACHED TO THE TABLE'S BORDER

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.667
AS A BARRIER
FOR THE PUCK DURING PLAY.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:46.334
A TECHNICIAN INSTALLS GOAL PUCK
DEFLECTORS ON THE ENDS...

00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:53.801
...AND SCREWS IN METAL PLATES
OVER THE DEFLECTOR CUPS.

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.367
HE INSTALLS A LOCK
ON EACH GOAL COMPARTMENT,

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.300
SO NO ONE CAN
STEAL THE PUCK.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.767
FINALLY, THE AIR-HOCKEY TABLE
ASSEMBLY IS COMPLETE.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.601
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.
