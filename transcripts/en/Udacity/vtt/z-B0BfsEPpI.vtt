00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.904
Let me show you the app we're going
to create in this lesson called

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:04.728
Pitch Perfect.

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:07.097
Pitch Perfect allows you
to record your voice and

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:09.128
play it back with various sound effects.

00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:13.940
Including changes to speed,
pitch, and even reverb and echo.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.670
Let's run it on the iOS Simulator so
that I can show it to you.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.710
The first screen simply prompts
you to record your voice.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.543
Hear at Udacity,

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:26.600
we believe that asking questions
is one of the best ways to learn.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.280
Judge a man by his questions
rather than his answers.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.632
Now you can see Pitch Perfect has moved
us to the playback view where we can

00:00:38.632 --> 00:00:42.468
choose to playback my voice using
a variety of different sound effects.

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:46.548
Let's try listening to it really fast.

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:47.629
&gt;&gt; Judge a man by his questions.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.368
Rather than his answers.

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:52.793
&gt;&gt; How about what I would
sound like as Darth Vader.

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.373
Judge a man by his questions.

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:57.010
Rather than his answers.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.880
&gt;&gt; This app is a lot
of fun to play with.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.430
But more importantly, you will learn key
iOS development concepts along your way.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.860
It will also be the start of your
journey as an iOS developer.
