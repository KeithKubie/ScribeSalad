00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.320
- [Narrator] Who is the
Speaker of the House

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.370
and what do they do?

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.030
- The office of the Speaker of the House

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.560
is actually outlined in the Constitution.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.030
That's one of the things that makes

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.760
the Speaker of the House unique.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.550
The Speaker of the House
does not have to be

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.790
a member of the House
although there has never been

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.890
a Speaker who has not been
a member of the House.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.380
And traditionally the Speaker of the House

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.900
is the member picked
by the majority party.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.470
Doesn't have to be from the majority party

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.270
but that's always the way it's worked out

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.950
and essentially everybody
in the House gets together

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.403
and whoever gets the most
votes of the people voting.

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:32.780
It's just the people voting,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.240
not necessarily the entire House.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.430
Whoever gets the most votes becomes

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.680
the Speaker of the House.
