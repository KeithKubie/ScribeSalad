00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.302
With the Summer Olympic Games
only six weeks away,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.905
Brazil is worried because more
than two million tickets

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.408
remain unsold
and many are blaming fears

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.009
about the Zika virus.

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.311
Uh, Irish golfer Rory McIlroy
is the latest athlete

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.014
to say he'll be skipping
the Games.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.150
Now, yes, it's true there appear
to be a number of reasons

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.218
to be nervous
about visiting Brazil.

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.387
Like because
an Australian Paralympian

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.789
was mugged at gunpoint
this week,

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.824
or because half of Rio
de Janeiro's sewage is dumped

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.692
-into open waterways...
-(audience exclaims)

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:28.828
...or maybe 'cause Reuters
recently reported

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.696
on a drug-resistant
super-bacteria

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:31.964
on the triathlon beach,

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.699
or maybe the fact
their president is currently

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.568
being overthrown in an angry
political uprising...

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.270
-(laughter)
-or possibly because

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.006
the official national bird
is a Molotov cocktail,

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.909
-or...
-(laughter)

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.778
...possibly because the Olympic
mascot, an Amazonian jaguar,

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.080
escaped and had to be shot
by the army

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.681
-before it attacked people.
-(audience groans)

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.483
Not to mention, sometimes
there's piranhas,

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:53.152
uh, also malaria
and the fact that, perhaps,

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.687
the country may have invented
the killer bees.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.423
But it's gonna be fine.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.125
It's all gonna be fine.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.259
Don't worry.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.794
After all, Brazil...

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:04.230
Listen, guys,
Brazil gave us PelÃ©

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.632
-and pussy waxing and...
-(laughter, whooping)

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.502
and-and-and antivenin.

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:11.471
-Antivenin.
-(whooping)

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.974
(Hardwick laughs)

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.111
The guy with the snake looks way
more excited to be doing this

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.846
than she does to be doing that.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.547
We're trying
to stay positive here.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.449
We're very positive,
Brazil's a wonderful place,

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.985
is a beautiful nation,
plenty to offer the world.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.454
Please give me some other great
reasons to go to Brazil.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.689
Burnie Burns.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.224
At least you don't have
to smuggle in

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.126
your own performance-enhancing
drugs.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.460
HARDWICK:
Yeah. Perfect.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.095
It's already... already there.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.464
It's a positive.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.032
Gavin.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:42.101
Brazil is actually
ranked higher

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:44.504
than most countries
alphabetically.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.473
(laughter, applause)

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.442
Absolutely.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.979
Barbara.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.447
Uh, you can get a selfie
with a homeless guy

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.615
masturbating on the street.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.450
Yeah, perfect. Perfect.

00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.349
So, go to Brazil
and celebrate the Olympics.
