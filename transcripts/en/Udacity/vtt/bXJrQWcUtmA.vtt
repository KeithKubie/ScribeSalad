00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It accelerates slower. That's the reason we rolled balls down inclined planes to begin with.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Galileo needed to slow down motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now that we have an equation, we can really solve some interesting motion problems,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but we can't solve them all just yet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, this equation only describes an object that starts at rest.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What if Galileo decided to throw this ball off the leaning tower?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or what if he decided to throw it at an angle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, now we're in the realm of 2-dimensional motion.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In the rest of this unit we'll talk about how to solve these problems.
