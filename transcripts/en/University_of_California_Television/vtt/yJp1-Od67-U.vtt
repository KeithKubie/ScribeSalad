00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:04.868
(soft music)

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.120
- Almost exactly 35 years ago,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120
I had the opportunity to
give several lectures here,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.810
same auditorium I think

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.033
on the topic language and mind.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.620
And quite a lot has been
learned in the intervening years

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.570
about language and the brain,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.570
hence the mind in the sense
in which I used the term then,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.980
the term mind, and mental and such terms.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.387
And those lectures,

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:07.220
(audience member speaking off mic)

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.810
Pardon.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.055
Aw, thank you.

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:11.270
(all laughing)

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.883
And we'll continue to use them now,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.640
always nice to have a
friend in the audience.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.800
(audience laughing)

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.170
I'm using these terms as
just descriptive terms

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.010
for certain aspects of the world,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.140
pretty much on a par with
such descriptive terms

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.140
as a chemical or optical
electrical, and so on.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.920
These are terms used to focus attention

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.900
on particular aspects of the world

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.900
that seem to have a rather
integrated character,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.110
and to be worth considering
for a special investigation

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.550
but without any illusions

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.170
that they cut nature at the joints.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.610
In those earlier lectures,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.730
I took for granted that human language

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.900
can reasonably be studied
as part of the world,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.210
specifically is a property
of the human organism

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.210
mostly the brain and for
convenience, I'll keep to that.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.220
Both then and now, I'm
adopting what Lyle Jenkins

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.470
in a recent book calls the
biolinguistic perspective,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.640
that's the framework within which

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.420
the approach to language that
I'm considering developed

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.880
about 50 years ago.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.180
Also for convenience,
I'll use the term language

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.830
to refer to human language,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.490
that's a specific biological system

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.060
there is no meaningful question

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.160
as to whether the
communication system of bees

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.360
or what might be taught the Apes,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.013
or mathematics or music,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.340
there's no question as to
whether these are languages

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.770
or whether airplanes really fly

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.450
or submarines really swim,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.450
or whether computers think
or translate languages,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.120
or other comparably meaningless questions

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.550
many of them based on a misinterpretation

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.580
of a important paper by Alan Turing

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.160
little over 50 years ago in 1950,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.670
which has spawned a large and to my mind

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.750
mostly misguided literature,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.750
explicitly, despite Turing's
very explicit warning

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.710
not to pursue that direction

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.333
which has apparently been overlooked.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.190
From the bio linguistic perspective,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.300
language is a component of human biology

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.040
more or less on a par
with mammalian vision

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.030
or insect navigation, and other systems

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.963
for which the best theories
that have been devised,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.760
attribute, computational
capacities of some kind,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.090
what's in informal usage
sometimes called rule-following.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.570
So for example,
contemporary texts on vision

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.540
describes the so called
rigidity principle,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.010
it's formulated about
50 years ago as follows.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.920
That says if possible,
and other rules permit,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.280
interpret image motions as projections

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.020
of rigid motion in three dimensions.

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:47.500
In this case later work
provided substantial insight

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.770
into the mental computations,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.770
that seemed to be involved
and when the visual system

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.290
follows these rules in
informal terminology.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.550
But even for very simple organisms

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.720
that's no slight test.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.400
A great many issues remain
unresolved in these areas

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.433
which are quite obscure even for insects.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.350
The decision to study
languages part of the world,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.880
in this sense should be
in my view uncontroversial

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.620
but it has not been, on the contrary,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.440
the assumption that this
is a legitimate enterprise

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.090
was rejected pretty
forcefully 50 years ago

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.710
and continues to be rejected.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.000
Virtually all of contemporary philosophy

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.720
of language and mind is based

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.080
on rejection of the assumption.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.980
The same is true of what's called

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.320
the computer model of mind

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.910
that underlies a good deal of
theoretical cognitive science

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.670
denied in this case not only for language

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.970
but for mental faculties generally.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.760
It's explicitly denied,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.090
and the technical linguistic literature

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.050
and what are called plate
mystic, accounts of language

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.050
and also in a different way
denied by the conceptualism

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.400
that was devised by the same authors

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.100
inaccurately attributed to
many linguists including me.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.573
It's also apparently denied
by many sociolinguists,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.240
it's incompatible with structural,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.480
behavioral approaches to language.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.760
It's a little to my surprise rejected

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760
by current studies of language
by leading neuroscientists

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.810
most notably Terrence
Deacon and recent work

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.260
which has been favorably received

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.573
by eminent biologists,
again little to my surprise.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.730
The approach therefore
seems to be controversial,

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.730
but I think the
appearances are misleading.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.200
A more careful look will show

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.200
I think that the basic
assumptions are tacitly adopted

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.150
even by those who strenuously reject them,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.890
and indeed have to be
adopted even for coherence.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.560
I'm gonna put aside this interesting topic

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.520
of contemporary intellectual history,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.570
and I'll simply assume that language

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.433
can be studied as part of the world,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.040
continue in other words to pursue

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.250
the biolinguistic approach that took shape

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.320
about half a century ago,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.320
heavily influenced by ethology,
comparative psychology

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.070
and intensively pursued then along

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.100
quite a few different paths,
including much of the work

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.253
that claims to reject the approach.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.190
Well, assuming that turn to some things

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.890
that ought to be obvious.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.890
It can scarcely be denied
that some internal state

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.150
is responsible for the fact, that I speak

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.510
and understand some variety

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.280
of what's loosely called English,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.510
but not say Hindi or Swahili at the borrow

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.730
and in fact adapt a traditional term,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.800
we can call this the state whatever it is,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.220
it's internal to me,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.480
a state of the human faculty of language

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.280
primarily a state of the brain.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.670
We can call each such state
an internalized language

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.880
in the technical literature

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.880
often called an I language for
simplicity I'll call it that.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.410
It should also be uncontroversial,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.280
that the Faculty of language
has an initial state

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.880
part of our biological endowment

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.580
which permits a certain range of options,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.533
the attainable I languages.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.030
The Faculty of language
then is a special property

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.160
that enables my granddaughter,
but not her pet kitten

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.090
or chimpanzee to attain
a specific I language

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.150
on exposure to appropriate data,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.820
data which her mind in some obscure way

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.360
is able to extract from the booming,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.800
buzzing, confusion and to interpret

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.560
as linguistic experience,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.180
that's no slight task
nobody knows how it's done

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.343
but it obviously is.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.510
More accurately every infant acquires

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.720
a complex of such states,
that's a complication

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.833
that I'll put aside.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.350
The expectation that language

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.500
is like everything else
in the organic world,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.900
and therefore is based on

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.860
a genetically determined initial state,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.750
that it distinguishes say my
granddaughter from her pets

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.450
that assumption has been called
the innateness hypothesis.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.110
And there's a substantial literature

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.100
debating the validity of
the innateness hypothesis.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.200
The literature has a curious character

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.370
there are lots of condemnations
of the hypothesis,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.593
but it's never formulated
and nobody defends.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.690
It's alleged advocates
of, of whom I'm one,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.623
I have no idea what the hypothesis is.

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:31.380
Everyone has some innateness
hypothesis concerning language

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.030
at least, everyone who's interested

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:39.030
in the difference between
an infant and say her pets.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.237
Furthermore, the invented term

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.800
innateness hypothesis is
completely meaningless,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.780
there is no specific innateness hypothesis

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.450
rather there are various hypotheses,

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.840
about what might be the initial
genetically determined state

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.730
these hypotheses are of
course constantly changing

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.790
as more is learned, that
all should be obvious.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.320
Confusion about these matters

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.280
has reached such extreme levels,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.730
that it's becoming hard even to unravel

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.433
but I'll put all that aside.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:19.580
The bio linguistic approach
takes mental faculties

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.520
to be states of the organism.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.520
In particular, internal
languages, I languages

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.160
that are states of the
Faculty of language.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.540
I'll focus on language,
but most of what follows

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.910
that should hold as well for
other cognitive faculties

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.380
and in fact for far simpler organisms,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.883
say a bee communication
or navigation for example.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.350
Well, when we adopt this approach,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.750
several questions arise at once.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.470
The central one is to determine

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:58.490
the nature of the initial
and attained States.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.060
And though the matter again
appears to be controversial

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.440
I know of no serious alternative

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.440
to the thesis that these are

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.100
in substantial measure
computational states,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.910
whether we have in mind insect navigation

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.933
or what you and I are doing right now.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.060
Again, that's held to be controversial

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.770
but since there's no alternative ideas

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.113
I don't understand why.

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.910
It's held to be controversial for humans

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.810
it's not held to be controversial for say,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.370
insect navigation but the
questions about the same.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.710
Investigation of the brain in these terms

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.780
is sometimes called psychological,

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.050
and it's contrasted with
investigation of term

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.240
in terms of cells chemical processes,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.860
electrical activity and so on
that's called physiological.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.950
These are again terms of convenience,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.083
they don't have any sharp boundaries,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.680
chemistry and physics were distinguished

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.600
in pretty much similar
way, not very long ago.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.010
So, the formulas involving
complex molecules

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.460
that we now study in school.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.030
These were pretty
recently considered to be,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.740
I'm quoting merely
classific story symbols,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.970
that summarize the observed
course of a reaction.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.950
The ultimate nature of
the molecular groupings

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.820
was held to be unsolvable,

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.100
and the actual arrangement
of atoms within a molecule

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.430
if that even means anything,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.738
was never to be read into the formulas.

00:13:43.738 --> 00:13:46.640
I'm quoting from a standard
history of chemistry.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.060
Keiko Leong whose structural
chemistry paved the way

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.180
to eventual unification of
the chemistry and physics,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.180
he doubted that absolute
constitution of organic molecules

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.963
could ever be given,

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.580
his own models his analysis of valency

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.740
and so on were to have

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.023
only an instrumental interpretation
as calculating devices.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.700
The actually large parts of physics

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.550
were understood in the same
way, by prominent scientists

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.930
including the molecular theory of gases

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.780
even Bohr's model of the atom.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.050
In fact, only a few years before physics

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.750
and chemistry were
united in Linus Pauling's

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.660
account of the chemical bond,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.400
America's first Nobel
prize-winning chemist,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.240
dismissed talk about the
real nature of chemical bonds

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.769
as in his terms metaphysical twaddle,

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:52.110
this was nothing more
than a very crude method

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.300
of representing certain known
facts about chemical reactions

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.260
a mode of representation only,
just a calculating device.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.260
The rejection of this skepticism
by a few leading scientists

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.600
whose views were incidentally condemned

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.840
as a conceptual absurdity,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.163
that paved the way to
the eventual unification.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.030
These are fairly recent debates,

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.403
this is talking about the 1920s.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.200
These fairly recent debates
in the hard sciences,

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.310
I think have considerable relevance

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.360
for today's controversies
concerning computational theories

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.083
of cognitive capacity, that's
from insects to humans.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.560
Important topic, one that
discussed a little bit elsewhere

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.450
and I think deserves a good deal

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.980
more attention than its received.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.280
Well, with the biolinguistic
approach in place,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.030
this framework in place,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.380
we wanna discover the relationship

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.520
between psychological states and the world

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.653
as described in other terms.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.570
We want to know how computational states

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.660
are related to neuro physiological states,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.350
states of the brain were represented

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.390
in them and one terminology.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.400
We also want to find out
how these mental states

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.450
relate to the organism
external world, as for example

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:29.450
when the motions and noises
produced by a forager

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.160
be direct others to a distant flower,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.160
or when I talk about
a recent trip to India

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.030
or when I say that I recently read

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:47.030
Darwin's Dissent of Man,
referring to a book,

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.250
all of this is called intentionality

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.743
and philosophical jargon.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.600
The broad issues were raised prominently

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.160
at the end of the decade of the brain,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.403
which brought the last
millennium to a close.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.720
The American Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.840
and at the end of the millennium year 2000

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.490
published the volume to mark the occasion,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.730
that summarized the current state

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.980
of understanding in these areas.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.920
The guiding theme of the
volume was formulated

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.700
by a distinguished
neuroscientist Vernon MountCastle

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.490
in his introduction to the collection.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.930
It is in his words, the
thesis that things mental

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.710
indeed minds are emergent
properties of brains,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.600
though these emergences are
not regarded as irreducible

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.150
but are produced by principles
that control the interactions

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.440
between lower-level events,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.893
principles we do not yet understand.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.580
That same thesis has been
put forth in recent years

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.110
as quoting as an astonishing hypothesis

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.700
of the new biology, a radically new idea

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.610
in the philosophy of mind,

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.330
the bold assertion that mental phenomena

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.210
are entirely natural and caused

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.350
by neuro physiological
activities of the brain,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:20.313
opening the door to new and
promising inquiries and so on.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.970
Contributors to the
American Academy volume,

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.290
were for the most part quite optimistic

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:32.290
about the prospects for
overcoming the remaining gaps

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.243
between psychological and
physiological accounts.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.350
Mountcastle's phrase, "We
do not yet understand."

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:46.063
Reflects that optimism suggests
we will soon understand.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:52.670
Wilson wrote that, "Researchers
now speak confidently

00:18:53.037 --> 00:18:57.540
"of a coming solution to
the brain mind problem."

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.940
Similar confidence has been
expressed for half a century

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.680
including announcements
by prominent scientists,

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.800
Nobel Prize winner in one case

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.223
that the brain, mind problem
has already been solved.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.140
We may recall usefully similar optimism

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.730
shortly before the unification
of chemistry and physics.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
So in 1929, Bertrand Russell
who knew the sciences well,

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:31.100
he wrote that chemical
laws cannot at present

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.260
be reduced to physical laws.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.960
In his phrase at present,
like Mountcastle's word

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.300
yet expresses the expectation,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.210
that the reduction should take place

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.830
in the course of scientific
progress, perhaps soon.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.640
Now, in the case of physics and chemistry

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.177
it never did take place,

00:19:52.177 --> 00:19:54.290
and what happened was something different

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.580
and totally unexpected.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.650
Namely, unification of a
virtually unchanged chemistry

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.360
with a radically revised physics.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.830
And it's hardly necessary
to stress the fact

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.220
that the state of understanding

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.327
and achievement in these areas,

00:20:11.327 --> 00:20:16.327
50, 80 years ago was far beyond
anything that can be claimed

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.710
for the brain and
cognitive sciences today,

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.123
which oughta give us pause.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.800
The American Academy volume

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.450
reviews many important discoveries,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.450
but the leading thesis
should arouse our skepticism.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.720
And not only for the reason
that I just mentioned,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.720
another reason is that the
thesis is by no means new.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.650
In fact, it was formulated
and virtually the same words

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.650
two centuries ago, late 18th century,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.480
by the eminent chemist Joseph Priestley.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.530
He wrote that properties of mind

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.980
arise from the organization
of the nervous system itself,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.920
and those properties termed mental

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.980
are the results of the organical
structure of the brain,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.150
just as matter is possessed

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.930
of powers of attraction and
repulsion that act at a distance

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.630
contrary to the founding principles

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.280
of modern scientific revolution

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.080
from Galileo to Newton and Beyond.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.510
Half a century before Priestley,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.420
David Hume had casually described thought

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.190
as a little agitation of the brain,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.630
and shortly after the French
philosopher, physician

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.810
Gabonese wrote that the
brain must be considered

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.210
a special organ designed
to produce thought

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.590
as the stomach and the intestines

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:51.083
are designed to operate
the digestion, the liver,

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.960
to filter bile and various glands

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.770
to prepare salivary juices.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.560
Lemetri, he had similar proposals,

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.240
they were suppressed at the time

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.350
but they're well known today.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.890
A century later, Darwin
asked rhetorically,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.230
why thought being a secretion of the brain

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.160
should be considered more
wonderful than gravity

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.520
which is a property of matter.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.190
Actually, these and many other conceptions

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.780
developed from an inquiry,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.250
into what was called thinking matter

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.680
in part developed from
what's sometimes called

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.540
by historians of philosophy
Locke's suggestion,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.350
John Locke's suggestion.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.390
That is, his observation in his words

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.390
that God might have chosen
to super add to matter

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.470
a Faculty of thinking, just as
he annexed effects to motion

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.940
which we can in no way
conceive motion able to produce

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.420
the theological apparatus,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.400
may well have been for self-defense.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.630
So Locke's correspondent suggests.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.900
By the late 18th century,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.333
the thesis was widely
regarded as inescapable.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.090
Newton had demonstrated
to his considerable dismay

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.210
that matter does not exist,

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.280
in the sense of the Galilean revolution

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.280
and of the scientists of his
own day and his own sense.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.470
That being the case, the mind-body problem

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.480
could no longer even be formulated,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.490
at least in anything
resembling the classical form.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.930
Current formulation, as
seem at best to restate

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.950
the problem of unification
of psychological

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.100
and physiological approaches, and to do so

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.563
in highly misleading terminology.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.840
There was no mind-body problem,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.230
any more than there was a
chemistry physics problem

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.893
in the 1920s.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.810
Unification of Newton's discoveries

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:11.430
led to, they really left
no coherent alternative

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:16.877
to the conclusion that was
drawn by Hume Priestley, others

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.890
and rediscovered today in
pretty much the same terms.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.150
But with the problem of emergence,

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.507
as unresolved as it was two centuries ago

00:24:27.507 --> 00:24:30.300
and that includes the
question whether this notion,

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.880
with its reductionist connotations

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.810
is even the right notion,
maybe it's the wrong notion,

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.673
as proved to be the case
for chemistry and physics.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.120
The traditional mind-body problem

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.120
is often ridiculed as a problem
of the ghost in the machine

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.320
but that's misconception.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.240
Newton exorcized the machine,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.940
he left the ghost completely intact.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:01.100
A similar observation
is made very recently

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.240
by two physicists Paul
Davies and John Griffin

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.623
concluding a book of theirs,
called the Matter Myth.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.010
They write that during the triumphal phase

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.730
of materialism and mechanism in the 1930s,

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.130
that Gilbert Ryle
derided, mind-body dualism

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.410
in a pithy reference to the mind part,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.470
as the ghost in the machine.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.970
But already when he coined
that pithy expression

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.270
in the 1930s, the new physics was at work

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.120
undermining the materialist worldview

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.540
on which Ryle's philosophy was based.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.800
By the end of the 20th
century they continue,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.890
we can see that Ryle was
right to dismiss the notion

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.600
of the ghost in the machine,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.690
not because there is no ghost

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.510
but because there is no machine.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.050
Their point is correct,
but the timing is off

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.130
by at least two centuries, actually three.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.230
Although, it did take some time

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.760
for Newton's demolition of what was called

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.010
at the time, the mechanical
philosophy, the belief

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.220
that the world is a machine,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.440
it took a little time for that to enter

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.033
scientific common sense.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.360
Newton himself was well
aware of the conclusion

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.980
and far from pleased by it.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.320
He regarded his own
conclusion as an absurdity

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.150
that no serious person could entertain,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.840
and he sawed away around
it to the end of his life

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.540
as did prominent scientists of his day,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.870
and much later always in vain.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.830
Over time, it just came to be recognized

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.330
that Newton had not only
effectively destroyed

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.910
the entire materialist,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.390
physicalist conception of the universe,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.390
but he had also undermined the
standards of intelligibility

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.890
on which the early Scientific
Revolution was based.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.820
The outcome is familiar at
least in history of science,

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.810
it was described very well in the classic

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.810
19th century history of
materialism by Friedrich Longa.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:20.910
He pointed out that scientists
have accustomed theirselves

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.680
to the abstract notion of forces,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.680
or rather a notion hovering
in a mystic obscurity

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.470
between abstraction and
concrete comprehension.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.410
A turning point in the
history of materialism

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.150
that removes the surviving
remnants of the doctrine

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.500
far from the ideas and concerns

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.330
of the genuine materialists
of the 17th century,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.980
and deprives them of any significance.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.180
That too is now a virtual truism,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.760
at least among historians of science.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.070
One of the founders of
the modern discipline

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.030
Alexandre Corre he wrote 40 years ago

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.010
that a purely materialistic
or mechanistic physics

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:08.210
is impossible, and we
simply have to accept

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.680
that the world is constituted of entities

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.293
and processes that we
cannot intuitively grasp.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.930
The problems of emergence and unification

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.930
take on an entirely new form,
in the post-newtonian era.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.080
A form that's furthermore
unstable, changing

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.860
as science comes to
accommodate new absurdities

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:36.150
as they would have been
regarded by the founding figures

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.380
of the Scientific
Revolution including Newton.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.650
And I know of no reason to suppose

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.450
that the process has come to an end.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.470
It's worth pointing out that
the only part of our knowledge

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.050
or what we take to be knowledge,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.890
for which we can claim much confidence

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.160
is our mental world, that is
the world of our experience.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.780
As reflective beings,
humans try in various ways

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.280
to make sense out of this experience.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.900
One part of this effort is
sometimes called folk science

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.060
when it's conducted in a more systematic,

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.830
careful, controlled way we
nowadays call it science.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.610
One standard conclusion
of contemporary science,

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.660
is that each organism,
humans in particular

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.660
reflexively develop what
ecologists call and unveiled

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.190
the particular mode of constructing

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.720
an interpreting experience
given the data of sense,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.910
it's quite different for us
and for bees for example.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.100
Furthermore, there is
no great chain of being

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.470
in fundamental respects,

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.410
insects have richer experience
and more sophisticated ways

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.440
of dealing with it for action,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.140
using it for action than humans do.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.500
Among other standard
conclusions of modern science,

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.700
are those that Priestley and many others

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.090
drew the conclusions
they drew centuries ago,

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.850
about thinking matter reiterated

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.460
at the end of the decade of
the brain, just two years ago,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.540
that without notable change
or maybe surprisingly

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.960
without much awareness that
its revival, not innovation

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.580
and that its revival of something

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.960
that was taken to be
an unavoidable truism,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.623
two centuries ago for quite good reasons.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.857
Given the lack of a
positive determinant account

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.562
of the non mental part of the world

00:30:42.562 --> 00:30:46.730
of the world, what sometimes
called the physical world.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.580
Talk of the hard part of
the mind-body problem,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.270
recent years that's been taken

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.403
to be consciousness conventionally.

00:30:56.178 --> 00:30:58.973
That talk of that kind
is misleading at best,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.653
if it's even meaningful.

00:31:04.216 --> 00:31:05.870
It may not be, sometimes the problem

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.700
is not very clearly
posed, that is it's posed

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.520
in terms of questions to which

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.270
we can't even of wrong answers.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.040
So for example, there's no sensible answer

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.970
to the question, what is it like to be me?

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.920
Or, what is it like to be a bat,

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.913
and quoting Thomas Nagle's famous paper.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.630
There are no bad answers to that,

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.720
they're no good answers, none at all.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.300
Formal semantics inquiries,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.620
often take the meaning of a question

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.040
to be the set of propositions
that are answers to it.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.410
And if that is at least
a condition on meaning,

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.580
then it follows that if there
are no sensible answers,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.293
the question has no meaning.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.420
Even when legitimate questions are posed,

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.247
we don't have any good
reason as far as I can see,

00:31:57.247 --> 00:32:01.390
but to suppose that they
are intrinsically harder

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.460
than lots of other problems,
say the problems posed

00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:09.380
for our understanding by quantum mechanics

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.550
or cosmological theories of
an infinity of universes.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:17.060
Or for that matter by
the properties of motion.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.130
We don't have any reason that I know of,

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:24.640
to question the opinions
of Newton, David Hume,

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.410
and other not inconsiderable figures

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.000
who in various ways
reached Locke's conclusion

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.030
that motion has effects
which we can in no way

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.820
conceive motion able to produce.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.820
Even before Newton puzzlement
about motion was profound

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.380
his precursors or William Petting

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.610
described springing or elastic motion

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.610
as the hard rock in philosophy,

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.650
philosophy means what we call science.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:00.650
The obscurity was so
great, Robert Boyle felt

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.700
as to prove the existence
of an intelligent author

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.690
or disposer of things.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.990
Even the skeptical Newtonian Voltaire

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.330
felt that the impenetrable
mysteries of motion

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.610
proved that there must be a God,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.923
who gave movement to matter
rather like Locke suggestion.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.920
One cannot say that the
hard problem was solved,

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.630
it was just abandoned in the course

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.230
of a significant revision of
the enterprise of science,

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.700
that is the recognition that
in some fundamental sense

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.660
the world is just unintelligible to us,

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.760
and that we have to reduce
our sights to the search

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.300
for intelligible theories,

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.290
that's something quite different.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:46.210
And even that goal has
been strongly contested

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.820
by prominent physicists.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.820
For example, in the critique
a century ago of atomic theory

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.930
or even of the idea that physics

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.070
should go beyond establishing
quantitative relations

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.380
between observable phenomena.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.180
The significance of that shift,

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.260
should not be underestimated,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.110
it was recognized soon enough
for example by David Hume

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.977
who wrote that in his words,

00:34:11.977 --> 00:34:15.637
"Newton's discoveries reveal the obscurity

00:34:15.637 --> 00:34:19.960
"in which nature's ultimate
secrets ever will remain."

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.460
These mysteries of nature
as Hume called them,

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.850
referring to the phenomena of motion.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.310
Will remain beyond our cognitive reach,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.390
perhaps we might speculate,
he didn't for reasons

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:36.460
that are rooted in the
biological endowment

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.630
of the curious creature,
that alone is able

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.893
even to contemplate these questions.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.340
Well, I did talk a little bit

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.209
about these topics 35 years ago,

00:34:49.209 --> 00:34:53.050
and what's happened since
including incidentally

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:58.050
my own belated self-education
inclines me to believe

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.760
that what I said then,
should be reiterated

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.180
much more forcefully,
and in much greater depth

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.100
and with much more explicit connections

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.720
drawn to contemporary discussions

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.130
about problems of language and mind.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.330
Well, let's return to
the narrower question

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.470
of emergence of mental
aspects of the world,

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:24.040
or perhaps the development of an account

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.290
of the non mental world that
can be unified with them

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:32.310
if the physics, chemistry
model turns out to be accurate.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.910
The scale of the gap that remains

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.330
and the very dubious grounds
for the general optimism

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:41.820
about overcoming it, are
revealed very clearly

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.630
in the American Academy symposium

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.840
that reviewed the state of understanding

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.981
at the end of the millennium.

00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:51.387
One leading specialist on vision

00:35:51.387 --> 00:35:54.936
who was toward the optimistic
end of the spectrum,

00:35:54.936 --> 00:35:57.085
and nevertheless reminded the reader

00:35:57.085 --> 00:35:59.833
that how the brain combines the responses

00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:02.366
of specialized cells to indicate

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:05.503
a continuous vertical line, is a mystery

00:36:05.503 --> 00:36:08.301
that neurology has not yet solved.

00:36:08.301 --> 00:36:10.288
Or even for that matter how one line

00:36:10.288 --> 00:36:15.022
is differentiated from others
or from the visual surround.

00:36:15.022 --> 00:36:17.015
Sameera Nzeki,

00:36:17.015 --> 00:36:21.631
the AAAs journal American Association

00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:25.564
for advancement of
science, journal science.

00:36:25.564 --> 00:36:30.542
A year ago they devoted an issue to

00:36:30.542 --> 00:36:33.016
neuroscience.

00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:38.016
The summary article was
co-authored by Eric Kandel,

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.718
Nobel laureate, it was subtitled

00:36:43.718 --> 00:36:46.159
Breaking Down Scientific Barriers

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:49.004
to the study of brain and mind.

00:36:49.004 --> 00:36:52.167
The article covers a lot
of interesting ground

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:54.319
but it ends up with the conclusion

00:36:54.319 --> 00:36:57.609
that the neuroscience of
higher cognitive processes

00:36:57.609 --> 00:37:01.179
is only beginning, it's surely beginning

00:37:01.179 --> 00:37:04.464
from a higher plane than was constructed

00:37:04.464 --> 00:37:06.806
by Descartes who was in many ways,

00:37:06.806 --> 00:37:09.243
the founder of modern neuroscience

00:37:09.243 --> 00:37:12.378
but nonetheless, it's still beginning.

00:37:12.378 --> 00:37:14.606
Fundamental questions remain

00:37:14.606 --> 00:37:17.388
beyond even dreams of resolution.

00:37:17.388 --> 00:37:20.421
That includes those
that were traditionally

00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:23.118
considered at the heart
of the theory of mind,

00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:27.209
such as for example at
choosing some action

00:37:27.209 --> 00:37:29.803
or even thinking about doing so.

00:37:29.803 --> 00:37:32.640
There's been very valuable work

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.838
about the narrower questions.

00:37:34.838 --> 00:37:39.054
For example, how an
organism executes a plan

00:37:39.054 --> 00:37:40.851
for integrated motor action,

00:37:40.851 --> 00:37:45.851
say how a cockroach walks
or how a person reaches

00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:48.123
for a cup on the table.

00:37:48.123 --> 00:37:51.369
Well, let's return to
the narrower question

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:54.518
of emergence of mental
aspects of the world

00:37:54.518 --> 00:37:58.947
or perhaps the development, of an account

00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:03.318
of the non mental world that
can be unified with them,

00:38:03.318 --> 00:38:07.414
if the physics chemistry model
turns out to be accurate.

00:38:07.414 --> 00:38:10.055
The scale of the gap that remains,

00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:13.295
and the very dubious grounds
for the general optimism

00:38:13.295 --> 00:38:16.951
about overcoming it, are
revealed very clearly

00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:19.776
in the American Academy symposium

00:38:19.776 --> 00:38:21.859
that reviewed the state of understanding

00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:23.831
at the end of the millennium.

00:38:23.831 --> 00:38:26.214
One leading specialists on vision

00:38:26.214 --> 00:38:29.756
who was toward the optimistic
end of the spectrum,

00:38:29.756 --> 00:38:31.887
and nevertheless reminded the reader

00:38:31.887 --> 00:38:34.660
that how the brain combines the responses

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.433
of specialized cells to indicate
a continuous vertical line

00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:43.109
is a mystery that neurology
has not yet solved,

00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:45.053
or even for that matter how one line

00:38:45.053 --> 00:38:49.940
is differentiated from others
or from the visual surround,

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.523
Sameera Nzeki the AAAs
Journal American Association

00:38:56.395 --> 00:39:00.381
for advancement of
science, journal science,

00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:05.131
a year ago they devoted
an issue to neuroscience.

00:39:07.877 --> 00:39:11.063
The summary article was co-authored

00:39:11.063 --> 00:39:15.448
by Eric Kandel Nobel laureate,

00:39:15.448 --> 00:39:19.615
it was subtitled Breaking
down Scientific Barriers

00:39:21.085 --> 00:39:23.796
to the Study of Brain and Mind.

00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:26.977
The article covers a lot
of interesting ground

00:39:26.977 --> 00:39:29.070
but it ends up with the conclusion

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.415
that the neuroscience of
higher cognitive processes

00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:35.921
is only beginning, it's surely beginning

00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:40.873
from a higher plane than
was constructed by Descartes

00:39:40.873 --> 00:39:44.106
who was in many ways the

00:39:44.106 --> 00:39:47.166
but nonetheless it's still beginning.

00:39:47.166 --> 00:39:49.445
Fundamental questions will remain

00:39:49.445 --> 00:39:52.155
beyond even dreams of resolution,

00:39:52.155 --> 00:39:55.341
that includes those
that were traditionally

00:39:55.341 --> 00:39:57.936
considered at the heart
of the theory of mind.

00:39:57.936 --> 00:40:01.952
Such as for example choosing some action

00:40:01.952 --> 00:40:04.594
or even thinking about doing so.

00:40:04.594 --> 00:40:07.531
There's been very valuable work

00:40:07.531 --> 00:40:09.463
about the narrower questions.

00:40:09.463 --> 00:40:13.650
For example, how an
organism executes a plan

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.490
for integrated motor action.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.670
Say how a cockroach walks,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.490
or how a person reaches
for a cup on the table.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:25.150
But no one even raises the question

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:30.150
of why the person or the
cockroach executes one plan

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.080
rather than some other one,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.290
that question is raised only
for the very simplest organisms

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.613
single-cell organisms.

00:40:41.732 --> 00:40:45.430
In fact, the same is true
even of a visual perception

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.620
which is often considered
a passive process.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:53.620
A couple of years ago, a few,
two cognitive neuroscientists

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:57.470
one a colleague of mine,
published the review of research

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:02.470
on a problem that was posed in
1850 by Helmholtz, his words.

00:41:04.327 --> 00:41:09.327
"Even without moving our eyes
we can focus our attention

00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:12.327
"on different objects at will,

00:41:12.327 --> 00:41:15.407
"resulting in very different
perceptual experiences

00:41:15.407 --> 00:41:17.217
"of the same visual field."

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.660
There's been interesting work on that

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.960
but the phrase at will points to an area

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.560
that's beyond serious empirical inquiry,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.490
it remains as much of a mystery

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.690
as it was for Newton
at the end of his life

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:37.200
when he was still seeking
what he called a subtle spirit

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.580
that lies hidden in all bodies,

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.070
and that might without absurdity

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.750
account for their properties
of attraction and repulsion,

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:49.880
the nature and effects of light sensation

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.470
and the way members of animal bodies

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.600
move at the command of the will.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.540
These are all comparable
mysteries for Newton

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.950
that perhaps even beyond our understanding

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.900
he thought like the principles of motion,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.450
and the classical problems
of the theory of mind

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.370
at least since Descartes,

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:10.450
who incidentally also regarded them

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:12.993
as possibly beyond human understanding.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.430
Even if we restrict ourselves
to the study of mechanisms,

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.240
the gaps are quite substantial.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.250
One of the leading
cognitive neuroscientists

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.810
Randy Gallistel pointed out recently,

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.160
that we clearly do not understand

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.430
how the nervous system computes,

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.740
or even the foundations
of its ability to compute

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.780
even for the small set of
arithmetic and logical operations

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.720
that are fundamental to any computation.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.850
He happens to be talking about insects

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.913
but obviously extends beyond.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.010
In another domain, one of the founders

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:55.787
of contemporary cognitive
neuroscience Hans-Lukas Teuber.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:01.870
He introduced an important
review of perception

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:05.390
and neurophysiology, by writing that,

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:08.710
it may seem strange to
begin with the claim

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.850
that there is no adequate
definition of perception,

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.920
and to end with the admission that we lack

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.763
the neurophysiological theory.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:19.930
Though this was the
most that could be said.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:23.060
Now, it's true that that was 40 years ago

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.770
and there were dramatic discoveries,

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.690
right at the time that
he was writing and since.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.630
But I suspect that Tueber who's since died

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:36.925
would have expressed much
the same judgment today.

00:43:36.925 --> 00:43:39.740
Tueber also outlined a standard way

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.740
to move towards addressing
the problem of unification.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.640
He explained that his purpose in reviewing

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.300
the perceptual phenomena and offering

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.560
a speculative psychological
account of them

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.560
was because this may suggest directions

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.070
in which the search for
neural basis of perception

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.070
should proceed, namely by
clarifying the assumptions

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.460
that those neural basis must satisfy.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.870
Now, that's a classic approach,

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.940
along with the restriction
of the scientific enterprise

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:22.890
to more modest goals, namely
intelligibility of theories

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:24.400
rather than of the world.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.440
Another consequence of Newton's demolition

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.370
of the hopes of the Galilean revolution,

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.740
for a mechanical conception of the world.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:36.090
Another one was recognition
that scientific inquiry

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.780
is gonna have to be local
in its expectations.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.510
Overarching unification, may take place

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.210
but perhaps over a long term,

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.853
and in ways that can't be anticipated.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:54.730
The 18th century English
chemist Joseph Black

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:58.490
set the tone for
subsequent scientific work

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.270
by recommending that chemical affinity

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.940
be received as a first principle,

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.540
which we cannot explain any more

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.290
than Newton could explain gravitation,

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:15.250
but let us defer accounting
for the laws of affinity

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.730
till we have established
such a body of doctrine

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.280
as Newton has established

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.670
concerning the laws of gravitation.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:26.390
And chemistry in fact
proceeded along that course,

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:30.100
separating itself
increasingly from physics.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:34.430
Physics followed Newton's admonition

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:39.090
that nature will be comfortable to herself

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.670
and very simple, observing
a few general principles

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.340
of attraction and repulsion

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.640
that relate the elementary particles

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.410
of which all matter is constituted

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.400
more or less in the way
that different buildings

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.970
could be constructed from the same bricks.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.960
The goal was therefore to
understand to quantify,

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.640
to reduce the whole of
nature to simple laws

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.773
as Newton did for say astronomy.

00:46:10.649 --> 00:46:13.360
I happen to be quoting Arnold Thackeray

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.380
in his history of Newtonian matter theory,

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.250
and the development of chemistry.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:20.807
He goes on to say "This
was the compelling,

00:46:20.807 --> 00:46:24.987
"the enticing, indeed the
almost bewitching goal

00:46:24.987 --> 00:46:28.937
"of much work pursuing
the thoroughly Newtonian

00:46:28.937 --> 00:46:31.687
"and reductionist task of uncovering

00:46:31.687 --> 00:46:33.477
"the general mathematical laws

00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:36.420
"which governed all chemical behavior."

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.250
There was a distinct chemical tradition,

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.940
followed the path that was
outlined by Joseph Black

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:46.100
Lavoisier Wallace
founded modern chemistry,

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:50.250
that tried to keep neutral
probably to avoid controversy.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:55.250
But his own work helped to found
the separate chemical track

00:46:55.530 --> 00:47:00.400
Dalton abandoned and entirely the Boyle,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.070
Newton corpuscular theories of matter.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.320
He adopted the radically different view

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.650
that matter could exist
in heterogeneous forms

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.450
with varied principles.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:16.210
His approach, Thackeray writes
was chemically successful

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.560
and therefore enjoyed the
homage of the history,

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.530
unlike the philosophically more
coherent if less successful

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.500
reductionist schemes of the Newtonians.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.603
By the end of the 19th century,

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.020
the fields of interest of
chemists and physicists

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.400
had become quite distinct,

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.350
including a standard history of chemistry.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.630
Chemistry dealt with a world consisting

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.910
of some 90 material elements,

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.600
with many and varied
principles and properties,

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.780
while physicists handled a more
nebulous mathematical world

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.470
of energy and electromagnetic waves

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:57.960
that were perceived in light radiant heat,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.560
electricity, magnetism,
later radio waves and x-rays

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:07.210
the chemists matter was
discrete and discontinuous,

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.240
the physicists energy was continuous

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:13.090
and the gap appeared unbridgeable.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:17.600
Meanwhile, chemists developed
a rich body of doctrine

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.290
achieving chemistry's
triumphs in isolation

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:26.200
from the newly emerging science
of physics, Thackeray again.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.330
As I mentioned the isolation,
ended only recently

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:34.640
in a completely unanticipated
way, not by reduction,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.910
but by unifying a
radically revised physics

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.860
with the bodies of doctrine
that chemistry had accumulated

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.310
which had in fact provided
important guidelines

00:48:48.278 --> 00:48:49.760
for the reconstruction of physics,

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.390
basically towards this
point about perception,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.660
and that's happened often
in the history of science

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.580
and we cannot know
whether something similar

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.490
might be required for unification

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:04.700
of the study of brain and mind,

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.410
if assuming that to be a task

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.380
that is within our cognitive reach,

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.030
and that we don't know either.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.490
Well, I've already
suggested and will repeat

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:17.660
that there are interesting
and important parallels

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.720
between the debates concerning
the reality of chemistry

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.880
up to the unification which
was just 65 years ago.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.230
And current debates in
the philosophy of mind

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.770
about the reality of the constructions

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.890
of psychological approaches.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.410
The former debates, chemistry physics

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:39.720
they are now understood to
have been totally pointless,

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.550
based on serious misunderstanding.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.510
We simply have no grasp of reality

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.143
other than what our best
explanatory theories can provide.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.310
If they happen to be
computational theories,

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.260
okay that's reality.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.120
My own view, I've discussed it elsewhere,

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.290
is that current debates
very much alive right now,

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:02.370
are also largely pointless

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.640
and for essentially the same reasons,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.270
this includes central
topics of philosophy of mind

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.313
and theoretical cognitive science,

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:14.640
which those of you in the
disciplines will recognize

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.590
or even in the general literature.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.330
Well considerations of the
kind that I've been reviewing

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:22.630
these were in the background

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:26.710
of the so called cognitive
revolution of the 1950s,

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:29.470
at least for some of the participants.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:32.590
Although it was unknown at the time,

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:35.560
in many ways the shift of perspective

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.840
brought about by the cognitive revolution

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.910
actually recapitulated the
first cognitive revolution

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.670
of the 17th century,

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.960
that includes the focus
on vision and language

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.810
in the latter case adopting
the bio linguistic approach

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:54.110
that is shifting the focus of attention

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:59.110
from phenomena like behavior
and its products, say texts.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.600
Shifting from that to inner mechanisms

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.240
that enter into producing the phenomenon.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.260
Now, that's a shift but
it's actually a shift

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.150
that was taken in the 17th century.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:15.540
Notice again then there was
regression for a long time.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.740
Notice again that that
shift still leaves us

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.470
a long way from the problems of action,

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:25.800
that's a vastly different matter.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.970
I've myself often quoted

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:34.810
though Hume from Humboldt's aphorism,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.740
that the core problem
of the study of language

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.340
is the infinite use of finite means,

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.890
so it was a leading concern

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.280
of Cartesian philosophy before him,

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.790
and a problem that
really couldn't be posed

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:50.530
very clearly at least
until the mid 20th century

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:54.200
that when the concepts of
recursive generative procedures

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.490
that was fully clarified.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:00.130
These procedures
constitute the finite means

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.170
that are put to infinite use,

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:03.940
but it's important to be aware

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.130
I don't think I've stressed this enough.

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:07.920
It's important to be aware

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.220
that despite quite a lot of progress

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.213
in understanding the means,

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.920
the means that are
employed for infinite use

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.940
the question of how they are used,

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.530
is scarcely even addressed
and it was that question

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.160
that was the fundamental
one for Descartes Humboldt

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.360
and other early modern figures,

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.670
and again those questions
aren't even addressed

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:33.113
for say insects, let alone humans.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:39.230
It's reasonably clear that the
human capacity for language

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.770
is what's called a species property,

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:45.300
that is biologically isolated
in essential respects

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.210
and close to uniform across the species.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.330
That actually seems less surprising today

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:55.730
than it did not long ago,

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.740
in the light of very recent discoveries

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.750
about the very limited genetic variation

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.420
among humans as compared
with other primates,

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.060
suggests that we've all descended

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.660
from a very small breeding group,

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.803
maybe 100,000 years ago.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:16.823
So, humans are basically identical

00:53:16.823 --> 00:53:18.940
from the point of view have say,

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.983
an outside biologist looking at us.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.490
The bio linguistic approach
adopted from the start,

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.890
what has been called quote,

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.040
the recently published encyclopedia

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.820
of cognitive neuroscience,

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.340
what's called the norm
these days in neuroscience,

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.550
the modular view of learning,

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:42.810
that is the conclusion that in all animals

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.800
learning is based on
specialized mechanisms

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.600
instincts to learn in specific ways

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.117
happen to be quoting
Randy Gallistel again,

00:53:53.117 --> 00:53:55.541
"These organs within the
brain," as he calls them,

00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:56.942
"Perform specific kinds of computation

00:53:56.942 --> 00:54:01.942
"in accordance with specific design.

00:54:01.997 --> 00:54:06.127
"Apart from extremely hostile environments

00:54:06.127 --> 00:54:10.497
"the organs change state
under the triggering

00:54:10.497 --> 00:54:14.607
"and shaping effect of external factors,

00:54:14.607 --> 00:54:17.237
"they do so more or less reflexively

00:54:17.237 --> 00:54:20.030
"and in accordance with internal design."

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:22.730
That's the process of learning,

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:26.140
although growth might be
a more appropriate term

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.470
avoiding misleading connotations
of the term learning.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.940
The language organ the Faculty of language

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:37.260
fits that pattern, the normal pattern.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:39.160
according to the best theories we have

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.970
each attainable state of the system

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.820
each I language, is a computational system

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:53.540
that determines, generates
in the technical sense.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.840
Infinitely many expressions
each of these expressions

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.440
is a store of information,

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.760
about sound and meaning which is accessed

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:04.670
by performance systems.

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:07.810
The properties of the I language,

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:11.620
result from the interplay
of several factors,

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.710
one factor is individual experience

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:16.890
which selects among the options

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.420
that are permitted by the initial state.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:22.520
A second factor is the
initial state itself,

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.780
which is a product of evolution.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.510
And a third factor is general properties

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:32.060
of organic systems, in this
case computational systems

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.120
incorporating it's reasonable to expect

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.250
principles of efficient computation.

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.450
The general picture involving
crucially the third factor,

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:47.450
is familiar in the study of
organic systems generally

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:51.700
this classic work of Darcy
Thompson and Alan Turing

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.590
on organic form and morphogenesis

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.220
is an illustration the topic currently

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.820
and contemporary biology.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.200
One example, current example
that might be suggestive

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.880
in the present connection, present context

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.950
is recent work by Christopher Juniac

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.520
mathematical biologists at Maryland

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.650
who's been exploring the idea that

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.730
minimization of what he calls wire length,

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:24.590
as in microchip design
should produce what he calls

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.360
the best of all possible brains.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.780
And he's tried to explain in these terms,

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:34.270
the neuroanatomy of nematodes,

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.760
one of the simplest and
best studied organisms

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.250
and also various pervasive
properties of nervous systems

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:44.610
such as the fact that the brain

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.810
is as far forward as
possible on the body axis,

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:52.700
wants to try to show
that that's just property

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:57.523
of efficient computation based
on wire length minimization.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.040
Well one can trace interest
in this third factor

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.340
general properties of organisms,

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:09.130
back to a Galilean intuition
namely Galileo's concept

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:11.940
that in his words, "Nature is perfect."

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.800
From the tides, to the flight of birds

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.590
and it's the task of the
scientist to discover

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:21.370
in just what sense this is true.

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:25.370
Newton's confidence that
nature must be very simple,

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:28.183
which I quoted, that
reflects the same intuition.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:33.760
However obscure it may be that intuition

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.370
about what Ernest Pickle
called nature's drive

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:40.400
for the beautiful, has
been a guiding theme

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.740
of modern science since
its smart modern origins

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.000
and with a Galilean revolution,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.990
perhaps even its defining characteristic.

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.840
It's hard to say exactly what it is

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:54.420
but that it's a guiding
intuition is not a doubt.

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.710
Biologists however have tended
to think rather differently

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.160
about the objects of their inquiry.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.710
Very commonly, they adopt
what Francois Jacob,

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:08.110
the Nobel laureate his image of nature

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.730
as what he called a tinkerer,

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.480
which does the best it can
with the materials at hand

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:18.480
often a pretty rotten job,
as human intelligence seems

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.190
to be keen on demonstrating about itself.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:25.260
One well-known contemporary biologist

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.860
Gabriel Dover British geneticist,

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.870
he concludes in a recent book that biology

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:33.140
is a strange and messy business

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:36.580
and perfection is the
last word one could use

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.840
to describe how organisms work,

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:43.070
particularly for anything
produced by natural selection.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.750
Though of course produced only in part

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:48.780
by natural selection as he emphasizes,

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.160
and as every biologist
knows and to an extent

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.280
that can't be quantified
by available tools.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.940
Well, we just don't know

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.680
which of these conflicting
intuitions is more accurate,

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:06.040
the Galilean intuition
or say Jacob's intuition.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.960
And we will not know
until we know the answer,

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:12.430
and they seem very remote those answers.

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:16.117
The same author Gabriel Dover writes that

00:59:16.117 --> 00:59:19.337
"We are nowhere near relieving
our deepest ignorance

00:59:19.337 --> 00:59:22.080
"about the biological world around us."

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.190
Now, he goes on to
reserve his sharpest words

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.560
for those who seek to give
scientific respectability

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.630
to complex behavioral phenomena and humans

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:35.030
that we cannot even begin
to investigate seriously.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:38.710
He calls that a sign of
intellectual laziness at best,

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:41.040
and shameless ignorance at worst

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.430
when confronting issues
of massive complexity

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:50.070
which far exceed the reach
of contemporary science.

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:53.763
He gives some examples but
for charity, I'll ignore them.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:59.150
The long-term goal of
investigating the third factor

00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:02.040
that is the role of general
properties of organisms

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.183
in determining the Faculty of language,

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.470
and the states that can
attain internal languages,

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:12.950
that goal was actually
formulated in the early days

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.590
of the bio linguistic turn,

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:17.790
but it was put aside as unfeasible

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:20.940
and attention focused
on the first two factors

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.920
experience and the initial state.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.330
In technical terminology that's called

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:29.460
the problems of descriptive
and explanatory adequacy,

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.290
and the latter is the question
of how the initial state

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:36.500
enters into determining the transition

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.770
to the final state, the state attained.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:43.120
The earliest attempts 50 years ago,

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.870
to replace traditional or
structuralist accounts of language

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.940
by generative rule systems,
revealed very quickly,

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.170
that very little was known

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:56.380
about the sound and meaning
and structure of language

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.350
and that huge problems
had been unwittingly

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.490
swept under the rug,

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.150
rather as in the days when it was assumed

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:08.440
that bodies fall to their natural place.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.140
As has often been the case,

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.780
one of the hardest steps in
the development of the sciences

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.740
is the first one namely to be puzzled

01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.270
by what seems so natural and obvious.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:26.270
To gain some realistic sense
of what had been overlooked

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:31.270
was an enormous task
in itself, even more so

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:33.020
in the light of the recognition

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.180
that the apparent complexity
and diversity of languages

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.010
that was very soon discovered,

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.763
just had to be an illusion.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:45.560
The reason for that conclusion
is a standard one in biology

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.730
namely as in the case of
other organs of the body.

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:54.010
Experience can play
only a very limited role

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:57.570
in determining the state that's obtained

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:00.630
in this case the attained I language.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:04.080
So, even a young child has mastered a rich

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.940
and highly articulated system of sound

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.420
and meaning and structural properties.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.750
that goes far beyond
any evidence available,

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:17.030
and that's shared with
others who have different

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:20.420
but also highly restricted experience.

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.790
So, it has to be the case,
that the initial state

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:27.930
plays an overwhelming role,
in determining the language

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:31.410
that the child attains
in all of its aspects.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.530
Experience surely has a role of triggering

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.540
and shaping role, as in
the case of other organs,

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.540
but it has to be a limited one.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.810
So, there's no reason
to suppose that language

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.760
and other higher mental
faculties depart radically

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.750
from everything known
in the biological world.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:57.750
The task was to show that
the apparent richness

01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:01.480
and complexity and diversity
is in fact an illusion,

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.630
that all languages are
test to the same mold

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:08.760
and that experience
serves only to set options

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.450
within a fixed system of principles,

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:13.680
all determined by the initial state.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.453
Much as in the case of
other biological systems.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.180
Well, a great deal of the
research the last 40 years

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.600
in these areas has been
driven by a kind of tension

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.240
between descriptive and
explanatory adequacy,

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.440
that is the tension between the search

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.570
for true theories of I
languages the attained state

01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:36.980
on the one hand, and a true theory

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.420
of the invariant initial state

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.950
of the language or again on the other.

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.910
The invariant initial state is the topic

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:48.410
of what's come to be
called Universal grammar,

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:53.410
it's adapting a traditional
notion to a quite a new context.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.690
The search for a descriptive adequacy

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.603
like a true theory of Hungarian,

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:04.050
that leads to complex intricate theories

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:07.460
of particular constructions
and particular languages

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.363
differing from one another.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.270
In contrast, the search
for explanatory adequacy

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:15.910
seeks to find the common ground

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.500
from which the existing
languages and all possible others

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.220
arise given the data that are
structured is experienced,

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.730
by the operations of the initial States,

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.420
again in some unknown manner.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.620
The first proposals from the 1950s

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.530
suggested that the initial state,

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.720
the topic of universal grammar.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.580
That the initial state
provides a kind of a format

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.210
for rural systems in their organization,

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:45.910
and a procedure for
selecting one instantiation

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:48.130
of the format over another,

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:50.760
in terms of its success in capturing

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.320
authentic linguistic generalizations

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.630
and empirical notion that incorporates

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.340
also a kind of a theory internal version

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.620
of standard best theory considerations.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.420
The rules themselves at the beginning

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.420
were adaptations of informal
traditional notions,

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:14.000
which had proven to be utterly inadequate

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.790
when they were subjected
to close examination.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:20.500
So that meant for
example rules for forming

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.170
relative clauses in Hungarian or passives,

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.360
or in Japanese or positives

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.823
and the Romance languages and so on.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.280
The general approach did
offer a kind of solution

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.070
to the core problem of
the study of language,

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:38.620
sometimes called in the literature,

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.720
the logical problem of
language acquisition

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.500
that is how does the initial state map

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.020
constructed experience,
to the final state.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:53.020
But as was emphasized, that
solution holds only in principle

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:58.140
because in practice the
conception was unfeasible

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:02.590
because of the astronomical
computational demands.

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.890
Well, from about 40 years ago

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:08.400
attempts were made to reduce
the scale of the problem

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.550
by seeking valid general principles

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.910
that can be abstracted
from particular grammars

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:17.450
and attributed the
universe grammar meaning

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:22.450
to the initial state of the
language faculty leaving residue

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:25.703
that might be more manageable.

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.893
Actually some of those
proposals were kind of proposals

01:06:29.893 --> 01:06:32.380
that were then being explored.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.263
I reviewed in the lectures
here 35 years ago,

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:38.960
after that time, by then already

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.770
there was some progress after that time

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.850
then considerable progress,

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.410
but it still left the tension unresolved.

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:46.930
That as the general picture

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:49.630
was somehow fundamentally defective,

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.140
there was no true
solution, feasible solution

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.010
to the logical problem
of language acquisition.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:59.470
Well, a possible resolution
of the tension was reached

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:02.700
after a good deal of
effort about 20 years ago,

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.570
with the crystallization
of a picture of language

01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.540
that marked a very sharp break

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.980
from a long and rich tradition

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.610
of tracing back to
classical Indian and Greece,

01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:17.980
is sometimes called the
principles and parameters approach

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.220
that dispenses entirely
with the core notions

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.310
of traditional grammar notions,

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:27.100
like grammatical construction
or grammatical rule.

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.250
From this point of view,

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:34.070
categories such as a relative
clause or passive construction

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.680
are understood to be real enough,

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.520
but only as taxonomic artifacts.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.560
So for example, aquatic organisms

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.610
which would include say
dolphins, trout, eels

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:49.110
and some bacteria it's a category

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:51.670
but not a biological category.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:56.330
The phenomena, the phenomenal
properties of these artifacts

01:07:56.330 --> 01:07:59.730
result from the interaction
of invariant principles

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.280
of the initial State, Faculty of language

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.550
with parameters that are
finite number of parameters

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.640
fixed in one or another way.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.240
It would incidentally follow

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.460
that there are only finitely
many possible human languages

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:18.040
apart from idiosyncrasies
and choice of lexical items,

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.950
and even these are sharply constrained.

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:23.980
That means that the problem
of unfeasible search

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:28.940
is eliminated it's a major
conclusion if correct.

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.140
The conception has now been applied

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.450
to typologically different languages

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:38.350
of just about every known kind,

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:41.583
it's led to many discoveries
a host of new questions

01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:44.010
that were never before contemplated

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:46.960
sometimes suggestive answers.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.080
This principles and parameters approach

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.383
is an approach, it's not a theory.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:57.040
Within the general approach,
there are many diverse theories

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.060
there is actually a very good introduction

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.800
to the topic just published by Mark Baker,

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.470
called Atoms of Language
he himself has made

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:08.120
major contributions to the approach,

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.420
that he's been working
primarily on languages

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.630
that appear to be at opposite ends

01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:16.540
of the spectrum of
typological possibilities,

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.890
picking that on purpose of course.

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.700
Mohawk and English that's the pair

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.100
that he studied most intensively,

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.760
trying to show that
although they are about

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:30.350
as different phenomenally
as two languages can be,

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:33.220
there in reality virtually identical

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:37.170
apart from very small
changes in a few parameters,

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:40.020
so that's a Martian observer

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:44.190
who views humans as we
view other organisms,

01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:48.430
would conclude that they're
essentially identical

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:51.550
dialectal variants of the same language.

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:54.810
There's been extensive
work of a similar character

01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:58.340
carried out worldwide with
quite revealing results.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.590
One major program funded
by the European Union

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:05.880
is studying the vast number
of languages in Europe,

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.800
huge number in fact misleadingly called,

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:12.050
things like German and Italian and so on

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.480
though they're totally
different languages.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.280
Included by those in
those characterizations

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.490
and it's happening being
done elsewhere as well.

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:25.280
I don't wanna suggest that the
approach has been established

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.210
that's very far from true,

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.970
but it has been very successful
as a research program

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:35.430
as a stimulus to empirical
and theoretical inquiry

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:37.900
that progress towards
the goals of descriptive

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.760
and explanatory adequacy,
has far surpassed anything

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.610
that precedes, that not
only in depth of analysis

01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:47.260
of particular languages,

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:50.610
but also in the range of
typologically different languages

01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:52.650
that have been investigated.

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:56.180
And also a new areas
of linguistic structure

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.030
that had barely been explored before.

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:03.430
Related fields such as the
study of language acquisition

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.780
have also been completely revitalized

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.270
within a similar framework, they now look

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:12.593
totally unlike anything that
was around 20 or 30 years ago.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.930
There are some important
steps towards convergence

01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:21.270
although it's certainly gonna
be a long and difficult course

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.240
even if the approach turns out

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.440
to be more or less on the right track,

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.350
we're far from having a clear idea

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:31.370
of what the principles and
parameters actually are.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:34.320
But I think it's fair to say
that the study of language

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.060
in the last 20 years, has
moved to an entirely new plane.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.200
Well, I wanna pick up
these topics tomorrow

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.040
and then move on to the issues,

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.485
particularly the role of the third fact

01:11:47.485 --> 01:11:49.310
there are general properties of organisms

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:51.360
and say something about that.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.070
And then to move on to the work called

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:56.700
the questions of intentionality,

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.800
now that is the question of
how language now understood

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.440
within the by linguistic framework

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.213
relates to the rest of the world.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:09.364
(audience applauding)

01:12:21.429 --> 01:12:24.380
- Professor Chomsky has agreed
to take a couple of questions

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.253
that were submitted by the audience.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.980
Since these questions were submitted

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.100
at the beginning of the lecture,

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.720
they may not have been part
of what's covered today,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.647
it might be a sneak preview of tomorrow.

01:12:44.647 --> 01:12:47.137
"Do you still believe that
the human language faculty

01:12:47.137 --> 01:12:50.707
"evolved all at once in a
sudden evolutionary leap?

01:12:50.707 --> 01:12:52.797
"Doesn't this conflict
with the general finding

01:12:52.797 --> 01:12:54.537
"that evolution is gradual?"

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.790
- This idea sometimes
called the monster mutation

01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:03.420
was invented as far as I'm
aware by Elizabeth Bates,

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.750
and has been repeated
by many other people,

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:07.550
that's been attributed
to me for some reason

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.280
I haven't got the slightest idea why,

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.490
I've never said a word about it.

01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:14.870
And I have no idea whether it's true

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:18.490
nor does anyone know anything
about these topics in general.

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:19.720
Why it was invented,

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.068
why it was attributed to me
you can try to figure out.

01:13:23.068 --> 01:13:25.260
The fact of the matter is no one knows

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.080
anything about these things,

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.050
even for much simpler questions.

01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:33.867
So for example there, one well-known fact

01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:37.360
about biological organisms

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.810
is they all you know
above the level bacteria,

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.030
they all seem to have essentially

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:45.940
the same body type, same body forms.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.940
And it's now kind of
understood how that works

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.760
certain regulatory genes
have been master genes

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.960
have been discovered
that create the forums

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.740
and it just runs through the
whole organic world of animals.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.050
Well very recent work, actually
a couple of papers in nature

01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:08.190
just a few weeks ago, show

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:11.140
laboratory experimental work

01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.870
that shows how this might have happened

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.870
in one monster mutation.

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:17.910
Well, okay maybe maybe not.

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:22.910
There's recent work about the
evolution of the human brain

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.940
articles in science a couple of weeks ago,

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:30.540
suggesting in fact that one
small mutation took place

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.740
which suddenly led to
explosion of brain cells.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.190
Maybe, maybe not these are you know,

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:38.250
I don't have anything to
say about these matters,

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.810
I just repeat what's in
the technical literature.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:45.090
But why this conception
was attributed to me

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:47.920
is a total mystery as far as I know.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.310
- I hope this is not at
the same you like it,

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.457
so do you still question again.

01:14:51.457 --> 01:14:54.577
"Do you still view language
as self-contained module

01:14:54.577 --> 01:14:56.647
"that is independent of
other cognitive systems?

01:14:56.647 --> 01:14:59.437
"Wouldn't it be simple to
assume that language ability

01:14:59.437 --> 01:15:01.807
"is grounded in the same
cognitive mechanisms

01:15:01.807 --> 01:15:04.490
"as other forms of human cognition?"

01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:08.240
- Well, I take for granted
that the human language,

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.410
I mean it's kind of like asking

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:12.540
whether the visual system is distinct

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.390
from other systems of the body.

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:17.560
Of course it isn't or
say the immune system.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.040
Of course, it's not distinct
from the rest of the body

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.600
like you can't cut the immune system out

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.080
and leave the rest of the
body, I mean it's impossible.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.840
Every subsystem of the body

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.600
that's isolated for a particular inquiry

01:15:32.490 --> 01:15:34.630
is isolated because it has a kind

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.970
of an integrated character,

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:37.870
and you think you can
learn something about it.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:39.960
It doesn't mean that it's in a little box

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.350
that you can pull out, right?

01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:44.450
So the immune systems in every cell,

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:46.160
but it's still a system.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.730
And presumably the same is
true of the language faculty.

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:53.730
I mean, it's brings together,
many different components

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.910
which come from all over the place,

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:59.420
for example the language faculty

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.320
what you and I are now doing,

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.320
makes essential use of
the delicate architecture

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.910
of the bones in the middle year, okay.

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:12.010
They're terrific for wonderfully designed

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:13.930
for understanding language.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:15.860
Of course they evolved for reasons

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.291
having absolutely nothing
to do with language,

01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:22.460
they evolved from the
fact that they apparently

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:27.340
that the skulls of early mammals
about 160 million years ago

01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.760
were getting bigger,
and as they got bigger

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.310
blowing in the reptilian
jaw started migrate

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.540
and for mechanical reasons apparently,

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:38.200
it ended up in the middle of the ear

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.232
which turns out to be great for language.

01:16:40.232 --> 01:16:43.250
And the same is true of, it could,

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.330
I mean the computational principles

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:47.147
that are at the core of language,

01:16:47.147 --> 01:16:48.920
and we might discover that those

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.800
are the same computational principles

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.420
that are used by insects for navigation,

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.870
if we did that the fascinating discovery,

01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.850
would mean that it's one of the things

01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:01.440
that was recruited to
form the language faculty.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.860
The idea that the language
faculty is isolated

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.190
from other cognitive systems

01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:08.530
just makes no sense at all, can't be.

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:13.010
I mean we use the language
faculty to express our thoughts

01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:16.830
to think to ourselves to communicate,

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:20.450
to have and communicate
attitudes, to perceive the world.

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:24.160
Of course, it's integrated
with the entire collection

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.520
of cognitive faculties
and other faculties.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.830
Again, the interesting question

01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:31.590
that should be asked about that question

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:34.130
is why it says do I still believe,

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:36.650
because nobody could
possibly believe this.

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:39.650
There's a huge mythology
about these things

01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:41.280
which has been developed.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.420
It's kind of characteristic of studies

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.740
of human higher mental faculties.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.870
They are pursued at a
level of irrationality

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:53.913
that is just hard to deal with.

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:59.890
In fact centuries ago, the hard sciences

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:02.120
were dealt with in a similar way,

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.220
but we should be able to escape from that.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.840
- [Moderator] Have your
views regarding poverty

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.123
of the stimulus change in
light of these studies?

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:13.658
- There are no such studies.

01:18:13.658 --> 01:18:15.945
(audience laughing)

01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:19.440
All studies show what
everybody knows in advance,

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.810
that the amount of data available

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:25.020
for language acquisition
is extremely small.

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.710
This notion of poverty of
stimulus is a little bit

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:30.450
like what I call the
innateness hypothesis.

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:33.180
Everyone believes in poverty of stimulus,

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.513
not only for language but for everything.

01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:40.790
There was a certain
embryo once upon a time

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:43.460
that turned into my granddaughter okay.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.113
Why didn't it turn into a worm let's say?

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:50.880
I mean is it because of
the nutritional input?

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.830
Like what a different nutritional input

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:56.850
to the cell have turned it into a worm?

01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:59.710
Well you know, nobody even
takes questions seriously

01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:01.080
they're so idiotic.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.260
What is assumed automatically
by every scientist

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.813
is what's called poverty of the stimulus,

01:19:07.813 --> 01:19:09.910
in the case of language.

01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:11.280
It's considered controversial

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.430
in the case of human mental faculties,

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:17.130
but taken for granted
without even any discussion

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:20.050
throughout the rest of biology
because it's so obvious.

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:21.870
I mean it cannot possibly be that

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:29.150
what you and I are now
doing, is based on early

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:31.740
or for that matter late
input for the environment

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.220
because there isn't any, virtually none.

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.860
In fact, it's easy to demonstrate

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.100
that the things that even a young child do

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.430
have a statistical level that is barely

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:47.430
at the point of noise
in an actual discourse.

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:49.530
The point is kind of obvious,

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:51.620
there's nothing to discuss about it.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:56.580
Everyone agrees that there
is poverty of the stimulus,

01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:00.890
the only question is well
what is the initial state

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:05.460
that in fact, first of all
structures data as experience

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.450
which is no trivial task,

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:11.420
and then takes that experience
and almost instantaneously

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.600
and reflexively as Gallistel points out,

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.820
constructs an attained
state, that's the problem.

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.770
Somebody has some ideas
about it, be my guest

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:23.403
it's a great topic.

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:26.110
- [Moderator] You have
suggested that human beings

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:28.890
possess a language acquisition device,

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:31.683
is this device a real
entity or a metaphor?

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.720
- Well, kind of like asking
whether the genetic endowment

01:20:38.530 --> 01:20:40.170
that leads to an immune system

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.033
is a real system or a metaphor.

01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:45.800
I mean we end up doing
what you and I are...

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.270
Well, let's go back to my granddaughter

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:49.693
and her imagined pet chimpanzee.

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.050
Let's suppose that the two of them

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:55.480
are exposed to exactly the same data okay.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.080
One of them ends up doing what you and I

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.813
are now doing, the other one does nothing.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.480
Suppose that she also happens
to have a pet bee, okay.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.890
Well, the pet bee and my granddaughter

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:10.590
exposed to the same visual data

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.300
in the case of the bee, it'll end up

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:17.300
with a complicated intricate
system of communication,

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.830
the humans can't possibly duplicate

01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:22.770
it's way beyond their cognitive capacities

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:26.030
to communicate the distance and height

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:29.750
and quality of a flower,
humans simply can't do that

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.970
but the bee does it reflexively.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:34.850
Well, observing facts like that,

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:37.770
every scientist just takes for granted,

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:40.810
there's something special
about my granddaughter,

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:43.470
or the bee and the chimpanzee

01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:48.470
which uses the same data to end
up in very different states.

01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:52.100
And unless it's miracles,

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.610
that has to do with
their genetic endowment.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.050
So, therefore we can talk about

01:21:58.170 --> 01:21:59.750
a language acquisition device

01:22:02.283 --> 01:22:04.700
a chimpanzee call acquisition device,

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.700
a bee communication acquisition device

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.810
these aren't metaphors,

01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:11.720
these are just descriptions
of sub components

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.530
of an organism which
you try to understand,

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.290
there's nothing metaphoric about them

01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:19.090
and there really should be
nothing controversial about them.

01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:22.320
I mean unless one thinks that the bee,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.190
the chimpanzee and my granddaughter

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:27.260
should end up the same
way with the same data,

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:28.780
unless anybody thinks that,

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:31.283
then the answer should be obvious.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.950
- [Moderator] Is there any
evidence of evolutionary change

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.340
in the historical record
of human language?

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.260
- No, that's why I mentioned
before the current,

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:44.780
at least current understanding is that

01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:49.040
there's extremely little
genetic variation among humans

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.750
as compared with other primates.

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:55.400
Meaning which can only, is taken to mean

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.780
that we're basically all kind of cousins

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.460
coming from the same small
breeding group not very long ago

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.490
like a 100, 1,000 or 200,000 years

01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:08.950
is essentially nothing
in evolutionary time.

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:11.030
There's been no time for any evolution

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:15.250
nobody knows exactly when
language got into the picture,

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:18.280
but probably about the same time

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.083
roughly plus or minus a 100,000 years.

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.790
And there's been just no time

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:27.040
for any evolutionary change to take place,

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.033
that's why say my granddaughter

01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:32.020
and don't know why I'm focused on her.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.160
But my granddaughter if she'd grown up

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.940
say in Tokyo, would be
talking perfect Japanese

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.950
because she's genetically identical

01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:42.630
to the kids who grow up in Tokyo,

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:44.380
as far as this capacity

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.570
or probably just about
every capacity is concerned.

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:51.260
So then if that's true, there
can't have been evolutionary

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:53.150
any meaningful evolutionary change

01:23:53.150 --> 01:23:56.520
in the history in the
brief history of language,

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.773
it's just way too short.

01:23:59.010 --> 01:23:59.980
- [Moderator] Now this is the last,

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.690
and it's a very open-ended question

01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:04.127
so feel free to ignore
it or do what you like.

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:07.107
"what details are results
of current neuroscience

01:24:07.107 --> 01:24:10.427
"bear on your current biologically
based language theories."

01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:14.930
- Well currently neuroscience is providing

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:17.930
some new ideas, not so much neuroscience

01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:22.320
as new techniques, for example imaging,

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.170
brain imaging is providing

01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:27.930
rather interesting suggestive results

01:24:27.930 --> 01:24:30.650
you know FMRI and things like that.

01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:32.710
You don't exactly what to make of them

01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:36.040
because you know these are investigating

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.040
systems that are just not understood

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:43.080
on the basis of signals that
are detected from the outside.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.130
Some of the results are
quite in a way startling,

01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:49.220
so for example Proceedings

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.020
of the National Academy of Sciences,

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.610
just recently a couple of
months ago published a paper

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:57.120
by Laura Patito, an investigator

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.753
who's was in Montreal now and Dartmouth.

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:05.470
She apparently has seems to have shown

01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:10.470
that sign language, the
deaf children who use sign,

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:17.220
the neural centres that are
involved in processing the sign

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.530
are close to identical,
as far as you can tell,

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:24.000
identical with those of hearing infants

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.320
who are processing auditory input.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.410
That's a very surprising result.

01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:30.840
I mean a little less surprising

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.930
than it would have been 20 years ago

01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:35.410
because work has shown that these systems

01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:39.440
are very similar in many
structural respects.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.660
But that there neurally
represented in the same place

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.830
is quite interesting, if it's true

01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:48.090
it would mean that whatever
our Faculty of language is

01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:51.110
it's probably independent of modality,

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:54.730
sensory modality, some
analytic computing system

01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:58.760
that could use one modality or another.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.680
The fact that say vision and hearing

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.280
end up analyzed in the same place

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.480
is a little bit surprising,

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.920
because of what's known
about the projection

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.350
of sensory systems into the cortex.

01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:12.761
But that kind of inquiry
is pretty interesting

01:26:12.761 --> 01:26:16.960
and suggestive, and there is
work of that kind coming along.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.810
As for neuroscience itself,

01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:21.690
remember that very little is known.

01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:24.450
I mean, I quoted the encyclopedia,

01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:27.860
the current edition of
the MIT encyclopedia

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.510
of cognitive neuroscience is pointing out

01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:34.890
that we do not understand
the neurophysiology

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:38.400
of even the most elementary computations,

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.710
that are used throughout the animal world,

01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:42.730
say for insect navigation.

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.430
Even the simplest ones,
the neurophysiology

01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:47.750
is completely obscure.

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:49.940
When you try to get to human language

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.010
you're off in some in
outer space somewhere.

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:56.420
It's an important problem maybe
someday it'll be understood,

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.570
but it's pretty remote.

01:26:58.690 --> 01:26:59.523
- [Moderator] Well, thank you very much

01:26:59.523 --> 01:27:01.695
for a most stimulating lecture.

01:27:01.695 --> 01:27:04.695
(audience clapping)

01:27:08.225 --> 01:27:10.808
(upbeat music)
