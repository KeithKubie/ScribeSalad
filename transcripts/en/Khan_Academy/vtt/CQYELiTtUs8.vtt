00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.200
In this video, I want
to talk a little bit

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.060
about Newton's
First Law of Motion.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.730
And this is a translation from
Newton's Principia from Latin

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.710
into English.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.600
So the First Law,
"Every body persists

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.090
in a state of being at
rest, or moving uniformly

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.190
straightforward, except
insofar as it is compelled

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.910
to change its state
by force impressed."

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.240
So another way to rephrase
what they're saying

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.610
is, that if there's something--
every body persists--

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.860
so everything will
stay at rest, or

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.240
moving with a constant
velocity, unless it

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.050
is compelled to change
its state by force.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.420
Unless it's acted on by a force,
especially an unbalanced force.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000
and I'll explain
that in a second.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720
So if I have something that's
at rest, so completely at rest.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.840
So I have-- and
this is something

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.840
that we've seen before.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.150
Let's say that I have a rock.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.720
Let's say that I
have a rock someplace

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.210
and it's laying on
a field of grass,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.005
I can keep observing that rock.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.966
And it is unlikely
to move, assuming

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.090
that nothing happens to it.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.310
If there's no force
applied to that rock,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310
that rock will just stay there.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.260
So the first part
is pretty obvious.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.599
So, "Every body persists in
a state of being at rest"--

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.140
I'm not going to do
the second part--

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.150
"except insofar as there's some
force being applied to it."

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.710
So clearly a rock
will be at rest,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.330
unless there's some force
applied to it, unless someone

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.110
here tries to push it or roll
it or do something to it.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.730
What's less intuitive about the
first law is the second part.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.270
"Every body persists in,"
either, "being in a state

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.300
of rest or moving
uniformly straight forward,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.390
except insofar as
it is compelled

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.620
to change its state
by force impressed."

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.057
So this Newton's
first law-- and I

00:01:55.057 --> 00:01:56.640
think I should do a
little aside here,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.450
because, this right
here is Newton.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.890
And if this is
Newton's first law,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.610
why do I have this huge
picture of this guy over here?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.370
Well, the reason is is because
Newton's first law is really

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.600
just a restatement of
this guy's law of inertia.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.490
And this guy, another
titan of civilization

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.170
really, this is Galileo Galilei.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.880
And he is the first person to
formulate the law of inertia.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.460
And Newton just rephrased it
a little bit and packaged it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.630
with his other laws.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.500
But he did many, many,
many other things.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.520
So you really have
to give Galileo

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.130
credit for Newton's first law.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.460
So that's why I made
him bigger than here.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.260
But I was in the
midst of a thought.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.140
So we understand if
something is at rest,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.889
it's going to stay at
rest, unless there's

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.120
some force that acts on it.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.578
And in some
definitions, you'll see

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:44.270
unless there's some
unbalanced force.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.380
And the reason why
they say unbalanced

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.210
is, because you could have two
forces that act on something

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.930
and they might balance out.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.710
For example, I could push
on this side of the rock

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.094
with a certain amount of force.

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:56.760
And if you push on
this side of the rock

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.630
with the exact same amount of
force, the rock won't move.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.470
And the only way that it would
move if there's a lot more

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.510
force on one side than
on the other side,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.380
so if you have an
unbalanced force.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.760
So if you have a ton
of-- and maybe the rock

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680
is a bad analogy.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.030
Let's take ice, because ice is
easier to move, or ice on ice.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.099
So there's ice right here.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.640
And then, I have
another block of ice

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.820
sitting on top of that ice.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.790
So once again, we're
familiar with the idea,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.760
if there's no force acting
on it that ice won't move.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.177
But what happens if
I'm pushing on the ice

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:31.010
with a certain amount
of force on that side,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.950
and you're pushing on
the ice on that side

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.620
with the same amount of force?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.690
The ice will still not move.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.120
So this right here, this
would be a balanced force.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.630
So the only way for the ice to
change its condition, to change

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.980
its restful condition is
if the force is unbalanced.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.200
So if we add a little bit
of force on this side,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.920
so it more than compensates
the force pushing it this way,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.730
then you're going to see
the ice block start to move,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.160
start to really accelerate
in that direction.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.584
But I think this
part is obvious.

00:04:05.584 --> 00:04:07.250
This, you know,
something that's at rest

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.300
will stay at rest, unless
it's being acted on

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.050
by an unbalanced force.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.200
What's less obvious is
the idea that something

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.690
moving uniformly
straightforward, which

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.135
is another way of
saying something

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:19.259
having a constant velocity.

00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:24.170
What he's saying is,
is that something

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.240
that has a constant
velocity will continue

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.560
to have that constant
velocity indefinitely,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.290
unless it is acted on
by an unbalanced force.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.590
And that's less intuitive.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.970
Because everything in
our human experience--

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.430
even if I were to push
this block of ice,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.700
eventually it'll stop.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.510
It won't just keep
going forever, even

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.460
assuming that this ice field
is infinitely long, that ice

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.890
will eventually stop.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.020
Or if I throw a tennis ball.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.380
That tennis ball
will eventually stop.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.080
It'll eventually
grind to a halt.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.336
Or if I roll a bowling
ball, or if I, anything.

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.460
We've never seen, at least
in our human experience,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.510
it looks like everything
will eventually stop.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.350
So this is a very
unintuitive thing to say,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.820
that something in
motion will just

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.940
keep going in
motion indefinitely.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.430
Everything in human intuition
says if you want something

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.910
to keep going in
motion, you have to keep

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.595
putting more force, keep
putting more energy into it

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:23.470
for it to keep going.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.490
Your car won't go
forever, unless you keep,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.810
unless the engine keeps burning
fuel to drive and consuming

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.310
energy.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.927
So what are they talking about?

00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:33.510
Well, in all of these
examples-- and I

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.040
think this is actually a pretty
brilliant insight from all

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.630
of these fellows is
that-- all of these things

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.090
would have gone on forever.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.540
The ball would
keep going forever.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.970
This ice block would
be going on forever,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.200
except for the fact that
there are unbalanced

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.000
forces acting on
them to stop them.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.489
So in the case of ice,
even though ice on ice

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.030
doesn't have a lot
of friction, there

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.460
is some friction
between these two.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.050
And so you have,
in this situation,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.150
the force of friction
is going to be

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.560
acting against the direction
of the movement of the ice.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.930
And friction really comes
from, at an atomic level--

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.570
so if you have the actual
water molecules in a lattice

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.775
structure in the ice
cube, and then here are

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:17.130
the water molecules in a
lattice structure on the ice,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.810
on the actual kind of sea of
ice that it's traveling on--

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.769
they do kind of bump and
grind into each other.

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:25.226
Although they're both smooth,
there are imperfections here.

00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:26.140
They bump and grind.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.080
They generate a
little bit of heat.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.310
And they'll, essentially, be
working against the movement.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.810
So there's a force of friction
that's being applied to here.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.620
And that's why it's stopping.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.203
Not only a force of
friction, you also

00:06:37.203 --> 00:06:38.480
have some air resistance.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.560
The ice block is
going to be bumping

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.570
into all sorts of air particles.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.660
It might not be
noticeable at first,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.390
but it's definitely going to
keep it from going on forever.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.460
Same thing with the ball
being tossed to the air.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.380
Obviously, at some
point, it hits

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.810
the ground because of gravity.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.200
So that's one
force acting on it.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.700
But even once it
hits the ground,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.990
it doesn't keep rolling
forever, once again,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.670
because of the friction,
especially if there's grass

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.260
here.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.290
The grass is going to
stop it from going.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.779
And even while it's in the
air, it's going to slow down.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:08.570
It's not going to have
a constant velocity.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.710
Because you have all
of these air particles

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.750
that are going to
bump into it and exert

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.646
force to slow it down.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.520
So what was really
brilliant about these guys

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.060
is that they could
imagine a reality where

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.610
you didn't have gravity,
where you did not

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.850
have air slowing things down.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.100
And they could imagine
that in that reality,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.960
something would just keep
persisting in its motion.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.416
And the reason why Galileo,
frankly, was probably good

00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.790
at thinking about
that is that he

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.130
studied the orbits of planets.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.050
And he could, or at
least he's probably

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.431
theorized that, hey, maybe
there's no air out there.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.430
And that maybe that's why
these planets can just

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.780
keep going round
and round in orbit.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.500
And I should say their speed,
because their direction is

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.540
changing, but their
speed never slows down,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.810
because there's
nothing in the space

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.572
to actually slow
down those planets.

00:08:01.572 --> 00:08:04.030
So anyway, hopefully you found
that as fascinating as I do.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.410
Because on some level,
it's super-duper obvious.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.743
But on a whole other level,
it's completely not obvious,

00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:10.910
especially this moving
uniformly straightforward.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.470
And just to make
the point clear,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.270
if gravity disappeared,
and you had no air,

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.900
and you threw a ball,
that ball literally

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.950
would keep going
in that direction

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.980
forever, unless some other
unbalanced force acted

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.390
to stop it.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.790
And another way to think
about it-- and this

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.270
is an example that you might
see in everyday life-- is,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:38.600
if I'm in an airplane
that's going at a completely

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.880
constant velocity and
there's absolutely

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.960
no turbulence in the airplane.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.790
So if I'm sitting in the
airplane right over here.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:51.250
And it's going at a constant
velocity, completely smooth,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.490
no turbulence.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.647
There's really no way for me to
tell whether that airplane is

00:08:55.647 --> 00:08:57.230
moving without looking
out the window.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.480
Let's assume that there's
no windows in that airplane.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.110
It's going at a
constant velocity.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.390
And there's no turbulence.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.380
And let's say, I
can't hear anything.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.780
So I can't even
hear the engines.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.870
There's no way for me to sense
that the plane is moving.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.950
Because from my
frame of reference,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.290
it looks completely
identical to if I

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.622
was in that same plane that
was resting on the ground.

00:09:18.622 --> 00:09:20.330
And that's another
way to think about it.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.110
That it's actually
very intuitive

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.920
that they're similar states,
moving at a constant velocity

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.480
or being at rest.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.290
And you really can't
tell whether you

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.477
are one or the other.
