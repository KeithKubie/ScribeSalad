00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.210
The challenge begins with how to pronounce
his name.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.650
The first bit should sound like ‘Knee’, the second like ‘cha’

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.860
Knee – cha.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.620
Then we need to get past some of his extraordinary
and provocative statements:

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.380
‘What doesn’t kill me makes
me stronger’

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.070
‘God is dead! And we have killed him.'

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.330
And his large moustache.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.960
But when we do, we’ll discover a thinker
who is intermittently enchanting, wise and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.509
very helpful.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.990
Friedrich Nietzsche was born in 1844 in a
quiet village in the eastern part of Germany

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.120
where his father was the priest.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.470
He did exceptionally well at school and university and so excelled at

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.530
ancient Greek that he was made a professor

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.050
at the University of Basel

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.390
when still only in his mid-twenties.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.590
But his official career didn’t work out.
He got fed up with his fellow academics, gave

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.860
up his job and moved to Sils Maria in the
Swiss alps

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.570
where he lived quietly, working on his masterpieces,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.340
among them:

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.220
The Birth of Tragedy,
Human, All Too Human,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.260
The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.960
Beyond Good and Evil,
On the Genealogy of Morals,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.780
He had lots of problems:
- he didn’t get on with his family:

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.599
'I don’t like my mother and it’s painful
even for me to hear my sister’s voice.’

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.790
- women kept rejecting him.
- his books didn’t sell

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.360
- And when he was only forty-four, he had
a mental breakdown, precipitated when he saw

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.390
a horse in a Turin street being beaten by its driver

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.740
and ran over to embrace him shouting
'I understand you'. He never recovered and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700
died eleven sad years later.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.900
But his philosophy was full of heroism and
grandeur.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.960
He was a prophet of what he called: SELBSTÜBERWINDUNG

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.460
or SELF-OVERCOMING, the process by which a great-souled

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.920
person - what he called an ÜBERMENSCH 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.979
rises above their
circumstances and difficulties to embrace

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.260
whatever life throws at them.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.210
He wanted his work to teach us, as he put
it, ‘how to become who we really are’.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.510
His thought centers around 4 main recommendations:

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.979
Own up to envy

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.210
Envy is – Nietzsche recognised – a big
part of life. Yet the lingering effects of

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.990
Christianity generally teaches to be feel ashamed

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.080
of our envious feelings. They seem an

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.880
indication of evil. So we hide them from ourselves
and others

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.750
Yet there is nothing wrong with envy, maintained
Nietzsche, so long as we use it as a guide

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.889
to what we really want. Every person who makes
us envious should be seen as an indication

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.239
of what we could one day become. The envy-inducing
writer, tycoon

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.419
or chef is hinting at who you are capable of one day being.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.399
It's not that Nietzsche believed we always end up getting what we want. His own life

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.749
had taught him this well enough). He simply
insisted that we must face up to our true

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:40.329
desires, put up a heroic fight to honour them,
and only then mourn failure with solemn dignity.

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.129
That is what it means to be an ÜBERMENSCH

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.450
2. Don’t be a Christian

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.200
Nietzsche had some extreme things to say about Christianity

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.719
‘In the entire New Testament, there

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.399
is only person worth respecting: Pilate, the
Roman governor.’

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.400
It was knockabout stuff, but his true target
was more subtle and more interesting: he resented

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.719
Christianity for protecting people from their
envy.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.749
Christianity had in Nietzsche’s account
emerged in the late Roman Empire

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.669
in the minds of timid slaves, who had lacked the stomach

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.959
to get hold of what they really wanted 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.219
and so had clung to a philosophy that made a virtue of their cowardice.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.870
He called this SKLAVENMORAL

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.219
Christians - whom he rather rudely termed
DIE HEERDE, the herd - had wished to

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.540
enjoy the real ingredients of fulfilment (a
position in the world, sex,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.260
intellectual mastery, creativity)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.939
but had been too inept
to get them.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.900
They had therefore fashioned a hypocritical
creed denouncing what

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.249
they wanted but were too weak to fight for

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.639
 – while praising what they did not want but happened

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.519
to have. So, in the Christian value system, sexlessness

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.359
turned into purity [show text changing] weakness
became goodness, submission-to-people-one-hates

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.799
became obedience and, in Nietzsche’s phrase,
“not-being-able-to-take-revenge” turned

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.580
into “forgiveness.”

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.599
Christianity amounted to a giant machine for
bitter denial.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.720
3. Never drink alcohol

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.159
Nietzsche himself drank only water – and
as a special treat, milk. And he thought we

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.969
should do likewise. He wasn’t making a small,

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.280
eccentric dietary point. The idea went to
the heart of his philosophy, as contained

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.240
in his declaration: ‘There have been two
great narcotics in European civilisation:

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.700
Christianity and alcohol.’

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.380
He hated alcohol for the very same reasons
that he scorned Christianity: because both

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.199
numb pain, and both reassure us that things
are just fine as they are, sapping us of the

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.590
will to change our lives for the better. A
few drinks usher in a transient feeling of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.090
satisfaction that can get fatally in the way
of taking the steps necessary to improve our

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.479
lives.

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.460
Nietzsche was obsessed with the awkward truth
that getting really valuable things done hurts.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.080
“How little you know of human happiness
- you comfortable people” he wrote

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.009
“The secret of a fulfilled life is: live

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.419
dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes
of Mount Vesuvius!”

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.140
4. “God is Dead”

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.720
Nietzsche’s dramatic assertion that God
is dead is not, as it’s often taken to be,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.640
some kind of a celebratory statement.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.840
Despite his reservations about Christianity,
Nietzsche did not think that the end of belief

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.929
was anything to cheer about.

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:21.960
Religious beliefs were false, he knew; but
he observed that they were very beneficial

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.060
in the sense of helping us cope with the problems
of life.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.220
Nietzsche felt that the gap left by religion
should ideally be filled by Culture (he meant:

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.700
philosophy, art, music, literature): Culture should replace Scripture.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.600
However, Nietzsche was deeply suspicious of
the way his own era was handling culture.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.000
He believed the universities were killing the humanities,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.800
turning them into dry academic exercises,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.900
rather than using them for what they were always meant to be:

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.699
guides to life. He admired

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.680
the way the Greeks had used tragic drama in a practical, therapeutic way,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.650
as an occasion for catharsis and moral education
– and wished his own age to be comparably

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.789
ambitious.

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.580
He called for a reformation, in which people
– newly conscious of the crisis brought

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.960
on by the end of faith – would fill the
gaps created by the disappearance of religion

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.760
with philosophy and art.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.680
Every era faces particular psychological challenges,
thought Nietzsche, and it is the task of the

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.000
philosopher to identify, and help solve, these.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.939
For Nietzsche, the 19th century was reeling under the impact

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.580
of two developments: Mass Democracy 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.469
and Atheism. The first

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.620
threatened to unleash torrents of undigested
envy; the second to

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.400
leave humans without guidance or morality.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.860
In relation to both challenges, Nietzsche
remains our endearing, fascinating often loveable

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.800
and moustachioed guide.
