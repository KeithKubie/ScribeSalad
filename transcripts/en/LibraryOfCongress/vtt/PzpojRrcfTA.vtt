&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER:
It is my pleasure

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.390
to introduce Paul Holbrook to
our [inaudible] lecture series.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.870
It's. Today we have here Dr.
Paul Evans Holbrook to speak

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.950
to us about the victor
[inaudible] collection

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.150
and there is perhaps no
one more knowledgeable

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.490
about victor [inaudible] than
Mr. Holbrook, Dr. Holbrook.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.530
He became close friends
with Caroline about 2 years

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.080
after victor passed away
and he was instrumental

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.390
in getting the victor
[inaudible] collection,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.510
victor and Caroline
[inaudible] collection here

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.530
to the library of congress.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.230
This all started about, well at
least for us here, our interest

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.070
and our relationship with Paul
started about 4 years ago.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.130
He stopped by to pick
up some materials

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.480
from the collection itself
and as he was going through,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.350
it was just, he was,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.960
it's obvious he was the
curator for the collection.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.660
He's picking up [inaudible]
and saying yes,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.740
this is the mantel piece that
belongs in the church and I,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
when I picked my job off
the floor, I was, you know,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.150
I was really thrilled that
somebody knew the collection

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.190
so well and then at the same
time I was really disappointed

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.920
that he was on a flight
back to Kentucky that night.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.410
And so, we've been working with
Paul to reclass the collection

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.820
and this is why it's so
important that he's back here

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.340
to help us, to help
us understand,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.360
to help curate this
collection, get it in front

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.730
of the people who
need to see it.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.060
So, we have a keepsake that
you're holding right now.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.340
This is from the crooked crow
press, Chris Manson's press,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.260
and he's part of APHA,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.730
the American Print
History Association.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.990
And so, you may see that we have
2 dates on here; April 26th,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.110
of course today, and
April 27th, tomorrow.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.020
Tomorrow, Dr. Holbrook
will be giving a talk

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.710
to APHA specifically and that's
why you'll see 2 dates on there.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.600
We're not missing anything
or that wasn't a typo.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.900
Though don't look too closely

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.360
because we set some
of the [inaudible].

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.460
This is a beautiful
piece despite the fact

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.090
that [inaudible] helped
produce it, but not because of.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.480
So, Dr. Holbrook edited
a collection of letter

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.400
between the [inaudible]
and Thomas [inaudible].

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.890

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.320

work and legacy as a printer

and director of the
King Press Library

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.880
at the university of Kentucky.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.510
Please help me to welcome
Dr. Paul Evans Holbrook.

[ Background noise ]

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.080
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Thank you very much.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.430
Raise your hand if
you can't hear me.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.630
Am I all right with you?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.790
Tomorrow, I'm talking mostly

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.340
about printing types although a
few other things will work their

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.040
way in and today I'm talking
not so much about victor's work

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.690
as a typographer and printer,
but will be happy to do

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.870
so in discussion with you
after my presentation.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.010
Today my hope is to introduce
you to victor [inaudible]

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.430
and his work and then when I
have done so, you will feel

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.960
as if you have met him.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.850
In a letter of May, the 25st,
1951, the poet Wallace Stevens

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.140
with whom [inaudible] had
an extensive correspondence

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.230
and for whom victor
created an [inaudible],

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.930
humorously suggested the life
and times of a contrary man

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.090
as a suitable title
for [inaudible] book

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.730
which was badly entitled as
Memory and her nine daughters,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.320
the muses, a pretext for
printing cast into the mold

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.490
of a dialogue in 4 chapters.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.900
It was badly entitled because I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.220
as a sometime bibliographer have
had to write the entire title

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.970
or type it numerous
times, too long.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.370
I, being in the process
of writing a biography

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.140
of [inaudible] at the request
of his late wife Caroline,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.690
with whom I worked for 30 years,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.230
and considering using this title
humorously suggested by Stevens

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.100
as the subtitle of my
biography of [inaudible].

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.260
[inaudible] himself says in
the dialogue lengthily titled,

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
truly I'm, you labeled
me the contrary man,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.920
but you did not say
contrary to what.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.410
Truly I'm contrary to mediocrity
though I know we could not live

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.180
on the planet without it.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.370
I'm contrary to sloth and
contrary to waste which will go

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.720
on in spite of me
and I'm contrary

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.430
to blasphemy against the spirit.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.480
I have proved to myself
that I can change the world,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.320
that only within the
reach of my hands.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.950
The work I leave behind will
not be great yet it will prove

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.880
to be genuine, genuine
though not progressive.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.680
[inaudible] poets in ancient
India saw that all elements

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.880
of the divine, human and natural
world fit together perfectly

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.290
in an eternal and smoothly
flowing symbolism known

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.670
as [inaudible].

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.210
Despite their powerful
and diverse personalities,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.890
even the gods and goddesses
lived within the structure

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.580
of this cosmic law
of universal harmony.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.460
With intuitive flash of
imagination, the poet

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.370
or artist was able to see
the unified harmonious nature

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.870
of reality and to be afforded
access to the creative powers

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.480
that imagined the real.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.780
The sand script word
[inaudible] suggests the smooth

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.230
and rhythmic turning of the
wheel of being and is derived

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.000
from the proto-Indo-European
root, ar,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.810
meaning fit together
properly, suitably united.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.280
This serves as the basis
for the Greek word harmous,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.390
the root of harmony and also
the basis for the Latin ar's,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.890
root of art and artist.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.940
The [inaudible] sages who
saw [inaudible] within

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.790
and behind all forms of being
saw the art of existence itself

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.770
and allowed their
artistry and craft

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.760
to focus the creative power
and thereby to present

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.510
that order fixed
for contemplation.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.340
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Victor [inaudible] life

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.300
as an artist and craftsman is
a testament to that vision.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.700
It is an understanding that
very early became a part

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.740
of [inaudible] tacit awareness.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.710
As he writes in his last book,
I was born into the 18th century

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.490
yet I was not consciously aware

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.230
of this fact for
a very long time.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.990
I first opened my eyes in and
onto one of the oldest parts

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.140
of Vienna, the Vienna
of Maria Teresa.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.810
My father and mother had chosen
to live in this old sector

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.490
of time not because
it was beautiful,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.680
but because the rents
were low for not one

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.360
of the houses had more than the
simplest conveniences to offer.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.430
I was born in [inaudible],
but my earliest recollections,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.330
all of them visual, hinge

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.890
on the place we occupied
in the [inaudible].

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.050
These first few years of my
childhood in the last quarter

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.030
of the 19th century have
formed by view of the world

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.520
as an artist and have modeled
it in the character of the art

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.000
of the late 17th and
early 18th centuries.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.320
I had no chance, nor had I
being then a little oy not

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.190
yet in school, the capacity
for realizing that all things

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.080
that surrounded me were
already over 200 years old.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.860
This world into which I was
born and in which I began

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.880
to live was a world
contemporary with me.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.810
I saw no other.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.310
It was a world built of
the demand of the people

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.870
who lived more than 2 centuries
before me, a world shaped

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.760
and raised by their
builders and artists,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.040
a world of artistic achievements
was the only world of which I,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.770
at this early age, was aware.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.380
It was self-evident and
beyond all question.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.550
I had never heard of art,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.820
would not have understood the
word nor could I have conceived

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.900
of quality and achievement, but
I looked upon the altar pieces

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.150
in the Jesuit's church,
it's ceiling with a fresco

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.060
by Padre Patso and
[inaudible] of the university.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.260
I absorbed and accepted,
unknowingly.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.440
I am a genuine anachronism.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.300
The rear of the Jesuit's
church, it's apse,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.760
gave on the [inaudible], the
front gave on the [inaudible].

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.020
The house in which we lived
was separated from the church

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.410
by a narrow passageway
only allowed to pedestrians

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.010
as it opened through
no more than a doorway

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.880
into the [inaudible]
where the church stood.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.750
I liked to play or just
to be in this place.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.600
Every time I stepped through
the small doorway into this roof

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.910
without a ceiling through
4 well-ordered walls,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.410
the site of it cleared my
breath, made me feel free.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.730
Even the memory of it
has the same affect.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.180
This well-ordered space was
the womb which nurtured the art

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.190
of victor [inaudible] in his
youth and set the trajectory

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.530
that allowed his vision to
develop throughout his lifetime.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.560
[inaudible] attended 4 years of
the Jesuit's elementary school,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.930
already showing a vivid
interest in drawing,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.080
painting and the crafts.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.780
Because of his artistic
bent as he grew older,

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.770
his father became
concerned about his future,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.860
fearing that life as an
artist could not be a

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.110
serious profession.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.800
At 14, after 4 years
of secondary school

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.440
with increases competence as
a draftsman, several drawings

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.410
of his family including a
portrait of his grandfather

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.370
which had recently
gained familial favor,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.550
finally convinced his father

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.800
that his artistic
ambitions were serious.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.510
No longer opposing
victor's future plans,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.140
Carl [inaudible] arranged for
his apprenticeship in the studio

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.360
of the well-known
architect, art historian

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.650
and urban planner,
[inaudible] in 1897.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.040
After a year of realizing
victor's potential, he suggested

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.900
that he should apply to
the academy of fine arts.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.890
He was accepted and
studied painting

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.190
with professor [inaudible].

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.700
Later he switched to sculpture
classes with professors Helmer,

He was very much attracted

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.900
to sculpture but soon realize

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.860
that his true métier
was to be painting.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.660
As he said, I could not
afford to be a sculptor

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.640
and I knew I could make
my way as a painter.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.630
Though when I looked at a
finished work, I am always aware

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.340
that I painted with
a sculptor's eye.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.730
My painted figures
looked to be carved.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:40.590
He left the academy after 7
semesters saying professor

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.600
[inaudible] was glad to be
rid of me as glad as he was

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.990
to have rid himself
of [inaudible].

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.520
He worked alone for a year
when professor [inaudible] work

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.650
and took him into his classes
where he remained for 4 years.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.810
While there, he participated
for the first time

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.120
in a public exhibition
with the [inaudible],

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.520
an artist organization, in 1907.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.110
His portrait of a woman
was received positively

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.300
by the press and critics.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.550
His next success came in 1908

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.880
when he was awarded the
[inaudible] for a portrait

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.030
of Rosa [inaudible], his future
wife, which allowed him to marry

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.330
and to travel to Paris, Munich,
and for the first time to Italy.

He also won the [inaudible],
permitting further traveling.

They spent the winter
of 1909 and 10 in Munich

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.650
and became acquainted
with the circle

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.470
around Adolf von [inaudible], a
friend of the artist [inaudible]

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.090
and the art theorist
Conrad [inaudible].

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.070
[inaudible] writes in 1910
or 11, I had an interview

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.080
with Adolf von [inaudible].

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.470
His book, the problem of
form, had fascinated me,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.220
but I felt I did not
understand it and hoped

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.300
that he would explain
part of it to me.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.430
He tried, but after quite
a long talk together,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.950
I was still groping
for my answers.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.190
Finally, I asked a question
which I thought was pertinent,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.540
after all, is not the
most important part

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.430
of the portrait painter's
task the representation

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.270
of the psyche of the sitter.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.080
With a flash in his
eyes, he hurled a reply,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.520
how can you say such a thing.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.070
I was shocked and crushed,
but my eyes had been opened.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.990
In time, I understood.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.280
Because of his contact with
[inaudible], he said of his stay

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.590
in Munich, this experience
brought by a deep

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.830
and lasting spiritual
stimulation.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.820
From [inaudible], he began to
understand the problem of form

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.020
in a clearer light with
form as the primary concern

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.530
of the artist, but it
would be several years

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.600
until his understanding became
visible in his paintings.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.190
[inaudible] had been painting
of rather large canvases

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.940
and a colleague suggested
smaller,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.750
more intimate portraits
more likely to be bought

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.860
and fitting more easily
in domestic settings.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.990
Indeed, [inaudible]
received more

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.220
and more private commissions.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.470
at which time he also took
up book binding in order

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.900
to supplement his
income as an artist.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.420
This is a portrait
of [inaudible],

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.230
done in almost art nuevo style.

She was a dancer, I mean,
well dancer and singer

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.770
in the Viennese Operetta.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.840
In 1912, he exhibited a
collection in the succession.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.510
It was an important success
critically and financially

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.080
and he was elected a
member of the succession

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.570
and joined regular
commissions thereafter.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.730
From 1907 until world war 1, he
exhibited regularly at galleries

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.000
in Vienna, in Berlin at
the gallery [inaudible]

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.240
and in Munich at the
gallery [inaudible].

He was mentioned positively,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.670
almost unanimously,
in publications.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.840
Only once was he
criticized for his quote,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.020
sharp and rigidly
drawn portraits

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.760
which lacked liveliness.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.050
[inaudible] resigned from the
Viennese succession in 1913,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.180
realizing he had
really nothing in common

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.990
with the other secessionist even
though they were his classmates

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.540
at the academy.

who recently had a show

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.550

York, had been his studio mate

tragic suicide following his

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:40.450
in oil showing still bound to
the Viennese style of 1900.

In his studies, victor had
copied portraits of [inaudible]

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.380
and the Italian masters
as well as [inaudible]

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.780

[inaudible] technique differed

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.610
from that of his
later paintings.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:00.480
He painted in oil instead of
egg tempera and in a much freer

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:06.080
and quicker way, finishing
after only a few sittings.

of every detail, a facet
of all future work,

sitter's head the best place

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.030
forms, announcing the subject's
name and date of completion.

this painting of letter forms

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.700

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.030
and early renaissance
style in various portraits.

of 1914, I was invited

come to Florence

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.590
and paint a portrait
of his wife.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.090
I worked very hard on this
portrait in the few weeks

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.720
at their Villa in
[inaudible] near Florence,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.200
was a very lovely
time in my life.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.690
I was able to take a trip
by car through Umbria

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.560
and the total experience
filled me with pure happiness.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.670
Faith had apparently
given me this peaceful

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.270
and happy interlude
out of charity

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:59.350
for before I could start my new
work, the world war broke out.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.730

[inaudible], Poland,

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.530

river as an infantryman.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.370
He spent 4 months in combat

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.570
with the 4th Austrian
infantry regiment.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.650
In October, he would be sent
to guard duty behind the lines

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.470
and then to headquarters as a
staff artist in the [inaudible].

to Constantinople before
returning to Vienna.

He writes, the first work I
did after this army life was

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.130
as though my artistic
ability was paralyzed.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.670
In the first year at the
academy, my work was better.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:41.020
In 1918, [inaudible] began a
work pivotal to the development

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:47.100
of his technique, the wood
turners of Constantinople.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.270
Even for his standard, he
did an amazing large number

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.430
of preparatory studies.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.970
Even though he came ack to
the panel numerous times

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.340
in the following
years, the panel started

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.970
in egg tempera was
never finished.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.770
Nevertheless, the panel is
of particular importance

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.880
because it shows
a new development

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.080
in [inaudible] work
unlike the portraits he did

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.500
for the [inaudible] museum,
the arsenal gallery of Vienna.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.920
Although his panel still shows
a scientific 3-dimensional

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.990
perspective, which is not
found in the later works,

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.900
the figures no longer
seem captured

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.970
in a temporary situation,
but seem arrested

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.470
in their movement
in a timeless space.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.080
As [inaudible] says, the work
of art, the genuine work,

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.900
opens the eyes of the
beholder to see reality anew,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.000
prepared for contemplation.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.300
By 1918, [inaudible] had
returned to his studio in Vienna

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.000
which he would maintain
until 39.

The [inaudible] now
had a son and daughter.

from hunger, cold,

the constant currency
devaluation

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.210
and shattered self-confidence.

The political situation

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.150
in the young republic
was tense and uncertain.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.540
The fear of overwhelming
communism was in the air.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.440
People thought that
only an annexation

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.510
by Germany could save the
situation, but it was not

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:09.350
until 1938, until the
[inaudible] became a reality.

For an artist, he is
too practically minded,

to sober, to normal.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.760
There is nothing fanciful
or exalted about him.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.380
For a craftsman, his
mind is too profound,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.990
his intellectual
measure to great.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.490
As early as 1910, [inaudible]
had been experimenting

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.000
with the technique
of the [inaudible],

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.400
and almost forgotten
discipling which his concern

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.880
for graphic preciseness,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.920
proved to be an ideal
medium for the artist.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.540
The technique had been widely
used for copying paintings

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.450
from the late 18th into the
second half of the 19th century,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.370
especially in England
and in Austria.

In Saint Martin,

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.640
in a traditional
Austrian hunting outfit.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.420
He later did a number
of illustrations

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.620
of traditional Austrian clothing
known as trachten for his friend

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.920
and patron, Conrad [inaudible].

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.230
In 1924, he extended his
skill in London where the arts

was still taught

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.320

Thereafter, he completed
a number

a portrait

about the parallel relationship

The year 1922 marks
the beginning

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.040
of victor's most productive
period as an artist

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.980
which sees the crystallization
of his mature painting style.

The creation of his
first [inaudible] faces

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.730
and the establishment
of his printing press.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.840
This is a version, an
early version, of Christ

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.310
and the adulteress, an image

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.940
which he painted 5 different
times over a long period

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:51.330
of years and our thinking
about it is he meditated

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.200
on [inaudible] suicide because
of Maria von [inaudible]

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:04.450
adultery and it was a way of
dealing with that tragedy.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.420
Victor returned to Florence with
his family and set up his studio

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.480
and household in
October of 1922,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:18.730

It was with the crystallization
of this mature style

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.070
in the portrait of
Madam [inaudible] shown

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:37.010
at the Venetian [inaudible] of
1924 with, and his own portrait

with Lute [inaudible] and
tuning fork and the portrait

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.190
of [inaudible], the
court of saint James,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:46.570
that [inaudible] had
a realization crucial

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.340
to his self-understanding.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.650
I just wanted to
point out the portrait

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:56.570
of the Swiss Madam
[inaudible] and the difference

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.110
in a color version and a
black and white version.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:05.720
Victor always painted something
new in each of his portraits

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.390
and he was interested in
learning to paint a glass

suspended on the chain along

Back to [inaudible].

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.780
As a child, [inaudible]
had looked

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.330
out of his bedroom window
one morning and writes,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.680
at one glass I absorbed all
the forms in front of me.

Their order, the contrast of
light and shadow, warm and cool

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.600
as it were, and the
relationship of planes.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.440
I also saw the narrow street
coming from the left-hand side

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.040
and broadening into
the narrow square.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.600
Through the open door
of the gate house,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.090
I could see the sunlight

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:30.350
on the distant pavement
of the [inaudible].

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.080
The tiny belfry with its
cross on top stood clear

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.530
against a transparent sky.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.310
Yellow sunlight already lay on
the roofs and the upper part

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.430
of the house walls while cool,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.790
gray shade still filled
the narrow street.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.410
Horizontal and vertical forms,
rough and smooth surfaces,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:52.610
solid, tangible forms against
the sky, that was all there was,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.770
nothing poetical, nothing
emotional, no yearning,

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.350
no great distance,
nothing idyllic.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.800
Only quiet, clear
sensitively arranged forms.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.490
After a short while, I left the
window and picked up the shreds

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.660
of a child's life where I
have left off the day before.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.220
Many years passed and I was
nearing the middle of life.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.750
I had forgotten what I
had seen as a little oy.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.980
Sometimes at long
intervals, a recollection

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.600
of those moments
flash through my mind.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.350
It soothed me while it lasted,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.590
but no longer did it
mean anything to me.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.260
When I was in London,
I was commissioned

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.950
by the Swiss minister to
the court of Saint James

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.530
to paint his portrait.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.140
I made all his studies in London
then went back to Florence

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.150
to paint the panel there.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.830
As Mr. [inaudible] was in
the garb of a minister,

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.440
I had a chosen a view of
the ambassador's court

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.440
in the Saint James palace

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.160
with a little white
tower as a background.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.580
After I finished the painting,
I took it to London for delivery

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.060
and should it be necessary,
to give it final touches

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.390
in the presence of the model.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.150
When I took it out of the box
and saw it with fresh eyes,

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.500
the recollection of what
I'd seen from the window

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.910
as a little boy came
back to me suddenly

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.380
and was more vivid
than ever before.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.840
I realized that I had repeated
that scene in the painting,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.700
horizontal plane alternating
with vertical ones,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.190

gray and murky, in my portrait.

The tiny belfry, the
[inaudible] in the street,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.600
everything was there, oddly
changed yet recognizable.

Even myself in the
person of the model.

Mentally, I reviewed
my past work.

I was both agitated and puzzled.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.800
No doubt, here was a pattern
of composition which recurred

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.420
in all my work however disguised
in each particular one.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.750
The subject matter had
no influence upon it,

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.380
whether a portrait, a historical
scene or a single figure,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.340
I had cast it in the same mold.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.200
The rules were not arbitrary.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.930
They were not setup
for the convenience

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.200
of either the artist
or the patron.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.570
When followed, these
rules attained an end,

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.690
a work of civilized art to fit

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.490
into a civilized
people's environment.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.950
The patron was not
interested in the rules,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.750
but in the end obtained what
[inaudible] ready to pay.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.680
If he ordered an image
of Saint Sebastian,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.060
he expected to get a picture

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.760
of a naked young man
spiked with arrows.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.620
It was easy for the
artist to comply with this,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.940
but to observe the rules

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.790
of the workshop was
quite a different thing.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.800
Without it being laid
down expressly as a rule,

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.580
the concern for the workshop
was to make the saint visible,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.770
visible to the beholder.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.880
This was not a matter of
observation of nature,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.540
of scientific watching
and scrutinizing,

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.570
nor was it a matter of
making concepts visible.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.960
An old man with a white
beard and a halo served

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.780
for god the father and
human beings with wings

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.030
on their shoulders
served for angels.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.420
The devil was always at
the bottom, never on top.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.730
In modern terminology,
this was show business

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.190
and show people know what
affects an audience visually.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.750
The medieval craftsman
knew it to.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.220
[inaudible] was able to work out
his personal type of classic art

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.710
and to create a portrait style
valid for the rest of his life,

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.330
a development showing
its first visual outburst

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.330
in the timelessness
and graphic quality

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.330
of the wood turners of 1918.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.630
The time in Florence from
1924 to 29 were a time

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.370
of serenity for [inaudible].

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.870
He completed numerous portraits
in [inaudible], Berlin, Munich,

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.840
Paris, [inaudible], London,
Strasburg and in Pittsburgh,

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.530
for his Patron Edgar
[inaudible].

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.390
He began cutting [inaudible],

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.080
setting up his printing
in [inaudible].

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.820
He also built together with
[inaudible] a carpenter,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.050
2 clavichords as
prototypes for kids.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.670
Albert [inaudible] had suggested
this idea to [inaudible]

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.300
since both were great components

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.050
of the clavichord
and the harpsichord.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.630
Unfortunately, we will
probably never know the details

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.140
of this project because prior
to their departure from Vienna,

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.510
following the German
annexation in 1939, [inaudible]

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.200
and his wife Rosa burned a
number of letters in order

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.210
to protect their correspondence

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:10.170
after they had left Austria
including those of [inaudible].

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.440
In her book, 40 years
with [inaudible],

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.510
Nikki [inaudible] wrote,
[inaudible] had been introduced

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.950
to the Berenson's by one of
BB's old Austrian friends,

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:24.330
the collector Count
Lens [inaudible].

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.110
[inaudible] seemed to
belong to another century

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.760
in combining art
and artisanship.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.240
An accomplished painter,
a printer of fine books,

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.530
a constructor of musical
instruments, his discussion

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.990
with Bb were sometimes
so profound and involved

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.650
that ordinary mortals
could not follow them.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.750
Berenson was not
sympathetic to [inaudible]

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.200
at this time nor
ever, yet the family

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.760
and Nikki [inaudible] were
always the kindest of friends.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.240
As [inaudible] himself records,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.850
when I had finished
the self-portrait

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.300
with the tuning fork
which is usually mistaken

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.260
as a fever thermometer
at first sight,

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.500
dear kind Nikki [inaudible]
wanted me to show it to Berenson

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.690
for she liked it and she
said he might be interested

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.480
in seeing it.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.360
I took the picture one
day over to [inaudible],

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.440
setting it in a chair
in Berenson's study.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.850
What he said I do
not recall in full,

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:22.080
only one thing I remember
well, he said it looks like one

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.360
of those wooden painted statues
one sees in Spain on the altars

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.260
of churches and this
was and is true.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.700
I did not take this criticism
as a complement at that time

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.730
and Berenson did not mean
it to be one, but now I see

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.300
that Berenson's judgement
was in a sense,

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.100
rather an involuntary
compliment.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.260
For some argument, he pointed
to the Madonna of [inaudible]

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.540
that hung in the study
next to the window.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.710
I saw immediately
the weak part in it

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.780
and said certainly not too
politely, but how can you stand

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.780
that left side of the mantle
falling down into nothing

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.680
against the firm
triangle of the child.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.490
For a while he was
silent, realizing perhaps

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:06.850
for the first time that the bulk

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.110
of the child was not
counterbalanced by anything

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.040
on the opposite, the
left side, by anything

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.450
but the weak part of the mantle.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:19.780
Then he continued, yes, I admit
this but what about the rest?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.120
The question itself
was a wrong one.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.480
If something in the whole
composition is wrong,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.180
there is nothing left
for being any good.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.700
Lovely though the child
is and the mother too.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.640
Among musicians in Florence,
[inaudible] knew Adolf Bush

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.390
and Rudolph [inaudible]
who years later came

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.660
to see [inaudible] in
Lexington on 2 occasions.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.560
He had bought the drawing
for the portrait of,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.860
Victor's portrait of
Thomas [inaudible].

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.700
Through his Munich patrons the
[inaudible], he was introduced

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.360
to Carlo [inaudible], a
Florentine noble, novelist,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.510
travel writer and figure
in the local literary life,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.500
art collector [inaudible]
and lawyer

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.910
and American art
collector Carlo [inaudible].

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.210
Ulrich [inaudible], head

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.790
of the German art
institute, became a friend.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.690
They would be reunited in
Chicago where [inaudible],

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.700
formerly head of the art
department at the University

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.320
of Chicago, arranged
an exhibition

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.690
for [inaudible] in 1948.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.560
Through the Berenson, he met Sir
John Rosenstein whose wife was

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.250
from Lexington, Kentucky
and Kenneth Clark

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.630
who became a patron and friend.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.860
Edward Ned Bruce, also an artist
and later in charge of the WPA

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.710
at the treasury department
was a kind friend

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.140
who brought his friends
to meet [inaudible],

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.580
among whom was [inaudible]
Huxley whose philosophy

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.200
[inaudible] admired.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.620
Huxley saw [inaudible] many
years later in Lexington

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.510
when he lectured at
Transylvania University.

&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
[inaudible] drawings

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.230
of [inaudible] and
of Mary Berenson,

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.200
fine and firm images much work

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.850
over are almost speaking
images [inaudible].

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.240
[inaudible] writes of
another similar drawing

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.540
of Sir Frederick [inaudible].

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.890
In the early 1920's,

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:17.560
the Austrian minister Baron
[inaudible] invited him to come

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.620
to London and stay with him
at the embassy while I worked

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.750
on the drawing for his portrait.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.590
He decided I should
make a drawing of one

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.900
of his acquaintances,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.990
a very distinguished
looking gentleman at court.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:32.340
This night, as we both
innocently believed result

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.840
in other conditions when
the drawing would be seen.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.230
So, I made the drawing which
I recall was a silver point.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.020
Sir Frederick accepted
it gracefully

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.200
and hoped its display
would be a success.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.500
After a long while,

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.770
Baron [inaudible] asked
whether the drawing had

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:49.220
been appreciated.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.920
Sir Frederick's reply was
that it may have been,

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.690
but though he could
lead horses to water,

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.150
he couldn't make them drink.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.680
Years later in Lexington,

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.900
our good neighbor Mary
[inaudible] came one day

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.490
with a book for me, grace
and favor, the memoires

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.840
of the duchess of West Minster.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.080
In this book was the drawing
I had made of her father.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.170
His face had, she
said, the refinement

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.580
of a [inaudible] drawing.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.070
She seems to have seen
him through my eyes

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.790
for my drawing had
the characteristics

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.930
of a [inaudible] drawing though
I did not have the benefit

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.800
of renaissance dress.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.310
[inaudible] had been
interested in the book arts

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:31.710
since he began book binding
in 1911, hoping one day

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.910
to print and bind a book.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.320
In Florence, he experimented

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.780
with cutting type eventually
created several [inaudible]

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:44.040
faces, the first being cut
in 1921 by Swiss type cutter.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.370
1926, [inaudible]
and [inaudible],

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.720
son of Rudolph [inaudible],

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.640
began cutting a second
type face together.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.560
It was cast by hand
in the studio in 1928

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.900
and would be called [inaudible]
after the first issue

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.310
from the press in 1931 and that
book is the second from the end

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.850
of the left side of the table.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.370
Deciding that if he were
creating a type face

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.880
and using handmade paper,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.670
he should also have a
handmade printing press.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.040
In 1927, [inaudible] made some
drawings of a wooden press

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.280
in the bibliotheca [inaudible].

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.740
While still living
in the [inaudible],

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.640
his craftsman friend,
built the press.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.140
Neighbor [inaudible] Berenson
suggested that in [inaudible],

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.840
appropriate first issue

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.370
of the press might be John
Milton's Samson Agonistes

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.670
for reasons unclear, but
that was the suggestion

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.720
and it was accepted.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.300
At a luncheon party in 1929,

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.600
[inaudible] had a
fortuitous meeting

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.490
with Edgar [inaudible]
sr. at Pittsburgh.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:53.790
[inaudible] had completed
a drawing

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.110
of his wife Lilly Ann in 1926.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.740
[inaudible] asked [inaudible]
if he would come to Pittsburgh

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.060
to paint several portraits.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.180
[inaudible] thus made his
first visit to the U.S

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:08.500
for commissions including
Edgar [inaudible] portrait

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:13.280
which now hangs in the
dining room at Falling Water.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.870

in the printing project,

on as an apprentice
in his art studio.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.420
In addition to [inaudible] the
studio included Fritz Cradle

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.110
who had been a student
of Rudolph [inaudible],

Conrad [inaudible], scion of
an Austrian industrial family,

spent most of his
time in [inaudible],

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.210
one of the small Austrian lakes
in the western [inaudible] area

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.750
where many Viennese
families summered.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.700
[inaudible] was a collector of
steerian folk sounds and dances

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.340
and a [inaudible] expert on
the dialect of this region.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.060
Here, [inaudible] met numerous
friends including Austrian

[inaudible] daughter, Veronica,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.580

Baron [inaudible],

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.310
grandson of Gabrielle.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.810
At [inaudible], worked
on temperate paintings

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:06.350
on parchment depicting
Austrian peasants

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.460

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:18.720
his interest in folklore
and local customs and many

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.510
of his friends from the area
posed for these paintings.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.560
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Other paintings completed

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.320
in these years were those
of Baron [inaudible]

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.690
with the [inaudible]
in the background.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:46.460
Francesca [inaudible],
the wife of his friend

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.490
and pet Delfino [inaudible] and
[inaudible], the wife of well,

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:57.530
his friend as well as the
wife of his friend Alexander.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.190
In all these, in addition
to perfect finish obtained

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:03.580
by the use of temper,
there is another attribute.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:09.860
It is the brush or the
tuning fork in the hands

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.340
of the painter, the decorative
medallion in the portrait

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:19.480
of [inaudible], the geometric
pendant in the, on the chain

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.490
of Madam [inaudible] glass orb
or the twigs of an olive branch

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.210
at the side of the
Austrian ambassador.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.750
All these attributes are not
merely aesthetic embellishments,

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.530
but symbolic forms ornamenting
the work with increased meaning

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.070
and binding it into
a visible whole.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:43.040
In 1932, Rosa [inaudible] and
children returned to Vienna

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.680
and [inaudible] returned to
London where he had hoped

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.880
to get further commissions
from friends of Kenneth Clark,

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.890
[inaudible] and Frankenstein.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.160
[inaudible] completed
several [inaudible] portraits

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.010
and works in silver point.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.310
He was commissioned
by a committee headed

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:02.490
by Baron Frankenstein to create
a bronze memorial bust for,

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.690
in honor of [inaudible] and to
cut a marble inscription for it,

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.140
placing it in the
[inaudible] house in Salzburg,

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.820
later destroyed by the Nazis.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.550
He had several shows, was
well received in the press,

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.820
but the public did
not fulfill his hopes.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.500
At the end of 1932
he left for Paris

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.960
where he'd met his old friends,
Tutor and Don Wilkinson.

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.280
Of Don, [inaudible]
said I was asked

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.700
to paint the most
beautiful woman

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.440
in the world, but I failed.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.360
She had been so [inaudible]
when she was

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.230
in [inaudible] before
world war 1

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.330
and now she refused
the painting finding it

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.810
to austere, or statue like.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.110
He also painted some

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.440
of his nicest female
portraits during this visit.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.390
His subjects were mostly
friends and [inaudible] cousins

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:52.690
of Antoinette [inaudible].

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.510
In 1934.

&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
On the way back to Austria

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.170
from Paris, [inaudible] stopped
at [inaudible] near up Strasburg

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:14.330
to visit his patrons and
friends, the [inaudible] family.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.370
They were close friends
of Thomas [inaudible]

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.770
and his wife [inaudible].

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.410
They became converted
to Roman Catholicism

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.630
and thought it their duty
to build a small chapel

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:27.120
on their own property,
adjacent to the Parish Church

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.690
which then did and
now still does,

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.430
serve both Protestants
and Catholics.

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.640
[inaudible] knowing the task was
possible, offered his services

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.660
and was offered the job.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.640
The remarkable thing about the
chapel is that is showcases all

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.170
of Victor's skills and talents.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.630
It incorporates his
philosophy and world view.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.290
He created it as a prism with
a quarter prism on top, a door,

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.830
a window, all out
of local stone used

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.470
for the cathedral in Strasburg.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:59.900
He worked alongside the masons,
sculptured figures on each side

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.470
of the door, crafted all
the interior appointments,

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:06.070
drew plans for the stone
altar, the holy water fount,

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:08.060
the candlesticks and chalice.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:10.950
He painted the ceiling
beams and finally,

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.680
was able to place a crucifix

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:17.310
over the altar upon his
return to Europe in 1957.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.650
He worked on the
chapel for 2 years.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.960
While there, he carved into
the marble library mantle

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.190
at [inaudible] suggestion.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:28.970

beauty and truth, refined
from Aristotle, [inaudible],

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:40.670
reflecting the wholeness, the
unity of the work, its harmony

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.990
and its rhythm which
combine to reveal a radiance

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:48.410
that arrests the eye, stills
the mind and enchants the heart.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.430
True art, genuine art, is thus
the vehicle for transformation

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.500
for spiritual growth
because is made whole

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.140
through an integrating
spiritual gesture.

It lifts us up to
apprehend the sublime.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.110
and [inaudible] of the
[inaudible] foundry

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.860
who had known victor and was
a friend of [inaudible] along

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.890
with other Chicago friends hoped
Transylvania might call victor's

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.060
artist in residence.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.860
McClain and Graves were amazed
at the depth and breadth

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.430
of victor's talent and craft
and immediately did invite him

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.360
to come to Lexington
without consulting any

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.010
of the Transylvania
board members.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:33.590
[inaudible] accepted and
with only a hand shake,

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:34.960
it was settled.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.770
As McClain later said
in an oral history,

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.890
we did things differently
in those days.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.990
And so, in the fall of 1948,
[inaudible] began his position

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:47.090
as artist in residence
at Transylvania College

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.550
in Lexington, Kentucky.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.040
Established his press, now

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.560
with his own American
[inaudible] type,

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.690
the [inaudible] again operated

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:01.410
and began its run
in the bluegrass.

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.780
[inaudible] time in
Lexington was peaceful.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.310
Of course, he acquired a new
circle of friends and patrons.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.270
Teaching, and as a result
without any financial worry,

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:15.030
he could work on projects
that we wanted to do.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.210
Rosa [inaudible] died in 1954.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.260
The following year, [inaudible]
married their mutual,

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.560
well their friend,
Caroline [inaudible]

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.690
who had been Victor's apprentice

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.100
and helped Rosa during
her final illness.

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.580
He cut the 18-point American
[inaudible] in Lexington

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:37.740
and the 14 point
[inaudible] type.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:43.660
He completed 5 portraits
including one of Raymond McClain

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:47.300
and our Kentucky
[inaudible], John Jacob Niles.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:52.090
He painted 8 panels on
[inaudible], crucifixes,

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.210
3 different versions
of varying size.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:55.510
One for the chapel
in [inaudible],

00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:00.420
one for Thomas Merton who wanted
it in his [inaudible] chapel

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:05.190
at [inaudible] and another
one that he retained himself.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.510
He did the 4th and 5th versions
of Christ and the adulteress

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:14.670
and these 2 tryptic on the
left crowning the young Christ

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:20.050
and memory and her 9 daughters,
the muses, and he worked on,

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:25.460
but did not finish his lass
tryptic, the resurrection.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.510
Do I have time to say
something on [inaudible]?

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.280
[ Background noise ]

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.670
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Are we doing all right?

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:39.270
Well, the [inaudible] Sophia
was commissioned as a Madonna

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.710
and child and as Victor
was working on it,

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.840
the child became a young man
and the woman, the Madonna,

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.320
became almost Amazonian
in proportion.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.740
And Thomas Merton came to
the dentist in Lexington,

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.700
which was a way that
he could escape

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.640
and see his friends
[inaudible] and at lunch,

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.740
Merton was observing the panel
on the easel and he said,

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:12.100
who are these people and
victor said I no longer know.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.160
Merton thought of the line from
proverbs, Wisdom will honor you

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.800
if you love her, she will place
on your head a fair garland,

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.280
she will crown you
with a crown of glory.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.030
And so, Merton said this
is [inaudible] Sophia

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.050
and crowing the young Christ.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:32.310
Merton then wrote his little
meditation on the holy hours

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:35.450
of the day called
[inaudible] Sophia.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:40.480
In the muses, which is in, at
the University of San Francisco,

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.890
Victor did something
that he often did do,

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:50.490
make use of his former sitter's
faces in another context

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:57.870
and Mrs. Tudor Wilkinson
[inaudible] as the head

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:03.270
of Urania and when Victor
told her she was going to be

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:06.420
in his tryptic she wrote a post
card and said oh dear Victor,

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:10.180
I'm so happy I'm in your tryptic
when my body is moldering

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:14.710
in the ground, my, I will
still be measuring the skies.

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:18.470
[inaudible] was awarded
an honorary doctor

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:20.770
of humanities degree by the
University of [inaudible]

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:25.220
in 1960 in the North Carolina
Museum of Art at Raleigh mounted

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.200
in retrospective
exhibition in 1965.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:33.300
[inaudible] died in Lexington
on the 10th of July 1967.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.840
Raymond McClain, former
president of Transylvania,

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.030
read the burial service
concluding

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:41.100
with this final evaluation.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.660
It was his genius to unify
these gifts in his life.

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:51.460
He made no distinctions so far
as I can tell between the arts

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.380
and the crafts, even more
between the fine arts

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.860
and the supposed
lesser categories.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.370
There was just as much artistry,
just a much craftsmanship,

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:03.400
just as much attention to
composition, just as marriage

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.090
with form and function, just
as much discipline, technique

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.710
and production, whether
the work were carpentry

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:12.020
or punch cutting or painting.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:15.020
This gave Victor the power
of undivided wholeness

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.380
and reduced potential
complexity to simplicity.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.060
These are attributes
of genius and results

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:25.700
of enormous self-discipline
exercised over the years.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.510
He's lifted his work to
the level of the universal,

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.340
lifted it above the moment
and gave it to the ages.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.650
Let us make no mistake about
Victor, he was a simple man,

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.770
but it was an achieved
simplicity.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.850
He was a highly sophisticated
person,

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:42.900
well read in several languages,

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.710
conversed with the
best minds ever

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.600
to have reduced their
thoughts to poetry

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.970
or prose on the printed page.

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:51.780
His simplicity was the
result of education,

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.520
of continuing thought.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.610
His technique embodied
a constant search

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:57.790
for better ways of doing things.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:01.260
His power was rooted in a
highly sensitized intuition,

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:03.650
refined by unremitting
work and dedicated

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:07.810
to a purpose beyond his
immediate personal status.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.650
It is no accident that
he worked [inaudible],

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:15.910
the moto which was carved in
the portico of the Jesuit church

00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:19.670
in Vienna which had
overshadowed his childhood gains

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:22.510
and nurtured his
life as an artist.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:25.410
He paid the price to
deserve this distinction.

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:28.650
He could be so withdrawn
from the world because he was

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:31.400
so thoroughly its product.

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:38.100
And this is a late
portrait of our [inaudible],

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:44.580
collector of folk songs and
musician John Jacob Niles

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:50.100
and completely, accidentally,

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:55.600
Johnny's 126th birthday is
Saturday and the friends

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.490
in Lexington have contributed
to an historical marker

00:58:59.490 --> 00:59:04.730
to be placed on the
[inaudible] road at Boot Hill,

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:07.750
the Nile's farm in Clark County.

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:13.600
And Victor, and this
is a perfect example

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.960
of Victor's portraits here.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:20.730
Everyone looks far more austere
than they were in reality

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:24.200
and there's another similar
portrait of the mayor

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:30.170
of Louisville, Charlie Farnsley
who was just a terrible comedian

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:34.590
and yet he looks very
dignified in the picture.

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.590
So, that's all I have to
say, but I'll be happy

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:43.510
to answer any questions
if I can.

&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER: If we
have questions then please

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:11.950
and afterward we can take a
look at some of the material

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:17.330
that Paul has brought
up for us to see

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.700
that compliments the topic.

Thank you for coming.

offended the Nazis,

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.360
that required the [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS
HOLBROOK: Well,

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.110
[inaudible] didn't
have to leave.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:32.810
He just felt because he knew
he would not have any artistic

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:40.240
freedom and he had no intention
of becoming a propaganda artist

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.310
which his paintings,
as it were idealized,

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:49.110
figures would have been
perfect for the Nazi program.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:50.410
&gt;&gt; Did he [inaudible]?

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:54.660
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK: Yes,
but he was forbidden to teach.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:01:02.070
The excuse was that he belonged
to this conservative party

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:04.430
that was against the annexation.

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.370
So, there was really no reason
that they needed to fire him,

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.860
but I'm sure, but
it happily worked

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.500
out to everyone's advantage
except the [inaudible]

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.910
which was replaced by the.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:19.340
I showed the original memorial
was a bust from the waist up

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.450
and the marble plaque underneath
it and Victor had had a head,

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.550
just the head cast for
him to keep at the time

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:33.010
of the original casting and
they were able to make a mold

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:42.790
from the cast head and recast
another head that I'm told is

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:44.340
in the [inaudible]
house again in Salzburg,

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.640
but I haven't yet seen it.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.730
I hope to get to
Salzburg before too long.

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.660
&gt;&gt; Another question.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.960
Was the relationship of the
[inaudible] long standing?

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.260
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK: Yes.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.690
Well, it was very important.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:05.690
It allowed him, the press,
to really be started.

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:13.540
Edgar Sr. gave Victor I think
$400 a month for 2 years

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.750
and Edgar Jr. After, then
the depression hit of course

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:20.470
and Edgar Jr. said I'm getting
an allowance from father,

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.560
I will have it and
give you half of it.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.780
He was still there in
the studio, which he did,

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.800
and Edgar Jr. although,
you know,

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.480
he had this fabulous
art collection,

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.600
but it was mostly contemporary
works, but he had these several.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:46.340
I mean, he was devoted to Victor
and wrote a very nice meditation

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.120
for the 3rd volume the
[inaudible] press publication

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.530

testament about his time

and his experience
in the studio.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.510
And he, when Victor died,
he sent the large portrait

01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:01.050
of Victor to Caroline
of, which he had in his,

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.190
stored away somewhere
probably with the paint brush

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:06.230
and the [inaudible] on which
Caroline then donated along

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:08.920
with the silver point
and the, that one copy

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.090
of the [inaudible] self-portrait

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.040
to the national portrait
gallery.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.140
So, it's here somewhere and
would be nice to see it again.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.050
But, so yes, the
[inaudible] were and Caroline

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.120
and Edgar Jr. corresponded
till he died.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.840
the [inaudible] correspondence,
there's over, Victor.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.930
I mean, there's over
400, I think,

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.710
envelopes of correspondence
in the collection here.

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:53.970
&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER: So, part of
Paul's coming to give this talk

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:58.310
and talk [inaudible]
tomorrow is, is also a bit

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:09.310
of a celebration in
rehousing and publishing

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:18.670
and posting the revised binding
[inaudible] for the collection.

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:25.460
And so, the collection
is broke up into,

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.680
it's a wonderful collection.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.730
We have correspondence exhibits,

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:39.770
exhibit publications,
photographs.

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.020
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Reviews and critiques.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:48.080
&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER: As well
as some artifacts and some

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.710
of his printing blocks.

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.150
And yeah, so that's [inaudible]
collection exists here

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:56.450
at the [inaudible] and
special collections.

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.750
It was posted earlier this week

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.050
and the entire finding
is available online.

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:00.350
It's ready and waiting
for researchers.

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:01.650
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK: And
I will come and research again.

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:02.950
We sent the boxes away in a
Mayflower moving truck to come

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:04.250
to Washington in 1988
and then I came back,

01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:05.550
what was it, 4 years ago?

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:06.850
Oh dear.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.450
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
Doesn't seem as long,

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.740
but at any rate, came back
and helped make it get the,

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.480
get things filed away which we.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.310
I came on Wednesday
and left on Saturday

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:23.740
and we had it basically all
in order by the time I left.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.040
&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER:
Assembly line up of.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.740
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS
HOLBROOK: Several helpers.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.040
Yes Mam.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.760
&gt;&gt; Where are the presses now?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.060
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS
HOLBROOK: Well,

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.550
mysteriously the 2
wooden presses were left

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.350
in Victor's studio in
Vienna when he left in 39.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:40.520
Mysteriously, one of
them found its way the

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.990
to the Gutenberg's last
house in [inaudible].

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:48.520
So, it's a part of
the collection there.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.430
The other wooden press is
at the King Library Press.

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:56.430
It along with a lot of
things from the studio came

01:05:56.430 --> 01:06:01.000
to Lexington in 1955
and friends of Victor's

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.990
in Lexington bought the wooden
press from him and donated it

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:08.790
to the King Library for use
in the press there in order

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:13.580
to help support Victor's
life in Lexington.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:19.570
And the, Victor had an
iron press at Wells College

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:25.760
which was left there and the,
we, they reopened the press

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.520
in 1993 I think and it
is, they have a curator

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.940
who comes I think every
other year, a hummer fellow,

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.280
a printer who comes
and does work there.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:44.610
And Victor got an iron press
in, after he came to Lexington

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:50.600
which he, which is still in
Lexington with Caroline's nephew

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.130
who also learned to print.

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:59.060
&gt;&gt; The wooden presses
were [inaudible].

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.920
&gt;&gt; DR. PAUL EVANS HOLBROOK:
There is a press still

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.540
in the [inaudible] Library
in Florence that was thought,

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:11.300
when Victor drew the, copied
the, drew the plans for it,

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:17.360
though to be the 15th century
Remundy Press and [inaudible],

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.730
who it was and I've showed
she's no longer there,

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:26.820
I mean long dead, at the
library, proved more or less

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:30.700
to everyone's satisfaction
that it was an Napoleonic copy

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.590
of the original Remundy press.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:37.610
But, still, an old
press and its,

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:41.390
Victor and [inaudible] did
a very nice job with it.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.240
It's a beautiful
press and we use it.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:50.530
I just had a student this
semester who wanted to do a poet

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:56.900
in MFA candidate in poetry
did a, wanted to do a poem

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.060
and used the wooden
press to do the poem.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.370
He wanted to, we happened
to have a Buick woodcut,

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:08.780
a small heron, tiny
one that Bob Middleton

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.680
who had accumulated a large
collection of Buick cuts

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.400
and at his cherry
burn press in Chicago,

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.710
printed 2 different
volumes of Buick images.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:26.700
So, we use the image of the
heron in this, with this poem.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.960
And I thought the wooden press
would be the gentlest way

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:38.670
to print this lock that was done
in 1730 or whenever it was done.

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:43.700
So, we're, we are still
very much using the press

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.490
and I have Caroline, when
she, we quit printing,

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.450
the last book we printed
at the anvil press

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:54.680
which was her final imprint,
Thomas Merton's 4 poems

01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:01.070
in French and Merton having
been born in Prague, France.

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:06.750
And she gave me the press and
the contents of the press room

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:11.120
and I transferred them to the
King Library where I assume

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.000
as long as it lasts, will be.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.440
I mean, I will eventually
completely donate it

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.690
to the King Library
unless they close the press

01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:19.490
and I have to take it home.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:23.920
But, I imagine in my old age
going to the press and using it

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.790
as long as I please even
if I'm no longer there.

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:29.590
So.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.730
Thank you.

I hope you feel as if you
have met Victor [inaudible]

01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:39.920
in part, at least partially.

of the Library of Congress.
