00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:02.934
[MUSIC].

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:06.846
Welcome to the first ever Sense Olympics. I'm joined here by my co-host Andy.

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:08.050
Thanks for joining us Andy.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.792
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks for having me, Lauren. I'm really excited to be here. Let's start by

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.644
telling some of our viewers at home what we're going to be doing in the Sense

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:15.030
Olympics.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That sounds like a good idea.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.620
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, we're going to have six events. And, we're going to be using our coworkers

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.400
as senseletes. Now, each of these events is going to somehow test or push the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.890
limits of human sense and perception. And first we have a touch event. And in

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.720
this event, we're going to be measuring what's called a difference threshold.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.584
So, basically, measuring our senseletes ability to detect small changes in

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:40.978
weight.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:45.120
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Then, we're going to move on to one of our chemical senses. That's taste.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.655
Followed by our main events that focus on hearing and seeing.

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:54.225
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As we all know, humans have five senses. They have sight, hearing, taste, smell

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:58.462
and touch. And to go along with each of those five senses are our five sense

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:05.057
organs. We have eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. And it's through these

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:10.540
organs that we receive all of our sensory information about the world.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.086
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's true, Andy. But our sensory organs are just the beginning of the

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:17.880
process. They only let us sense things, not necessarily perceive them.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.792
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're right. And this is a really important distinction, sensation versus

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:27.216
perception. So, sensation is really the taking in of input. It's the sights and

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:30.951
the sounds. Whereas perception is the understanding and interpreting of these

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.549
inputs. So, really it's the senses.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.628
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Or sensations.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.341
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Together with the brain.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:37.694
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Or our perception.

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:43.049
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That are part of really the same process. Responding adaptively to our

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.662
environment.

00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:48.502
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So what's really important here, is that we see, feel, touch, taste, and hear

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:54.280
just as much with our brain as we do with our sense organs. Sensation is just

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.604
the beginning of the process. Whereas perception is the end of the process. Oh,

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:03.020
excuse me, I'm getting word from our grounds correspondent, Susan. Their

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.850
senseletes are lining up to begin. You know, while we're waiting for them to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880
start, Andy, do you mind telling the people at home what it takes to be a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.179
senselete?

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.296
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Absolutely, Lauren. So one thing we can expect to see today, from our real

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:16.762
all-star contenders is some exquisite transduction. Now, transduction is

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:21.320
something you may not be familiar with. It's how we convert a physical stimulus

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.280
and the physical energy associated with that into neural energy, in the form of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.630
neural impulses.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.458
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For example, when light waves become neural impulses from the photo receptors

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.064
on our retna.

00:02:33.064 --> 00:02:35.515
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's true Lauren, but I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:38.700
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm sorry, I just get really excited about sensation of perception.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.918
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's okay, Lauren, we all do. It's going to be a great day in the history of

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:42.397
Sense Olympics though.

00:02:42.397 --> 00:02:45.029
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Andy, you do know it's going to be the only day in the history of Sense

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.301
Olympics.

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:50.226
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You don't know that. This might be a continuing event. I hope so. anyway,

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:53.618
before we begin the first event, we'd love to thank our sponsors who made this

00:02:53.618 --> 00:02:59.574
a reality. Paint away, sniff book, Megadog 30,000 desiboost and

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:00.885
[UNKNOWN].

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:05.118
They've generously donated to make this event happen. So, now to our ground

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.350
correspondent, Susan, are you ready?
