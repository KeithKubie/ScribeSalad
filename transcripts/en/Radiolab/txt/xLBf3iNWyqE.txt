Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I'm Kelly. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. So we're just doing this because, because that article you wrote with one of the most amazing things that we've ever read. Oh, I thank you. Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today a story about a decision about a decision that we as human beings, we've only recently begun to consider. Yeah, sure. There are, there are stories like this elsewhere, but somehow not too many. No, maybe not know. So we're going to devote the entire hour to just this one story, which I think is the first for us think it is. And the story comes to us from a woman named Kelly Behnam. Okay. She's a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times in Florida. Maybe the way to do this as chronologically, just sort of across time, where were you and who, what did you want to do when I decided to have a baby?

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       Yeah. Well, you one of those people who, who ever since you were young, you knew that you would be a mom. Yeah, I did, but I wasn't like, um, I didn't play with a lot of dolls or babysit. I bet. I always just kind of had this weird certainty that I might have a daughter and a daughter and not a son, maybe a son too, but I don't know. I think I always thought I would have a daughter and I sort of had this image of her in my head. And what was the image like? Really Feisty, mischievous, dark hair. Um, dirty face. Okay. We've, we've left princess land, not a princess at all. Like a tree climber and a dog chaser. I really wanted to have a baby. I wanted one very badly, but I just couldn't see how it made sense for me to be the father.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       That's Tom French, also a journalist at the Tampa Bay Times or he was at the time he and Kelly had been dating for a few years, but he was a good 10 years older than her. I had two kids, sons approaching the end of college and I was ready to travel. I wanted to see, yes. Spain and Greece and the world tour on the, on the cruise ship where you get to be the, you know, poker master, whatever you interested. The only world tour I would have been insured with Springsteen, Springsteen following Springsteen around Europe. I'd made up my mind no more kids, but she was insistent. I stuck to it. She saw our daughter very clearly. Oh yeah, I saw that I was destined to be that little girl's father. And was that a happy gentle disagreement or the other kind? Oh, it was brutal. Broke up. And when we worked at the same place, there was kind of an invisible line in the, in the newsroom that neither of us would cross.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       The line was the mailboxes. There really wasn't one. Wow. It was a horrible time. We call it the dark era. The dark period. What turned you? Uh, it was the, uh, it was the Halloween section of target. I, my sons and I have loved Halloween forever. I love it when I was a little kid and, uh, I just wanted to see what they had, if they had anything new, cause I had, you know, I usually check out their gargoyles and their stuff and so I just was kind of walking through the section browsing and then something

Speaker 2:          00:03:03       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       just stop me in my tracks. Apparently it was, it was really like kind of a lightning bolt epiphany. And I just said, wait a minute, maybe you are not thinking about this straight, you're acting as though you're 80. And then it hit me that nobody knows how much time they have to have a child is to embrace a future that you can't control. Remember those words.

Speaker 4:          00:03:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       so I, I, you know, I had this come to Jesus meeting with

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       myself among the gargoyles and that was when I realized I need to just take a step back and try to restart the conversation with Kelly. And so then he, you know, went home and wrote me this long letter and I just, I was over and by that point I was like, I wasn't looking back. So, you know, over a few months, took a little while, they patch things up, eventually got married and started trying to make a baby. We thought that this would just happen right away. And then of course it didn't

Speaker 4:          00:04:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:04:05       after trying and trying the regular way, she took drugs that make you drop a bunch of eggs at one time. After that, the Turkey based or method, there's like kind of a process that they walk you through after Turkey Beyster IVF test to stuff. Yeah, and I never thought that it would get that far, but it would go farther because after trying IVF three times, that didn't work. So they said, well you can try it with an egg donor. Meaning you get a friend who'd be willing to donate the egg, take the egg, put it in a dish, forcibly impregnated with Tom Sperm. Then you insert the egg into your womb and that's kind of the magic bullet it seems in fertility.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       It's kind of like if you don't know what's wrong with your car, you just replaced the whole engine. Kelly asked a good friend to be an egg donor. They've been planted the egg and shortly after she took a pregnancy test, I tested away too early. Um, and so the line was super, super faint. Wasn't even sure I could see it at all. So I took a photograph of the pregnancy test and I put it into Photoshop and I actually had to dial up the contrast to make the, the line up here. That is everything about this is so high tech. Right. Wow. Did you see what you wanted to see? Yeah, and I was like, oh my God, I think there's two lines there. So I waited and I, and I did it a second time. Um, and then I, then I told Tom

Speaker 5:          00:05:30       and did you go into like the expectant parent mode and Oh yeah, they touched up to paint. You know, I patched the little holes in the wall. Everything was perfect. Everything was absolutely perfect until it wasn't

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       five months into her pregnancy, 20 weeks, which is just about halfway cause the full term is 40. Kelly was at a park playing with her dog and

Speaker 6:          00:05:58       I just, I felt a little bit weird and just started to bleed like not a lot, but any amount of blood is not a good thing. And I called the doctor's office and they didn't seem too concerned. They were like, yeah, you probably want to go to the hospital and get that checked.

Speaker 3:          00:06:15       And I went to pick her up then

Speaker 6:          00:06:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:06:18       by the time we got to the hospital, she was in a lot of pain,

Speaker 6:          00:06:21       cramping, cramping, cramping. I knew something was really, really wrong.

Speaker 5:          00:06:26       They got me into one of those wheelchairs and they wheeled me into the, um, sort of triage room. And by that point, like blood was just coming out of me, chunks of blood coming out of me and I didn't know, I thought it was baby parts like falling out and I thought, I'm having a miscarriage. Like the babies kind of drop out on the floor. I was throwing up and then the doctor came in and he looked scared. There's the doctor say something or what happened?

Speaker 6:          00:06:57       Um, the doctor

Speaker 3:          00:07:00       explained to me quietly, there was something that was making it difficult to stop Kelly's bleeding. And if they couldn't stop it, we might lose. Kelly and Kelly heard the doctor say this, and I need to tell you, Kelly is the toughest, most fearless person I've ever known. But she grabbed my arm as hard as anyone who's ever grabbed my arm.

Speaker 6:          00:07:19       And I remember just asking him, don't let me die. Please don't let me die. It was terrifying. And then, um, at some point they, they brought in an ultrasound machine to see what was going on with the baby and I assume the baby was long dead. I mean, I thought they were baby parts on the floor. I didn't know. And they hooked up this machine and they were moving their on and around and around and trying to pick up a heartbeat and there was nothing. And, um, I was apologizing to Tom, I'm sorry, like, you know, I just knew the baby was gone. Then all of a sudden

Speaker 7:          00:08:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:08:01       there, it was just as hard.

Speaker 7:          00:08:07       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:08:07       this is sound. She recorded on her cell phone.

Speaker 7:          00:08:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:08:12       baby's heartbeat. Super, super fast. So it sounds like a rabbit or something. You just hear it on the Sonogram. Yeah, this heartbeat pops up and then there's the baby and you can see and she looks fine. She's totally oblivious. She's just right there. So now I thought, oh my God, I'm going to watch her die when going watch her die in front of me. And um,

Speaker 6:          00:08:41       then they started just pumping me full of drugs to try to get this labor stopped. There's this drug called magnesium sulfate and one of the effects of it is it just makes you kind of boil from the inside. But eventually they got the contraction stop. They got the bleeding stopped, they put me in a hospital room and they said get to 24 weeks because that's, that's the limit. So four more weeks. Yeah. It was almost like they drawn a line in the sand. Like you must get to 24 or there's no hope. And why 24? What's special about that? That number they told me that um, 24 weeks is kind of the loose definition of viability.

Speaker 8:          00:09:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:09:25       that sort of grew out of when they were fighting out Roe v Wade

Speaker 8:          00:09:30       in Fondren birth at state for example, the court rule that a woman who commits an abortion on herself is guilty of no crime. Okay,

Speaker 9:          00:09:36       okay, so here's the story as I understand it Robert. Okay. In Roe v Wade, the supreme court was trying to strike this balance. They wanted to protect a woman's right to choose as we know, right? But they also wanted to say that there are limits to that, right, that there is some moment in the development of the fetus in the course of this pregnancy, we crossed this line and suddenly it's no longer just about the woman's rights. Now you have to think about the state's interest in the [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       born child. The problem of course, it's weird you draw that line now that is the million dollar question. This is neither pharaoh honey. She's a law professor at Duke University. So the kind of best gas at that point, the best medical objective standard that the justices could come up with. And this is in 1973 was viability and Norton viable in this case means can it survive on its own? Yes, outside of the woman's womb. In other words, when a fetus is developed enough that you can take it out of the mother's room and it can still survive. That the court suggested is the point when it is no longer okay to have an abortion because of cross that line, a fetus is quote viable. So then the question was, when does a fetus cross that line? When can it survive on its own?

Speaker 8:          00:10:49       Well, we begin Mr. Justice in our brief with the development of the human embryo.

Speaker 9:          00:10:57       And here's where you get to the 24 week thing. What ended up happening was that the court considered what was known about fetal development. And there are charts that show this, um, go like this. Three weeks, the fetus was brain and heart begin to develop eight weeks, nerve fibers, 13 to 16 weeks, the fetus begins to move and then kick at 23 weeks. Some fetuses respond to familiar, sounds like a mother's voice and at 24 weeks

Speaker 8:          00:11:18       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:11:18       air sacks form in the lungs. And the thinking was maybe that's the point, the minimum point where the fetus is viable because perhaps it could breathe on its own. But this was just a theoretical idea. No one was testing it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       No one was trying to take the fetus out of a mother at 24 weeks to see if it would survive. In fact, throughout the 70s and eighties most hospitals, according to Kelly drew the line of viability back a little bit farther at 28 weeks.

Speaker 6:          00:11:49       And that is because somewhere around the 28th week of gestation, the lungs start to produce a fluid called surfactant, which prevents the lungs from collapsing and sticking together between breaths. So that's a really important thing. So for a long time, the actual viability line, not the theoretical one was 28 weeks, but then in the late seventies someone invented an artificial lung surfactant. It's kind of a slippery white stuff that they shoot down the ventilator tube when the baby's born. And that combined with Ivy Nutrition, new super small ventilators moved the line of viability back to around where it is now. Where it is now is generally around 24 but uh, here's the thing, depending on what hospital you're in, even what doctor is on call, sometimes it can be 23 or 25 or in some cases 22 so given modern technology, you could imagine, so there's need a one day the line could jump way back, which will make things really tricky.

Speaker 1:          00:12:51       If for example, we get to the point where modern science is able to develop an artificial womb. Yeah. Does viability start at the point of a fertilized egg? You know, if the standard is the point at which the developing child can actually survive outside of the womb using any technological intervention possible, that is a slippery line. Indeed.

Speaker 6:          00:13:14       They said get to 24 weeks because that's the limit, which meant that the doctors have to pump Kelly full of drugs, keep her feet elevated for at least another four weeks. But I just kept going into labor in and out of it and they felt like they couldn't hold it off anymore. And at 23 weeks and four days, a doctor tells her that there's nothing more they can do. The baby is gonna come in a day, maybe two. The guy comes in and um, he, he, he seems a little uncomfortable like this, that was not pleasant for him. He said, you know, your baby's probably coming in 24 to 48 hours and we know how hard you work to have this baby and we know how much you want this baby and we assume that you want everything done. What does that mean? We had no idea. So we said, we're not sure if we do want everything done. Paint the picture for us doctor. And he said, you know, there's about a 53% chance that the baby will die no matter what we do. 53. Yeah. Whatever we do, whatever we do, there was a small chance that she could be fine. What were those chances? About 20

Speaker 4:          00:14:26       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:14:26       I felt like, like 20% you know, it's not an, it's not an impossibility. It seems like a like a reasonable, it seems like worth a gamble until you really think about what the 80% means. I mean, she could be on a ventilator for the rest of her life. She could have a massive bleed in her brain and it was like eat holes in her brain and affect her ability to think or talk or walk. She could pretty good chance she could be blind or deaf. And there was no way for the doctors to predict. But with the doctors didn't know is that when the baby came into the world, it would need a ton of medical support. It may even need to be revived. And so the question for the [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:15:14       for Tom and Kelly was, do they want the doctors to do that? Do they want them to pursue every measure possible or no, and just let nature take its course? And he said it would be, we should decide before the baby came because once the baby came, if we saw the baby, it would be really hard to say no. So if, if no was going to be the answer, we needed to say that before the baby came.

Speaker 5:          00:15:42       Yeah, it's the worst night ever and you're trying to make up your mind about what's what's right. Like would we be torturing this baby for nothing? We didn't want her to be born and have a life that she would hate us for having. There have been instances where children with birth defects or genetic diseases have filed wrongful life suits, essentially claiming that they should have never been born. We had to really debate what was in her best interests. What would she want? I started to really struggle with whether I was being selfish, whether I had already pushed too far and this was like God or the universe pushing back. Well, think we went into pleasing our house. Our marriage might break up. We would lose our ability to try again for another child. I felt like I might get a baby, but I would lose everything else. And I think I got pretty close to no

Speaker 7:          00:16:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:16:46       all night as we're talking this through and yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:16:50       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:16:50       crying and trying to figure it out.

Speaker 7:          00:16:53       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:16:54       ah, we could hear the baby's heartbeat through the Monitor.

Speaker 7:          00:17:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:17:00       baby was letting us know all night. I'm right here, right here.

Speaker 7:          00:17:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:17:15       but there must've been a moment where you had to say yes or no out loud.

Speaker 6:          00:17:20       I um, we asked for a second opinion or not a second opinion, but another console. We had some more questions and a nurse practitioner from the NICU came to the room. Yes. My name is Diane Leisel. I'm a neonatal nurse practitioner. This is the next day had asked to speak to someone again and set up just citing numbers and statistics. I don't give numbers. It's different for each baby. She kinda started to paint a picture. This is what I've seen. I've been doing this 30 years. But more importantly,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I also told them that it wasn't a yes or no decision.

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       she said, you know, you don't have to decide right now. They could have the baby. The baby came out crying and active, then we should do everything we can for the baby. But if the baby came out, blue and limp intervened, tricolor hemorrhage

Speaker 4:          00:18:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       we could stop. We didn't have to keep going. If something goes horribly wrong, we can withdraw the support and then you could hold your baby until it dies. But you can give your baby a chance and see how it goes. In other words, in a very real way, they could give this decision to the baby.

Speaker 5:          00:18:35       That same night I was feeling like I'm just uncomfortable. A couple hours later, discomfort turns to pain. Finally a doctor came in and was like, yeah, your labor, we have to go right now. So then it was like super, super quick. Oh, our light shot in the spine, cutting me open and then, oh my God, there's a third person in this room.

Speaker 4:          00:19:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:19:05       but not really. Not Quite, almost. I mean, she was so, so early. And what did she look like? Um, well I didn't see her then. Um, I just saw like her kind of Whiz by in an incubator and she just looked like a little dark smear in a hat.

Speaker 1:          00:19:27       And did you make it to 24 weeks? So we were one day shy of 24

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       23 weeks and six days.

Speaker 4:          00:19:39       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       we'll be back in just a moment.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Hi, this is Kelly friends. Tom French sham leaving credits. There we go. Okay, here we go. I'll try it. Regular lab is supported in part by the national science foundation and the Alpha t phone foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. Hi Diane. Lays out more information about Sloan can be found@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       I'm Bessie music. I hosted esoterical talk show in Egypt after the Arab spring until the government tried to throw me in jail. So now I live in America and I host the podcast three made in America presented by cafe where I interview all kinds of outsiders from comedian Maz. Do you run to journalist Maria in a wholesale and filmmakers here in view? And I try to use those conversations to figure out my new country, American subscribe to remade in America presented by cafe. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Today we're spending entire hour on a single story, which we saw in the Tampa Bay Times. Kelly Behnam, a journalist published an unbelievably wonderful set of articles about her and her husband Tom Fringe, who was also a journalist. They had a baby except their baby came very, very early. So full term, as we've mentioned, is 40 weeks. Their daughter arrived 23 weeks and six days, which works out to be just a little bit over halfway. No, just to put that in context,

Speaker 9:          00:21:16       if a baby is born before 22 weeks, it's generally considered a miscarriage and pretty much no doctor is gonna intervene. If a baby is born after 25 weeks. There've been all kinds of studies which show that doctors then feel morally obliged to save that life no matter what the parents say. So before 22 and after 25 things are pretty clear, but between 22 and 25, you land in this gray zone,

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       this strange little liminal space between life and death. We have to answer some really tough questions like should my baby live at what cost and who gets to decide. And ultimately when does life begin? And she has shown us that so many Kelly and Tom, like many parents who land in this zone decided that for the hardest question, ultimately it's up to the baby. The baby will tell them whether it's going to stay or whether it's going to go. So they delivered by c-section. And uh, their daughter with that point didn't have a name, was whisked off to the neonatal intensive care unit or the NICU. And eventually they went to see her and they incubator for the first time. And she was, um, like, like weirdly perfect.

Speaker 7:          00:22:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:22:37       if she had all the parts, these long fingers and long feet, delicate little nose and she had hair and fingernails and eyebrows and you know, all the things that they're supposed to have. But she was translucent.

Speaker 5:          00:22:57       You could just see right through her. You could see all the veins running under her skin and you could see her heart thumping in her chest. Um, and her eyes were sealed shut like a puppy. And um, she was like beat up. Like she had bruises all over her body and she had a black eye just from the, you know, they were very careful with them when they're born, but just that very delicate handling, um, kind of batters these babies because they're so fragile. I mean, it was like weird. Like I didn't know how I supposed to feel.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       I mean, you want to believe that the, the minute you meet your daughter, there's going to be like butterflies, you know, or like Unicorns or something. It's supposed to be the best moment of your,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       but there was so much terror inside that moment. I was terrified because I love being a father. My relationship with my sons is extremely important to me and I was really terrified that she would be so alien having been born at 23 weeks, six days, that I wouldn't recognize her as my daughter and that I wouldn't bond with her, that I was now that thought was filled me with a real dread and I went up to see her. I could see that she was only a half finished, barely a pound at that point. So tiny. My brain couldn't even process how small she was. And the nurse Gwen, um, she said, well, you can touch her, you know, and I was stunned because I didn't think I would be able to. And so she had me, I had already washed and sterilized my hands once and she had me do it again. She showed me how to reach in through this little round porthole into the incubator and explained how to touch her. You, you don't rub the skin because the skin will come off if you do that. When they're born that early you, you just press gently. And so the baby was lying there, not with her fists, but with her arms extended with their palms open. So her right palm was right there. When I reached my left hand, Dan and I just put my, my left finger gently into her poem and she just grabbed on tight.

Speaker 5:          00:25:17       Mm.

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       And in that moment, um,

Speaker 5:          00:25:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       all my fears about not being able to bond with her washed away. And um, hi. Uh, what, what got to me was

Speaker 5:          00:25:40       how

Speaker 3:          00:25:43       I could be so afraid.

Speaker 5:          00:25:47       Oh, when she was so strong and at that point I just, she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen and I told her, hey, peanut daddy. So that's why my daughter, yeah. When a baby is this early, the parents and the doctors are watching it very carefully trying to guess, is this baby ready to be out in the world? Is it going to make it? And Tom says, when she grabbed his finger, that wasn't just them bonding, he felt like she was saying something. She made her will very, very clear. Baby declared itself like declared its will to live. And that was a phrase we heard again and again. Some babies will for can use the term to declare themselves over the first few

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       hours and days of their life. That's a neonatologist. We spoke to Keith Barrington, you get a gut feeling and that's Diane Lez elegant and the nurse practitioner. After meeting the baby that this one looks very fragile or this one can do it, the baby's declared itself. Now there's a real question as to like, what does that mean? What are you seeing when something that prematurely declares itself and here we ran into a real difference. Parents will often see will in a credible will and resolve doctors and nurses. No, not so much. That sounds a bit too mystical for me. I wouldn't take it as there's a voice inside the baby saying I'm going to be a fighter. I'm not one is sick enough not to be able to fight and one isn't. Can you see a spirit in it in a kid? Can I think you can see for some fight, I call it spunk.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       A lot of times that is Tracey Hollet. I'm a registered nurse. She was Kelly and Tom's primary nurse at all children's hospital and like everyone we spoke to on the hospital side, when it comes to this issue, she chooses her words very carefully. I maybe try to keep things a little bit more neutral than talking about their will to live. Because you know a baby at 23 weeks barely has folds on the outside of its brain. Its brain is still smooth for the most part. So who knows what it's capable of thinking or feeling? Oh, that's a difficult question. And the truth is things like fight spunk may just boil down to physiology. Maybe that baby had a few more lung buds to start with. Maybe it had an easier time and utero may have nothing to do with will. In fact the baby grasping the finger of the parent, it's actually a reflex

Speaker 10:         00:28:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       that the babies have a grasp reflex. I never tell a parent that because they think it's an intentional movement. Because you know, putting yourself in the parent's head, if you've gotta decide how much am I going to push, how much of my heart am I going to pour into this little creature? Maybe if you can see something like will or something like intention, if you see, oh, that's a person in there. Or maybe if you don't see it, maybe it's the only way you got to make this decision. Yes. My wife, the professional ethicists often says, we don't make important decisions in our life for rational reasons. Very often, no. Keith and his wife, Annie, John VA have done a huge amount of research into the ethics of extremely premature births. But one of the primary reasons we wanted to talk to him is that in addition to being a neonatologist and a guy who publishes a lot of stuff in this area, he and his wife recently had a baby girl who was born at 24 weeks and five days [inaudible] 20 grams, one and a half pounds. And, uh, she was actually in my own and ICU. Oh Wow. I was actually the director of the unit where she was

Speaker 10:         00:29:31       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       So he was in his unit into the place where he usually worked. He saw babies, make it not make it, and now suddenly he was a parent that place

Speaker 11:         00:29:42       and several weeks after his baby was born, there was a very, very big complication. She actually didn't move at all for about 36 hours. How many thought maybe it was a little and maybe it's time. Yeah, so they decided he and his wife to let her go.

Speaker 4:          00:30:02       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         00:30:03       peacefully. But I went back into the en ICU to see ya in something happened. He looked down and he saw her lips move.

Speaker 4:          00:30:14       [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:30:14       barely just thought he was sucking on a suitor that the nurse had put in her mouth. She was sucking on a pacifier and it was just a reflex. The most basic baby reflex, the sucking reflex. He knew that, but just that movement to slicking on the Sioux, that changed his mind completely. I went and bank to Manny and said, we can't stop. A really neat to, to continuing and give her the chance. But you knew that some of the sucking responses and not, that's a fairly deep brain. Yes. It's a very basic, it's just the brainstem is not, you know, you and you need a lot more than be able to suck to, to, um, to do well. But as I say, I was trying to be the parent there or not then in etiologist. Oh, could you remember if the doctor in you was surprised at the father in you? Yeah, I think I was actually a little, yeah. I think if I had to have been more evidence based and rational and scientific, um, I, I could have gone either way, but just as a father, I couldn't at that point let it go.

Speaker 6:          00:31:18       I just didn't really know how to process it. I felt like she was, I just had this very acute sense that she had just been like violently ripped out of my body and I could feel where they had cut her out, you know? And like I just wanted to put her back and make her safe, you know? Yeah. And I had had all these questions going through my head, like, you know, like how long does she have to live for us to get a birth certificate for this to be real.

Speaker 6:          00:31:53       Like I felt like she might die and, and, and like, it wouldn't count and I, and I wouldn't be a mother, you know what I mean? And, and like what if she died? Like what would happen? Like what do we have a funeral? They make caskets the size of shoe boxes. I mean, all, he's like, it's so screwed up that that's the stuff you think about, but your brain goes places you just can't control or predict. Um, and if she, I want her to like, if she knew, was she really aware that I was even standing there? Like was it just a reflex that made her, grabbed my finger and when she grabbed it, did she know that you know, I was there and if she didn't know I was there, did she wonder where I had gone?

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Did she feel alone? And then she's scared. Oh, she could really do at that point, we'll sit with those questions. And it just became this waiting game.

Speaker 8:          00:32:53       A [inaudible] [inaudible] continuing about moment.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we are spending the whole hour with Tampa Bay Times reporter at Kelly Bennom and her husband Tom French and the story that they're telling us to bet this limbo a space that's literally between life and death. We have to tackle some really big questions. Yeah. Oh the, here's an easy one. Tom, when did you decide to name your daughter? Juniper [inaudible]? About about five days after she was born. No, in those five days, pretty much everything in their lives changed. I mean on the most superficial level, they began their hospital stay days zero in the maternity ward, which had butterflies on the walls and images of roses opening.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       And um, everyone's really good looking like in an er sort of way or like in a Grey's anatomy kind of way. We had like one super hot nurse, we called her cupcake and she had this like glossy hair and you know, people would visit me. They'd be like, Hey, is cupcake here with, is cupcake? Come on by. And so that's where their hospital journey began. But five days later everything had changed and they find themselves on a different floor of the hospital stranded in this unit that is perhaps more than any other place on earth. The physical embodiment of this limbo, the neonatal intensive care unit, the NICU where they just have to wait and hope that that will or whatever it was they saw in juniper takes hold.

Speaker 12:         00:34:59       We had been like yanked out of our lives and out of everything that we recognized, you know, out of our jobs at our house and we just been

Speaker 8:          00:35:12       okay

Speaker 12:         00:35:12       dropped into this like science fiction, nothing was recognizable babies that even look like babies, you know there was one baby that had his intestines be outside of his body, like piled up on his belly like in this back and everyone's wearing uniform, don't know who anyone is and everything like

Speaker 5:          00:35:37       beeping and humming and you don't know how long you're going to be there and you don't have any sense of time. Like day and night don't mean anything. And you know, we're sort of dimly aware of the Sun rising and setting out the window. But other than that, it's just, it's just like minute to minute, hour to hour. You're afraid to leave even for you for an hour to get some lunch because the baby could die.

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       You know, if we went home to get some sleep, would she, would she die? I mean is that critical? And she had roughly five, six days that went pretty well. And then that next weekend blew a hole on our intestines. That was the real beginning of a lot of problems. And her belly turned dark and got real distended. They were inserting drains in the belly to try to drain away the stool and gunk. And she just had this little straw sticking out of her belly and then they couldn't maintain her blood pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       So I was thinking of everything I could do, cause you don't want to feel powerless in a situation like that. You want to feel like there's something you can do. So in quiet moments with Tom would do chapter one, the boy who lived his, he would stand over juniper incubator and he would read her Harry Potter,

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four privet drive. We're proud to say that they were perfectly normal. Thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious. As I started reading to her and as the days went on, she has no idea what I'm reading. Right. But there is something there that

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       she responded to. I wanted to say she liked because her, her sat number would go high at that point. Her sat number, what is it like her oxygen, the saturation of oxygen in our blood. Ah, Tim says that number on the monitor was one of the only ways that they could get feedback about how she was doing. Because you know, her eyes were still closed. There'd be times when she wasn't moving around a lot. The higher the number, the better. And he says when he would read to her,

Speaker 3:          00:37:50       her numbers would go up. Not just slowly but instantly. But then when I got deeper into the story, I read in Haggard's voice buyout it, professor Dumbledore, Sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke and she decided instantly

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       and the alarms are just going off and going off and Kelly hit me and she said, you're scaring the baby.

Speaker 3:          00:38:16       And I'm like, what do you, what you could see even before her eyes opened that she was really responding to what we were doing. She didn't know a chapter is, but she was in her own way, very eagerly waiting for the next chapter and I don't know, a better way to describe to be alive.

Speaker 6:          00:38:37       Then you want to find out what happens next. Unfortunately, what happens next is that one night at around two o'clock in the morning on a rear, NYPA Bay actually went to sleep at home. They get a call from their doctor in his first question was how far do you live from the hospital? And yeah, that's not a question you want to hear from your child's doctor. Leave, like rushed to the hospital. And, um, when they get there, they were told that she did it again. She got another hole, neither hold her intestines and she started to really spiral

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:39:11       I it really go downhill. Her blood pressure and oxygen levels were crashing. She was on a hundred percent oxygen. The ventilator settings were turned up as high as they could go and she was still struggling and faltering and you know, once they are giving your baby a hundred percent oxygen, they can't give her any more. At that point, I had done everything that I could possibly do. This is Fauzia Shaquille neonatologist at all children's hospital. She was Juniper's doctor at the time. She said she'd given juniper everything she could think of, blood pressure, medicine, antibiotics. She'd put a drain in her abdomen, but obviously it was not enough. If something was wrong, instead of be wrong, we might lose her at any second. The only option left to take her to the operating room with car open, clear the intestines, relieve the pressure. How do you do a surgery on a one pound baby? Seems no, exactly. I mean you don't, she was so extremely premature, so fragile, so tiny. That operating seemed kind of crazy. And Dr Shaquille began to really consider the idea that maybe this was, it had at that point. Um, I was at bedside looking at her, um, trying to figure out what to do and all of a sudden

Speaker 4:          00:40:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:40:25       she opened her eyes.

Speaker 4:          00:40:28       Really?

Speaker 6:          00:40:28       Yeah. She opened her eyes. Why? And she looked at us, her eyes were like wide open and she was looking right at the doctor directly staring at her hard. And uh, it was a very powerful moment.

Speaker 4:          00:40:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:40:49       Dr Shaquille says she decided right then and there. Well, going into surgery, I think she deserves a chance to tell me more about why you made that decision. Oh, well, typically babies who are that critical or they're totally unresponsive. Yeah. Because they're just fighting for every breath and the ability to just open her eyes at that stage in her life when she had no blood pressure that I could barely record when she had hardly any oxygen for her to just open her eyes and look at us. It was a very powerful statement that I'm still here. I'm here, I am still here, don't give up. So Dr Shaquille Summon, the pediatric surgeon told her they want to move forward with the operation, but the surgeon, no

Speaker 1:          00:41:36       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:41:36       the surgeon was adamant that she did not want to do it. She said it's Eh, it's few title and it's um, she, her blood pressure's so unstable that she will not make it out of the Er. And the surgeon told her, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       even if I can open her up and do the job, her skin is so papery that I might not be able to set her back up. There are guidelines that medical industries have even basic things like the hippocratic oath do no harm. That's law professor and emphasis. Nita, Farrah honey. Again, many physicians legitimately believe that if you have a preterm and fence and that infant is in serious peril of spending a life of suffering and pain and the only way to do no harm and fulfill your oath is not to do the surgery. But she says, if you ask the courts, you know, right now the law favors life.

Speaker 6:          00:42:29       The courts have seen very few cases that involve disputes like this, but in every one so far, she says they've supported the person who's arguing to keep the child alive. I never, there's life. There's hope. So this is our window. We should do it. Now for Dr Shaquille, the argument that ultimately won the day was simply this. Basically what I told her was that if you think she's going to die, well he is dying right now as we speak in the unit. So we can either do nothing and she definitely dies or we can do something and she probably dies. But you never know. There is a slim chance. So they're wheeling the incubator with the baby in it and I'm holding her little hand and she's getting ready to go into surgery. And she was looking right at me. And she hadn't done that before. I mean, it really seemed like she was aware that I was there very clearly and she was locked on my face. So I, we know her. I gave her a little kiss on her forehead and Tom did the same thing and then they wheeled her away.

Speaker 6:          00:43:29       How long was the operation? It was, we, they, they co they paged us much more quickly than we expect it to come back. So we knew something was wrong. The nurse assured Tom and Kelly into a separate room, this little windowless conference room and the surgeon came in and she said, you know, I, um, she was supposed to go in and clean everything out and rinse everything off and find the hole and patch it and, and do all these things. And she said when she cut the baby open and touched the baby's intestines with her, a little probe, she's, the way she described it was everything fell apart. It was just falling apart and falling apart. And you're hearing this. Yeah, juniper had survived the operation, but barely. So we're thinking like, okay, this was an incredibly risky surgery and we just put her through it for nothing either. I thought there was no way that bay was gonna live til morning. I had been really

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       working hard to avoid thinking about all the bad things that were possibly going to happen here. Just trying to hold on, you know, and I sort of thought it was my job to do that and I'm just kind of funny, kind of stereotypically male of me. Um, and uh, and Tom says they were in the car around the time of the surgery as we're driving, you know, by that time Junebug and I were about two thirds of the way. So the first book and this thought just snuck in on me, which was, what if I don't get to finish reading her this book? What if she doesn't get to hear the ending?

Speaker 8:          00:45:14       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       And you know, she never finds out. You know, what happens to Harry, Hermione and Ron that thought led in all the other flats, very difficult thoughts about all the things we wouldn't get to do with her. She wouldn't ever get to know. And I had this terrible thought that, you know, she was in this incubator, this isolated this plastic box. And I had this terrible thought that she was just going to go from one box to another.

Speaker 8:          00:45:51       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:45:52       And I had to pull over, you know, cause I just lost it. And at that point I wasn't maintaining anymore. There was no holding back. This flood of, uh, of, of what was happening. And we had a rural Kelly and I, which is that only one of us got to lose it at, at a time. And you know, that was my turn to lose it.

Speaker 11:         00:46:13       We're in a very unnatural situation of neonatal intensive care, which is so recent in the developed world and still doesn't exist in much of the world. And we're working so hard to save babies is very new neonatologist, Keith, Barrington and evolutionary history. Newborn babies very frequently died. And most parents who have a, any significant number of children had lost one or two or three or more. And in order to be able to carry on with your life and to provide for the rest of your family, we had to be able to adapt to the death of babies. And now that has become much less common to lose a baby, even no miscarriages and stillbirths, to now we realizing how much that hurts. And in the past, maybe we've hidden some of that from ourselves.

Speaker 6:          00:47:03       No way that bay was going to live til morning. But what happened was really strange. She continued to just not die

Speaker 7:          00:47:20       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:47:20       and the next day she, you know, she was still there.

Speaker 7:          00:47:25       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:47:26       The surgeon was surprised and no one can quite explain it. The more I thought about it, the more I found it like surprising and interesting, you know, because she doesn't know that there's a better place, you know that she's just in this box. Yeah. And she's gotten needles coming out of every which way, and tube down her throat. She has no idea that one day, you know, she'll just be held and rocked and then we'll take her out for ice cream and she'll play with the dog. And I just wondered like what is she fighting for?

Speaker 7:          00:48:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:48:15       and so that became, you know, our job, the best that we can articulate it was to try to give her some sense of something beyond that place. After the surgery, things did not get easier. She would stop breathing many times a day. Teams would rush into the state, come on g, but come back, come back. I just, I remember the room spinning and then she started to swell for like weeks and weeks, but she continued to not die and she began to gain weight.

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       And you know, nurses are very superstitious. A lot of them, they won't say the word at home

Speaker 6:          00:48:56       for some reason. When the baby's here, that word is Tracey. Hold it again. Primary nurse, they get sick and we just, it's a superstition obviously, but something happens and sometimes it can be devastating. So what do you say instead? We'll say that place that the baby's going to go when they leave here. Wow. I got so tortured. Sometimes we spell it, which makes no sense at all.

Speaker 3:          00:49:22       Um, after about four and a half months, Diane, that nurse Practitioner told us that we might want to think about buying a car seat. That was the first inclination that we might be able to take her out of there.

Speaker 6:          00:49:37       That's the first time I've ever imagined a choir of angels singing around mention of Carthy. Carseats right. But when you're, when you want to have a baby really bad and everybody else has a baby but you and you can't have a baby. Things like shopping for car seats become like fantasies, you know, like, and finally, you know, the doctor gave the all clear and we took the monitors off of her and she was completely free and untethered, not hooked to anything. And we strapped her into this car seat and I put a little pair of sunglasses on her cause I didn't know if her eyes would be okay in the sunlight. She'd never seen the sun. Wow. And we all kind of walked out. And um, Tracy's is really not a hugger, but we like grabbed her, hugged her and cried

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       and all over her shirt. And then we put the baby in the car and we went to chick-fil-a. Yeah, that was totally before the gay thing, before I stopped going into filet and all in all, how long were you in the hospital for? Six and a half months. I was 196 days. How is your super now what? What is, can you give us a snapshot of her morning?

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       Actually Tom and Kelly were nice enough to, uh, allow us to send a reporter to their house

Speaker 2:          00:51:05       to meet her cousin. She's two years old now. [inaudible] hi, June book. That's Jennifer [inaudible] say hi. When we got there, she was still, she was still in bed. It was just waking up. She's not being very cuddly this morning. Snippy. But then she just sprung up, jumped out of bed and took off. Huh? Yeah. You went to Daddy. Isn't that funny? Hoses. Come on, show me where the kitty is. I know you want to give the kitty a hug. She is, he don't look nice. She's kind of your typical two year old. [inaudible] Chantal. And because we were their juniper, it felt it was kind of important that we see some tricks. She's learned. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       is radio. So they have no idea what you just did. Even somersaults, you know, it's, it's interesting because as journalists again, we, we spend a lot of time chronicling sometimes very terrible things. And uh, what's interesting is that through the chair yesterday morning, by journalistic standards, nothing happened, you know, we need to do is change your name. It was, it was, it was, wouldn't even be on journalistic way doc.

Speaker 2:          00:53:12       Oh Huh. But what, you know, as a parent comes in, especially after you've been through what we went through, if you come and see Mommy, I'm on kiss. You was everything. Come on Kesha.

Speaker 5:          00:53:29       Nothing you can do about it either. We ready one. Everything happened yesterday in those couple of hours, the entire world was contained inside that morning. Okay. Of Eskimo kisses and all of her [inaudible] now all the blank chapters of her life were inside that morning waiting to be written. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:53:52       Which, what you want this book to me and it's called.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       Oh. And do you feel like you're out of the woods? Well, um, both Tom and Kelly said no way. And then Tom told us about these flu shots that juniper gets. They're not just flu shots. They're like, um, flu shots, like super flu shots and they, there's four shots you get and I swear to God that costs $14,000 for those four shots. And that is, that's a real number. You just said that's a fact. That's, yes, they are designed to help protect her from a RSV, which is a virus that in most people just presents as a common cold. But you know, her lungs are still recovering and are still developing and RSV can be devastating and there are some other concerns that could still creep in down the road. Some studies have shown that kids who were born prematurely, uh, struggle more in school with reading and math.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       That's often they're more susceptible to depression and anxiety. But I will say that, um, we took her to visit a preschool the other day and we took her there and sat her down and she just took off and like went up to these giant children and started taking their toys and they were seeing the wheels on the bus and you could see it in her eyes. I know that song and she didn't care about Tom or I one bit, you know, she was totally there with those kids and she was so ready and I thought, wow, she might be okay.

Speaker 9:          00:55:33       She is okay.

Speaker 8:          00:55:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:55:42       and now for an update, um, we originally aired this story in 2013 when juniper was to here's tape from just a few months ago.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       Right. How old are you? Huh? Four. Oh my gosh. You're about to turn five in April and do that. What's going to happen when you turn five? Oh, lable Oh, Earl Jones. [inaudible] wow.

Speaker 9:          00:56:08       Juniper is about to start kindergarten and um, her and Tom and Kelly live in Indiana now. We're Tom and Kelly teach journalism at the Indiana University media school. I actually happened to be in Indiana just yesterday, so I hooked with Tom and Kelly. We stood on the side of a busy street in downtown Bloomington and they gave me an update and they told me that in the nearly three years since we heard this story, and this is generally not what you would expect from a baby born that early.

Speaker 13:         00:56:35       Um, physically we have had shockingly few problems. Like she, she hasn't had any, I gotta knock on some wood somewhere. She never had like a, a horrible bout of the flu or was never back in the hospital. Um, her kidneys are a little bit small and they're watching that, but there's a savagery to her. It's true. That is amazing.

Speaker 9:          00:57:04       They told me that she's this extremely headstrong, active child really into climbing trees. How did you get up there? You climb, but you're so high up.

Speaker 13:         00:57:18       Sh like she goes horseback riding. She does gymnastics. Does she have some awareness of the incredible journey she went through just to be four and a half? Do you guys talk about it with her each night? We talk about it because every night she asks, Oh, tell me the story about when I was a widow, tiny baby in the hospital. Tell me about when I was sick. Tell me about when I had the hole in my tummy. So you know, for a long time I would just tell her the story. When you're born, you're born very early, a lot more early than you were supposed to be born. We just super extra small or her. I called the hospital over the summer and I said, hey, like every night we were talking about this, can I show her the NICU? Like would you let me just show her the space and what an incubator looks like.

Speaker 13:         00:58:10       And they were amazing about it. And so they set up an incubator in an empty room and they let her come in and just play in the room. And she took her a little doll baby that I ordered for her on Primi doll, baby.com or whatever that's like the size and weight that she was when she was a baby. Oh, is that a real thing? It's a real thing, you know? So I got her the stall that's so she could get an idea of how small she was. I don't know. I thought it would be useful someday. So she took it to the NICU and she put it in the incubator and we showed her how we would reach our hands through the little portholes and hold her hand. And she reached in and held her little babies, little cloth hand. And then because she's juniper and of course she would do this, she climbed into the freaking incubator and laid down and asked Tracy the nurse to close the lid. Whoa. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:59:01       Well like she, what was that like for you? Was that like, was that like traumatic flashback or was that like really cool? And she said at one point during the visit, this woman walked by the room

Speaker 13:         00:59:11       and she kinda stuck her head in the doorway and her eyes were all red and she had that look about her. Like she was a couple days postpartum and I was, I thought, Oh God, you know, Tracy kind of whisper in her ear. Then Tracy, the nurse and um, she looked at Jennifer and she said, oh my God, she's so beautiful. And then she told us that she had just had a baby if few days before that was born at 23 weeks and six days.

Speaker 2:          00:59:43       [inaudible] hi, hey baby. Hey Baby.

Speaker 9:          00:59:52       Now speaking of that, a specific chunk of time, 23 weeks, six days, we ended up checking back in with Nita ferry honney professor of law and philosophy at Duke University about that whole viability question, like that line of when a preterm infant comes viable, which at the time we did the story seemed to be roughly around 24 weeks on average. Has that changed at all? And she pointed us to a study that was done in 2015 which did sort of a big survey of outcomes for preterm infants and it basically argued that we might want to push that line back even further.

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       The study author believes that 22 weeks is the new standard for viability and that 23 weeks and 23 weeks and six days that that's too late.

Speaker 9:          01:00:33       She says, this is now the new conversation, 22 weeks, not 24.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       Um, you know, this is something that physicians and hospitals were being educated about and look at. We're already at 22 weeks, um, you know, and, and it's just been, what, two years since we last talked about this? Yeah. Three years at most, right? I mean, so in three years, if we've moved back two weeks, um, then talk to me in another way,

Speaker 9:          01:00:58       a quarter of a century and we'll be at the beginning, she thinks it's just a matter of time before we get to that artificial womb. Maybe case Lessing I'll say by way of updates is that Tom and Kelly are about to release a book about their experience. It's called juniper. And normally I'm not one to Gush, but this book is something else. Like we got into this story because of some really haunting articles that Kelly had written for the Tampa Bay Times. Uh, and this book takes those articles so much farther goes into way more detail than we could ever get into a it is, yeah, it's totally worth reading.
