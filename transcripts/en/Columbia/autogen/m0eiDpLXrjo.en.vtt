okay let's get started we're going to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
okay let's get started we're going to
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.320
okay let's get started we're going to
talk about optimization or maximization

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
talk about optimization or maximization
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.959
talk about optimization or maximization
and minimization okay so you learn to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
and minimization okay so you learn to
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.250
and minimization okay so you learn to
take a derivative and you know that what

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260
take a derivative and you know that what
 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.130
take a derivative and you know that what
doing what that process does is it gives

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140
doing what that process does is it gives
 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.480
doing what that process does is it gives
you a formulaic way of expressing the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
you a formulaic way of expressing the
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.830
you a formulaic way of expressing the
slope of a nonlinear function now you

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
slope of a nonlinear function now you
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.260
slope of a nonlinear function now you
have a way of expressing the slope of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
have a way of expressing the slope of
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200
have a way of expressing the slope of
the nonlinear function well there are

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
the nonlinear function well there are
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520
the nonlinear function well there are
certainly things you can say about

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530
certainly things you can say about
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.310
certainly things you can say about
slopes of complex nonlinear functions

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
slopes of complex nonlinear functions
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.790
slopes of complex nonlinear functions
but one of the ways in which you use

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
but one of the ways in which you use
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.200
but one of the ways in which you use
that information is to determine the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
that information is to determine the
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.459
that information is to determine the
maximum or minimum off that complex

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
maximum or minimum off that complex
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.979
maximum or minimum off that complex
nonlinear function often in science or

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
nonlinear function often in science or
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.160
nonlinear function often in science or
in policy or trying to look for the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
in policy or trying to look for the
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.460
in policy or trying to look for the
value of x which either maximizes or

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
value of x which either maximizes or
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410
value of x which either maximizes or
minimizes the function that you care

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
minimizes the function that you care
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.160
minimizes the function that you care
about this assumes that there's a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
about this assumes that there's a
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.950
about this assumes that there's a
functional relationship that is changing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
functional relationship that is changing
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.859
functional relationship that is changing
X leads to a change in the f of X or in

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
X leads to a change in the f of X or in
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.810
X leads to a change in the f of X or in
the function so there is some underlying

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
the function so there is some underlying
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.630
the function so there is some underlying
belief and causality some underlying

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
belief and causality some underlying
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580
belief and causality some underlying
reason to think that this causality

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
reason to think that this causality
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.600
reason to think that this causality
between X and f of X okay it's not like

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
between X and f of X okay it's not like
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660
between X and f of X okay it's not like
the example in your primer where you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
the example in your primer where you
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090
the example in your primer where you
might have two variables that are

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
might have two variables that are
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.649
might have two variables that are
related but they're not actually

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
related but they're not actually
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.389
related but they're not actually
causally related okay so if they are

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
causally related okay so if they are
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.830
causally related okay so if they are
causally related and you understand how

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
causally related and you understand how
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.870
causally related and you understand how
the slope of that function works you can

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
the slope of that function works you can
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.350
the slope of that function works you can
use the nature of that slope to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
use the nature of that slope to
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.889
use the nature of that slope to
determine the value of x or the value of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
determine the value of x or the value of
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.670
determine the value of x or the value of
the input variable which will either

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680
the input variable which will either
 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.459
the input variable which will either
maximize or minimize the function of

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
maximize or minimize the function of
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.360
maximize or minimize the function of
interest okay that maximization might be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
interest okay that maximization might be
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.730
interest okay that maximization might be
local or global

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740
local or global
 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.670
local or global
all so here is a convex or concave

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680
all so here is a convex or concave
 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.760
all so here is a convex or concave
function concave function is a concave

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770
function concave function is a concave
 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.070
function concave function is a concave
function that attains a maximum at the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080
function that attains a maximum at the
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.300
function that attains a maximum at the
point s well what's special about that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
point s well what's special about that
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.980
point s well what's special about that
point s is that at that point s the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990
point s is that at that point s the
 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.400
point s is that at that point s the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410
derivative of this function is equal to
 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.690
derivative of this function is equal to
0 right the slope of the function is

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700
0 right the slope of the function is
 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.950
0 right the slope of the function is
equal to 0 okay a concave or convex

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960
equal to 0 okay a concave or convex
 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.970
equal to 0 okay a concave or convex
function convex right this is a convex

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980
function convex right this is a convex
 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.750
function convex right this is a convex
function and this convex function has

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760
function and this convex function has
 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.320
function and this convex function has
the property that at the point r it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330
the property that at the point r it
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.840
the property that at the point r it
attains a minimum at that point are the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850
attains a minimum at that point are the
 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.850
attains a minimum at that point are the
slope of the function f of X or the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860
slope of the function f of X or the
 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.290
slope of the function f of X or the
derivative F prime of X is equal to 0 ok

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300
derivative F prime of X is equal to 0 ok
 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
derivative F prime of X is equal to 0 ok
so what in both these cases here the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780
so what in both these cases here the
 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.800
so what in both these cases here the
function attains a maximum here the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810
function attains a maximum here the
 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.920
function attains a maximum here the
function attains a minimum the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930
function attains a minimum the
 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.910
function attains a minimum the
derivative of the function is equal to 0

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920
derivative of the function is equal to 0
 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.740
derivative of the function is equal to 0
ok it turns out of course that if you

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750
ok it turns out of course that if you
 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.200
ok it turns out of course that if you
have a convex function and it's

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210
have a convex function and it's
 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.040
have a convex function and it's
derivative is equal to 0 then you're

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050
derivative is equal to 0 then you're
 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.000
derivative is equal to 0 then you're
likely to be attaining a minimum if you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
likely to be attaining a minimum if you
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.440
likely to be attaining a minimum if you
have a concave function and it's

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450
have a concave function and it's
 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.260
have a concave function and it's
derivative is equal to 0 or it's flat

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270
derivative is equal to 0 or it's flat
 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.930
derivative is equal to 0 or it's flat
the slope is flat then you're at a

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940
the slope is flat then you're at a
 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.230
the slope is flat then you're at a
maximum so concave functions attain

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240
maximum so concave functions attain
 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.360
maximum so concave functions attain
their maximums at points where the slope

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370
their maximums at points where the slope
 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.539
their maximums at points where the slope
is equal to 0 and convex functions

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549
is equal to 0 and convex functions
 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.710
is equal to 0 and convex functions
attain their minimums at the point where

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720
attain their minimums at the point where
 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.570
attain their minimums at the point where
their slope is equal to 0 yes you had

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580
their slope is equal to 0 yes you had
 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.260
their slope is equal to 0 yes you had
raised you

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270
 
 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.629
 
yeah this is this is for a single point

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639
yeah this is this is for a single point
 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.990
yeah this is this is for a single point
but within the interval that I'm showing

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000
but within the interval that I'm showing
 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.790
but within the interval that I'm showing
it could be that this is a complex

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
it could be that this is a complex
 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.499
it could be that this is a complex
nonlinear function that goes like that

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509
nonlinear function that goes like that
 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.860
nonlinear function that goes like that
it'll this this function will still

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870
it'll this this function will still
 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.999
it'll this this function will still
attain a local maximum here it may not

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009
attain a local maximum here it may not
 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.100
attain a local maximum here it may not
be a global maximum there may be some

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110
be a global maximum there may be some
 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.050
be a global maximum there may be some
other point where there's a global

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
other point where there's a global
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.629
other point where there's a global
maximum but nevertheless this will be a

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639
maximum but nevertheless this will be a
 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.059
maximum but nevertheless this will be a
local maximum and generally you'll care

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069
local maximum and generally you'll care
 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.010
local maximum and generally you'll care
both about local and global maximum you

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020
both about local and global maximum you
 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.790
both about local and global maximum you
know so in with the example of the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800
know so in with the example of the
 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.850
know so in with the example of the
carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860
carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide
 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.070
carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide
concentrations i talked about you are

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080
concentrations i talked about you are
 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.860
concentrations i talked about you are
probably going to care about the shape

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870
probably going to care about the shape
 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.689
probably going to care about the shape
of that function near its current value

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699
of that function near its current value
 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.920
of that function near its current value
and not not far away from it even though

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930
and not not far away from it even though
 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.520
and not not far away from it even though
some related phenomenon that you care

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
some related phenomenon that you care
 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.029
some related phenomenon that you care
about might retain a global maximum far

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039
about might retain a global maximum far
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.760
about might retain a global maximum far
away from the current value of

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770
away from the current value of
 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.620
away from the current value of
greenhouse gas emissions if this were a

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
greenhouse gas emissions if this were a
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.709
greenhouse gas emissions if this were a
plateau what you would see would is that

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719
plateau what you would see would is that
 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.580
plateau what you would see would is that
the the tangent line would be would have

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590
the the tangent line would be would have
 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.120
the the tangent line would be would have
a slope of zero at many points it can

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130
a slope of zero at many points it can
 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.570
a slope of zero at many points it can
certainly be the case that FX attains a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580
certainly be the case that FX attains a
 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.899
certainly be the case that FX attains a
maximum at many points s but they'll

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909
maximum at many points s but they'll
 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:04.450
maximum at many points s but they'll
nevertheless be local Maxima okay so it

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460
nevertheless be local Maxima okay so it
 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.399
nevertheless be local Maxima okay so it
doesn't have to be a single single point

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409
 
 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.360
 
okay generally okay

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370
 
 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:26.620
 
okay now so a key piece of information

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630
okay now so a key piece of information
 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.260
okay now so a key piece of information
you have is that to find the maximum or

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270
you have is that to find the maximum or
 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.360
you have is that to find the maximum or
minimum of a nonlinear function you you

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370
minimum of a nonlinear function you you
 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.900

know that feature of that point is that

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910
know that feature of that point is that
 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.730

the derivative is going to be equal to
 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.370
the derivative is going to be equal to
zero so if you're faced with a higher

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380
zero so if you're faced with a higher
 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.330

inflection such as this this is neither
 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.150
inflection such as this this is neither
a maximum nor a minimum but what you do

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.160
a maximum nor a minimum but what you do
 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.000
a maximum nor a minimum but what you do
know is that if you find the derivative

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.010

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.260
 
 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.940
 
you would what you could do here is you

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:39.950
you would what you could do here is you
 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:47.260
you would what you could do here is you
could plot once you find the derivative

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:47.270
could plot once you find the derivative
 

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.240
could plot once you find the derivative
of this did I tell you what that was

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.250
of this did I tell you what that was
 

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:58.300
of this did I tell you what that was
yeah so that is 15 X to the 4 that's the

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.310
yeah so that is 15 X to the 4 that's the
 

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.820
yeah so that is 15 X to the 4 that's the
derivative 15 X to the 4 minus 60 x

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:00.830
derivative 15 X to the 4 minus 60 x
 

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:08.380
derivative 15 X to the 4 minus 60 x
squared okay I could look at this and if

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.390
squared okay I could look at this and if
 

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.640
squared okay I could look at this and if
by graphing this I see that the function

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:12.650
by graphing this I see that the function
 

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.300
by graphing this I see that the function
is really interesting between the points

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.310
is really interesting between the points
 

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.830
is really interesting between the points
minus 2 and well it's if I if I

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:20.840
minus 2 and well it's if I if I
 

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.140
minus 2 and well it's if I if I
determine the behavior before minus 2

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.150
determine the behavior before minus 2
 

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.350
determine the behavior before minus 2
between minus 2 and 0 from 0 to 2 and

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360
between minus 2 and 0 from 0 to 2 and
 

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.990
between minus 2 and 0 from 0 to 2 and
then above 2 i'll have a good sense of

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000
then above 2 i'll have a good sense of
 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.010
then above 2 i'll have a good sense of
how the function looks and that's what I

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:36.020
how the function looks and that's what I
 

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.140
how the function looks and that's what I
try to do here so I say the sum what I

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.150
try to do here so I say the sum what I
 

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.210
try to do here so I say the sum what I
want to know is what are the values of

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:43.220
want to know is what are the values of
 

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.500
want to know is what are the values of
the derivative of this function be 4

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:47.510
the derivative of this function be 4
 

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.620
the derivative of this function be 4
minus 2 at minus-2 between minus 2 and 0

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:50.630
minus 2 at minus-2 between minus 2 and 0
 

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.450
minus 2 at minus-2 between minus 2 and 0
between 0 and 2 and above two so I could

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:55.460
between 0 and 2 and above two so I could
 

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.730
between 0 and 2 and above two so I could
choose these numbers minus 3 minus 1 1

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:57.740
choose these numbers minus 3 minus 1 1
 

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.490
choose these numbers minus 3 minus 1 1
and 3 plug those numbers into the

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:03.500
and 3 plug those numbers into the
 

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.350
and 3 plug those numbers into the
derivative so it tells me what the slope

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360
derivative so it tells me what the slope
 

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.080
derivative so it tells me what the slope
of the original function will be at

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.090
of the original function will be at
 

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.930
of the original function will be at
those points so this is the derivative

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:13.940
those points so this is the derivative
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.340
those points so this is the derivative
and I evaluate this derivative at these

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.350
and I evaluate this derivative at these
 

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.500
and I evaluate this derivative at these
four different values of x if x is equal

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:23.510
four different values of x if x is equal
 

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.540
four different values of x if x is equal
to minus 3i plug minus 3 into that

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:25.550
to minus 3i plug minus 3 into that
 

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.380
to minus 3i plug minus 3 into that
equation i get 675 if x is equal to

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.390
equation i get 675 if x is equal to
 

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.440
equation i get 675 if x is equal to
minus 1 i plug it into that i get minus

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.450
minus 1 i plug it into that i get minus
 

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:37.990
minus 1 i plug it into that i get minus
45 if i plug 1 into that i get minus 45

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000
45 if i plug 1 into that i get minus 45
 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.190
45 if i plug 1 into that i get minus 45
and then 675 again so that tells me that

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200
and then 675 again so that tells me that
 

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.480
and then 675 again so that tells me that
when x is minus 3

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.490
when x is minus 3
 

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.320
when x is minus 3
the function is steeply upward sloping

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:49.330
the function is steeply upward sloping
 

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.000
the function is steeply upward sloping
is that the case yes it's going up

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.010
is that the case yes it's going up
 

00:10:54.010 --> 00:11:01.390
is that the case yes it's going up
steeply right and when X is 3 it's all

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:01.400
steeply right and when X is 3 it's all
 

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.210
steeply right and when X is 3 it's all
so steeply upward sloping and that's

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.220
so steeply upward sloping and that's
 

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:10.050
so steeply upward sloping and that's
what's happening here and in between it

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.060
what's happening here and in between it
 

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.110
what's happening here and in between it
changes around for example at minus 1

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120
changes around for example at minus 1
 

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.080
changes around for example at minus 1
its downward sloping and at one it's

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.090
its downward sloping and at one it's
 

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.570
its downward sloping and at one it's
also downward sloping and I know that

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:19.580
also downward sloping and I know that
 

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:28.150
also downward sloping and I know that
it's zero it's flat okay and I'm just

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160
it's zero it's flat okay and I'm just
 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.470
it's zero it's flat okay and I'm just
doing that here okay so here I'm

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480
doing that here okay so here I'm
 

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:42.840
doing that here okay so here I'm
plugging in the values minus 2 and 2

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:42.850
 
 

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.230
 
since I know that those are in addition

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240
since I know that those are in addition
 

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.200
since I know that those are in addition

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.380
to this point zero which is a point of
inflection these are the other points

inflection these are the other points
 

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.480
inflection these are the other points
where the derivative is equal to zero by

can cavity changes to convexity okay
 

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.730
can cavity changes to convexity okay

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:22.730
first derivative you would solve for the
 

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.770
first derivative you would solve for the
zeros of this function okay you want to

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:26.780
zeros of this function okay you want to
 

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.160
zeros of this function okay you want to
know because of the graph it's easy for

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.170
know because of the graph it's easy for
 

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.190
know because of the graph it's easy for
me to tell you that minus 20 and plus

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200
me to tell you that minus 20 and plus
 

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.710
me to tell you that minus 20 and plus
two other points where the slope is zero

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720
two other points where the slope is zero
 

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.170
two other points where the slope is zero
but if you didn't have the graph you

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:38.180
but if you didn't have the graph you
 

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.650
but if you didn't have the graph you
would take this equation set it equal to

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:41.660
would take this equation set it equal to
 

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.220
would take this equation set it equal to
zero and solve for the values of x where

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.230
zero and solve for the values of x where
 

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.550
zero and solve for the values of x where
that was true now this happens to be a

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:47.560
that was true now this happens to be a
 

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.050
that was true now this happens to be a
polynomial of degree 4 so it take you a

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:53.060
polynomial of degree 4 so it take you a
 

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.070
polynomial of degree 4 so it take you a
long time to solve this by hand I would

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:57.080
long time to solve this by hand I would
 

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.009
long time to solve this by hand I would
not ask you

00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019
not ask you
 

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:02.359
not ask you
this in an exam but if you plug it into

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:02.369
this in an exam but if you plug it into
 

00:13:02.369 --> 00:13:04.819
this in an exam but if you plug it into
matlab it'll turn it out in two minutes

00:13:04.819 --> 00:13:04.829

two seconds it'll give you the values of
 

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:17.090
two seconds it'll give you the values of
x where this is equal to zero so i would

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100
x where this is equal to zero so i would
 

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.249
x where this is equal to zero so i would
know that and actually what will do is

00:13:19.249 --> 00:13:19.259
know that and actually what will do is
 

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:24.439
know that and actually what will do is
it'll give me these three values okay

00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:24.449
it'll give me these three values okay
 

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:36.079
it'll give me these three values okay
yes all I'm saying is that I would take

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:36.089
yes all I'm saying is that I would take
 

00:13:36.089 --> 00:13:40.479
yes all I'm saying is that I would take
you know I I i computed this derivative

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:40.489
you know I I i computed this derivative
 

00:13:40.489 --> 00:13:43.729
you know I I i computed this derivative
that's the slope that's a function that

00:13:43.729 --> 00:13:43.739
that's the slope that's a function that
 

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:49.129
that's the slope that's a function that

X here this expression will give me the

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:06.029
X here this expression will give me the
 

00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:08.840
X here this expression will give me the
slope of the original function for that

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:08.850
slope of the original function for that
 

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.639
slope of the original function for that
value of x now I want to know the values

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:13.649
value of x now I want to know the values
 

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:18.590
value of x now I want to know the values
of x for which this expression is equal

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600
of x for which this expression is equal
 

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.970
of x for which this expression is equal
to 0 okay well how do I get that I

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980
to 0 okay well how do I get that I
 

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:29.410
to 0 okay well how do I get that I
simply set that expression equal to 0

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.420
simply set that expression equal to 0
 

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.929
simply set that expression equal to 0
and I solve oh actually I chosen an easy

00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:35.939
and I solve oh actually I chosen an easy
 

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:38.329
and I solve oh actually I chosen an easy
example so you don't need matlab to do

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339
example so you don't need matlab to do
 

00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:41.359
example so you don't need matlab to do
this right you can you can tell because

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:41.369
this right you can you can tell because
 

00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:44.509
this right you can you can tell because
I this is this is the square of that so

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519
I this is this is the square of that so
 

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:47.150
I this is this is the square of that so
that's a nice that's a useful feature so

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160
that's a nice that's a useful feature so
 

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.829
that's a nice that's a useful feature so
if I want to set this equal to 0 and

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839
if I want to set this equal to 0 and
 

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:55.970
if I want to set this equal to 0 and
then I solve for x okay so that's going

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980
then I solve for x okay so that's going
 

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:02.979
then I solve for x okay so that's going
to be 15 x 4 is equal to 60 x squared

00:15:02.979 --> 00:15:02.989
to be 15 x 4 is equal to 60 x squared
 

00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:08.259
to be 15 x 4 is equal to 60 x squared
okay i divide both sides by x squared

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:08.269
okay i divide both sides by x squared
 

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:11.960
okay i divide both sides by x squared
okay but when you divide

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:11.970
okay but when you divide
 

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.610
okay but when you divide
right and this is something useful to

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:13.620
right and this is something useful to
 

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.749
right and this is something useful to
keep in mind when you solve equations I

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759
keep in mind when you solve equations I
 

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:20.449
keep in mind when you solve equations I
can eliminate x squared I mean I can

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459
can eliminate x squared I mean I can
 

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:22.759
can eliminate x squared I mean I can
eliminate X to the fourth from here by

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:22.769
eliminate X to the fourth from here by
 

00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:26.059
eliminate X to the fourth from here by
dividing both sides by x squared but I

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:26.069
dividing both sides by x squared but I
 

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:28.999
dividing both sides by x squared but I
have to keep in mind that there is one

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:29.009
have to keep in mind that there is one
 

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:33.590
have to keep in mind that there is one
case where which I when I'm not allowed

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600
case where which I when I'm not allowed
 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.369
case where which I when I'm not allowed
to divide by x squared and what case is

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:37.379
to divide by x squared and what case is
 

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:42.019
to divide by x squared and what case is
that that x is equal to 0 because our

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:42.029
that that x is equal to 0 because our
 

00:15:42.029 --> 00:15:46.340
that that x is equal to 0 because our
mathematics is unable to divide by zero

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.350
mathematics is unable to divide by zero
 

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:53.329
mathematics is unable to divide by zero
okay so so I keep in mind that I have to

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339
okay so so I keep in mind that I have to
 

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:56.030
okay so so I keep in mind that I have to
examine the case that x is equal to 0

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040
examine the case that x is equal to 0
 

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.290
examine the case that x is equal to 0
and then i divide both sides by x

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300
and then i divide both sides by x
 

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.730
and then i divide both sides by x
squared so I get and then i divide both

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740
squared so I get and then i divide both
 

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:13.160
squared so I get and then i divide both
sides by 15 hmm ok so I this reduces to

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.170
sides by 15 hmm ok so I this reduces to
 

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.600
sides by 15 hmm ok so I this reduces to
a simple equation so then the roots of

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:16.610
a simple equation so then the roots of
 

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.929
a simple equation so then the roots of
this are just minus two plus two and

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:20.939
this are just minus two plus two and
 

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.879
this are just minus two plus two and
then I have to look at the case where x

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:22.889
then I have to look at the case where x
 

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:27.350
then I have to look at the case where x
is equal to 0 okay so i must have chosen

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360
is equal to 0 okay so i must have chosen
 

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.759
is equal to 0 okay so i must have chosen
that that polynomial so that this could

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:31.769
that that polynomial so that this could
 

00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:34.280
that that polynomial so that this could
be done by hand but generally you know

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:34.290
be done by hand but generally you know
 

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.009
be done by hand but generally you know
but this is this is a pathological

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:36.019
but this is this is a pathological
 

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:44.439
but this is this is a pathological
example most examples won't be like this

00:16:44.439 --> 00:16:44.449
 
 

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:48.730
 
okay

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740
 
 

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:56.740
 
ok so this you've already seen if we

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:56.750
ok so this you've already seen if we
 

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:02.290
ok so this you've already seen if we
have a concave function and it's a

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:02.300
have a concave function and it's a
 

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.110
have a concave function and it's a
smooth function that attains a maximum

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120
smooth function that attains a maximum
 

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.980
smooth function that attains a maximum
at X star then of course it's derivative

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:08.990
at X star then of course it's derivative
 

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.150
at X star then of course it's derivative
is equal to zero and its second

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160
is equal to zero and its second
 

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.980
is equal to zero and its second
derivative at that point is less than or

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:17.990
derivative at that point is less than or
 

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.970
derivative at that point is less than or
equal to 0 if it's strictly concave then

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:21.980
equal to 0 if it's strictly concave then
 

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.710
equal to 0 if it's strictly concave then
it'll be strictly negative this was if

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720
it'll be strictly negative this was if
 

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.620
it'll be strictly negative this was if
you go back to a slide an earlier slide

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:31.630
you go back to a slide an earlier slide
 

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.870
you go back to a slide an earlier slide
recall that having the second derivative

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880
recall that having the second derivative
 

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.320
recall that having the second derivative
be negative was the definition of a

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:38.330
be negative was the definition of a
 

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:43.000
be negative was the definition of a
concave function ok so this is a concave

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.010
concave function ok so this is a concave
 

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.440
concave function ok so this is a concave
function if it's concave and it's slope

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.450
function if it's concave and it's slope
 

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:54.250
function if it's concave and it's slope
is flat then it's attaining a maximum if

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.260
is flat then it's attaining a maximum if
 

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.770
is flat then it's attaining a maximum if
its convex and its slope is flat it's

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:56.780
its convex and its slope is flat it's
 

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:07.600
its convex and its slope is flat it's
attaining a minimum ok ok ok how is

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:07.610
attaining a minimum ok ok ok how is
 

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.080
attaining a minimum ok ok ok how is
everyone doing ok I actually have quite

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.090
everyone doing ok I actually have quite
 

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.470
everyone doing ok I actually have quite
a lot of examples so we may not get to

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480
a lot of examples so we may not get to
 

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.070
a lot of examples so we may not get to
the multivariate calculus today but

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080
the multivariate calculus today but
 

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.549
the multivariate calculus today but
that's not unexpected we will simply

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559
that's not unexpected we will simply
 

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:26.580
that's not unexpected we will simply
catch up on it in the next session and

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:26.590
catch up on it in the next session and
 

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.710
catch up on it in the next session and
we'll probably be do a little less of

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720
we'll probably be do a little less of
 

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.840
we'll probably be do a little less of
the integration and so on remember we

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:34.850
the integration and so on remember we
 

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.470
the integration and so on remember we
got to spend most of the time on the

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480
got to spend most of the time on the
 

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.080
got to spend most of the time on the
simpler twenty percent of the topics
