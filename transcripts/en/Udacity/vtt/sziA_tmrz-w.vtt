00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is shortest first would work.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If there is a path, it'll eventually find it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It will waste some time repeating itself, and may not be the most efficient.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But we'll get there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Don't re-explore seems more efficient, because it stops off some of these paths.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't reverse isn't quite good enough,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because if we said, okay, we're going to eliminate the steps that go from A to B

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then back to A, but that doesn't stop us from going from A to B to C to D and then back to A

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and having that longer loop and having that be infinite.
