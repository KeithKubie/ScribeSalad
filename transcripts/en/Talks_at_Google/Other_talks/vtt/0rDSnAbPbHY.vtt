00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.641
MALE SPEAKER: So, just by way
of introduction, I want to say,

00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:05.010
I learned to play
Go many years ago.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.590
When I learned to play Go,
I had received a Go board

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.780
as a Christmas present
from my parents.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.812
I was I think 12 or 13.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.270
There were no Go
players around me.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.050
I taught myself to
play by reading books.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.894
I taught my friends to play.

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:18.560
It was many years
before I played anyone

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.710
who I hadn't taught myself.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.430
Later, when I graduated from
college, I came to the Bay Area

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.770
to play, at San Francisco Go
Club, among other places--

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.830
a fine representative of
that institution here--

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
and was always grateful.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.450
In those days, there
was an AGA, I believe,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.330
but there was no US Go Congress.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.830
There were no
professionals that I'm

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.913
aware of living in the
United States at that time,

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.510
or anywhere in the West.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.479
And so, since then, we
have US Go Congress,

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.520
which happens every year.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.290
This year, it's in Boston,
sponsored by the AGA,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.400
which is, as I said, Mr. Okun's
wonderful organization that he

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.230
leads.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.040
They have a YouTube
channel as well,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.346
and you can see streamed
Go commentary there.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.180
The American Go Foundation
is the charitable arm

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.110
of that organization.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.630
You can donate--
they're a 501c3.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.234
Google will match that donation.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.150
If you search the United
States Go Foundation,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.890
you can find that I sponsor
the annual Google Giving

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.120
campaign for them.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.760
So that's a great organization.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.805
They teach kids in school
and spread the word about Go

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.060
in general.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.464
And, as I said, the US Go
Congress is held every year.

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.380
It used to be that a
visiting professional was

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.170
a rare and wonderful event.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.470
But every year now
they have this event,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310
there's 30 or more-- I don't
know how many we have confirmed

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.560
this year-- but 30 or more
professionals come from all

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.210
over Asia and now, the West.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
So we now have actual Western--
the AGA has professionals

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.510
that they certify.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.712
So having said
that, I would like

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:52.920
to welcome today's guest,
who's a professional player

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.190
from Korea.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.200
Her name is Hajin Lee.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.444
She is the general secretary
of the International Go

00:02:00.444 --> 00:02:01.860
Foundation, which
is-- Foundation?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.525
Federation?

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:03.400
AUDIENCE: Federation.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.983
MALE SPEAKER:
Federation-- thank you--

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:08.530
which is an outreach group
sponsored by the Korean Baduk

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.050
Association.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.530
And she is a professional
3 dan herself.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.902
So let me switch
over to her slides,

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:23.314
and I'll hand it off to Hajin.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:27.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.218 --> 00:02:31.186
I can drive the
slides if you want.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:32.170
HAJIN LEE: OK.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.230
Ah, thank you.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.410
Hello, everyone.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.500
Nice to meet you.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.350
Thank you for taking your
time to come here for my talk.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.140
I'm very excited to talk
about professional Go players

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.950
and AlphaGo match today.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.420
I hope you will
find it interesting.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.720
So, to begin with, let me give
you a bit of my background.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.840
As Lee mentioned, I'm a
professional Go player

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000
from Korea.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.310
In Korea, we call
Go, "baduk"-- so it's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.670
Korea Baduk Association.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.190
We call it KBA.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.530
So I'm a professional
player with KBA,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.010
and I became a
pro when I was 16.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.070
The picture over here
on the right side

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.430
is me playing on the
best-of-three final match

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.880
for the major title for
female players in Korea.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.470
I didn't manage to
win this final match,

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160
but I was one of
the five Korean team

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.710
players for the international
team competitions,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.240
and I won one minor title.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.470
And I also won a bronze medal
in the first World Mind Sports

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.680
Games in Beijing.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.330
And five years into my career
as a professional player,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.770
I went to university.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.270
Can I go?

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.760
Yeah.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.260
Yes.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.020
Sorry.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.360
So my decision to
go to university

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.100
surprised many people around
me, especially my parents,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.380
because at the time
of my application,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.700
I was one of the top
players in Korea.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.510
And going to university
meant a huge distraction

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.340
from pursuing the very top
place in the tournament world.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.310
But in my mind, I always
wanted to see the world

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.350
outside Go tournaments.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.870
And then I was
afraid that if I wait

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.250
for, like, one year, and
two years, and three years,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.940
I might lose the courage
to start anything new.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.090
So, at the time, I
was 20 years old,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.240
and then I decided
to go to university.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.080
I studied business
administration and specialized

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.210
in finance.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.090
At first, I was afraid that I
would have a hard time catching

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.380
up with other students,
because in my whole life,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.470
I only studied Go.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.680
But it turned out, studying
in university was really fun.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.180
I loved going to classes
and writing papers and doing

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.820
team projects.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.608
And then I had a great time, and
I graduated as a valedictorian.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.400
And in my last semester, I was
planning to go to grad school

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.430
to get a higher degree in
finance, because I enjoyed

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.650
being a student so much.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.120
But at the time, coincidentally,
International Go Federation

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.210
was looking for a candidate
for the next general secretary.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.330
They asked KBA, Korean
Baduk Association,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.620
to recommend a candidate,
and then their requirement

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.050
was that they wanted someone,
a professional Go player,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.350
with English ability and some
international experience.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.990
And there I was, a
professional Go player,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.350
graduating from
a university that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.720
is teaching 100% in English.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.540
And then, also as
a student, I was

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.530
working part-time with the KBA
as international coordinator.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.540
So KBA interviewed a few
professional players,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.480
and they decided to
recommend me as a candidate.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.400
At first, the IGF board
was a little concerned,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.930
because I was only half
the age of my predecessor.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.780
And then, you know, I was just
graduating from university.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.350
But they decided to honor
the KBA's recommendation.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.210
And that's how I started at
the International Go federation

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.100
as secretary general, and
I'm still working there.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.320
Being the youngest
ever secretary general

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.660
had many challenges.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.080
But on the bright side,
because I was so young,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.060
many of the board
members were more

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.240
willing to help me and guide me.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.860
So I had a great mentor.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.410
And then, I learned so
much by working at the IGF.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.080
Some of them were good
things, but some of them

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.650
were, like, more of
the frustrating side

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.240
of international organizations.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.310
But I'm very grateful
for the opportunity,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.950
and then, I was just
very lucky, I think.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.350
And while working at the
IGF, I did two things.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.030
The first one was that I
started a YouTube channel.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.940
And, at first, it was
just an experiment,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.630
because there weren't
many strong players who

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.810
were doing the live
commentary, meaning,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.790
like, you talk while you play.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.860
And that format could be very
risky for professional players,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.650
because basically, you're
giving away your secrets.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.576
For professional
players, you need to win,

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:42.450
and then you don't want
to share what you are

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.200
thinking while you're playing.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.390
But when I went to university,
I stopped playing in tournaments

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.610
actively, and I wanted to see
whether this kind of format

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.000
would be helpful
for amateur players.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.420
And then I was going to
just post a few videos,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.170
but it turned out, it was, a lot
more popular than I expected.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.720
And then, as I was receiving
these messages, how,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.830
like, my viewers improved a
lot by watching my videos,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.240
I couldn't stop.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.560
So it's been about 1 1/2
years, and I'm still doing it.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.180
Today, I have over 150 videos,
7,000 subscribers, and close

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.990
to 10 million minutes watched.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.320
Another thing is that I
published this book over here.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.940
Some of you have seen it.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.980
So, this book,
"Outside the Board,"

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.200
is a collection
of my blog entries

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.510
that I wrote from 2008 to 2013.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.460
It's about that time
when I was still

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.800
an active professional player.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.190
And then I stopped
writing my blog when

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.170
I started working at the IGF.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.940
So my blog entries covered
my flashback stories

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.310
of my childhood--
how I studied Go,

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.690
how I became a professional
player, my life

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.930
as a professional player, and
my matches, my overseas trips,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.600
my classes, the books I read.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.080
It's very wide.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.590
And then, I just selected
some of the interesting ones

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.060
for the book.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.880
So that's about my
background, and then, I

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.500
would like to start with
professional Go players.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.470
So, I am a
professional Go player.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.630
And then, you're probably
familiar with Fan Hui and Lee

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.130
Sedol.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.560
They are all
professional players.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.920
So professional
players are the ones

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.700
who dedicated their life
to develop their Go skills.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.820
I believe that
AlphaGo was the result

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.480
of the brilliant
developers of DeepMind,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.010
but AlphaGo was also
possible because there

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.160
were professional players
who dedicated their lives.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.440
Imagine-- if Monte
Carlo tree search

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.890
was strong enough to compete
with the top human players,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.800
then I think they would have
thought of just improving

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.170
a little bit, instead of, like,
coming with this breakthrough

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.710
method to be even stronger.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.860
So I believe the
DeepMind was inspired

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.000
by professional
players, and then they

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.895
knew that they needed
something different approach.

00:10:26.938 --> 00:10:29.180
So, you know, you
probably heard why

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.810
Go is such a difficult
game for a computer

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:37.890
to learn-- the wide variations,
and so many branching factors.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.690
And for the same reason, Go
is a difficult game for people

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.480
to be stronger as well.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.210
And before I tell you more
about professional players,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.260
I would like to share
this cartoon from xkcd.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.010
This is about estimating
time for a project.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.400
The first girl says,
ah, I have a hard time,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.090
like, estimating the
time for a project.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.120
And the second girl says,
I have a simple trick.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.450
You first estimate some
time, and then you double it,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.950
and then you double it for
the second time, and then

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.140
a third time.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.500
And then, realize
that you are doing

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.470
this imaginary
calculation instead

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.450
of working on the project.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.250
So this one seems like
it's just a goofy cartoon,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.750
but it actually makes
a lot of sense to me

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.630
as a professional player.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:30.160
Because this is the how I
feel about the necessary time

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
to become a professional player.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.730
So imagine this--
there's this one student,

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.790
and she wants to be a
professional player.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.410
And then I would
tell her, imagine

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.730
you are really ready to commit.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.630
And then you are going to
study eight hours a day,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.560
five days a week,
50 weeks a year.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.820
After one year, you would
have put in about 2,000 hours,

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.830
right?

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.440
So starting from there, we are
going to double it-- 4,000--

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.570
and double it for the
second time-- 8,000--

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.000
and for the third time--
it's 16,000 hours.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.240
So maybe after
about 16,000 hours,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.380
you would have gotten close
to professional level.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.690
But we will add some more
time, because getting

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.760
to the professional
level doesn't mean

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.300
you are a professional player.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.980
Oh, and you should remember
that you might not ever

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.006
become a professional player,
because it's very competitive.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.080
Wait.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.980
So this is the time I put in to
become a professional player--

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.220
19,000 hours.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.080
So, I started playing
when I was five years old.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.290
And then, it was
very natural for me,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.560
because both of my
parents liked to play.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.160
So, at first, I learned
from my parents,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.410
and then we would study
about one hour a day,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.840
about four to five days a weak,
but with many missing days.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.380
When I was six years old,
I won this small tournament

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.690
for preschoolers,
and then my teacher

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.170
thought I had some talent in Go.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.930
So after that, we
increased the study hours,

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.520
and then we started
studying two hours a day.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.230
And then I became
nine years old.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.030
And at the time, my
parents and my teacher

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.180
thought I had a
really strong chance

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.700
of becoming a
professional player,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.240
so I moved to a
Go master's place.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.570
My Go master was
about close to Seoul,

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.410
and my hometown is not in
Seoul, so it was about two hours

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.280
distance by car.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.030
And then, at the
time, it was very

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.200
important to get the proper
training with the Go master,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.980
if you wanted to become
a professional player.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.950
So I lived with the Go master,
his wife, and their children,

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.540
and a few other fellow
kids, just like me.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.850
So when I joined the
Go master's place,

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.520
we would study pretty much
all day, other than the time

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.390
we go to the public school.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.340
So I would study something
like from 2pm to 10pm

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.390
with a one-hour dinner break.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.610
So that was about
seven hours a day.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.960
And then when I
became 12 years old,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.680
I joined this official
training program of the KBA.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.490
It's widely known as "insei"--
that's a Japanese term.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.480
In Korean, we call
it "yunguseng,"

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.920
or we can just say, Go prodigy.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.720
So when I became yunguseng,
it was, like, really serious.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.550
And then, I had a
lot fewer holidays.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.730
And I would study
not until, like,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.220
10 pm, but more like
11 or midnight, so that

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.840
became eight hours.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.040
And also, if you
are a student, you

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.460
have summer vacations
and winter vacations.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.810
In those days, you
don't go to school.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.800
Then we would go to
the Go school at 9 am

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.550
and then study until 9pm.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.630
So that's how I started.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.140
And then when I added
up all the hours,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.480
it came out 19,000 hours.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.320
I became pro at 16.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.560
So let me read you a small
part of my book over here.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.290
"It was an endless repetition
of many types of training.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.680
I played against peers,
received comments on those games

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.030
from the teacher, studied
professional players' games,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.450
solved exercise programs,
and played again.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.350
Moreover, I had to
memorize well-known games

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.350
of prestigious players'
games as homework.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.090
While I was suffering the
tediously long study schedule,

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.250
all I could do to
entertain myself

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.470
was to chat with Yoo-Jin
when the teacher was absent

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.630
or to go out for ice cream
during short breaks."

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.950
This training is when
I was nine years old.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:51.090
So it was very serious.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.550
And then, you know,
it was serious,

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.240
not only because getting to the
professional level is so hard,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.700
but also, the
competition is so tough.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.360
If I told you that this was the
chance that you would succeed

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.032
at something, would you try?

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:14.780
So this number seems very
low, but it's very realistic.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.980
The Korean Baduk
Association estimates

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.680
that there are about 8 million
Go players in the country,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.770
and about 30% of
them are under 18.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:30.140
So we can assume that there
are over 2 million youth

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.460
players in Korea.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.730
And KBA selects 15 new
professional players each year.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.980
And then, it's not
an absolute number--

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.020
it changes each year to reflect
the number of Go players,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.050
but they never increase widely.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.510
When I became pro in 2004,
they were selecting nine pros

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.750
a year.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.690
So, in some years,
they select a few more,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.290
but usually, it's
about that level.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.870
And then, it's not like when you
get to the professional level,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.810
you will become a pro,
but more like they

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.800
would organize the Pro
Qualification Tournament.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.089
And then upfront,
they will say, we

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.109
are going to select two pros.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.329
And then, it's open to
anyone who wants to compete.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.859
So, like, 100 players would
enter the qualification,

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.599
and then the top
two players would

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.670
become professional players.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.349
So that's why, even if you
get to the professional level,

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.740
you might not become a
professional player, ever.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.810
Because some players
can get really nervous,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.290
because it's such an
important tournament.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.470
And then, if you don't
win in those tournaments,

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.200
then you have to compete again
the next time, the next time.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.770
And then, as time passes,
you get a little older,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.450
and then there are more
younger and talented players.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.950
And the pressure is
just so enormous.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.490
So that's why it's
very difficult.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.130
And then, someone
did this study--

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.890
this study took the
recent-- about 50--

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:07.610
professional players in Korea,
and then saw when they started.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.600
The average-- they started
at 5.3 years old, and then

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.300
they became pro at 17.6.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.790
And then, studying
over eight hours a day

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:23.370
is usual practice in any of
the professional Go schools.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.730
So you can imagine that this
is a very long and hard journey

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.000
to become a professional player.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.610
Let me read you another
part of my book.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.490
" 'I resign.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.020
Congratulations.' She offered
her hand over the board

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.270
and shook mine lightly.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.520
I couldn't see her
eyes nor say anything.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.520
I fixed my eyes on the
board and remained silent.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.850
Soon enough, she stood
up and left the room.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.340
My heart was beating
so fast and loud

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.160
that it felt as if it
would explode any moment.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.610
I closed my eyes.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.690
I could not think of anything
else but repeating, 'I made it.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.150
I am a pro now.' "

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.680
So, the day you become a
pro is like a birthday,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.400
because you will live a
totally different life.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.180
Once you become a professional
player, first of all,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.020
you get out of that
pressure, that huge pressure,

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.500
that you have to pass the
Pro Qualification Tournament.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.160
So it's a very emotional day.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.760
And then you just remember
the day, I think, forever.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.910
I still remember this scene
very vividly in my mind.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.160
I stayed in the
room for a while,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.860
and then I walked
out of the room.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.690
And then my parents were
waiting, which was surprising.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.640
I didn't know they were coming.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.520
And then, with my parents
there, was this journalist

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.120
from "Baduk" magazine.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.680
It's a monthly
magazine of the KBA.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.120
"Baduk" magazine has
about 60 years of history,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:04.610
and then they interview each and
every new professional player.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.360
So the picture over here-- it
was clearly taken on the day

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.660
that I became pro.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.890
And then, when I see this
magazine-- when I see myself

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.530
in the magazine--
then I really, really

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.750
realize that I made the cut.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.140
So this was the
magazine, and then that's

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.000
how I became a
professional player.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.310
So you did this long journey.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.500
What does that mean, to
be a professional player?

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.410
I understand that
in English, usually,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.190
"professional" means that
your living income is

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.760
coming from that work.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.820
So, if you are
making life from Go,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.340
then you're a
professional player.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.870
Otherwise, you are not a
professional Go player.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.160
But in Korea, it's
a little different.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.020
And actually, not only in
Korea, but also in Japan,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.340
or China, or some
other associations

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.380
with professional systems,
in Go, "professional"

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.660
means that you got this title.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.050
It works more like a
degree than a status.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.590
So it could be an
equivalent of a Ph.D. in Go.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.880
So once you, like, test
this Pro Qualification,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.680
you are a professional player.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.550
It doesn't matter if you are
making money from playing

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.310
or not.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.450
And then, when you become
a professional player,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.520
people stop calling you by name.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.980
Especially in Korea, they
don't call me, like, "Hajin,"

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.770
but they call me, like, an
equivalent of "Master"--

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.280
"Master Lee," like this.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.632
So, like, my friend was
saying that you're a Jedi.

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:39.590
You're called "Master."

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.510
And also, in the
KBA, my IGF office

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.670
is inside the KBA building.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.780
And then when there
are new staff members,

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.050
they are about my age.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.270
And then, like, in
the first week or so,

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.730
they would call me "Hajin."

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.980
And then after a
month or so, they

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.750
learn to call me "Master,"
like all other senior managers,

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:06.400
because they do that to me.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.360
So it's a very honorary title.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.740
And all professional players
are eligible to enter

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.980
the professional
tournaments, and

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.510
these professional tournaments
have big prize money.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.840
You know, this AlphaGo match
had $1 million for the winner,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.970
but that was an extreme case.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.800
There is this one big tournament
going on called Ing Cup,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.740
and that has $400,000
for the first place.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.970
And we have Samsung Cup, and
LG Cup, MLily Cup-- these all

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.700
have $300,000 for the winner.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.910
And these are
international tournaments.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.351
Some domestic
tournaments inside Korea,

00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:49.220
I would have more like
$50,000, or $40,000.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.110
But, in any case, if you are
about, like, top 50 in Korea,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.520
then you can make a
decent living income

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.260
just by playing in tournaments.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.710
But if you are past the prime,
or you are not in top 50,

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.890
then you can also teach Go.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:12.140
Or you could commentate on TV.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.820
We have this Baduk TV that
only broadcasts Go programs.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.390
And you could be working
for Go-related companies.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.300
You could write Go books.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.740
So there are many other
things that you can do.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.430
Another thing about
professional players in Korea

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:34.320
is that you get to have a voice,
especially inside the KBA.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.450
So KBA makes, all day,
policy decisions, and then

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.770
they make directions
for development.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.490
And if you are a Go lover,
and you have many ideas,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:51.110
and you go to the KBA, they
are probably not going to care.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.120
But if you are a
professional player,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.280
and you have some ideas about
their policies or direction,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.200
you can directly knock on the
door of this vice chairman,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.220
the highest person in the KBA.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.070
And then the vice chairman
would invite you to come in,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:11.010
and he will listen, because
you are a professional player.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.980
And other than this, if you are
a professional player in Korea,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.980
you meet someone-- and,
say, they would ask you,

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.850
what do you do?

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.590
And then you say, oh, I'm
a professional player.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.770
And then the first thing
they would say is, wow,

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.280
you must be smart.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.420
So that's what you get in Korea.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:38.080
And also, if you are single, and
this is the elder Go friends--

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.450
they could start, you know, I
have this son in med school.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.610
So, yeah.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.540
That's the professional players.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.820
And, you know, that was the
professional word as we know.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:58.270
But recently, there was this
thing that happened-- AlphaGo.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.680
So AlphaGo is a computer
program with general artificial

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.150
intelligence.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.710
And I'm sure you are
very eager to hear more.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.010
I'm going to skip all the
rest of the technical side,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.980
just to save time,
not because I don't

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.320
understand the algorithms.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.700
So let's talk about the
AlphaGo match in Seoul.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.580
It was in March, just
about 1 1/2 months ago.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.940
My involvement in
the AlphaGo match

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.550
started last year,
about November,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.980
when DeepMind reached out
to me through the British Go

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.470
Association.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:36.380
They had just defeated
Fan Hui, and then they

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.290
wanted to have a
higher level challenge.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.950
And because they didn't have any
experience in organizing a Go

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.640
event with top Asian pros,
they had so many questions.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.740
So I told them about usual
practices, the top players'

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.200
expectations, and when
would be a good time,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.040
where would be a good location.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.470
And then, when they
decided to invite

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.800
Lee Sedol 9-dan for
the five-game match

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.690
and to have it in
Seoul, I volunteered

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.430
to be the messenger.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.180
And I told them, oh,
I can talk to the KBA,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.330
because I am very
close with them.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.300
And at the time,
I thought that it

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.530
would be really fun to
watch this game happening.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.830
At first, I thought
there was no way

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.150
that AlphaGo could
defeat Lee Sedol 9-dan,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.250
but soon enough, I learned
that it was extremely strong.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.810
And then I still doubted that
it could defeat Lee Sedol,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.520
but I thought it
would be very, very

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.880
exciting to watch them play.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.420
And then I thought--
I am from the IGF.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.610
This is the work for
DeepMind and the KBA.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.310
I'm going to
deliver the message,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.950
and then sit back
and enjoy the game.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.610
But that's not what happened,
because my role expanded

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.530
one-by-one, and then I
was doing these roles.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.310
It was not like I
volunteered for all of this,

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.770
but more like I had a
very unique position

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.810
that I could help in
all of these roles.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.200
So I was a professional
player, and then I

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.230
had a personal relation
with Lee Sedol 9-dan.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.910
I was close with KBA
leaders, because they

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.110
come to the IGF meetings.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.603
And I was also close
with KBA staff members.

00:27:27.603 --> 00:27:31.380
In KBA, there are about 50
full-time staff members.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.190
And I was very close with
them, because my office is also

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.530
inside the KBA building.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.910
And for almost three years, I
was working there and having

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.990
lunch with them everyday.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.760
So I was involved
from the beginning-- I

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.700
had a very good understanding.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.660
And also, KBA and DeepMind
had some language barriers.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.740
They didn't speak each
other's language very well.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.040
So I was there and in-between,
and I could connect everyone.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.110
So I ended up doing
so many roles.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.350
And then during
this AlphaGo match,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.600
I don't think I was ever
busier than that time.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.720
My phone was literally
ringing all day.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.270
And the commentator would
call me, and I am on the way,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.200
and then a KBA colleague calls
me, and he needs me right away.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.430
And there is this
DeepMind looking

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.830
for me, like, pinging me.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:30.280
And there's journalists grabbing
me-- I have some questions.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.190
So it was, like, amazingly busy.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.160
So I have some
pictures over here.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.830
This first picture-- this
is from my best friend,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:44.140
and she didn't know
that I was working.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.770
She suddenly sent me this
picture, and said, Hajin,

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.330
I saw you on TV.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.530
So I was like, oh.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.052
And then she said, Dennis
looks like your brother.

00:28:57.052 --> 00:28:58.260
I hope that was a compliment.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.260
So this is the picture.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.660
And then this is from
the playing venue.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.980
One of the roles I took was
Le Sedol 9-dan's translator,

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.090
so I got to talk with Dennis.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.040
And then also when
Eric Schmidt and Sergey

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.580
Brin met with Le Sedol 9-dan,
I was there to translate.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.330
I was very impressed by
how respectful they were.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.200
I thought that was
really true leadership.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:34.460
And then I was emcee of the
pre-match press briefing,

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.340
and press conference,
and the awards ceremony.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.660
It was my first time
to do emcee in front

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.580
of, like, hundreds of cameras.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.230
And generally, I
would get nervous,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.280
just as I'm nervous right now.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.350
But at the time,
I was so busy, I

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.500
didn't have the
mind to be nervous.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.520
So I wouldn't remember
what I did after that.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.080
So these are some pictures.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.630
And then getting into the match.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.450
KBA had two main goals,
and then two minor goals.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.300
The two main goals--
the first one

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:13.180
was to have the match as fair
as possible, and problem-free.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.790
Because one player was not
human for the first time,

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:21.350
we had to make sure about
all the possible problems.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.890
And then we wanted to make sure
that none of the two players

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.070
would have something to
complain after the match.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.610
And luckily, I think we
managed that very well,

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.000
so there were no complaints.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.850
And then, the second goal was
to have as much exposure as

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.930
possible for Go.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.350
And then, two minor
goals-- the first one

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.580
was to build some good
relationship with DeepMind.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.610
We thought that this may not
be the last one we do together.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:51.900
There could be some
other future projects,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.180
so we wanted to work with
them, with a trust base,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.970
and build a really
good relationship.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.920
Another goal was to
return some favors

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.530
to the journalists or
the Go sponsors who've

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.140
been helping the Korean Go
community for a long time.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.950
We didn't get to have this
good position very often.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.460
But during this match,
it was so popular,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.020
and everyone wanted
to enter the site.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.910
And then KBA, for
the first time,

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:24.530
had this higher status-- to
give some favors to people,

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.500
because they all wanted to come.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:34.220
So KBA could exercise some
of its status to let them in.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.760
And I think many of
them were very happy

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.910
that they could be there.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.040
It was a historical event.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.140
And at the end of
the match, I think

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.540
the KBA leaders were very
satisfied with the results.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:53.900
And as a bonus, we had really,
really good outreach impact.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.490
So all together, we had
280 million viewers.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:04.090
Over 35,000 articles published--
and these 35,000 articles

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.890
include all the headline
news you can imagine.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.890
There was CNN, and BBC, "Wall
Street Journal," "New York

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.520
Times," and "The New Yorker."

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.930
And there were over 300
journalists on-site.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:24.830
We had AlphaGo and Lee Sedol
on the top 10 of Twitter trend

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.320
worldwide-- it was amazing.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.920
And then inside Korea,
the AlphaGo news

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.510
was making the front
page almost everyday.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.870
And all together, we had over
2,000 articles published.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.650
And usually, in
Korea, we would say,

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.380
one small article
in the newspaper

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.770
would be worth about
$1,000, if you calculate.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.620
So it was a really huge
success-- more successful

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.970
than we had hoped for.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.770
And this is all the
TV channels in Korea

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.100
that broadcast it live.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:06.100
So KBS, NBC and SBS are the top
three TV channels in Korea--

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.260
they all live broadcasted.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.460
And there were
other TV channels,

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.600
and the viewership was so high.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.240
I asked someone from the
broadcasting industry,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.750
and he told me
that you could say

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.390
that this interest was higher
than soccer World Cup A match.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.320
And, you know, soccer is
very popular in Korea.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.130
So that was just amazing.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.870
It was surreal.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.390
So it was a huge success.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.390
And then this is a picture from
the Korean commentary room.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.680
You can see that there were
so many people over there.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.320
So all together, we
had a huge success.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.110
And then, as a
result of this event,

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.640
AlphaGo became the symbol
of artificial intelligence.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.140
Still, in Korea, many
people use AlphaGo

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.620
as a metaphor for anything
artificial intelligence.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.070
And Lee Sedol 9-dan
also became a huge star.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:04.030
He already appeared
on two TV commercials,

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.320
and I heard there
were more to come.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.040
And Go also became very popular.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:17.679
So overall, we had very good
results than we could imagine.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:22.719
So this was the AlphaGo match,
and it has been about 1 1/2

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.190
months since the AlphaGo match.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.989
And we are still
seeing the interest

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:34.889
that is from the AlphaGo
match, but it's slowly fading.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.730
But still, there is this
fundamental question

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.800
that people have in their mind.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.139
So now that the computer,
or AlphaGo, is so strong,

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:48.510
it's possibly a lot stronger
than any professional players,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.070
especially if it's
still improving.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:56.320
If that is true, is it
still worth it for people

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.260
to dedicate their lives
to master these Go skills?

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.470
What about the professional
Go players that

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.620
already dedicated their lives?

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.350
And there was this "New
Yorker" article titled,

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.110
In the Age of Google DeepMind,
do they still have the future--

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.060
the Go prodigies of Asia?

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:21.580
This article describes the life
of the young prodigies in Asia.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.600
And then actually, Dawn, the
writer of this article-- she

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.840
interviewed me three
times over Skype,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.770
so she quoted me many
times in this article.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.110
So this article basically
doesn't answer the question,

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:38.550
but it lays out the situation--
like, this is the situation.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:42.870
And no one knows, you know--
the future, we can't tell.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.550
But in my mind, if you
ask me, is it still worth

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.680
pursuing your career as
a professional Go player?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:55.990
My answer is yes,
and for two reasons.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.380
The first one is
that I think Go is

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.350
more of a mind sport than work.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:06.990
If professional Go players' work
was to generate better-- like,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.270
sitting at the
office, then AlphaGo

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.340
could replace all of them.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.890
But in my mind, they are more
of the athletes in sport.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.710
Go is a mind sport.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.420
And people enjoy
watching sports,

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.520
not because machines
can't do better than them,

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.780
but because they are inspired
by these athletes who

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.660
are pushing their limits.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.960
They are developing
their skills,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:38.010
and that is a story-- it's
a valuable story, I think.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:43.430
Another thing is that I think Go
skills are transferable skills.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.580
And there were many
research studies

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:51.380
that shows how learning Go
can help children to develop

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.960
responsibilities,
problem-solving skills,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.310
behavioral education.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:03.890
So I believe training in Go
is as valuable as training

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.850
in other sports.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:11.430
So in that sense, I believe
that it's still worth it.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:17.440
And then also, we have to
think about future changes.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.990
Now that AlphaGo
is out there, it

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.660
could be from DeepMind,
or someone else,

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:29.640
that technical changes would
come to the Go industry.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.210
I don't know when
that would be, but it

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:35.440
will happen, because
AlphaGo inspired

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.410
a lot of software engineers.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:41.210
And already, some companies
in China, or in Korea,

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.370
or everywhere in the
world, they are already

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.780
working on second
or third AlphaGo.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.530
And it will be probably
only a matter of time

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:53.410
that they reach the
top professional level.

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:56.000
So how will this
technical development

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.030
change the Go system
or Go community?

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.750
At the moment, we have
this ecosystem in Go.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.580
We have Go fans, the
hobby players who

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.150
watch professional
games, and pay

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.780
for the lessons, who
buy Go books and then

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.170
play with their
friends or play online.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.190
Because we have
these Go fans, we

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.810
have professional tournaments.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.810
And also because
we have Go fans,

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.230
we have Go lessons-- this
includes all the Go books,

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.350
Go lessons, and Go
schools, et cetera.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.810
And professional
tournaments and Go

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.140
lessons-- they require
elite players--

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.180
the professional
players, Go prodigy,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.910
or the strong amateur players
whose life depends on their Go

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.280
teaching classes and all.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.130
So if you don't have
any of these elements,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.420
the ecosystem of Go
would lose its balance.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.730
For example, if we don't
have elite players,

00:38:56.730 --> 00:39:00.280
the professional tournaments
wouldn't be as interesting.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.280
If they were no Go books,
or quality Go classes,

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.360
Go teachers, it would be
very difficult to have

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.140
the elite players
or the Go fans.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:16.030
One thing about Go--
Go tournaments and Go

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.550
infrastructure--
is that in order

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:24.210
to enjoy Go-- top
players' Go games--

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.330
you need to be a
Go player yourself.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.750
For other sports like soccer,
or basketball, or baseball,

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.310
you don't have to be
a player yourself.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.750
But in Go, if you
are just a beginner,

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.640
you could still enjoy with
the commentary of, like, very

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.830
detailed explanations,
but still, you

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.640
will be missing a lot.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.370
If you are a strong
Go player, then you

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.110
can enjoy the game a lot better.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.520
So that's why this is
very important in order

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.850
to maintain the Go system.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.010
So when there is this new
technology that comes in,

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:06.120
some part of the ecosystem
can lose its power,

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:11.130
and that can be a little
destructive for the system.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:16.560
So what I'm hoping to see in the
future is balanced development.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.730
So we take the ecosystem
of Go, and let's imagine

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.430
there is these individual
tools where these Go fans can

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.480
play AlphaGo, for example.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.160
They can access in their
home, and they can play.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.300
This could be very fun and
very interesting-- so much so

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.790
that they won't be as
interested in watching

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:41.070
other professional players'
games, or pay for other lessons

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.520
or buy Go books.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.470
If that happens, then it can
damage other Go teachers'

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.600
lives, or we can lose
some Go sponsors.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.090
That will be hard.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.040
So in order to
maintain the balance,

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.290
I think we would also need
some spectator's tools,

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:01.870
or commentator's
tools, in order to make

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.680
watching professional
games more enjoyable.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.400
Also, we would need some
kind of teachers' tools,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.930
so that we can also provide
as interesting Go lessons

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.340
or Go books.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.140
And when we have
all of these, we

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.520
would have naturally higher
expectations for elite players.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.480
So we can have also
some training tools

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.930
for having the elite players.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.430
If we can have
all this together,

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.060
we can strengthen each part,
and then, all together,

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.010
have a stronger Go
industry than ever.

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:39.220
And this is not the first
time that technology

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.960
help some industry-- we've
seen this in all other areas.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.630
It's just that it
came at last in Go.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.470
We didn't think it was
possible, but it happened.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:54.270
And if we can maintain
this balance of all areas,

00:41:54.270 --> 00:42:00.000
I think it could be a lot
better for Go in the future.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.360
So that's about I
think about the future,

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.980
and that was about AlphaGo.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.730
And that's all I
prepared for today.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.585
And I would be happy to
answer some of your questions.

00:42:10.585 --> 00:42:11.336
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:15.410
MALE SPEAKER: We
have a Dory set up,

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.400
so I'm going to switch to Dory.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.733
If anybody wants to ask a
live question while I do that,

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:22.567
that would be great.

00:42:22.567 --> 00:42:24.816
Actually, I'm going to abuse
my position here, and ask

00:42:24.816 --> 00:42:25.880
you the first question.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.850
So I will ask you
about an anecdote which

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.600
you relayed in one of
your YouTube videos,

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.330
which was-- did you know
what an NDA was before this?

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.805
And how did you explain
that to Lee Sedol?

00:42:36.805 --> 00:42:39.230
HAJIN LEE: Ah.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.220
I knew what an NDA was.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:46.480
And then it wasn't difficult
to explain to Lee Sedol 9-dan,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.980
because I just told him,
you can't tell about it.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.960
So what I did was that I gave
him the invitation from Google

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.890
DeepMind, and that had
all the important details,

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.420
like the dates,
and the location,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.040
and the prize money,
and the match format,

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.000
which was a five-game match.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.040
It didn't have the sponsor
name, or the opponent name.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.060
And then he said, I can't accept
unless I know the opponent.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.290
So I told him, I can tell
you the opponent name

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.440
only if you sign the NDA.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.380
And then he said, so,
I can't talk about it?

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.380
So I said, no, you can't.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.390
And then he said, OK.

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.890
And then he signed the NDA.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.180
And then I told him about
that-- AlphaGo-- yes.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.872
MALE SPEAKER: And
was he surprised?

00:43:34.872 --> 00:43:36.247
HAJIN LEE: He was
very surprised.

00:43:36.247 --> 00:43:38.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:39.990
MALE SPEAKER: Us, too.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.585
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

00:43:42.585 --> 00:43:44.670
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:45.825
So I'm going to read these.

00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:46.679
So we have a Dory.

00:43:46.679 --> 00:43:48.970
I'm going to take the first
couple questions from this,

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.595
and then we'll ask
some live questions.

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:52.695
So how do classic Go games
compare to modern play?

00:43:52.695 --> 00:43:54.820
And can you see obvious
mistakes in the classic era

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.642
players-- Shuei,
Dosaku-- outside

00:43:57.642 --> 00:43:59.013
of new joseki innovations?

00:43:59.013 --> 00:44:00.679
And which era's games
are the most worth

00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:01.820
studying for amateurs?

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.278
That's about three
questions there.

00:44:03.278 --> 00:44:04.070
HAJIN LEE: Wow.

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:09.390
So, the classical games are very
different from modern games,

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.280
mainly because they didn't have
this system called "komi"--

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.660
that's like compensation
points for white,

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.650
because black plays first.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.620
So in the olden times,
instead of trying

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.960
to balance out by giving
some points to white

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.530
for playing later, they
would just do two games.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.900
So two players would play,
once with black, and once

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.250
with white.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.510
And there is this legendary
player who was so strong,

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.580
and he never lost with black.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:43.480
So the saying is that when
someone asked, how did you do?

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.050
And he would answer, I was
black, and that meant he won.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.100
So that's why the games
were very different.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.870
And then, as time
passed, we developed

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.720
many more opening theories
and endgame theories.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.030
So it is generally agreed
among professional players

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.980
that we are stronger
than before.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.180
But for amateur players,
the classic games

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.850
are still worth studying,
because they were still

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.020
very strong, and they
had a very deep reading.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.450
Another thing was that they
would spend a lot of time

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:16.810
for each move.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:21.120
These days, we finish one
game at least in a day.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.680
The longer games
take, like, 10 hours,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.600
but still, it wouldn't
take more than one day.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.580
In Japan, still,
there are some title

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.050
matches that would last
two days, but that's all.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.080
In the olden times, the
games would take months,

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.240
because they would
think until they decide.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.830
And they would take long breaks.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.720
So the game records are
actually quite good,

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.780
so you can still study.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:52.530
But it will be difficult to use
the same moves in modern games,

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.185
because of the komi, and then
different playing styles.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:01.510
Which era's games-- I'm
not sure about that one.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.945
MALE SPEAKER: I'll
just comment--

00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:08.880
Shusaku, who was the player
who would take black,

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.600
would win-- he was a
19th-century Japanese player.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.449
There's a very good book in
English called "Invincible."

00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:16.990
I'm not sure if it's
still available,

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.057
but that was, I think, still
one of the best English books

00:46:20.057 --> 00:46:20.890
in English about Go.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.160
And it's a complete commentary
on most of his games.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.450
So if you are looking for a
very expensive book to buy,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.400
that would be it.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.312
Excellent choice.

00:46:30.312 --> 00:46:32.520
AUDIENCE: You can get it
pretty cheap on [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.283
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, really?

00:46:33.283 --> 00:46:34.209
AUDIENCE: Or Go Books.

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:35.600
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.195
Is there a question
from the audience?

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:38.820
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.486
AUDIENCE: I know the
AGA has been trying

00:46:40.486 --> 00:46:44.347
to build an American
professional system, which I'm

00:46:44.347 --> 00:46:46.180
all in favor of, but
then I take the thought

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.050
of-- to a Westerner, the idea of
sending your six-year-old child

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.040
to go live with
somebody else in order

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:59.630
to become a professional board
game player is very strange.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.610
Do you think that we have
that cultural problem

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.660
of just not being used to
the kind of thing it takes

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.371
to become that level of pro?

00:47:07.371 --> 00:47:08.370
HAJIN LEE: That's right.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.640
It will be very difficult to
reach the Asian top pro level

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.350
without that kind of
intensive training,

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:21.090
but I think it is possible,
if you have a strong Go

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.070
teacher living nearby.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.730
It doesn't have to be, like,
separating from your parents,

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.730
if you have the
teacher right there.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:29.980
So that could be one thing.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.030
Another thing is that
now we have the internet.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.040
When I was 9 years old, we
didn't have strong internet.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.900
And there were no strong players
to play, like, very freely.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.180
So with this aid of technology
and maybe some strong teachers'

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:49.750
presence, I think, the American
students-- they could also

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:50.838
get very strong.

00:47:53.885 --> 00:47:55.260
MALE SPEAKER: The
other thing is,

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.840
it's not that different--
like, women's gymnastics,

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.710
for example, they start studying
and training at that age,

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:02.010
right?

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.093
I don't know that they
move in with their teacher,

00:48:04.093 --> 00:48:05.000
but it's often pretty intense.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.375
And people have been known to
move cross-country to play,

00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:10.743
you know, to study with a coach.

00:48:10.743 --> 00:48:13.373
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:13.373 --> 00:48:14.873
MALE SPEAKER:
Athletics is, I think,

00:48:14.873 --> 00:48:17.884
what you should compare it to.

00:48:17.884 --> 00:48:19.550
I'm going to take one
more from up here.

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:20.341
HAJIN LEE: Oh, yes.

00:48:20.341 --> 00:48:23.516
MALE SPEAKER: If I can get
it to-- oh, look at that.

00:48:23.516 --> 00:48:27.630
So, have you seen any pros
copying AlphaGo moves or style?

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.030
HAJIN LEE: So, they have
been saying on Facebook

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:36.510
that Lee Sedol 9-dan's moves
were somehow resemblant AlphaGo

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:37.450
moves.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.460
And then someone
actually asked him

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.720
if he was trying to
copy AlphaGo's style.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.080
And he said, I wasn't
consciously trying to copy,

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.430
but I am trying to
think differently.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.460
And the main thing he
said was that before, he

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:58.880
had some intuitive moves that
came from his experiences,

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.010
but now he tries to
rely on 100% reading.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:06.820
So one thing we were
amazed by AlphaGo

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:10.690
was that it would play a
move that we would never

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.130
think about.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:14.080
And that was because
I think AlphaGo

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.970
didn't have any preconceptions.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.376
And that was just an
amazing experience.

00:49:20.376 --> 00:49:21.334
MALE SPEAKER: Comments?

00:49:21.334 --> 00:49:24.136
Andrew?

00:49:24.136 --> 00:49:27.420
AUDIENCE: During the
AlphaGo match week,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.970
I think a lot of players,
as the week went on,

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.800
became very excited by the
idea that, more quickly than we

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.670
thought, we would see
the next level of Go,

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.100
because AlphaGo would
force us into it,

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.160
or simply show us what it was.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:49.340
Before AlphaGo, would you
say that most professional Go

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:52.900
players, somewhere in
the back of their mind,

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.980
thought, we haven't
reached ideal Go playing?

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.710
That there is a next level--
we just don't know what it is?

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.256
Was that the opinion,
do you think?

00:50:02.256 --> 00:50:03.200
HAJIN LEE: Right.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.850
So before AlphaGo,
professor players

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.500
did know that there
was a higher level,

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.000
but they thought
the higher level,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.570
the margin of that difference
was very narrow-- very, very,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.460
very narrow, that you
could study for, like,

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.710
another 15 years, and
there is no guarantee

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.820
that you would get
this much stronger.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.810
But after AlphaGo, what
professional players realized

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:31.260
was that it wasn't that narrow.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.190
There was this whole lot
of different level of Go,

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.654
and that was very
inspiring for all pros.

00:50:42.814 --> 00:50:44.064
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, there we go.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.000
HAJIN LEE: That one--
I am not sure what

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.820
it means by "mistakes,"
because AlphaGo

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:06.240
has very different ideas of best
moves from we human players.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.420
So human players, because
we can't read all the way

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.640
throughout the end, we
just take maybe about up

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.110
to five or 10 or 15
moves, and then try

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.930
to have maximum advance
after that sequence.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.070
But in the case of
AlphaGo, AlphaGo

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.140
would look at the
end of the game,

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.380
and then make sure that
AlphaGo has the highest

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.850
probability of winning.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:38.560
And in winning, how
many points wouldn't

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.380
matter, whether it's like
half points win, or like

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.530
10 points win.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.590
AlphaGo only cares
about winning.

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:48.610
So, some moves of
AlphaGo, we could

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.660
feel like that was a mistake.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.870
But then in AlphaGo's system,
it wouldn't be mistake.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.380
So I think it's
very hard to say.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.278
AUDIENCE: But the response
to the wedge in game four--

00:51:59.278 --> 00:52:00.531
AlphaGo missed.

00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:01.530
HAJIN LEE: That's right.

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.960
That was a clear mistake-- yes.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.140
The fourth game that Lee Sedol
9-dan won-- and the wedge,

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.620
it's called "The
Move," "God's Move"--

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:18.100
that actually didn't work, if
AlphaGo responded in the right

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:18.820
way.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:22.290
But the thing was that AlphaGo
didn't predict the move.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.230
And I think Dennis
said that AlphaGo

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:30.420
thought the chance of white
playing there was 1:10,000.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.480
And in Go board, there were
only about 200 spots to play.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.590
So it was a very strange
move in AlphaGo's opinion.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.350
And AlphaGo thought it
could just now answer.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:45.030
So that was a mistake.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.830
Right.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.830
MALE SPEAKER: We're going
to go to the next one.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:52.215
So this is-- Andrew Jackson
asked this question.

00:52:52.215 --> 00:52:52.798
HAJIN LEE: Ah.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.600
That's a very, very
difficult question.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.700
And then I am afraid that
after answering something,

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.930
I would regret later.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:09.970
So naturally, I would
say, can I come back

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.450
with the answer in one day?

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:16.410
But right in my
mind, I would say,

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:20.670
the best thing would be an
international Go tournament

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:23.790
for the top
professional players.

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:26.680
It would be even better if
the winner of the tournament

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.920
could play AlphaGo.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.780
That would be like a
big exhibition match.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.171
That would be awesome, I think.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:37.970
Yes?

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.008
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so we've
had, I guess, over 10 years

00:53:41.008 --> 00:53:46.560
now to kind of see what happened
with chess, with Deep Blue.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:49.134
And it seems like,
I mean, people still

00:53:49.134 --> 00:53:50.108
sort of play chess.

00:53:50.108 --> 00:53:56.067
And top grandmasters use strong
computer programs, and still

00:53:56.067 --> 00:53:58.567
kind of the competitions among
the strong computer programs.

00:53:58.567 --> 00:54:02.997
So do you feel like Go will have
kind of a similar experience

00:54:02.997 --> 00:54:03.497
to chess?

00:54:03.497 --> 00:54:06.290
Do you think it'll react to
computers kind of the same way

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.960
that chess did?

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.490
HAJIN LEE: Yes, I think
that's absolutely possible.

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:12.180
Actually, after
the AlphaGo match,

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.990
we had a small party
among the organizers.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.990
And I was talking with
these Google people,

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.850
and we were lightly
joking about the future.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.630
And then they
mentioned Facebook.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:28.720
And they said that if AlphaGo
played the Facebook computer

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.030
artificial intelligence
in the future,

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.250
they would play, like, a
million games in half an hour.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.220
But that was obviously a joke.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.510
But, you know, Lee Sedol 9-dan,
he would spend a lot of time

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.350
thinking-- in the
future, I think

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.550
it is possible that computers
would play each other.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.650
And then also, I
heard in chess, it's

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:55.740
very interesting to see the
competition between human plus

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.950
machine, versus
just machine alone.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:00.352
That could be also an
interesting format, I think.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.060
Yes.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.456
There is a question over there.

00:55:07.456 --> 00:55:10.166
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
one of the goals of the AlphaGo

00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:12.611
match was having a good
relationship with Google

00:55:12.611 --> 00:55:13.530
DeepMind.

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:17.850
So I wonder if you can share
some short-term or long-term

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.730
plans for some events
like AlphaGo match?

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:25.890
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:31.560
At the moment, we don't have any
specific plans with DeepMind.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.270
We will have to see.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:38.840
So during the AlphaGo match,
DeepMind told us, KBA,

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.550
that they haven't planned
much of the future yet,

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:44.870
because they wanted to see
how the result comes out.

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.640
And then they would
analyze, and then they

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.050
would decide what's
the next move.

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:52.883
And I think they are still
considering different options.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:55:57.910
Yes.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:04.770
So AlphaGo's-- when the match--
was arranged-- was your-- Ah,

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.310
OK.

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:10.390
So before the match
against Lee Sedol

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.490
9-dan, I thought
AlphaGo was very strong.

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:16.180
I knew that AlphaGo was strong.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.400
And I also knew that the
games against Fan Hui

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.100
didn't show 100%
of its strength,

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.990
partially because
AlphaGo was winning.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.260
And when AlphaGo
is winning, AlphaGo

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.650
doesn't play its
strongest moves.

00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:32.700
It just plays safe moves.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:37.200
Another thing was
that DeepMind publicly

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.630
shared that AlphaGo was still
improving and still training,

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:43.990
and that it will be better by
the time it plays Lee Sedol.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.880
So I knew that it
would be strong,

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.100
but I had my doubts
that it would still

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.870
defeat Lee Sedol 9-dan.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:58.790
And I did share with him, but I
think Lee Sedol was very, very

00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:59.520
confident.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:05.860
And even though I told him,
you should be more careful.

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.360
But--

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:16.960
--he didn't take it
seriously enough, I think.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.195
AUDIENCE: Did you ever get
a chance to play AlphaGo?

00:57:20.195 --> 00:57:23.790
HAJIN LEE: Um, AlphaGo?

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.210
We will talk privately.

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.580
MALE SPEAKER: There we go.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.020
HAJIN LEE: Mm.

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:53.520
Right.

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:05.314
And I think-- is it the
end of the question?

00:58:05.314 --> 00:58:07.730
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah, you can
see the end of the question

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:08.670
here.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:09.844
HAJIN LEE: Ah, OK.

00:58:09.844 --> 00:58:10.510
Can you go back?

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.760
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, hopefully.

00:58:17.572 --> 00:58:20.030
HAJIN LEE: I'm a little confused
by the question, because--

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.630
MALE SPEAKER: I think
the question is,

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.966
who would benefit more from--

00:58:21.966 --> 00:58:22.880
HAJIN LEE: Ah, OK.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.290
If it was longer, who
would benefit more?

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.790
Both.

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:29.790
I'm not sure who
would benefit more.

00:58:33.292 --> 00:58:35.250
If the game was longer,
I would have suffered--

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.610
--because I was so busy.

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.040
And then the 300
plus [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.520
would have suffered,
because they

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.340
thought it was already so long.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.810
And the commentators.

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:49.850
But the two players would
have enjoyed, I think.

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:53.587
I'm not sure who would
have had more benefits.

00:58:53.587 --> 00:58:55.920
MALE SPEAKER: I think, like,
the two-hour time control--

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.656
that's a typical [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:57.656 --> 00:58:58.280
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:58.565
Right.

00:58:58.565 --> 00:58:59.930
MALE SPEAKER: --international.

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:01.550
The only people who play
the two-day tournaments

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:03.091
are the Japanese,
so I think it would

00:59:03.091 --> 00:59:05.860
be-- if they had played Iyama,
who's the top player in Japan

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.060
now-- they're more used to
playing with that time control.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:09.810
HAJIN LEE: Right.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:10.630
Yes.

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:13.946
MALE SPEAKER: So you know, it
takes practice, I think, to--

00:59:13.946 --> 00:59:14.570
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.570
Right.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:20.032
AUDIENCE: I know in the
second or third game,

00:59:20.032 --> 00:59:23.266
after AlphaGo made a very
strange move, Lee Sedol,

00:59:23.266 --> 00:59:25.030
like, left the room.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.190
Where did he go?

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.180
HAJIN LEE: Yeah.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.520
He went smoking, I think.

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.020
Yeah.

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:39.280
So the Four Seasons hotel
that we had this AlphaGo

00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:43.400
match-- they organized
a private terrace

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.749
for Lee Sedol 9-dan to smoke.

00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:48.194
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] typical
in a professional match

00:59:48.194 --> 00:59:50.150
for one professional to
be smoking [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.110
during the match?

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:54.160
HAJIN LEE: It's not
typical to smoke,

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.930
but it is very common to take
a short break to just get

00:59:57.930 --> 01:00:02.650
some fresh air, or some walk.

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.970
Yes?

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:08.584
AUDIENCE: I noted that after
all the games, including

01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:11.920
the games that Lee
Sedol 9-dan lost,

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:19.920
he left the playing room
quickly, and went away

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.650
for a while, and then came
back for the press conference.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:28.130
And at the press conference,
he was cheerful and composed.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:41.510
Can you comment a little bit on
what, for a champion Go player,

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.348
winning and losing
publicly is like,

01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:46.480
and then composing
yourself after it?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.526
What was going on in that
45 minutes after the game?

01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:54.160
And actually, a second
question-- the part

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:58.010
at the end of the game where you
review with your opponent was

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:01.860
missing from this game, because
the opponent wasn't there

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.180
to review with.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:08.440
Is that a very important part
emotionally of a pro's game?

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.160
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.400
The first question--
so Lee Sedol 9-dan

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.530
did extremely well in
post-game press conferences

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.650
after each game.

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:22.720
And I was very impressed,
because in Go tournaments,

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.650
the common practice is that
you only interview the winners.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:29.130
You leave the losers alone,
because they are already sad.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:30.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:35.450
But we planned this press
conference after each game,

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:38.830
regardless of the
result, because it

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.700
was very important for
all the journalists

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.400
to hear what he thought about.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.670
And they also wanted to hear
from the DeepMind developers.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.490
So, at first, I was
a little concerned.

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:52.510
So I told Lee Sedol
9-dan, several times

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:57.137
before he started the game, that
he needed to come to the press

01:01:57.137 --> 01:01:58.220
conference after the game.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.793
Because he could also just
disappear and go to his room.

01:02:01.793 --> 01:02:06.990
But very impressively,
he not only

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:09.720
came to the press conference,
but he did the interview

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.430
so well, that I think this is
a very big reason why Lee Sedol

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.380
9-dan became a big
star after the match.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:22.890
Although he lost, he
still was very-- yeah,

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:25.000
as he said-- he
was still cheerful.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.610
And he would answer very
humbly and genuinely.

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.660
So that was a really
good role model

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.020
for all the
professional players.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.510
And during the short breaks
between the game and the press

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:42.580
conference, he would
review the game.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.310
So he would talk about
the moves that he played,

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.650
or the moves that
AlphaGo played.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.770
After the first game, we
weren't really prepared for him

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.520
to review, because he
didn't have the opponent.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.120
And he was actually asking
me a lot of questions.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.320
And it was not direct
questions, but more like I

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.590
was alone there with him.

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.110
And he was saying,
maybe I should

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:08.670
have done the knight's move.

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:11.060
Should I have wedged over here?

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.000
What did you think
about this invasion?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.340
And I was there.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.770
And actually, I was too
busy to see the game,

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.960
so I didn't actually
know what to say.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.120
And he kept saying these things.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.370
And I felt terrible.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.380
Because I knew, as a
professional player,

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.460
that just talking about
the game makes you feel,

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.490
somehow, more relaxed,
because you're still

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:38.250
processing the
result. And especially

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.780
after the first game, it must
have been very hard on him,

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.710
because he didn't
expect to lose.

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:48.250
But luckily, he did very
well in the press conference.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:51.050
And then from the
second game, I made sure

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:52.770
that there were some
strong pros that he

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.730
could talk about the game.

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:58.790
So when the game was over,
I would bring in one or two

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:00.370
professional players,
and then they

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:03.970
would review for about half
an hour in the play room.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:07.850
And when the press
conference was getting close,

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:09.860
like in five minutes,
or in 10 minutes,

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.270
I would tell them that
it's press conference soon,

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:16.260
and they would move
to the waiting room.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.880
And I'm sure it was
hard, because he couldn't

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.950
review with the opponent.

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:22.930
He couldn't review
with [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:26.190
Although [INAUDIBLE] was a very
good representation of AlphaGo,

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:29.990
he couldn't review on
behalf of AlphaGo, sadly.

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:33.280
But because he
could still review

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.180
with his professional
friends, I think

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:40.090
it had a similar
effect in the end.

01:04:42.999 --> 01:04:45.040
MALE SPEAKER: I think
there might be [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:52.762 --> 01:04:53.470
HAJIN LEE: Right.

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:54.450
MALE SPEAKER: We're running
low on time here, so--

01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:55.908
HAJIN LEE: Yeah,
so this question--

01:04:55.908 --> 01:04:59.390
it's one of the
fundamental questions

01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:01.800
that all pros are
asking themselves.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.000
If AlphaGo can really
teach individual players,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.250
where would professional
players or the Go teachers

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:12.560
go for their income?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.130
And I think the
answer is that they

01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:20.870
will have to be as competitive
as AlphaGo tools-- meaning,

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:24.410
they will have to
teach better to attract

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.900
the Go players to pay
for their lessons, right?

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:33.167
And for that, I think they will
need something like Alphago.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:35.000
MALE SPEAKER: We can
take one more question,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.166
and then we'll take a break.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.190
HAJIN LEE: Yeah.

01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:40.620
AUDIENCE: So for
the past two years,

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:44.050
I've been trying to get
more people to play Go,

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:48.950
and I've found out that
getting people to play Go

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:51.890
is kind of like getting people
to become software engineers.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:56.790
Women tend to not
want to play Go.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:00.218
There's a huge movement
now to promote diversity

01:06:00.218 --> 01:06:03.180
in software engineering,
and I'm wondering,

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:06.210
is there something
similar in Korea

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:10.480
that we can learn from to
promote diversity in Go?

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.210
HAJIN LEE: First
of all, in Korea,

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.760
we don't have a higher
gender ratio for women.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.780
We have about the same.

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.920
We have the same problem, where
only about 10% of Go population

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.910
are women.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:28.660
And also, we also
have been conscious

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.910
about this situation
and thinking

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.910
that we should do something.

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.660
I don't think there
have been major efforts

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:40.110
to actually do promote
Go to women yet,

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:43.260
but I think we are taking
some baby steps toward that.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:48.220
And we are aware
of the situation.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.600
It's difficult to share
any success story,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.860
because we don't have one yet.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.760
Maybe we can--

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.093
AUDIENCE: Do you have any ideas?

01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:58.370
HAJIN LEE: --work on it.

01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:03.620
Maybe we need more role
models, like some star player

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:08.060
who is a woman-- maybe a
star engineer who is a woman.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.350
And I think these role models
can really inspire young girls

01:07:12.350 --> 01:07:14.445
to follow their path.

01:07:14.445 --> 01:07:15.820
AUDIENCE: Can I
[INAUDIBLE] this?

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.820
HAJIN LEE: Yes.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.820
AUDIENCE: So I started,
me and some of my friends

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.140
starting playing because of
"Hikaru no Go," the anime.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.360
And I feel like if there
was a similar anime,

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.812
but with a woman player, or
more women players, [INAUDIBLE],

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:33.892
it could probably bring
more women or girls

01:07:33.892 --> 01:07:36.360
when I was at that age to play.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.440
And I'd like to say more
role models and just

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.405
active [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:42.405 --> 01:07:43.780
That's my opinion.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.870
HAJIN LEE: Right, yes.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:46.760
AUDIENCE: Actually, the
author of that was a woman.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.110
MALE SPEAKER:
Yeah, that's right.

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:47.710
HAJIN LEE: That's right.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:48.210
Yes.

01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:54.420
MALE SPEAKER: We're going
to take a brief break,

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.976
and then we're going
to reconvene over

01:07:56.976 --> 01:08:01.228
in [INAUDIBLE], which is
a training room in 2000.

01:08:01.228 --> 01:08:06.326
And Ms. Lee is going
to play some Go.

01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:07.200
HAJIN LEE: All right.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.700
Thank you.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.450
[APPLAUSE]
