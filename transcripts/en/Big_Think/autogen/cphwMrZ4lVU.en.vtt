the changes in their lifestyle that are
needed to move us off of fossil fuels

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960
needed to move us off of fossil fuels
 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.980
needed to move us off of fossil fuels
into a cleaner future because right now

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
into a cleaner future because right now

air pollution pollution which is killing

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930
air pollution pollution which is killing
 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.630
air pollution pollution which is killing
in the United States about forty to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
in the United States about forty to
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.179
in the United States about forty to
fifty thousand people per year worldwide

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189
fifty thousand people per year worldwide
 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.030
fifty thousand people per year worldwide
a much larger number than that because

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040
a much larger number than that because
 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.190
a much larger number than that because
the pollution is much worse in China and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
the pollution is much worse in China and
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.440
the pollution is much worse in China and
India than it is in the United States so

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
India than it is in the United States so
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.390
India than it is in the United States so
we have many reasons to want to move

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400
we have many reasons to want to move
 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.820
we have many reasons to want to move
beyond the fossil fuel era

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830
 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.260
it could happen very easily if our

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
it could happen very easily if our
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.250
it could happen very easily if our
governments would move in that direction

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260
governments would move in that direction
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.490
governments would move in that direction
and by the way if this has happened it

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500
and by the way if this has happened it
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
and by the way if this has happened it
is happening now in British Columbia

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
is happening now in British Columbia
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.520
is happening now in British Columbia
Canada they have imposed a carbon tax

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
Canada they have imposed a carbon tax

with the money returned to the public
 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.740
with the money returned to the public
they do it via a decrease in payroll

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
they do it via a decrease in payroll
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320
they do it via a decrease in payroll
taxes I would rather see a dividend

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
taxes I would rather see a dividend
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.240
taxes I would rather see a dividend
because half the people are not on a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
because half the people are not on a
 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.250
because half the people are not on a
payroll either they're retired or

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260
payroll either they're retired or
 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.040
payroll either they're retired or
they're out of work but you could use

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050
they're out of work but you could use
 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.900
they're out of work but you could use
say half of it for a payroll tax

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910
say half of it for a payroll tax
 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.310
say half of it for a payroll tax
deduction and half of it for a dividend
