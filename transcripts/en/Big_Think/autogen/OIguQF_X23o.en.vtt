right now where there's a desire for
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.900
right now where there's a desire for
anthropologists to be more engaged and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
anthropologists to be more engaged and
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.200

if anthropologists are so dependent on

I think that undermines the

I think that undermines the
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.109
I think that undermines the
anthropological project anywhere so I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
anthropological project anywhere so I
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880

this tendency to both you know stick in

this tendency to both you know stick in
the ivory towel and and and justify that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
the ivory towel and and and justify that
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109
the ivory towel and and and justify that
by saying you know we can't get involved

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
by saying you know we can't get involved
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120
by saying you know we can't get involved
because the moment we get involved we

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
because the moment we get involved we
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.749
because the moment we get involved we
implicated in these things and then this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
implicated in these things and then this
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700
implicated in these things and then this
tendency to say well how do we make this

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
tendency to say well how do we make this
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.339
tendency to say well how do we make this
knowledge that we generate relevant and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
knowledge that we generate relevant and
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.790
knowledge that we generate relevant and
useful to people in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
useful to people in
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890
useful to people in

haven't yet started my own research i'm

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
haven't yet started my own research i'm
 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.410

very much of the theoretical distance

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
very much of the theoretical distance
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.370
very much of the theoretical distance

devil before i have to actually going
sort of get my hands dirty i think it's

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
sort of get my hands dirty i think it's
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.320
sort of get my hands dirty i think it's
really in that field work experience

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330
really in that field work experience
 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.450
really in that field work experience
that a lot of these things have worked

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460
that a lot of these things have worked
 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.790
that a lot of these things have worked
out so anthropology is unusual in that

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800
out so anthropology is unusual in that
 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.640
out so anthropology is unusual in that
sense within the Academy because it does

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
sense within the Academy because it does
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.980
sense within the Academy because it does
have that field work two years of field

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990
have that field work two years of field
 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.290
have that field work two years of field
works are built into your academic

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300

experience it and forces you to grapple

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
experience it and forces you to grapple
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.480
experience it and forces you to grapple
you know and go out there and engage

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490
you know and go out there and engage
 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.310
you know and go out there and engage
with people and so it's an like

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320
with people and so it's an like
 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.670

sociology which is you know much more

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
sociology which is you know much more
 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.180
sociology which is you know much more
statistical sort of quantitative based

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
statistical sort of quantitative based
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430
statistical sort of quantitative based
social science so it's very unusual in

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
social science so it's very unusual in
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.430
social science so it's very unusual in
that sense but it's still struggles with

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440
that sense but it's still struggles with
 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.030
that sense but it's still struggles with
finding a balance between those first
