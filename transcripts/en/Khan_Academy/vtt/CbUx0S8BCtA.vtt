00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.430
So I've been sent this definite
integral problem and it seemed

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.270
as good as any, and I think the
key with this is just to

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.390
see a lot of examples.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.820
So let's do it.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:19.290
This definite integral is from
pi over 2 to pi of minus cosine

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:27.610
squared of x times sin of x dx.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.770
So before we just chug
through the math and do the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.510
antiderivatives and use the
fundamental theorem of calculus

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.970
to evaluate the definite
integral, let's think about

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.170
what we're even doing.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770
So I've graphed this function
right here, minus cosine

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.940
squared of x times sin of x.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.980
And what we care about,
we're defining the definite

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.670
integral between pi over 2,
which is roughly here.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.490
Let me see if I can make
this a little bit bigger.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.670
So between pi over 2 which is
right there, and between pi.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.190
So the definite integral of
this function between here and

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.970
here is essentially the area of
the curve between the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.670
curve and the x-axis.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.370
And since the a curve is below
the x-axis here, this area is

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.870
going to be a negative number.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.400
So that gives us
immediately an intuition.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520
We should be getting a negative
number when we evaluate this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.160
and just to prove this I
actually typed it in up here.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.540
So let's now evaluate
this definite integral.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.400
Now I'll rearrange some of the
terms here just to make it a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.940
little bit easier to read.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.860
But the way I always think
about it is, well I have

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.760
a cosine and a sin.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.060
The cosine is squared, so all
these crazy things are

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.770
happening to it, so it seems
like I could use substitution

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.320
or the reverse chain
rules some out here.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.820
And what was the chain rule?

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.060
The chain rule said if I took
the derivative of f of g of x

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:01.750
that this is equal to f prime
of g of x times g prime of x.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.610
That might completely confuse
you, but I just wrote that here

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.160
because we could say, well what
if g of x is cosine of x. f

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.540
prime of g of x is the cosine
of x squared, and then the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.875
derivative of g of x or the
derivative of cosine

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.080
of x is sin of x.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.270
Well it's actually minus sin of
x, and we have a minus sin

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.030
here, so that works
out well too.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.760
If this confuse you, ignore it.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.260
Well essentially we're just
going to do the same thing,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.470
but we're going to do
it with substitution.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.950
So let me do it
with substitution.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.985
Let me a erase this if
this confuses people.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.580
I want to do it however it
is least confusing to you.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.260
OK let me erase that.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.190
Actually, let me do it with
substitution, just because the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.540
way I was just doing is kind
of my shortcut back in the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.530
day when I was a mathlete.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.530
But it's good to be able to do
it with substitution, helps you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.000
from making careless mistakes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.280
So let me rewrite
this first of all.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.700
This is the same thing as the
integral from pi over 2 to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.670
pi of cosine squared of x.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.340
Actually let me write that
as cosine of x squared.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.810
Same thing, right.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.730
Times minus sin of x dx.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.350
And now it should
be clearer to you.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.330
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.710
It's minus sin of x.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.020
So I have a function and it's
being squared, and I have its

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.310
derivative, so I can figure out
its antiderivative by using

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.855
substitution or the
reverse chain rule.

00:03:31.855 --> 00:03:34.360
So let's make a substitution.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.800
u is equal to cosine of x.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.385
How did I know to substitute
u is equal to cosine of x?

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:42.960
Well because I say, well
the derivative of this

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.850
function is here.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.750
So when I find du, this whole
thing is going to end up

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.460
being du, and let me
show that to you.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.502
So what is du/dx?

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:57.980
du/dx is equal to
minus sin of x.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.620
That hopefully we've
learned already.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.480
So what is du?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.750
If we multiply both sides by
the differential d of x get du

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.250
is equal to minus sin of x dx.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.160
So if we look at the original
equation, this right here we

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.900
just showed is equal to du,
and this right here is what?

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.790
Cosine of x is u.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.440
That was our original
substitution.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.685
So we have u squared.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.100
So now let's take the integral.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.450
And I will arbitrarily
switch colors.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.160
And now this is a very
important thing.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.790
If you're going to do
substitution, if we're going to

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.020
say u is equal to cosine of x,
we're going to have to actually

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.450
make this substitution
on the boundaries.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.640
Or we could do the substitution
and reverse the substitution

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.710
and then evaluate the
boundaries, but let's do that.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.240
So if this is going from x is
equal to pi over 2 to pi,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.160
what is u going from?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.070
Well when x is equal to
pi over 2, u is equal

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.870
to cosine of pi over 2.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.390
Because u is just cosine of x.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.253
And then when x is pi, i is
going to be cosine of pi.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.720
And now the fun part.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.840
Cosine of x squared.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.400
Well that's just the same
thing is u squared.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.620
And minus sin of x dx,
that's the same thing

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.560
is du-- did that here.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.800
This is pretty straightforward
and I'm just going

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.370
to rewrite it.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.450
What's cosine of pi?

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.120
Cosine of pi is minus 1.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.860
Cosine of pi over 2,
well that's a 0.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.420
So we have the integral from u
is equal to 0 to u is equal to

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.280
negative 1 of u squared du.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.050
And now this seems like
a simple problem.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.710
So this is equal to the
antiderivative of u

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.460
squared, which is
fairly straightforward.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.350
u cubed over 3.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.960
You could just take the
derivative of this,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.980
you get this.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.900
All I did is I increased this
exponent to get the third, and

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.491
I divided by that exponent.

00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.790
Now we're going to have to
evaluate it at minus 1 and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.840
subtract from that,
it evaluated at 0.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.090
So this is equal to minus 1
to the third over 3 minus

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.110
0 over 3, and so this
is equal to minus 1/3.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.310
And we are done.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.260
And if we look at this area
from our original graph, what

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.400
we just solved, as we said the
area of the curve between

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.405
here and here is minus 1/3.

00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:39.050
Or if we wanted the absolute
area because you can't really

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.670
have a negative area, it's 1/3
but we know it's negative

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.490
because this curve is
below the x-axis here.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.610
And that looks about right,
that looks about 1/3.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.580
I mean if this cube right
here is 1, then that

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.600
looks about 1/3.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.520
The intuition all
works out at least.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.800
So hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.670
Actually let me-- since we
have a little bit of time.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.810
Hopefully you understood this,
and if you did, don't worry

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.920
about what I'm going to do now,
but I want to show you how I

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.330
tend to do it where I
just think of it is the

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.040
reverse chain rule.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.840
It's a little bit
quicker sometimes.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.570
But it's really the same
thing as what we just

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.250
did with substitution.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.450
So if we erase all of this.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.130
And so if we have this integral
right here, what I do is I say,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.690
well I have cosine
of x squared.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.980
I have cosine of x squared, and
then I have minus sin of x.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.240
This is the derivative of this.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.040
Since the derivative is here,
I can just treat this whole

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.260
thing like an x term.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.130
So this is the same thing.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:55.330
So the antiderivative is cosine
of x to the third over 3, and I

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.140
evaluate it at pi
and pi over 2.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.870
And remember, how
did I do this?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.030
What allowed me to treat this
cosine of x just like an x or

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.200
like a u when I did it
with the substitution?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.960
Well I had its derivative
sitting right here,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.860
minus sin of x.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.750
So that's what gave me the
license to just take the

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.920
antiderivative, pretend like
this cosine of x is just an x,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.650
is just a u, you could even
say, and just take it's

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.110
exponent, raise it by 1 and
divide it by 3 and then

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.740
evaluate it from
pi to pi over 2.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:31.540
So this is equal to cosine of
pi cubed over 3 minus cosine

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.470
of pi over 2 cubed over 3.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.630
This is minus 1 to the third,
so this is equal to minus

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.990
1/3 minus this is 0.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.330
So we get the same answer.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.550
I just wanted to show you that.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.450
It's exactly the same
with substitution.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.440
It's just I didn't formally do
the substitution, but it's

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.320
the exact same thing.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.950
Anyway, hope you
found that helpful.
