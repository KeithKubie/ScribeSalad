00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.874
Hospital health IT systems came into
widespread use in the late 1970s and

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:06.466
80s.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.890
There were some early attempts
to provide a single vendor

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.210
fully integrated hospital wide solution,
but most systems were developed for

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.430
a particular department, such as
pharmacy, clinical lab, or radiology.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.410
And it was common for each of these
departments to select their own system.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.230
As a result,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.410
hospitals were faced with the problem
of communicating among those systems.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.530
So, for example, patients could
be uniformly registered and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.260
charges could be reliably collected.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.370
Health level seven, HL7, evolved to
create these messaging standards.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.190
It used EDIX12 to format the messages.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.230
Its latest version, 3, migrates to XML,
which, as we discussed earlier,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.190
is a technology developed for
the internet in which tags and

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.540
HTML formats are used to described
data elements within web pages.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.779
While it is more verbose, memory and
disk space are now inexpensive.

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.028
It is more human readable, and
of course, still machine readable, and

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:13.200
it's easily rendered in a browser.
