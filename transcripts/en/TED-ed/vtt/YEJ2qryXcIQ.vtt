00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.696
This is a crystal of sugar.

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.486
If you press on it, it will actually
generate its own electricity.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.796
How can this simple crystal 
act like a tiny power source?

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:20.386
Because sugar is piezoelectric.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.147
Piezoelectric materials 
turn mechanical stress,

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:24.327
like pressure,

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:25.190
sound waves,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.247
and other vibrations

00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:28.746
into electricity and vice versa.

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:30.647
This odd phenomenon was first
discovered

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:34.966
by the physicist Pierre Curie 
and his brother Jacques in 1880.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.417
They discovered that if they compressed
thin slices of certain crystals,

00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:43.018
positive and negative charges would appear
on opposite faces.

00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:45.156
This difference in charge, or voltage,

00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:48.927
meant that the compressed crystal
could drive current through a circuit,

00:00:48.927 --> 00:00:50.487
like a battery.

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.718
And it worked the other way around, too.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.877
Running electricity through these crystals
made them change shape.

00:00:56.877 --> 00:00:57.978
Both of these results,

00:00:57.978 --> 00:01:00.769
turning mechanical energy into electrical,

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.157
and electrical energy into mechanical,

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:04.699
were remarkable.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.146
But the discovery went uncelebrated
for several decades.

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:11.148
The first practical application
was in sonar instruments

00:01:11.148 --> 00:01:14.648
used to detect German submarines
during World War I.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:17.460
Piezoelectric quartz crystals 
in the sonar's transmitter

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.459
vibrated when they were subjected
to alternating voltage.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.949
That sent ultrasound waves
through the water.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.179
Measuring how long it took these waves
to bounce back from an object

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.850
revealed how far away it was.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.528
For the opposite transformation,

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.009
converting mechanical energy 
to electrical,

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.829
consider the lights that turn on
when you clap.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.539
Clapping your hands send sound vibrations
through the air

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.188
and causes the piezo element to bend
back and forth.

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:46.880
This creates a voltage that can drive
enough current to light up the LEDs,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.420
though it's conventional sources 
of electricity that keep them on.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.629
So what makes a material piezoelectric?

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:55.750
The answer depends on two factors:

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.590
the materials atomic structure,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.970
and how electric charge
is distributed within it.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.690
Many materials are crystalline,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.499
meaning they're made of atoms or ions

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.630
arranged in an orderly 
three-dimensional pattern.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.270
That pattern has a building block
called a unit cell

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.730
that repeats over and over.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.561
In most non-piezoelectric 
crystalline materials,

00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.611
the atoms in their unit cells
are distributed symmetrically

00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:20.474
around a central point.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:23.953
But some crystalline materials
don't possess a center of symmetry

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:27.102
making them candidates 
for piezoelectricity.

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:28.515
Let's look at quartz,

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.982
a piezoelectric material 
made of silicon and oxygen.

00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:36.721
The oxygens have a slight negative charge
and silicons have a slight positive,

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.252
creating a separation of charge,

00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:41.142
or a dipole along each bond.

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:43.572
Normally, these dipoles 
cancel each other out,

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:46.593
so there's no net separation of charge
in the unit cell.

00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:49.574
But if a quartz crystal is squeezed
along a certain direction,

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:51.383
the atoms shift.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:54.134
Because of the resulting asymmetry
in charge distribution,

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.626
the dipoles no longer cancel
each other out.

00:02:56.626 --> 00:03:00.457
The stretched cell ends up
with a net negative charge on one side

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:03.133
and a net positive on the other.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.283
This charge imbalance is repeated
all the way through the material,

00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:09.937
and opposite charges collect
on opposite faces of the crystal.

00:03:09.937 --> 00:03:13.874
This results in a voltage that can
drive electricity through a circuit.

00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:16.914
Piezoelectric materials can 
have different structures.

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:21.517
But what they all have in common is unit
cells which lack a center of symmetry.

00:03:21.517 --> 00:03:24.354
And the stronger the compression
on piezoelectric materials,

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:26.744
the larger the voltage generated.

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:29.964
Stretch the crystal, instead,
and the voltage will switch,

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.244
making current flow the other way.

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:35.725
More materials are piezoelectric
than you might think.

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:36.664
DNA,

00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:37.395
bone,

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:38.274
and silk

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:42.426
all have this ability to turn
mechanical energy into electrical.

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:45.896
Scientists have created a variety
of synthetic piezoelectric materials

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:49.334
and found applications for them
in everything from medical imaging

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:51.536
to ink jet printers.

00:03:51.536 --> 00:03:54.845
Piezoelectricity is responsible for 
the rhythmic oscillations

00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:57.985
of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time,

00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.846
the speakers of musical birthday cards,

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:03.005
and the spark that ignites the gas 
in some barbecue grill lighters

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:05.116
when you flick the switch.

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:08.347
And piezoelectric devices may become
even more common

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:12.987
since electricity is in high demand
and mechanical energy is abundant.

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:15.936
There are already train stations
that use passengers' footsteps

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.478
to power the ticket gates and displays

00:04:18.478 --> 00:04:22.097
and a dance club where piezoelectricity
helps power the lights.

00:04:22.097 --> 00:04:25.348
Could basketball players running back
and forth power the scoreboard?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.668
Or might walking down the street
charge your electronic devices?

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:31.236
What's next for piezoelectricity?
