00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:15.949
Voiceover: Three years
prior to the making of this

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.952
painting, Pollock was working
on a small easel painting.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:22.045
He had struggled on it for a
while, and he decided to take

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.225
that painting off the easel,
place it on the floor, and then

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.458
pour some paint on the
surface to finish it.

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.032
&gt;From this deceptively simple
decision, an entire set

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:33.767
of creative possibilities
opened up to Pollock, and he

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.671
spent the next five years of
his career exploring them.

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.341
Now, in the studio, let's see
exactly how Pollock worked.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.578
Placing the canvas on the floor,
Pollock no longer remained

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.042
in physical contact with
the canvas while painting.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.350
Instead of using conventional
artist brushes to push

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.587
or smear liquid paint across
the surface of the painting,

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.815
Pollock now used things
like sticks, even turkey

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:00.660
basters or dried paint
brushes, hard as a rock,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.897
that he variously
dripped, drizzled, poured,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.334
or splashed paint onto
the canvas below him from.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.669
Pollock used very fluid
alkyd enamel paints,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.438
the kind of paint you
could paint your car with,

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.775
the kind of paint you could
paint your radiator with.

00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:15.776
Because the paint was so
fluid, Pollock essentially

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:19.078
drew in space, so that
drawing elements would

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.815
happen quite literally in
the air, before falling down

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.118
to the canvas below, sometimes
thick, sometimes thin.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:27.354
A rhythm of poured paint would develop

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.156
across the surface of the painting.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.924
Now, if you know that
the painting was painted

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.893
on the floor, if you
know that the paint has

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.963
a very low viscosity, you
can very easily imagine

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.998
the kind of physical
activities that would go into

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.833
the making of this type of painting.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.235
Art historians, at the
time, coined this kind

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:45.172
of painting, action painting,
because of this very

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.340
idea that you could
imagine quite viscerally

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.554
the actions that went into
the making of the painting.

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:52.279
Now, specifically, we're talking about

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:54.281
the actions of almost a dancer.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.782
You can imagine Pollock's feet

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.250
shuffling around the painting.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.252
You can imagine rotations of the elbow

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.755
and of the shoulder, variously launching

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.992
or slowly drizzling paint
onto the canvas below.

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:08.061
For Pollock, the drama
of making this painting

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.097
on the floor meant that
not only physically but

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.767
emotionally he could be
in the painting, stepping

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.536
into the canvas, but also
losing himself in almost

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:21.074
this trance-like or zone-like
type of painting process.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.276
Looking at the paint
below you on the surface

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.445
of the canvas, reacting
to it, and adjusting

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:29.149
whatever gestures you have
to create this painting.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.952
Now, traditionally in
painting, people would

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.634
compose one shape
according to another one.

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.723
A little bit of red here,
according to a little bit

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.260
of blue there, according to
a lot of yellow over here.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.528
Well, for Pollock, he threw that

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.663
out the window, as he did so many things.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:48.401
Rather, Pollock is composing
one line in juxtaposition

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.605
with another one, and
not in any haphazard way,

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:55.175
but rather in an all over
way, and this all-overness,

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.878
if you will, becomes key for Pollock.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.546
Since looking at this painting, there's no

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.251
one spot for your eye to rest.

00:03:02.251 --> 00:03:04.485
Traditionally, line had
been used quite literally

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:06.920
to delineate forms, to draw the outlines

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.056
of forms, which would be filled in.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.057
You can imagine landscape paintings.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.461
The lines define the
mountains, clouds, and so on.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.830
Well, here the line is
not defining anything.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.266
Line becomes here autonomous,
and for the first time

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:21.401
is liberated from its historical role in

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.337
painting of describing other shapes.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.474
In 1950, the drama of
making this painting was

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.844
actually captured by a
photographer and film maker,

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:33.346
so that the performance
of making this painting

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.680
captured the public's
imagination as never before.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.385
Not only that, but other
artists were profoundly

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.454
influenced by this radically
new way of working,

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.090
not only painters, but,
well, performance artists

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.760
can be traced back to
this very very formative

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.331
moment, very important moment
in American art history.
