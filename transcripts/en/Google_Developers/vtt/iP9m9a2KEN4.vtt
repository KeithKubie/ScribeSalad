JOHNNY LEE: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.420
Hi.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.520
It's great to be here.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.810
My name is Johnny Lee, and
I'm excited to give you

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.750
an update on where we
are with Project Tango.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.040
For those of you who are less
familiar with Project Tango,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.650
one of the core beliefs and
ideas behind this project

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.180
is the fact that, when we place
our mobile phones on a table,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.360
they don't actually
understand the things that

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.280
are around them.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.570
They don't understand
the extents of the table

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.557
or the room that they are in.

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:37.140
In fact, almost all
of the information

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.070
that they provide
us is constrained

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.540
to this little
rectangle you see here.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.100
They don't understand if we're
relaxing at home with family,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
or if we're in our
workspace collaborating

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.460
with our coworkers,
or in a large lecture

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.160
hall such as this, all
facing in the same direction,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.060
or having a nice intimate
dinner with friends and family.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.500
And what we do heavily
depends on where we are.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.580
How we feel, how we talk,
how we share information

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.960
with each other all depend
on this context of where.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.880
And so rather than try to force
our entire lives into this very

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.160
small rectangle, what
Project Tango is trying

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.560
to strive for is we're
developing the hardware

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.500
and software technologies
to help everything

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.600
and everyone understand
precisely where they are,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.480
anywhere.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.910
Not just where there's good GPS
coverage, good Wi-Fi coverage,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.170
or Bluetooth beacons, but
any building, any space,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
anywhere where we can
go, the devices and tools

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.340
that we use also share this
understanding of space.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.490
So last year we introduced
our Project Tango Tablet

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.630
Development Kit.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.480
And this was the
first mobile device

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.320
with the sensors and
software to start

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.280
to work toward this journey.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.270
It includes a 4 megapixel
2 micron camera,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.350
integrated motion tracking
camera, and an integrated depth

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.090
sensor.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.880
And all of these sensors
combined with the Project Tango

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.440
software stack allow
devices to understand

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.200
the physical movement
of the device, as well

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.710
as its surroundings.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.942
If you actually look at
the-- although we announced

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:26.400
the tablet over a year ago, if
you actually look at the GFX

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.590
Bench, which is very
popular graphics

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.520
benchmark for mobile devices,
using the Manhattan 3.0 test,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.050
the Project Tango devices still
rank among the highest marks

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.350
with regard to
processor performance

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.540
of ARM-based devices.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.380
We're also really happy to
share that since we started--

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.090
since last year, we've also
started shipping our dev kits,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.340
and 3,000 units are in the
field in the hands of developers

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.010
working on hundreds of apps.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.950
In a partnership with NASA,
we are also able to have two

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.950
of our devices,
early prototypes,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.710
shipped up to the International
Space Station atop

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.560
a 530,000-pound Antares
rocket from orbital sciences.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.360
This collaboration
and partnership

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.990
is allowing NASA researchers
to use the technology in Tango

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.080
to one day help robots
potentially autonomously

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.020
navigate the space station.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.130
So what happens when you
have devices that actually

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.296
have this sensing capability?

00:03:26.296 --> 00:03:27.920
Well there's a few
different categories

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.830
that we think are really
interesting, one of which

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.700
is indoor navigation.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.260
You can imagine
our devices one day

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.476
not just being able to
take you to the front door

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:37.850
of a building,
but could actually

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.135
navigate you all the way
to the door of the room

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:42.050
that you wanted to get to.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.020
There's a project inside
of Google starting

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.990
to use Project Tango
devices to explore

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.440
helping the visually-impaired
navigate indoor spaces.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.740
You can also use the tracking
and spatial reasoning

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.750
of the device to transform
parts of your home

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.080
into a game environment.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.510
So I can build a castle
in my living room

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.980
and build a forest
in my bedroom.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.907
And of course, there's
emerging new areas

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:07.490
that are all starting
to get exciting,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.520
such as robotics, AR and VR,
which are all potentially

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.270
enabled by the 3D-tracking
capabilities in Tango, as well.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.279
So to give you a briefing,
the core technologies

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.410
of a Project Tango device
and the software stack

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.550
that goes on top of
it break into three

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.690
different categories.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.090
The first is motion
tracking, the second

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.310
is area learning, and
lastly, depth perception.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.930
So motion tracking is actually
very similar to your computer

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.650
mouse.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.200
If you imagine taking your mouse
and putting it on the table,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.560
as you move it around
on the flat surface,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.140
it tells you the
relative position

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.700
you are when you
put it on the table.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.440
Project Tango devices
are very similar.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.200
When you first start
your app, it'll

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.600
tell you your relative
motion relative to when

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.720
the app started.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.020
But instead of just
being constrained to 2D,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.850
it actually is full 3D.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.600
You get X, Y, Z, as well as
three degrees of rotation.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.240
The second major concept
is area learning.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.840
And if you imagine
closing your eyes,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.720
you actually have sort
of a mental memory

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.040
of the shape of Moscone.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.040
You know roughly where
you are in this building.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.580
You know roughly
how big the room

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.520
is, as well as your own
location within this room.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.430
And it is that memory that
we call area learning.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.270
So when a Project Tango
device enters a space

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.040
that it's previously been in, as
it starts to explore the space,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.840
it will build a map.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.180
And when it recognizes a
landmark it's seen before,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.540
it can localize itself to
the rest of the building.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.470
And that's called area learning.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.210
The last major concept that
Project Tango devices provide

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.550
is depth perception.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.620
So in Project
Tango-compliant devices,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.320
we include a depth
sensor that uses

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.870
infrared signals to measure the
distance to points in space.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.630
This allows us to detect the
floor, the walls, and furniture

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.180
in the environment,
and potentially

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.520
allows your application or game
to respond to the user's space.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.710
Now over the past year, we've
made a ton of improvements

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.170
to the software stack.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.980
And this is just a few of them.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.880
This has been done
in collaboration

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.490
with some of our
early access partners

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.930
that we gave devices
to, and we really

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.640
appreciated their
feedback as we've

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.540
continued to push and push
the features of the system.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.400
Now unfortunately,
due to time, there's

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.720
no way I could actually
talk through all of these.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.680
So instead, I'm
going to show you

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.770
a short video that illustrates
some of these capabilities

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.905
in action.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:42.920
Could we dim the lights?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.419
Thanks.

00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:52.173
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:45.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:50.230
JOHNNY LEE: It's pretty
neat stuff, isn't it?

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.530
And it's all working in real
time on our tablet development

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.170
kits.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.550
Some of those videos
are very early

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.630
proof-of-concepts in
our lab, and so we're

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.400
happy to sort of share the
results as we develop them.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.240
Now because a lot of these
actually run in real time,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.170
I actually do want to try to
demo this stuff for you live.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.525
So we can switch
over to the tablet.

00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:13.025
Great.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.720
So what we have here
is a diagnostic screen

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.030
that just shows off kind of
what's going on under the hood.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.100
Again, we have our-- this is
the raw image from the motion

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.120
tracking camera.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.267
This is a wide-angle
camera that gives us

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:32.600
a large view of the environment.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.110
In fact, I can see my
fingers holding the device.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.640
And you see these
green dots that

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.950
are colored in various
different ways.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.460
And these represent the
optical computer vision work

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.560
that's going on that
actually is tracking

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.030
the flow of the image
in the camera scene.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.000
We combine this data with
the gyro and accelerometer

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.820
in a tight sensor
fusion stack to generate

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.760
the plot in the upper right.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.370
So like any mobile device,
they can turn left and right,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.230
and you can see a
response to my movement.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.188
But what's special about
a Project Tango device

00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:09.300
is that I'm able to actually
move with and walk around

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.940
the room.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.010
So if I draw a circle
with the device,

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.000
it continues to track in 3D.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.700
And I can walk off the
stage, and reasonably

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.110
aggressively walk
around and hold it.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.060
And it continues to
track my position

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.730
fairly robustly and accurately.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.790
So again, I could just
unplug the HDMI cable.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.960
I'm actually
tethered by this wire

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.690
so you guys can see
what's on the screen.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.420
But this would
allow a user to walk

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.010
around their entire house
or the entire building

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.400
and continue to have
full 3D tracking.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.660
Now I want to show you just
a couple of simple demos

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.740
just using the motion
tracking capability.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.030
So this is a quick test demo.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.790
It's sort of an homage to some
very popular world building

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.920
applications.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.910
And all I'm doing is I'm-- yeah.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.200
What's here is a
simple open grid.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.550
And you can see I have
this radical in the middle.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.400
And all I have to do
is move the device,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.580
and it controls the virtual
camera inside of Unity.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.320
If I use the tablet, I
can point at the ground

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.890
and push this Add button,
which will place a block.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.890
And if I add a
few more blocks, I

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.830
can start building
the foundation,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.290
a little plot of land to
build a small building.

00:12:35.352 --> 00:12:36.810
So you can see it's
pretty natural.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.420
All I had to do was just use
it like a camera controller.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.820
And I bring up this
menu, and I can

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.020
build bricks-- I can choose
bricks to build a little ground

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.870
line, like this.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.506
And I'm just pointing with the
tablet and hitting the button.

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:56.255
And I can actually
control it quite nicely

00:12:56.255 --> 00:12:59.120
and precisely quite quickly.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.860
So I'm placing
pillars for windows.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.440
Let me add a roof line.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.170
OK, so now I have
my walls built.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.270
And let me build a
little wooden roof.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.140
There we go.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.980
So just in a few--
about a minute

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.890
or so, I was able to build
this little structure that's

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.590
located here in the middle the
screen-- middle of the stage.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.000
And I can walk to left
and right and look at it

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.280
from different angles.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.730
And because I have full
six-degree freedom tracking,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.060
if I want to I can just
lean in and actually

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.234
go inside the house, like this.

00:13:47.234 --> 00:13:51.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.830
So I picked a stone
brick, and now I

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.000
can start decorating
the inside of the house.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.700
I did make kind
of a small house,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.209
so I can't do a whole lot in it.

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:07.750
But the neat thing about it is
that this building is actually

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.090
here in the middle the stage.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.230
If I come over here to
this part and I'm here,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.160
I can build a small tower.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.687
And these objects are actually
physically located in space.

00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:21.770
So you can imagine if I
actually had a multiplayer

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.770
version of this, I could build
with my brother or my sister

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.780
or my friend sort of in
a collaborative manner,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.694
and we could all be using
physical space in the same way

00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:31.735
as if I were stacking with
real physical objects.

00:14:36.436 --> 00:14:37.810
One of the things
we wanted to do

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.810
is make sure that working
with the Tango tablets

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.170
were actually very
easy for people

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.250
who already had 3D assets.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.260
So Other World is
a game developer

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.820
that we helped--
or we asked to see

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.490
if they'd be willing to port
a game that they already had,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.250
which was based inside of
Unity, to the Tango platform.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.500
And if you use the SDK,
it's actually quite simple.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.700
Within a matter
of a couple hours,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.140
you can take a 3D asset in
Unity game you already have

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.940
and make it Tango-enabled.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.350
So this is a world
where I have to help

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.610
the ship dodge these enemies.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.700
And in a normal game, you
would-- in a normal device,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.070
you would either tap
the screen to rotate

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.450
where you are on the
planet or rotate your head

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.502
with a gyroscope.

00:15:23.502 --> 00:15:25.710
But because we have full
six-degree freedom tracking,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.230
I can actually walk around
and look at the planet

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.042
from different sides.

00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:32.770
If I want to go
above the planet,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.320
I can dodge these
crystals and sort of

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.930
navigate him through
this space as

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.260
if this globe was
floating in front of me

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.380
and about two or
three feet away.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.630
I can also back up and
start throwing asteroids

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.280
from the planet, just by
touching the asteroid belt.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.710
So this is just a
demonstration of how

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.860
you might enable six-degree
freedom input into existing

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.440
game assets.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.720
The other thing that we've
been asked by our developer

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.040
community was
being able to bring

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.320
in geometry of the real
world into the game engine.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.160
So part of the
sample code that we

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.340
have on Project Tango
website is this app,

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.320
which is called Mesh Builder.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.150
And what it's doing is
actually using the depth sensor

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.120
combined with the 3D
tracking to do a real-time 3D

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.590
scan of the stage.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:34.570
So I have this small table
here with this basket.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.080
And you can see, as I
walk around the stage,

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:42.160
it's actually progressively
building this mesh.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.520
And because this is all running
real time inside of Unity,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.420
I can throw balls
on it, and we're

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.280
updating the physics
in real time as well.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.600
So this basket is actually
a little bit too small

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.030
for these balls, so let me take
this one away and give myself

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.650
a slightly more generous
basket right there.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.580
So let me clear
this and rescan it.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.470
And you can see it kind
of has the larger basket.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.040
It's progressively
building itself in.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.501
Now if I back up, I can
try to play basketball.

00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:19.260
Come on.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.140
Yeah!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:23.919
Yeah!

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:28.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.280
So with a little bit
of additional help

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.100
and some procedural
game geometry,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.080
you could actually turn this
table into a plateau or a mesa.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.980
You could actually literally
have someone building

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.579
a set of cushions
with their couch,

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:45.120
and you could turn
that into a castle

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.640
and have your characters
actually run around furniture.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.120
When we first got
this working, we

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.999
were like taping up
blankets in our office

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:53.540
and using them as
ramps for the ball.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.910
Another simple
utility that we've

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.870
been asked for with
the sensors that you

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.910
can do-- with the sensors that
we have in a Tango device--

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.780
is being able to simply
measure the environment.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.930
So imagine we are
shopping for a new table,

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.160
or I have a new bed that I
want to move into the space.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.630
We can use the tracking
sens-- we can use the tracking

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.030
data, as well as the 3D
sensing data, to give us

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.280
a simple visual tape measure.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.500
So for example, if I want to
measure the size of this table,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:38.040
I simply use this crosshair,
point it at the table-- whoop,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.650
let me try that again.

00:18:42.884 --> 00:18:43.550
Do it down here.

00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:47.271
OK.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.840
So that gives us a rough
measurement of the environment

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.180
between those two points.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.160
All I had to do was point the
device like it's a cursor,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.600
and I can see the distance
between these two corners,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.250
and come over here, and
just by pushing this button,

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.090
we get a rough measurement of
the footprint of this table.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.000
The other nice
thing about this is

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.430
that you don't have to be
constrained to flat surfaces.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.910
If I am trying to,
say, park a truck where

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.720
I have all my furniture
still inside of it

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.420
and I'm trying to figure out
if I can get through this gap,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:28.000
I can measure from this table--
from this podium to this wall,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.008
and it'll give us a measurement
in free space, just like that.

00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:36.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.630
So there's a variety of
professional applications

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.700
you could already
start with imagining

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.750
being able to make use of this
technology and capability.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.700
The last demo I want to
show you is from a partner

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.100
called [? Invive ?].

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.870
And what they do
is they specialize

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.520
in product visualizations.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.335
They do high-end
apartment complexes,

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.690
they do products such as
cars and refrigerators.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.210
And so we had been
working with them,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.750
and they have this
simple car visualizer.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.840
I need to actually
point in this direction

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.297
so that we can actually
place a car on the stage.

00:20:17.297 --> 00:20:18.880
Let me actually pick
it up and move it

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.320
so it's not touching the table.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.150
There we go.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.710
So I can simply walk
around this car.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.220
Because it's such
a-- it's actually

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.180
a full-size metric
car, it actually

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.060
doesn't quite fit on the stage.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:38.600
So I'm going to use the power
of software and shrink the car.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.110
There we go.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.020
OK.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.210
So now it's almost
toy-sized now,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.460
but I can sort of look around.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.670
I can look at the wheels,
I can double tap the hood

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.410
and it'll open up the engine.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.550
I can get up close to
the engine and talk

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:56.540
about the different
parts inside of it.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.680
The respirator, the
carburetor, the engine hood.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.370
Obviously, you can
do customizations

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.090
to the visualizer, such
as making it a nice racing

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.880
red, or a midnight blue.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.080
I think I can also go and
do body upgrades, which

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.420
I'll show different parts of the
car that I can edit and modify.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.500
So let me just select the
roof and give it an upgrade.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.620
And just for good
measure, let me scale it

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.120
back up to normal size,
which will actually

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.990
allow me to get in the car.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.720
But there's not quite
enough stage space,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.610
so I'm just going to go
right through the windshield.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.390
But here I can actually
see the in-car dashboard,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.530
the steering wheel, the seats.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:56.120
If I want to, I can adjust
the interior styles, as well,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.110
[INAUDIBLE] colors.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.005
So this is just
another simple example

00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:02.760
of our Unity integration.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.680
And we started improving the
AR quality of performance,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.230
the registration.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.680
And again, it's important
to realize that this is all

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.920
using motion tracking.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.490
There's no pre-existing
map of the stage,

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.760
and we could easily do
this in any environment,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.230
including your home or a
show room or a retail space.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.742
OK, so those are the demos.

00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:32.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:35.005
Could we go back to the laptop?

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.260
A couple other demos
that I unfortunately

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.350
can't do on stage, or it's
very difficult to demonstrate,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.770
is, of course, things like VR.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.250
VR has obviously made a lot
of news and press recently,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.410
and the [? sixth-off ?] tracking
and positioning that Project

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.270
Tango enables is
interesting for VR.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.280
So we started exploring docking
these tablets to your face

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.950
using the Durovis dive helmets.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.580
Durovis is a
partner that creates

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.680
these plastic shells for
different sized mobile devices.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.990
It's obviously not the most
ergonomically-friendly form

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.520
factor.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.430
And these tablets were
not designed for VR.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.920
They have high
latency, they don't

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.461
have quite the right
rendering stack.

00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:19.490
But from a sensor and
tracking standpoint,

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.850
they seem to be performing
relatively well.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.020
So if you have time, you can
go out to our sandbox area

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.180
and you could experience
this village scene in VR.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.070
You can look on
the ground and get

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.250
sort of to the ground
level of the people

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.010
and look around the
different bases.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.860
We also have a prototype
of doing multi-user VRs.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.670
Because we have fully
self-contained devices,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.367
having multiple people
in the same space

00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:45.700
is largely a matter of just
getting the Wi-Fi connection

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.896
working and having positions
shared among each other.

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:51.020
The great thing about this
is that you can actually

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.480
put on the helmet and you
can see each other in VR

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.160
and have an actual conversation.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:01.197
The mouths actually move to
your vocal-- to the sound.

00:24:01.197 --> 00:24:03.030
If you are on the sandbox
area, you probably

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.970
also saw one of this.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.190
This is a prototype that
we built with Hasbro.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.300
They have the NERF brand guns.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.530
And what they did is
they built a 3D mount

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.642
that goes on the rail
system of the gun,

00:24:14.642 --> 00:24:16.600
and you just put a Project
Tango-enabled device

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.520
and it allows you to
actually run around

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.440
the room in a
first-person shooter.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.690
You can turn and shoot the
enemies from left to right,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.740
but you can also move and duck
behind the boxes in the space.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.270
It's a lot of fun
to actually play,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.250
and so I encourage you
to try this one out.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.760
So we're really excited
and proud to have

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.630
a large number of
partners that have helped

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.190
us mature this platform, both
from a software and hardware

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.190
standpoint.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.410
And we hope to grow this
networking community

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.390
with hopefully some of
you in this audience we

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.190
can add to this list.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.480
So Project Tango devices
we feel enable a new form

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.820
of digital playground.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.460
We can put virtual objects in
the same physical space that's

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.330
meaningful to people.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.620
We can actually
navigate you to the item

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.490
that you're really
interested in a space

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.160
that you've perhaps
never been before.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.740
We can also help
you make decisions

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.210
about where to go
in play areas where

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.760
GPS may not be good enough.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.780
We can enable you to not only
create 3D stories that you

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.640
could look around by
turning your head,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.747
but you can actually
get up and walk through.

00:25:22.747 --> 00:25:24.580
And I think this is an
interesting dimension

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.790
that we're only starting
to-- we're only beginning

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.520
to explore as a community.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.910
Obviously, we're
all very excited

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.016
about the emergence
and maturity of AR.

00:25:35.016 --> 00:25:37.760
And 3D tracking and
registration is a core component

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.800
of making a good
user experience.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.010
And when you combine
that tracking ability

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.300
with information
about the environment,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.690
you can actually see beyond the
physical limits of your space.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.514
And we also know about
robotics and drones.

00:25:52.514 --> 00:25:53.930
And I know I've
been an enthusiast

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.505
and bought one of these
myself, but I also crashed it

00:25:56.505 --> 00:25:58.530
in the first 30 minutes.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.720
So onboard mobile 3D positional
tracking and 3D sensing

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.750
is important for things
like collision avoidance

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.640
and autonomy.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.810
So we also see the
technology in these devices

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.760
being relevant to
this domain, as well.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.880
So this is our Project
Tango Development Kit,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.510
with a high-performance 2
micron, 4 megapixel camera,

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.840
motion tracking camera,
integrated depth sensing,

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.530
the Tegra K1 processor with
128 gigabytes of storage

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.000
and 4 gigabytes of RAM, which
is on par with a lot of laptops.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.940
And before we had to
request that developers

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.790
apply on our website
to get one of these.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.100
So there was a relatively
limited distribution.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.600
But we're actually
happy to announce

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.200
that earlier this week
we opened up purchasing

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.690
to anyone in the United States,
with international locations

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.460
coming soon.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.775
We're also happy to say
that we are offering these

00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:57.277
at a reduced price of $512.

00:26:57.277 --> 00:26:58.860
Given the actual
specs of this device,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.360
this is actually a pretty
aggressive price point.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.870
To celebrate this new
availability of the devices,

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.180
we are also kicking off our
first app development contest.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.870
So this is an effort to seed
app development and seed

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.570
content on our platform.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.910
There's three categories
to the contest.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.310
You can choose to
build a utility

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.910
app, such as measurement,
navigation, room scanning,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.180
or object scanning.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.310
We have a category for
AR and VR use cases.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.650
And of course, gaming and
entertainment, which I think

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.780
is one of the ones that's very
easy to imagine seeing demos

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.370
in this space.

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:40.910
We have seed money for each
milestone for each category,

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.330
which exponentially increases.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:48.450
So 16 selected proposals
will get $1,024.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.510
Four selected working
prototypes after that milestone,

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.210
they'll get up to $2,048.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.310
And then each category
will have one final app

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.220
selected with $4,096.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.590
Once all the final apps
have been submitted,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:06.310
we'll have a user-driven
contest-wide grand prize

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.100
of $8,192.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.310
All told, together this
is a total cash awards

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.060
up to $95,000.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.380
And we hope this won't be
the last contest we run.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.594
So proposal entries start
today, and for deadline--

00:28:21.594 --> 00:28:23.510
the first deadline that
you should be aware of

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.190
is June 25th, which is a
deadline for proposals.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.742
The final APK entry will have to
be submitted by September 23rd.

00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:34.200
To find out more information
about how to enter the contest

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.280
and details, please visit our
Project Tango Google+ community

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.870
page.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.330
So $95,000 to help seed the
app development community.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.074
And we hope this helps bring
up and surface new partners

00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:48.990
that we actually want
to work with more deeply

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.573
and make a stronger
relationship with.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.560
We are really excited about the
tech inside of Project Tango,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.270
and we hope that one day it
can be as ubiquitous as GPS.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.490
But we also know
that-- before we

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.700
used to be fine with phones
that didn't have GPS.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.060
We knew how to get
from home to work,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.200
we knew how to get to our
restaurants just fine.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.200
But now we wouldn't even
consider buying a phone

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.430
without navigation directions.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.200
And I think-- we believe
that the technology

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.220
inside of Project
Tango would enable

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.920
this sort of feeling as well.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:28.300
But we also know that, to
become ubiquitous as GPS,

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.742
tablets are necessarily
the best form factor.

00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:33.200
I'll be the first to admit that
a seven inch tablet doesn't

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.810
really fit in my pocket.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.600
And we'd love to be able to
have people carry this around

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.091
with them all the time.

00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:41.340
And so that's why we're also
excited to announce today

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.089
a new partnership.

00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:47.900
And that's with Qualcomm.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.770
Qualcomm is the largest
manufacturer of mobile phone

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.620
processors today, and
we've been working

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.036
with them over the
past few months

00:29:54.036 --> 00:29:56.480
to try to incorporate the
Project Tango technologies

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.880
onto their chipsets.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.940
And this is with great support
from Raj Talluri, Senior Vice

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.360
President at Qualcomm, who is
right here in the audience.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.139
Do you want to
stand up and say hi?

00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:07.453
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:07.453 --> 00:30:07.953
Thanks.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.320
We first met Raj
earlier this year,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.400
and we sat down and
talked about the future

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.030
of Project Tango and
our goals and the future

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.100
of mobile computing.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.610
And we both agreed.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.500
And we agreed that computer
vision and 3D tracking

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.240
was going to be an essential
part of new mobile experiences

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.690
from indoor navigation to VR,
AR, and potentially robotics.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.850
And we understood that
to actually achieve

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.390
the price and power
and performance

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.530
requirements of these new,
demanding applications required

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:44.020
developing new hardware
and new software.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.990
And so we've been working with
very tightly with Qualcomm

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.850
engineers to modify their mobile
development platform, or MDP,

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.920
to incorporate
Project Tango sensors.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.960
So this is a modified version
of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 MDP

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.160
platform.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.690
We've incorporated it with
the motion tracking camera,

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.710
a new depth sensing camera,
which is time-of-flight based,

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.260
from a partner called
PMD Technologies, an RGB

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.610
camera, and timestamped
gyro and accelerometer.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.950
And these are all of the
things that you need in order

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.470
to support the software's
experiences that we

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.250
want to do on this hardware.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.160
So these MDP platforms
are the reference designs

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.050
provided to device
manufacturers to accelerate

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.470
the design of their
next generation phones

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.160
using Qualcomm chipsets.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.170
So by working with Qualcomm
and building these devices,

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.190
we cannot only optimize
Project Tango software

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.470
to the Snapdragon chipset, we
can also accelerate the rate

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.800
of adoption in mobile phones.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.820
Now it's important to remember
that these are engineering

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.800
reference designs,
so there's not

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.380
a plan to manufacture a
large quantity of these.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.950
The best platform right now
that you can purchase today

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.960
is the Project Tango tablet.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.070
But these will be given to OEMs
as well as software developers

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.290
to optimize some of
their applications

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.210
to the Snapdragon chipset.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.050
We're really excited
about this partnership,

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.310
because we believe it's a
large milestone in being

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.090
able to bring this technology
to the pockets of millions

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.070
and billions of users.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.500
So we're excited
about this future.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.730
So today, you can now purchase
a Project Tango Development Kit

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.610
and actually start writing
apps as early as next week.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.030
We hope to see what people
can do with this platform.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.110
We've started a contest
to enable the applications

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.720
that we'll see
tomorrow, and we hope

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.470
to find new partners that we
can engage in more deeply.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.950
And we're continuing
to invest heavily

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.420
in the software and
hardware required

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.400
to take this technology into
more form factors, including

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.470
the mobile phone and beyond.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.140
So this is an investment
in things to come.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.760
We see the exciting things
that technology is developing,

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.630
and we believe the future
is genuinely awesome

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.300
if we can work
together and bring

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.040
this technology to people.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:14.950
Thank you very much.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.902
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.140
It does look like we have about
six minutes for questions,

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.553
if anyone has any.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.207
Oh, I think it's best to
walk up to the microphone

00:33:38.207 --> 00:33:39.290
if you do have a question.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.950
I forgot to mention
we are hiring.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.340
So you can go to our website
and look at our job listings.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.660
The development kits and the
contest information can be

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.692
found on our website
and Google+ page.

00:34:00.692 --> 00:34:02.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.340
About the motion
tracking API, could you

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.800
comment on the accuracy
of the position

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.030
and pose given out by the SDK?

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.280
JOHNNY LEE: Sure.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.510
So when the system is happy,
the accuracy is about 1%.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.040
So with 100 feet of travel,
we drift about one foot.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.790
So it's a function
of distance travel.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.790
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.973
And you can say in percentage.

00:34:25.973 --> 00:34:26.639
JOHNNY LEE: Yes.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.710
It's more accurate to
talk about percentage,

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.889
because if you go a long
distance, it'll change.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:33.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.389
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.440
The contest is open to
all developers worldwide?

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.520
Or only for US?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.095
It is open?

00:34:40.095 --> 00:34:40.850
JOHNNY LEE: Yes.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.683
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:46.267 --> 00:34:46.980
JOHNNY LEE: Oh.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.480
Yeah.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.532
The Qualcomm device is actually
on display in the sandbox area.

00:34:52.532 --> 00:34:53.364
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:34:53.364 --> 00:34:56.889
So one of the demos showed
a user biking into the city

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.320
and then doing the
real time mapping.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.280
So [INAUDIBLE] how
do I deal with being

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.292
used outside and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:04.292 --> 00:35:06.470
JOHNNY LEE: So the
motion tracking camera

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.920
is a visible light imager,
so it works fine indoors

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.010
and outdoors.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:14.870
The positional tracking and all
of the orientation information

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.382
uses just that camera
and the inertial sensor.

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:19.090
So indoors and outdoors
is not a problem.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.345
AUDIENCE: So it can do object
detection outdoors, as well?

00:35:22.345 --> 00:35:25.320
JOHNNY LEE: The tracking
can work outdoors.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.430
The depth sensors
have a harder problem.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.830
So some depth sensors have
more sunlight robustness

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.520
than others, and so depending
on the technology being used,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.800
the outdoor performance of
depth specifically will vary.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.850
And you also mentioned
using the Tango tablet

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.050
for AR and virtual reality.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.840
What would be the latency in
the amount of data coming back

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.005
from [INAUDIBLE] and
back to the application?

00:35:50.005 --> 00:35:51.540
JOHNNY LEE: So
the primary sensor

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.340
that drives a lot of
the frame updates in VR

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.060
is actually the gyro.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.650
As you move your
head, that's the one

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:02.050
that creates the most visual--
significant visual feedback.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.310
So there's no reason why, in
a properly optimized hardware,

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.130
that the gyro
performance would be

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.710
any different from
another VR headset.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.460
But the tablets here are
running stock Android,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.860
and there's not any particular
latency optimizations

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.950
on these devices.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.350
So these devices are around
80 milliseconds or so,

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.140
but as I mentioned,
they're not optimized

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.640
for low-latency performance.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.958
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:36:29.766 --> 00:36:35.680
AUDIENCE: You showed the
screenshot of the multi-user VR

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.980
chat.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.510
How do the-- how does-- how
are the relative positions

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.480
between the multiple
users determined?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.240
JOHNNY LEE: Sure.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.380
So that's a good question.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.320
So each device when
it first boots up

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.790
is its own coordinate frame.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.810
So what we have is the
area description files,

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:58.790
which is the pre-existing
coordinate system for the room.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.590
So by sharing the
area description

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:03.610
file with multiple devices,
either by pushing those

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.550
over the network or by
copying them manually,

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.550
all the devices will boot up
and localize to the same room,

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.050
essentially.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.130
AUDIENCE: And that works by
detecting features in the room

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.030
and, like, mapping it to
that relative to the area

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.930
description file, or?

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:18.680
JOHNNY LEE: Right.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.140
The area description file
is a visual description

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.800
of the environment which
includes features and matches

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.860
in that space.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.400
So just like-- it would be
a description of this room.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.120
And as long as we all shared
the same reference of the room,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.700
we can all adjust
our coordinate system

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.585
to match the coordinate
system of the room.

00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:39.630
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.538
JOHNNY LEE: Yep.

00:37:40.538 --> 00:37:42.621
MALE SPEAKER: We have time
for one final question.

00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:44.440
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:45.840
Two quick questions, please.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.690
JOHNNY LEE: Yep.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.650
AUDIENCE: How good does
it work in large rooms

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.690
with high ceilings, like,
for instance, this room.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.560
If we would like to
map it, the whole room,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.340
the entire whole room,
how accurate could it be?

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.300
JOHNNY LEE: So 1%
is probably still

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.670
the best metric I can provide.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.510
So the further you
are from objects,

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.510
the more ambiguity there
is in the positioning.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.260
So on the stage, while a
large percentage of the room

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.190
was empty, I was still able to
see the content on the stage.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.390
And so this kept my
position accuracy

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.650
on the order of a few
millimeters to a centimeter.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.950
If I went out into the
hallway and only pointed

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.210
at the ceiling, the
area would go up.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.160
But as you walk around and build
more observations of the room,

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.320
it can become more
precise over time.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.280
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:31.780
Thank you.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.340
And the second
question is, is it

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.800
possible to anchor
a specific point

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:43.100
to-- a longtitude/latitude
references to a geolocation?

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.820
JOHNNY LEE: Yes.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.290
So in our indoor navigation
proof-of-concept,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.880
we're currently doing that and
locating our area description

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.680
files.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.890
So that requires some
other reference to say,

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.990
well, I know the
origin of the room.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.715
But where's the origin of
the room on the planet?

00:38:58.715 --> 00:38:59.390
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.681
JOHNNY LEE: So one of the
things we can use, of course,

00:39:01.681 --> 00:39:05.610
is GPS or Wi-Fi, or some other
manual alignment process.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.530
You could also
imagine, over time,

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.760
being able to collect
more area descriptors.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.680
And as we connect more
and more of those,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.080
we have enough GPS- and
Wi-Fi-based constraints

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.202
to give us a global
coordinate system,

00:39:18.202 --> 00:39:20.160
or a global reference to
the coordinate system.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.160
AUDIENCE: So if I anchor,
for instance, a window

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.470
and I tell this is the
latitude-- longtitude/latitude

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.440
of this window, as
I scan the room,

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.550
it could give me the--
automatically reference

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.924
me the other window that should
be the longtitude/latitude

00:39:32.924 --> 00:39:33.590
for that window?

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.270
JOHNNY LEE: Yes.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.230
So you will know your
offset to the window--

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.740
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.156
JOHNNY LEE: And
then you can apply

00:39:38.156 --> 00:39:40.850
the positional coordinate system
of the window to your data set.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:41.960
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.952
JOHNNY LEE: Yep.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.090
Great.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.690
Well, thank you very
much, and I hope

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.280
you guys check out our sandbox.
