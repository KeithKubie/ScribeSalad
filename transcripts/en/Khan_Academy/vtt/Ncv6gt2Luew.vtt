00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:01.917
- [Voiceover] Let h be
the vertical distance

00:00:01.917 --> 00:00:04.901
between the graphs of
f and g and region s.

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:08.442
Find the rate at which h
changes with respect to x

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.226
when x is equal to 1.8.

00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.687
We have region s right over here.

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:17.706
You can't see it that
well since I drew over it.

00:00:17.706 --> 00:00:20.749
And what you see when we're in region s,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.472
the function f is greater
than the function g.

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:26.297
It's above the function g.

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:29.282
We can write h of x,

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:30.812
we could write h of x,

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:33.673
as being equal to f of x

00:00:33.673 --> 00:00:37.307
minus g of x and what we wanna do

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.350
is we wanna find the
rate at which h changes

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.986
with respect to x.

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:44.310
We could write that as h prime of,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.690
we could say h prime of x

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930
but we want the rate
when x is equal to 1.8.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.794
So h prime of 1.8 is
what we wanna figure out.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:54.733
We could evaluate f prime of 1.8

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.311
and g prime of 1.8 and to do that

00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.251
we would take the derivatives of each

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:00.492
of these things and we
know how to do that.

00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.185
It's within our capabilities,
but it's important to realize

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:04.253
when you're taking the AP test

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.668
that you have a calculator
at your disposal.

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:09.211
And a calculator can numerically integrate

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.333
and can numerically evaluate derivatives.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.528
And so when they actually want us

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:17.559
to find the area or evaluate an integral,

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:19.005
where they give the endpoints,

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:20.296
or evaluate a derivative at a point,

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:21.667
well that's a pretty good
sign that you could probably

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:23.526
use your calculator here.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:25.621
And what's extra good about this

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.913
is we have already
essentially inputted h of x

00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:31.107
in the previous steps
and really in part A.

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:33.755
I defined this function here,

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:35.345
and this function is essentially h of x.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.446
I took the absolute value of it

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:39.385
so it's always positive
over either region,

00:01:40.265 --> 00:01:42.415
but I could delete the
absolute value if we want.

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.015
Delete that absolute value,

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:47.268
then I have to get rid of
that parentheses at the end.

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:50.917
Let me delete that.

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:52.655
And so notice this is h of x.

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:53.607
We have our f of x,

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:58.607
which was 1 plus x plus e
to the x squared minus 2x,

00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:02.275
and then from that we subtract g of x.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.885
G of x was a positive x to the
fourth but we're subtracting

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:07.729
so negative x to the fourth,

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.900
let me show you g of x right over here.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.596
G of x is right over here, and notice

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:12.815
we are subtracting it.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:15.171
So the y1, as I've defined
it in my calculator,

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:17.297
and I just pressed this y
equals button right over here,

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:18.702
that is my h of x.

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:21.806
Now I can go back to the other screen,

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:25.233
and I can evaluate its derivative
when x is equal to 1.8.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.614
I go to math.

00:02:26.614 --> 00:02:28.519
I scroll down.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.423
We have n derivative right here

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.750
and so click Enter there.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.602
And then what are we gonna
take the derivative of?

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:39.773
Well the function y sub 1
that I've already defined

00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:40.981
in my calculator.

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.383
I can go to variables, y variables,

00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:47.239
it's already selected function
so I'll just press Enter.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.480
And I'll select the function y sub 1

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.419
that I've already defined.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.324
So I'm taking the derivative of y sub 1.

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:55.692
I'm taking the derivative
with respect to x.

00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:57.665
And I'm going to evaluate that derivative,

00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:00.705
when x is equal to 1.8.

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:01.925
That simple.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.108
And then I click Enter.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:05.048
And there you have it.

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:09.484
It's approximately -3.812.

00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:15.664
So approximately -3.812.

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:18.399
And we're done.

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.104
One thing you might appreciate
from this entire question,

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:23.937
and even the question 1,

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.945
is that they really wanted to make sure

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:28.919
that you understand the
underlying conceptual ideas

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.682
behind derivatives and integrals.

00:03:31.682 --> 00:03:33.968
And if you understand
the conceptual ideas,

00:03:33.968 --> 00:03:36.868
of how do you use them to solve problems,

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.300
and you have your calculator at disposal,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.924
then these are not too hairy,

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:42.479
that these can be done fairly quickly.
