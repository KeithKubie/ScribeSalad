00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.620
Now let's do an ROB Timing quiz. So

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.270
here is again a sequence of instructions and we want to know when they issue,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.440
execute, write, and commit. And we want some comments here.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.960
Now let's say that an add takes one cycle, multiplication takes two cycles, and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.680
divide takes four cycles. And in this processor, we can broadcast one add or

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.449
subtract result from the add subtract unit. And

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.688
one multiplication divide result per cycle. So if both the add unit and

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:34.256
the multiply unit have a result available they can actually broadcast them in

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:39.430
the same cycle. And this processor can also commit up to two instructions per

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.030
cycle. So two instructions can commit in a cycle if both of them can commit.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.840
And we now free our reservation station at dispatch. So

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.910
let's look at what should be happening here.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.700
We know that this instruction issues in cycle one. Begin execution in cycle two.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.450
It will begin execution in cycle two. And then four cycles later in cycle six,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.410
it's going to write the result. And it's going to commit in cycle seven. So

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.400
the question for you is for this multiplication. When does it issue execute,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.850
write and commit? You can write your answers here.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.560
So pretty much what should go here, you should write here, here, here and here.
