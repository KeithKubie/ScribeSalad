EMILY ANTHES: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.840
Thanks so much for coming in the
middle of your work day.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.950
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.810
My name is Emily Anthes, and I'm
a science journalist, and

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.270
I'm here to tell you a little
bit about my new book, which

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.670
is called "Frankenstein's Cat:
Cuddling Up to Biotech's Brave

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.000
New Beasts." The idea for this
book came to me gradually over

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.230
the course of a couple
of years.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.680
I'm a big science geek, and
writing about science is what

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.330
I do for a living, so I spend
a lot of time reading the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.150
science news and the journals
and press releases.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.270
And over the period of several
years, I started noticing more

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.620
and more of these strange
headlines.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.490
I would see things like,
"Scientists Produce

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.800
Glow-in-the-Dark Cats."
"Synthetic biology and the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.900
rise of the spider-goats."
"Robo-rat controlled by brain

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.330
electrodes." And on and on and
on these headlines seem to go.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.830
These headlines and many others
like them made it clear

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.710
to me that science had given us
this whole new toolbox for

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.390
tinkering with life.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.570
We were reshaping animal bodies
in profound new ways,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.890
altering their genetic codes,
rebuilding their broken

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.050
bodies, and supplementing
their natural senses.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.330
So each of these stories was
interesting on their own, but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.320
I began to wonder about
the bigger picture.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.600
We had all these
new tools now.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.690
How and why were
we using them?

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.560
And what did it mean for
animals, and what did it say

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010
about us as humans that
we were making

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.160
these sorts of changes?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.850
So I don't have time to answer
all of these questions in

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.010
detail today, but I thought what
I would do is at least

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.090
give you a glimpse into some
of the things that are now

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.780
becoming possible.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.160
One of the things I learned in
researching this book is that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.180
lots of the developments and
ideas that have traditionally

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.070
been relegated to science
fiction are now, in fact,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.830
quickly becoming reality.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.630
So obviously, when you talk
about animal modification, one

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.610
of the first things that comes
to mind is genetic

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.760
engineering.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.920
And my adventure into the world
of genetic engineering

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.710
actually started not
far from here.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.580
It started at the Petco
over at Union Square.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.180
And I went there because I
wanted to buy myself a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.740
collection of glow
in the dark pets.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.770
It's not as crazy an idea as
it might at first sound.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.700
Scientists, for instance, have
known for many years that

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.770
there are some creatures out
there, particularly marine

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.230
organisms, that happen
to glow naturally.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.960
One of the most famous is this
jellyfish known as the crystal

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.650
jellyfish, and it's famous for
naturally producing what's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.360
known as Green Fluorescent
Protein, or GFP.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.890
This protein absorbs blue
light and re-emits it as

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.310
green, yielding the green
fluorescent ring you see

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.990
around the jellyfish's body.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.930
In the 1990s, scientists managed
to isolate the gene

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.970
that codes for GFP.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.430
And after they did this, they
realized they could start

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.930
moving it around the animal
kingdom, take this GFP gene

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.810
that comes from a jellyfish, and
put it into all sorts of

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.850
other critters.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.580
That leads you to animals
like this.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.330
This is a monkey, and only
one genetic tweak has

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.170
been made to him.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.690
All that scientists have done is
taken this GFP gene and put

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.690
it in his genome.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.090
As a result, his body naturally
turns out these

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.430
green fluorescent proteins, and
under a blacklight, like

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.330
what you see here, he glows
in this eerie way.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.350
This photo has not been
altered at all.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.060
So this kind of technology
is incredibly useful to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.670
biologists, because not only
can they make whole animals

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.150
glow, they can engineer animals
that glow only in

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.360
certain cells or only in certain
tissues or only during

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.730
certain phases of development.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.810
And so by creating these
animals, they get insight into

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.930
biological processes and what's
going on inside the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.640
body of these animals.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.440
So from a scientific
perspective, it's an

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.560
incredibly useful technology.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.110
But about 10 years ago, some
young entrepreneurs thought

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.480
that glowing animals were kind
of cool, and maybe there'd be

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.850
a market for using
this technology

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.260
to create neon pets.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.480
They started with this fish,
known as the zebrafish.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.510
It's an incredibly common
aquarium fish.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.100
You'll see them over at Petco,
most pet stores.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.360
It's a very small
tropical fish.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.750
It normally has these black and
white stripes, which is

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.760
what gives it its name
of zebrafish.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.470
And it's been in use in the
ornamental fish industry for

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.370
many, many decades.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.450
These entrepreneurs decided to
start with these zebrafish and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.920
then to transfer fluorescence
genes into zebrafish embryos.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.960
Not just green fluorescent
protein, but red, orange,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.940
purple, all of the colors
of the rainbow.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.410
When you do this, you turn
zebra fish into these.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.580
These are GloFish.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.370
They are America's first
genetically modified pets.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.240
They have been on the market
since 2004, and they're now

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.540
widely available.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.360
They're sold at most Petcos,
most Petsmarts, Walmarts.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.670
They also come with a range of
accessories, so you can buy a

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.290
special GloFish kit.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.890
It's an aquarium that comes
with blue and blacklights

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.380
built in, so when you turn these
lights on, it really

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.830
brings out the glow
in these fish.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.260
So scientifically, these fish
are not very radical.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.110
Moving fluorescence genes around
is one of the simplest

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.120
kinds of genetic engineering
that scientists do, and it's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.260
very, very common in the lab.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.690
But what's remarkable about
them, and why it was the first

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.610
thing I did as I researched this
book is it's really the

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.290
first biotech animal product
that is widely available to

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.320
the public.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.010
They cost $5.00 or $6.00 a fish,
so anyone who wants to

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.740
can just walk into PetCo or
Walmart and buy themselves a

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.910
whole aquarium full of
these high tech,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.080
next generation pets.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.730
Of course, this is a trivial use
of biotechnology, and the

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.100
company that makes these fish
has been criticized for using

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.750
biotech for frivolous
purposes.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.650
But once you've developed the
technology, it can be used in

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.370
all sorts of ways.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.020
There's a lab in Singapore where
the scientist is doing

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.980
the same thing.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.200
He is transferring

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.140
fluorescence genes into zebrafish.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.220
But he's not creating pets.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.930
What he's trying
to do is create

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.300
living pollution detectors.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.090
He's managed to couple these
fluorescence jeans with

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.590
genetic switches.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.620
So what happens is if these
fish swim in water that's

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.770
contaminated with certain
pollutants, they suddenly

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.600
begin to glow.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.450
They switch from black and
white to these neon fish.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.450
So that's one example of how
you can take this GFP

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.830
technology and use it in
a very applied way.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.860
Over the course of my
adventures, I met some other

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.590
extremely useful genetically
modified animals.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.380
I went out to UC Davis in
California, and met a herd of

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.460
genetically modified goats.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.140
They don't look as interesting
or strange as the fish, but

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.910
they are genetically modified
on the inside.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.780
And these go to been engineered
to produce high

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.940
levels of a compound known as
lysozime in their milk.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.220
Lysozime is a naturally
occurring enzyme, and it has

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.170
antimicrobial properties.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.870
What it does is bursts bacterial
cells like balloons,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.600
essentially, and can be used to
combat e. coli, salmonella,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.230
other sorts of diseases.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.900
The idea is that the milk from
these goats, which is high in

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:24.280
lysozime, could perhaps
be fed to children.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.000
Diarrhoeal disease is not a
huge problem in the US.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.500
It's not something we normally
think of as a serious public

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.590
health concern.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.659
But in many places around the
world, it's a major cause of

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.340
childhood mortality.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.350
So it's not in human
trials yet.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.860
It's still an animal trials.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.210
But so far, this milk does show
some ability to promote

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.160
intestinal health and help
piglets fight off various

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.000
forms of diarrhoeal disease.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.520
The goal would be, eventually,
to take this milk into human

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.530
trials, and perhaps to get these
genetically modified

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.180
goats out in the fields
producing milk

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.800
that anyone can drink.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.720
Of course, you can't talk about
animal biotechnology

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.150
without talking about cloning.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.160
That often comes
up right away.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.610
And as it turns out, a
university in Texas, Texas

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.770
A&amp;M, happens to have become a
leader in animal cloning.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.500
They're an amazing university.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.040
They've cloned six different
species of animals so far, and

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.860
they're working on
cloning more.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.140
And so I went out to meet some
of these clones and talk to

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.630
the scientists there.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.840
While I was there, as an
unexpected bonus, I had the

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.510
chance to meet the world's
first cloned cat.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.440
She was created as part of a
project that began in 2000,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.090
when a billionaire partnered
with some scientists at A&amp;M

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.590
because he wanted to clone
his beloved dog.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.380
When the scientists were talking
to him and working out

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.810
the details of this project,
they realized that there might

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.770
be a market for cloned pets
that went beyond this

00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.330
billionaire--

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.100
that many Americans might want
to clone their pets.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.080
So they decided that together,
they would launch a company

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.450
that would offer commercial
pet cloning services.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.950
They called this company Genetic
Savings &amp; Clone.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.100
One of my other discoveries is
that animal cloners love puns

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.900
and love wordplay, and so it
is all over the field.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.930
This is just one of
many examples.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.930
But when they launched the
company, cats and dogs hadn't

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.620
actually been cloned yet.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.870
So before they started selling
their services, they realized

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.530
they would need to really nail
down the technology and make

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.960
sure that it worked.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.890
What they decided to do
first was try and

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.830
clone a cat named Rainbow.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.070
This is Rainbow.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.730
And the word cloning gets
thrown around a lot.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.550
You see it in headlines and
in short news articles.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.220
But I find that there's not a
lot of discussion about what

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.760
cloning actually means
and how it works.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.570
So this talk isn't too
technical, but if you bear

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.520
with me for a minute, I'd like
to walk you through the

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.820
process of how the scientists
went about

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.670
trying to clone Rainbow.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.730
They started by harvesting
some of Rainbow's cells.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.840
But the trick is, you can't just
take a random cat cell,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.370
like a skin cell from Rainbow,
and pop it into a new cat

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.310
uterus and expect a whole
new cat to grow.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.520
Biology doesn't work that way.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.210
So you need to get the DNA from
Rainbow's cells into the

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.200
proper vehicle, which
is an egg.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.250
So after they harvested cells
from Rainbow, they recruited,

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.340
euphemistically, some
feline egg donors.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.870
They harvested unfertilized eggs
from all sorts of other

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.790
female cats.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.770
Then they used a tiny pipette,
which is like a small little

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.540
turkey baster, to essentially
suck out the nucleus of all of

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.320
these eggs.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.820
So you might remember from
high school biology the

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.460
nucleus is what contains the
chromosomes and all the

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.000
genetic instructions.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.620
So basically, what they're doing
is taking the DNA from

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.520
these eggs out and leaving
you with an empty egg.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.940
Then they took one of Rainbow's
cells and injected

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.820
the entire cell into
the empty egg.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.500
They put it just in
between the inner

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.840
and the outer membranes.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.500
Then they applied an electric
current to this whole cell

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.640
within a cell system.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.500
What the electricity does is
basically turn the cell

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.340
membranes into Swiss cheese,
poking holes in the membranes

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.600
of both the egg and Rainbow's
skin cell.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.870
As a result, the DNA from
Rainbow's cell can flow into

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.540
the empty egg.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.550
This sudden influx of
genetic material

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.200
actually tricks the egg.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.370
It thinks it's just been
fertilized by a sperm, and it

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.820
will then go on to grow
and divide just

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.170
like a normal embryo.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.040
What you end up with, then,
is a cloned embryo--

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.120
an embryo that has all
the genetic material

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.100
from Rainbow herself.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.000
These embryos are transferred
into surrogate mothers--

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.870
other cats that have been
recruited to the project.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.030
And if all goes well, after a
normal period of gestation,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.840
these surrogate mothers
give birth to a clone.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.690
Things did, in fact, go well
with the project to clone

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.270
Rainbow, and scientists
ended up with a

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.970
healthy little cat clone.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.300
This is her.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.540
She doesn't look very
monstrous at all.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.910
And her name is actually CC,
which stands for Carbon Copy,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.190
and also Copy Cat.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.840
So again, scientists having
fun with naming.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.850
And scientists did various
tests on her.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.570
They found she was, in fact, a
clone of Rainbow, and that she

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.630
was healthy and seemed
to develop normally.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.210
After her service to the
laboratory was done, one of

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.860
the scientists involved in
creating her, a man named

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.810
Doctor Duane Kraemer,
adopted her.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.900
So when I went out to Texas,
he invited me over to his

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.980
house to visit CC, who was about
10 years old at that

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.980
point, and I eagerly took
him up on his offer.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.200
The day did not exactly unfold
as planned, though.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.540
When I got over there, I
naturally started to approach

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.590
the front door of the house,
and figured we'd be going

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.590
inside to meet his cloned cat.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.480
But Doctor Kraemer and his
wife came running out and

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.310
said, oh, no no no no.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:39.120
CC has her own house for her
and her husband and their

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.730
kids, was what he said to me.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.780
And so he sort of steered me
around to behind the house

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.940
where the humans lived, and sure
enough, in the backyard

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.280
was this two story house.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.470
We're not talking about a
little doghouse here.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.840
This is a house that's bigger
than my Brooklyn apartment.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.390
And so he opened the door and
let me in, and there were five

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.500
cats running around inside.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.190
So after they'd adopted CC,
they thought she might be

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.130
lonely, and they adopted a male
cat named Smokey to keep

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.490
her company.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.100
One of the things we do know
about clones is that they can

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.090
reproduce normally, and CC and
Smokey did go on to breed, and

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:22.480
had three kittens conceived
in the usual way.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.540
Here are a couple photos
I took from the

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.300
inside the cat house.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.330
In the first one here, this is
Doctor Kraemer, one of the

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.520
cloners, trying to
give CC a pet.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.020
She was not very cooperative
the day I was visiting.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.520
She spent a lot of time of
sitting out in the window

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.810
looking over what she surely
imagines to be her kingdom.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.210
She's a very pampered cat.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.770
There are ladders or steps here
to the second floor of

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.830
the cat house.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.590
Doctor Kraemer also keeps all of
his students' dissertations

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.050
up there, so it's a

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.830
combination library/cat residence.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.360
And they also build this
outside, screened-in area for

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.570
the cats so they can go out,
get some fresh air.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.200
They don't have to worry about
the cats running off or being

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.790
attacked by some sort
of predator.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.570
So the cat family is still
living out in Texas.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.120
They all seem happy and healthy
so far, and Genetic

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.230
Savings &amp; Clone did go on to
clone a couple cats for

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.200
regular American customers.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.280
They cloned eight, I believe.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.200
But the price was high and the
demand was kind of low, so the

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.410
company eventually shut down.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.140
Again, you can think of pet
cloning as a pretty trivial

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.240
use of biotechnology,
and it is.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.730
But the advances that let CC
be cloned paved the way for

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.670
other applications.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.140
This is Ditto.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.230
He is the world's first cloned
African wildcat.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.920
And African wildcats are a
species of small exotic cats.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.829
They're threatened in the wild
by habitat loss and also by

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.270
interbreeding with
domestic cats.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:16.560
His name is Ditto, which is
another great pun, I guess, by

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.290
the scientists.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.040
And he was created by scientists
in New Orleans, who

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.470
work at what's known as the
Audubon Center for Research of

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.940
Endangered Species, or ACRES.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.339
The ACRES scientists have
really made a name for

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.670
themselves by using all sorts of
reproductive technology to

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.240
help endangered species breed.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.000
They started with IVF and
created test tube gorillas and

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.110
things like that.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.350
But as the technology has
advanced, so has their work.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.590
And in recent years, they've
become especially known for

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.600
their cloning projects and their
cloning of small species

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.920
of endangered cats.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.610
They've done four or
five of them now.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.550
So they've just small numbers of
these cats, but the idea is

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.710
that perhaps if we can refine
this cloning technology and

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.060
really get it to work well and
predictably, that we can use

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.000
cloning to help prop up
species that might be

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.310
struggling in the wild.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.410
There's also Bruce.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.970
This is another animal clone.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.720
He is a cloned bull, and was
also created at Texas A&amp;M.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.610
Bruce is the clone of a special
bull named Bull 86 who

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.940
was discovered in
the early 1980s.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.930
What was amazing about Bull 86
is that he had a natural

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.570
genetic mutation that just
happened to make him resistant

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.450
to all sorts of livestock
diseases.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.210
Because of this one genetic
error, he was resistant to

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.440
tuberculosis, salmonella,
and a disease known as

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.460
brucellosis, which is a
contagious livestock disease.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.290
Unfortunately, Bull 86 got old
and died before the scientists

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.590
could breed him.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.990
And though they saved some of
his sperm, accidents happen,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.010
as they can in science, and it
was accidentally destroyed

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.580
several years later.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.090
So for a while, it seemed like
Bull 86's valuable genes had

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.460
died out with him.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.330
But cloning came
along in 1996.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.730
That's when Dolly was born.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.490
And the scientists at A&amp;M
suddenly had an idea.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.380
Stashed away in the very back
of the freezer was a skin

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.890
biopsy that they had taken
from Bull 86's

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.020
ear 15 years earlier.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:35.390
They took the biopsy from the
freezer and used the genes it

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.320
contained to clone Bull 86.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.270
They ended up with
this bull here.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:47.100
Technically, his name is Bull
86 Squared, which, in their

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.000
scientific papers, the
scientists say stands for his,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.850
quote, "exponential genetic
potential." But because he was

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.930
also resistant to the same
diseases, TB, salmonella, and

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.470
brucellosis, students took
to calling him Bruce.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.600
So this is just one animal--

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.940
one bull that's been cloned,
but his birth raises

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.500
intriguing agricultural
possibilities.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.530
Lurking out there in our herds
and flocks might be other

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.540
animals that, unbeknownst to
us, happen to have natural

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.010
genetic mutations that protect
them from disease.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.540
So one possibility is that if we
can find and identify these

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:33.110
animals, we can use cloning to
create new stocks of breeder

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.790
animals and breed some
of these helpful

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.750
disease-resistant genes into
larger livestock populations.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.180
So it's not just genetics.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.290
We are also remaking animal
bodies from the outside in.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.990
And in particular, advances
in veterinary medicine and

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:58.120
materials science are letting
us give animals state of the

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.430
art prosthetic limbs.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.760
One of the leaders in this field
is a British veterinary

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.450
surgeon named Noel Fitzpatrick,
and he is

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.250
sometimes known as
the Bionic Vet.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.260
He was the subject
of a documentary

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.070
series by that title.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.260
And that's because he's become
best known for his work giving

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.530
people's pets bionic limbs--

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.600
prosthetics that are permanently
implanted into

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.460
their bodies.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.580
The device he invented is
called the Intraosseous

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.360
Transcutaneous Amputation
Prosthesis, or ITAP, as

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.920
everyone calls it.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.110
And that's kind of a mouthful,
but if you break down what

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.940
those words mean, you
really get a good

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.240
sense of what it does.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.140
So osseous comes from
the word for bone.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.900
Intraosseous means
inside the bone.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.170
Cutaneous, from the
root for skin.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.640
Transcutaneous means
across the skin.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.520
And then, of course, amputation
and prosthesis.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.980
So if we put this together,
what you end up with is a

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.840
prosthetic device that gets
inserted inside the bone and

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.850
crosses through the skin.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.800
This on the left here is what
the ITAP actually looks like.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.590
It's made of a titanium alloy.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.460
That's what this rod is here.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:21.050
And this longer portion here
gets implanted actually inside

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.500
of an animal's bone.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.390
This is an x-ray of a dog who
had the bottom portion of his

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.340
leg amputated.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.420
This smaller metal piece here
then juts out through the skin

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.880
and into the open air.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.840
The idea is that once this
implant has been surgically

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.960
implanted and the animal
recovers, you can then pop

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.180
different artificial paws
onto and off of this

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.490
little metal peg here.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.270
You'll also notice that there
is this sort of umbrella

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:53.050
shaped cap, and it's a little
hard to see, but that is also

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.640
implanted just underneath
the surface of the skin.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.010
It's covered in all of these
little tiny holes, and that's

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.270
a crucial part of
the ITAP device.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:10.370
These holes allow the device
to make a sturdy permanent

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.780
interface with the body.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.680
What happens is the
soft tissues--

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.640
the skin, the collagen,
the muscle--

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.100
actually grows into and through
these holes, creating

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.290
this permanent link between
implant and flesh.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.010
One of the first animals to
get one of these ITAP is a

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.870
bulldog named Cole.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.260
When Cole was eight years old,
he developed a tumor in his

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.900
front left paw.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.620
And the traditional treatment
for these kinds of bone tumors

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.370
is often just to amputate the
paw and to let the dog go on

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.600
with its life.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.220
We've probably all seen
three-legged dogs, and a lot

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.400
of them get along just fine.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.580
But not all dogs do well on
three legs, and veterinarians

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.460
were particularly worried about
Cole because he had

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.190
severe arthritis.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.570
And so they worried that if
they took away one of his

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.110
legs, his remaining three legs
might not be strong enough to

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.970
support his fairly massive
body weight.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.140
So they agreed to give
him an ITAP.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.160
This is Cole a few weeks
after the surgery.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.100
He had the device that we were
just looking at implanted.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.230
You can see the metal peg
sticking out here, and the

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:25.560
rest of the ITAP is hidden away
inside his leg there.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.870
Once he healed and recovered
from the stress of the

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.770
surgery, then his owners and
veterinarians could experiment

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.690
with different kinds
of artificial feet.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.590
This part of the ITAP is still
sort of a work in progress.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.910
Engineers and veterinarians are
working together to figure

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.910
out what designs of paws work
best and in what scenarios.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.620
Here's a wide variety of the
designs that have been tried.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.620
And in Cole's case, they found
that what worked best was

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.960
actually one of the very
low tech solutions.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.080
This last one here is
essentially just

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.650
a rubber sink stopper.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.560
So they popped this onto the
metal peg that came out of

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.020
Cole's foot, and this
is what they got.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.930
This is Cole after he's
recovered from all of his

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.590
surgeries and all the procedures
with his new

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.330
prosthetic paw.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.620
It was a huge success.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.420
He tolerated the implant well.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.190
It did, in fact, grow into his
skin and become a permanent

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.040
part of his body, and he seemed
to go back to life as a

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.050
normal dog.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.520
His owners reported that most
people never even noticed he

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.030
had a prosthetic paw unless
they looked closely.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.960
And also, before Cole had gone
through all these medical

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.080
procedures, he had been taught
some of those conventional dog

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.085
tricks, you know, where you
can say "paw" and the dog

00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:49.490
gives you his paw.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.440
And after all these procedures,
Cole would, in

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.920
fact, do it with either
his normal paw or

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.470
his prosthetic paw.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:01.860
So he seemed to get right
back to life as a dog.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.190
Fitzpatrick has also
done cats.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.590
This is Oscar, and she has the
distinction of being the first

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.550
recipient of the double ITAP.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.680
You can see both of his back
legs have been replaced here.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.830
Oscar unfortunately had a run-in
with a mechanical grain

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.860
harvester and lost both of
his back paws, but they

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.030
gave him two ITAPs.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.120
It's the same general procedure
that we saw with

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.930
Cole, just at a smaller scale.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.620
I've got a short video I'll show
you here where you can

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.090
see Oscar walking around on
these paws, and Fitzpatrick

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.330
also explains a little bit
more about the design.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:27:04.066
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:04.066 --> 00:27:05.062
Come on, boy.

00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:06.058
Come on, bud.

00:27:06.058 --> 00:27:07.552
There we go.

00:27:07.552 --> 00:27:08.548
Come on, man.

00:27:08.548 --> 00:27:10.042
Here, have that bit.

00:27:10.042 --> 00:27:11.038
Good boy.

00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:14.050
This is a good [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.540
So it's now been three
weeks since we put

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.200
on Oscar's new feet.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.060
He likes his new blades,
don't you, Oscar?

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:20.860
Good boy.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.630
He also likes fish.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.330
But he can run and jump on them
now, and his feet are

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.242
moving very well indeed.

00:27:28.242 --> 00:27:29.740
Come on, then.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.460
Come on, bud.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.100
So you will have seen his
prototype feet, which were

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.360
just compressive devices.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.660
They were devices which just had
a little spring in them.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.900
And that was just to encourage
him to use his feet in the

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:49.710
first instance, and to remodel
his bone so that it built up

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.050
around the metal.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:54.550
Now he's moved on to a different
phase in his life

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.380
where he needs to
be able to run.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.230
We can see that his new
foot is like a blade.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.220
It hits the ground like a normal
foot, and has a little

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.630
sole on it, so he can get
some traction, and

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.620
works like a seesaw.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.630
The foot was designed so that
the metal inside his bone

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.080
couldn't break.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.960
So if Oscar gets into
difficulty, the foot will

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.960
break here at a break point
before it would break the

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.930
implant inside his bone.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:28.810
It's very much like the bindings
on a pair of skis.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:34.430
So it will break off here at the
binding before it breaks

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.220
your leg, which is the
way skis work.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.650
And we designed this implant
with that in mind.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.990
So if you're skiing down the
hill and you catch your foot,

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.240
it will snap here before
it breaks your leg.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.490
So that's pretty cool.

00:29:15.034 --> 00:29:17.050
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.800
EMILY ANTHES: So Fitzpatrick has
now done about two dozen

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.600
of these animal ITAPS, and one
of the amazing things about

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.770
them is that they've been so
successful that the ITAP is

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.220
now in human trials in Europe.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.960
One of the first patients is a
woman named Kira Mason, and

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.530
she lost her arm in the
bombings of the London

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.780
Underground in 2005.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.740
She had tried a variety of
different prosthetic devices

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.580
and found them lacking, and
so she signed up for this

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.790
clinical trial and got basically
the same sort of

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:51.470
ITAP that Cole or Oscar got.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:55.950
She reports that this new ITAP
arm is much more convenient

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.075
and comfortable for
her to use.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:05.190
Finally, towards the end of the
book, I get into the most

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.210
extreme territory, and I start
talking about animal cyborgs,

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.080
of which there are
now a variety.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.620
In particular, DARPA, the
research and development arm

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:20.040
of the Pentagon, has been
interested in developing

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.230
remote-controlled, steerable
insect cyborgs.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.420
And this is because DARPA has
long had an interest in

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.390
creating little tiny
flying drones--

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.930
drones that are much smaller
than the ones we tend to hear

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:33.870
about today.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.730
And the idea is that these tiny
drones would maybe fly

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.470
into occupied buildings or
distant caves and perhaps

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.700
conduct surveillance--

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.880
send video or audio feeds back
to military personnel and let

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.260
us scope out a territory before
we actually go there.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.260
The difficulty is that it's hard
to build these completely

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.250
mechanical drones at
a very small scale.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.540
Partly that's because the
dynamics of flight change when

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.070
you get that small.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.140
And there's also a
battery problem.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.750
These drones are so small and
light that they can barely

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.330
carry any weight, and as a
result, the batteries they do

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.450
carry tend to be
very low power.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.480
They only keep these drones
aloft for a couple of minutes.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.990
So DARPA realized that maybe
insects would be a shortcut to

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.120
these kinds of drones.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.230
After all, they already know
how to fly, and better yet,

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.030
they power themselves.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.460
All we'd need to figure out how
to do is to steer them and

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.880
make them obey our commands.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.160
So in 2006, DARPA put out a call
asking researchers across

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.730
the country to submit proposals
for how they would

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.460
create these kinds of
insect cyborgs.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.250
DARPA funded a couple
of these proposals.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.500
One of the scientists who won
funding is a man named Michel

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.580
Maharbiz, and he's
at UC Berkeley.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.780
He decided he was going to work
with these flour beetles.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.620
They're relatively
large beetles--

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.780
three or four inches--

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.680
so they're bigger than
most insects.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.030
The trouble is that Maharbiz is
an electrical engineer, and

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.540
he knew plenty about the wiring
and the circuitry, but

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.720
next to nothing about
insect biology.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.430
So to begin with, he started by
delving into the literature

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.160
and trying to figure out
what we knew about how

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.830
these things fly.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.730
He ended up homing in on two
areas of the beetle brain at

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:38.770
the base of each optic
lobe, here and here.

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.800
And the literature suggested
that these areas of the brain

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.460
were involved in flight
initiation and cessation.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.080
So he tinkered around in his lab
and decided he was going

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.900
to hack into these
brain regions.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.520
He ended up threading thin wires
into the base of each

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.960
optic lobe.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.050
The wires then snaked out of
the brain and connected to

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.560
this circuit board.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.110
Then, at the back of the circuit
board here, you see a

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.720
big radio antenna.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.030
The scientists wrote specialty
software, which they called

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:17.100
Beetle Commander, and they could
sit with their laptops

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.340
across the room 100 or more
yards away from the beetle and

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.500
start issuing commands
with this software.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.210
The commands would be picked
up by the radio antenna,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.640
transmitted into the circuit
board, and then electrical

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.930
pulses would go zinging down
these wires and into the

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.770
beetle's brain.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.370
Through trial and error, they
discovered that if they sent a

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.860
series of rapid fire electrical
pulses into the

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.950
beetle's brain, it would
suddenly take flight.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.420
On the other hand, if they sent
a single long pulse to

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.380
the same area of the brain, the
beetle would immediately

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.290
stop flying.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.320
The effect was so dramatic
that the beetle would

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.870
literally fall out of the
air in mid-flight.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.330
And you don't have to take my
word for that, because you

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.462
will see that in this video.

00:34:02.462 --> 00:34:22.580
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.876
The beetles were not injured,
by the way.

00:34:49.776 --> 00:34:50.780
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.280
EMILY ANTHES: So that's
pretty dramatic.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.670
But of course, that's
just step one.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.400
In order to actually be useful,
the beetles need to

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.180
not just stop and start, but
go in the right direction.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.550
And so the next step was to
figure out how to take control

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.320
of the beetle's movements
while it was in the air.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.720
The scientists managed to
do this by adding a

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.810
second set of wires.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.310
It's not in this photo,
unfortunately, but they went

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.100
to the base of the beetle's
wings on each side.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.980
And what they discovered is that
when they stimulated the

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.780
right wing muscle, the right
wing would start beating with

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.420
more force, and as a result,
the beetle would naturally

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.620
veer to the left.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.400
And vice versa, by stimulating
the left wing muscle, the

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.860
beetle would veer
to the right.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.650
I have another video of that.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.070
I'll warn you in advance, it's
a little harder to see than

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:45.590
the previous video, but you can
see definitely the beetle

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:47.829
veering across the room.

00:35:47.829 --> 00:36:11.781
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:11.781 --> 00:36:12.300
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.120
So I think I'll stop it there.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.820
You guys the idea.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.750
It's a little difficult
to see.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:21.120
But this is a pretty dramatic
thing to do, to take control

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.330
of this beetle's movements.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:24.280
But it's still pretty crude.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.790
So right now, all we're able to
do is make them veer in one

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.290
direction or the other.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.320
In order to really be useful,
we'll need to take much more

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.030
precise control.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.930
Military commanders may want
the beetle to go left by 40

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.300
degrees while flying at a
certain altitude and speed.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.550
So that's something that the
scientists are working on now

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:48.550
is to make much more fine-tuned
commands that they

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:52.480
can control the beetle with.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.870
So obviously, some of these
things are very radical things

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.490
to do to animals, particularly
when you talk about taking

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.070
over their nervous systems, and
it's easy to understand

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.370
why some of these technologies
are controversial.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.260
It can certainly, in certain
cases, cause animal suffering.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.850
It can turn animals into
commodities or tools.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:16.950
And in certain cases, it could
potentially pose a risk to us

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.100
or to the environment, to
ecosystems that we all share.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.140
These are absolutely serious
issues, and they deserve

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.660
serious consideration.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.410
There is plenty of reason to be
cautious as we move ahead

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.370
with these technologies.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.200
I think we need more of a
societal discussion about how

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200
we want to use these
technologies, and

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.460
why, and to what end.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.160
And we should absolutely
be prepared to reject

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.760
applications or products that
pose undue dangers.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.160
But I also think there's a lot
of reason for hope, and animal

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.060
biotechnology could do more good
not just for the world,

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.200
but also for animals themselves,
than it's often

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.880
given credit for.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.490
Biotechnology, after all, is
not inherently good or bad.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.120
It's merely a set of techniques,
and we have

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.980
choices about how
we can use them.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.940
What scares me a little bit
is that if we have these

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:17.520
knee-jerk reactions against
biotechnology, then we'll lose

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.910
many, many of the good
beneficial applications along

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.670
with the bad.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.510
So thank you guys
for having me.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.880
I know we don't have a lot of
time left, but I'm happy to

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.130
take questions.

00:38:31.134 --> 00:38:32.616
Yes.

00:38:32.616 --> 00:38:34.592
AUDIENCE: I hear there are
glowing plants on Kickstarter.

00:38:34.592 --> 00:38:36.074
Have you seen them?

00:38:36.074 --> 00:38:38.550
What is your sentiment
about them?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.660
EMILY ANTHES: I have
seen them.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.030
So the question is, there's a
Kickstarter campaign to fund

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.830
the creation of glowing
plants.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.580
And actually, that's
not a particularly

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.580
radical thing to do.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.150
So scientists have created
glowing plants in the lab.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.910
But one of the things that's
become controversial about

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.080
this project is that one of the
rewards for donating is a

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.610
set of these seeds,
supposedly--

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.960
these glowing plant seeds.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.930
So a big concern with
genetically modified organisms

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.780
is what happens if they
get loose in the wild?

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.200
And so I think the plants
are likely to

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.630
be completely harmless.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.190
I'm not worried about human
safety or, if someone ate

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.650
them, food safety.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.100
But I think it's a little bit
worrisome that we might see

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.090
all these seeds going
out there in a

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.540
totally unregulated way.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.135
So I think that's why it's
gotten so much attention.

00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:34.456
Yes.

00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:37.438
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
with the cloning to save

00:39:37.438 --> 00:39:44.083
animals that are dying out, if
every animal is a clone, how

00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:47.080
would the population not end
up just being interbred?

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.290
Is that something that--

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:49.620
EMILY ANTHES: Right.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.250
So cloning is not a cure-all,
and sometimes it's presented

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.340
as, well, all we have
to do is make more

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.550
copies of these animals.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.890
Problem solved.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.990
I think that's an exaggeration,
but I think it

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.610
can be useful in much
more limited ways.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.490
So as you, I think, were getting
at, one of the big

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.760
problems with endangered species
isn't just that they

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.020
are small in number, but they
lack genetic diversity.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.580
And so cloning, obviously,
doesn't solve that problem,

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.260
because it only gives you
replicas of the animals you

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.490
already have.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.820
But it could potentially be used
to keep diversity from

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.220
dwindling further.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.950
So if you have animals that die
before they can reproduce,

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:34.110
or are infertile for some
reason, or something else

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:38.270
happens, you could potentially
take cell samples and clone

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.810
them and at least sort of get
those genes back into the

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.510
population.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:46.495
There's also a big effort right
now with frozen zoos--

00:40:46.495 --> 00:40:49.860
like tanks of liquid nitrogen
where scientists are storing

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.700
cells and DNA from all sorts
of wild animals.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.830
And I think there's real
potential there, because if we

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:02.780
have a species that, say, now
looks OK, but in 50 years is

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.180
endangered, and the genetic
diversity has died off, we may

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.390
have these samples of genes that
have disappeared and can

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.100
perhaps clone them back
into existence.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.290
So I think in this limited
way, it could be useful.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.070
But yes, we're not going to save
species just by making

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.186
thousands of clones.

00:41:19.186 --> 00:41:20.102
Yes.

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:22.850
AUDIENCE: On a kind of related
topic, I saw on "60 Minutes"

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.410
maybe a year ago that they found
some dinosaur DNA, and

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:31.835
they were actually, for real,
legitimately trying to

00:41:31.835 --> 00:41:34.020
actually bring some
of them back.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.533
What's your perspective on
that, and do you know

00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:35.800
anything about it?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.280
EMILY ANTHES: I haven't
seen that.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:42.700
I mean, the perspective of every
scientist I've ever seen

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.450
is that dinosaurs will
never be possible.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:48.890
Not only cells degrade over
time, but DNA begins to

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.310
degrade at the moment
of death.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:55.150
And so I've not seen
anyone say that.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.160
The DNA is just too far gone.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.530
The moon shot project right now
is the mammoth, which is a

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.830
lot more recent than the
dinosaur, and it's still

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.840
unclear whether we will have
good enough DNA, even these

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.580
best preserved samples, and
you probably saw just last

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.290
week, I think, they found an
amazing preserved sample.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.320
But so far, the DNA is
still in fragments.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.540
The cells are deteriorated.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.780
So, I mean, scientists are
still hoping, but it's--

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.940
to excuse the pun--
a mammoth project.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.250
It will take not just taking a
cell and popping it out and

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.930
cloning it, but we'll have to
painstakingly reconstruct what

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.610
we think the mammoth
genome looked like.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.110
And so even that's a
bit of a stretch.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:44.402
But dinosaurs really seem
like an impossibility.

00:42:44.402 --> 00:42:45.770
Yes.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:48.050
AUDIENCE: For the mammoth
project, though, what species

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.380
would we use as a host?

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.270
EMILY ANTHES: The discussion
is the elephant, which--

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.800
AUDIENCE: Is sufficiently
close?

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.820
EMILY ANTHES: Well, we don't
know, and I don't

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.960
think we will know.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:04.360
And there are also questions,
I think, about whether, even

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.280
if we can do it, it's
fair to do it.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.170
At least my thought is that
the ecosystems for these

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.640
animals have disappeared, and
the earth is so radically

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.570
changed that what would we do
with these mammoths when we

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:19.310
brought them back?

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.480
Would they just live in zoos?

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.410
Would it just be for
our own amusement?

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.380
Just personally, my perspective
is I would rather

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.940
see this technology used to try
and keep the species we

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.280
have now from dying out, rather
than trying to bring

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.350
back species that have been
gone for a long time.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.358
But others disagree with me.

00:43:36.358 --> 00:43:37.822
Yes.

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:40.994
AUDIENCE: You said one of the
reasons that Genetic Savings &amp;

00:43:40.994 --> 00:43:43.678
Clone went out of business is
because it was too expensive.

00:43:43.678 --> 00:43:47.460
Is the cost coming down
for this technology?

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.850
EMILY ANTHES: The cost
of pet cloning has

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.190
not come down a lot.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.180
I don't know of any commercial
cat cloning companies in

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.680
existence, but there are two dog
cloning companies in South

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.230
Korea, and it's $100,000 to
$150,000 still to clone a dog.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:10.220
But there are some companies in
the US that are banking on

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.080
it coming down, and
they actually will

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.240
store your pet's DNA.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.200
And their whole business model
is when cloning gets better

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.490
and cheaper, then you
can clone your pets.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.870
We'll see, I guess.

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:24.170
Did you have a follow up?

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.134
AUDIENCE: I think I saw
that CC with different

00:44:27.134 --> 00:44:29.110
colors than her clone.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.062
Is that a disappointment for pet
owners to realize they're

00:44:33.062 --> 00:44:34.560
not exactly the same?

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.430
EMILY ANTHES: Yeah.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.410
I talk about this in the book.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.280
I didn't get into it here.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.870
But if you were watching
closely, you'll notice that CC

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:42.790
was grey and white, and
Rainbow was gray

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.260
and white and orange.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.110
And it turns out that calico
cats in particular are not

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:55.410
great candidates for cloning,
because the genes for grey

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.290
versus black fur are on one X
chromosome, and the gene for

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.430
orange fur on another
X chromosome.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:06.770
So in calico cats, depending
on which X is active in a

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.110
cell, you either get a patch
of black or orange.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.380
But when you clone, scientists
suspect that what happens is

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.090
the cell they used from CC had
the X chromosome turned off in

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.320
that particular cell,
and as a result, CC

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.140
didn't express any orange.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.050
The entrepreneurs were not happy
about this, because they

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:33.490
thought people would realize
that they might not be a twin.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.440
The scientists didn't do this
intentionally, but were really

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.020
happy to see that CC didn't
look the same.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.550
One of their concerns has been
that pet owners might

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.930
misunderstand the technology
and think they're getting

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:46.650
their same old pet back.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.340
So for them, they use this
example a lot to remind people

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.510
it's not the same animal.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.750
But calico cats, you're always
going to run that risk in

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:56.943
particular.

00:45:56.943 --> 00:45:57.930
Yes?

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.122
AUDIENCE: What effect does the
mitochondrial DNA have on this

00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:02.090
whole process?

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.970
EMILY ANTHES: So that's the
other thing that you don't

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.280
hear talked about very
much in cloning.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.440
So remember I showed you when
they take the egg and they

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:15.320
suck the nucleus out, that's
99.9% of the genetic material.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.310
But mitochondria, which are
these little organelles that

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:22.650
sit in the cytoplasm, have their
own tiny little genomes.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:26.960
And so technically, clones
aren't quite perfect copies of

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.290
their genetic donors, because
they have the mitochondrial

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.860
DNA from their egg donors.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.630
Most scientists sort
of wave that off.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.250
Because it's so specialized and
small, they tend to not--

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:44.060
maybe it will have a slightly
different energy metabolism,

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.060
but because it tends to not
have physical, visible

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.770
effects, scientists don't
really talk about it.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:56.700
But, you know, it is a small
complicating factor.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.110
AUDIENCE: It would
definitely make

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.460
ancestral analysis confusing.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.830
EMILY ANTHES: Yes.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:06.320
One of the issues with cloning
endangered species is because

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.240
if you have a leopard and you're
trying to clone it, you

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.210
don't want to put all these
other endangered leopards

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.530
through surgery to harvest
their eggs.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.150
So they tend to use eggs from
domestic species, like

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.520
domestic cats.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.080
And so there's an interesting
philosophical question you can

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:29.580
ask about if it's a jaguar,
we're reproducing these

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.490
endangered species, but it has
a tiny little bit of DNA from

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:35.340
a different species, are we
really continuing the lineage

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.110
of the same species?

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:40.010
And that's a debate that
ecologists are having.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.699
And it's an interesting
philosophical question.

00:47:43.699 --> 00:47:44.645
Yes.

00:47:44.645 --> 00:47:48.586
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that one
of the Xs was turned off,

00:47:48.586 --> 00:47:50.660
and that's why the clone
looked different.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.990
Is it possible that if
you were to use--

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.250
I'm not sure what cells were
used initially, if they were

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.990
skin cells or something else,
but if you used stem cells,

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.420
would that make a difference?

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.850
EMILY ANTHES: You
know, it could.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.670
One of the problems with a lot
of this work is that so few

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:09.460
animals of any one species have
been created that there's

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.440
not a lot of data
to work with.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.650
I don't believe that's
something that

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.840
scientists have tried.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.420
I mean, the idea is when you
clone, that if you take DNA a

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.482
from a skin cell, it's what's
known as differentiated.

00:48:24.482 --> 00:48:28.180
It's specialized to
be skin cell DNA.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.210
And in theory, when you put it
in the egg, it's supposed to

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.670
get reset to the embryonic
state.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:36.820
But that doesn't always happen,
and sometimes it

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.040
happens partially.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.850
And so it's a question of how
well we do at getting the DNA

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:47.670
to sort of reset to its
normal settings.

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:49.520
And that's thought to be one
of the reasons that clones

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.640
sometimes have birth defects or
die in the womb is because

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.240
if the DNA doesn't get
reprogrammed correctly, it may

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.279
not be viable.

00:49:00.279 --> 00:49:06.066
AUDIENCE: So is the other X on
anywhere else in the clone?

00:49:06.066 --> 00:49:09.930
So if the clone is female, and
there were two Xs, and one of

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.892
them was turned on and the other
one was off in the cell

00:49:13.892 --> 00:49:18.080
that was shot into the embryo,
so did they do any tests to

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.970
see if any other parts of the
cat were [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:21.360
EMILY ANTHES: They didn't.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:25.730
And, I mean, X inactivation is
sort of their best guess for

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.030
why she didn't have any orange
was that for each individual

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:31.850
cell, a different X chromosome
can be on.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.730
And so, in theory, it could have
turned out that some of

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:39.110
the orange Xs were
on in some cells.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.090
But they didn't really look
into it in detail.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.540
Their guess is that, for
whatever reason, the DNA

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.480
didn't reset, and so in all the
cells, that X chromosome

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.150
was inactive.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.730
But it's not clear.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.200
Yes?

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.448
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] stupid
question, but how does

00:49:55.448 --> 00:49:56.846
it work with men?

00:49:56.846 --> 00:50:02.584
Because it sounds like with
using genetic material from a

00:50:02.584 --> 00:50:07.760
female animal and plugging that
with more female-- does

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.870
cloning actually work in
the male instance?

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:16.250
EMILY ANTHES: Yeah, it does, but
if you clone a male cat,

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.240
you'll get a male cat.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.500
If you clone a female cat,
you'll get a female cat.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.910
And men have mitochondrial
DNA, it just

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.370
comes from their mothers.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.330
So you can clone either sex.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.380
Any other questions?

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.650
Thank you guys for coming.
