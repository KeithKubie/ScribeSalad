YouTube application you can do that feat

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
YouTube application you can do that feat
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.560
YouTube application you can do that feat
intent and that's definitely a good

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
intent and that's definitely a good
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.299
intent and that's definitely a good
approach but the downside there is that

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
approach but the downside there is that
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.259
approach but the downside there is that
it's going to take you out of your

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
it's going to take you out of your
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060
it's going to take you out of your
application and so if you're looking for

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
application and so if you're looking for
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.760
application and so if you're looking for
a more immersive experience you have a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770
a more immersive experience you have a
 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.720
a more immersive experience you have a
few other options you could go ahead and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730
few other options you could go ahead and
 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.019
few other options you could go ahead and
add a webview with which links to the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
add a webview with which links to the
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359
add a webview with which links to the
flash version to youtube or you could

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
flash version to youtube or you could
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.040
flash version to youtube or you could
also go and load the html5 version of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
also go and load the html5 version of
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.600

YouTube the catch each of those have

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
YouTube the catch each of those have
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459
YouTube the catch each of those have
some catches though pretty important

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
some catches though pretty important
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770
some catches though pretty important
older devices and actually some newer

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
older devices and actually some newer
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080
older devices and actually some newer
devices that matter to don't have flash

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
devices that matter to don't have flash
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.790
devices that matter to don't have flash
installed so the flash player is not

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
installed so the flash player is not
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860
installed so the flash player is not
always available and all the devices

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
always available and all the devices
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.420
always available and all the devices
aren't going to be able to play you on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
aren't going to be able to play you on
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430
aren't going to be able to play you on
video or html5 video unless they have an

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
video or html5 video unless they have an
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860
video or html5 video unless they have an
html5 compliant webview implementation

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
html5 compliant webview implementation
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.950
html5 compliant webview implementation
so with that that other way that the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
so with that that other way that the
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020
so with that that other way that the
current devices that pretty much limits

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
current devices that pretty much limits
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
so for almost all practical purposes
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969
so for almost all practical purposes
right now I'd say the best option is to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
right now I'd say the best option is to
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.770
right now I'd say the best option is to
go ahead and fire off intent and send

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
go ahead and fire off intent and send
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929
go ahead and fire off intent and send
the user off to the YouTube player just

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
the user off to the YouTube player just
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.370
the user off to the YouTube player just
so they have the best YouTube playback

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
so they have the best YouTube playback
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.550
so they have the best YouTube playback

once a security fix for this is
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.130
once a security fix for this is
determined i don't think that's a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140
determined i don't think that's a
 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.990
determined i don't think that's a
security issue you're not secure I think

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
security issue you're not secure I think
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.670

that's just a YouTube terms of service

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680
that's just a YouTube terms of service
 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.560
that's just a YouTube terms of service
issue yeah but any case I think the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
issue yeah but any case I think the
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.170
issue yeah but any case I think the
correct enter here until we get that the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
think that's for pretty much every case
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.849
think that's for pretty much every case
there you're going to get the best

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859
there you're going to get the best
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.240
there you're going to get the best
experience that way but yeah at least

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250
experience that way but yeah at least
 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.780
experience that way but yeah at least
for now so let's go ahead and move on to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790
for now so let's go ahead and move on to
 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.340
for now so let's go ahead and move on to
the next question I just rest then we

the next question I just rest then we
 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.300
the next question I just rest then we
never turn on the lights in here

yeah so right now the way we do software

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040
yeah so right now the way we do software
 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.290
yeah so right now the way we do software
updates assuming you how the device that

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300
updates assuming you how the device that
 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.810
updates assuming you how the device that
has a update available is we roll the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820
has a update available is we roll the
 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.670
has a update available is we roll the
device out to a fraction of users at a

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680
device out to a fraction of users at a
 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.010
device out to a fraction of users at a
time and there's a number of reasons we

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020
time and there's a number of reasons we
 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.500
time and there's a number of reasons we
do that first off it makes sure that we

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510
do that first off it makes sure that we
 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.180
do that first off it makes sure that we
don't overload carrier networks for

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190
don't overload carrier networks for
 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.790
don't overload carrier networks for
people who are on

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800
people who are on
 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.809
people who are on
cellular connections in fact I think

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819
cellular connections in fact I think
 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:59.950
cellular connections in fact I think
there's even an option in there where

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960
there's even an option in there where
 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.839
there's even an option in there where

testing then we can go ahead and abort

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349
testing then we can go ahead and abort
 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.200
testing then we can go ahead and abort
the update and solve those problems

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210
the update and solve those problems
 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.420
the update and solve those problems
before many users are impacted now we do

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
before many users are impacted now we do
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.040
before many users are impacted now we do
testings pretty thoroughly and it's rare

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050
testings pretty thoroughly and it's rare
 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.570
testings pretty thoroughly and it's rare
that something like that happens it's

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580
that something like that happens it's
 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.459
that something like that happens it's
just a safety device that we basically

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469
just a safety device that we basically
 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.950
just a safety device that we basically
built in I think in the case of

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960
built in I think in the case of
 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.339
built in I think in the case of
developers this is a valid concern it

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349
developers this is a valid concern it
 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:31.839
developers this is a valid concern it
will be definitely very nice to be one

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849
will be definitely very nice to be one
 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.249
will be definitely very nice to be one
of the first users to get a software

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259
of the first users to get a software
 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.689
of the first users to get a software
update so that way you can update your

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699
update so that way you can update your
 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.110
update so that way you can update your

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120
application so I'll make sure that the
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.040
application so I'll make sure that the
actually I think that we already filed a

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050
actually I think that we already filed a
 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.140
actually I think that we already filed a
bug this morning for this so there is a

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150
bug this morning for this so there is a
 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.570
bug this morning for this so there is a
bug open we'll go ahead and make sure

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580
bug open we'll go ahead and make sure
 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.969
bug open we'll go ahead and make sure
that the OTA team sees it as a feature

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979
that the OTA team sees it as a feature
 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.249
that the OTA team sees it as a feature

discuss future future features that we
 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.189
discuss future future features that we
may or may not be implementing or

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199
may or may not be implementing or
 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.040

whether or not we're working on them
 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.719
whether or not we're working on them
when the you know hypothetically state

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729
when the you know hypothetically state
 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.999
when the you know hypothetically state
would be that kind of thing we will

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:34.009
would be that kind of thing we will
 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:35.529
would be that kind of thing we will
definitely follow it as a feature

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:35.539
definitely follow it as a feature
 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.379
definitely follow it as a feature

about when it when it would happen or if
 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:43.899
about when it when it would happen or if
we're working on it yep I think that's a

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:43.909
we're working on it yep I think that's a
 

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:47.230
we're working on it yep I think that's a
pretty good answer so prizzy from the

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240
pretty good answer so prizzy from the
 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.820

Philippines says can i retrieve data

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830
Philippines says can i retrieve data
 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.980
Philippines says can i retrieve data
from the google maps api so i can use it

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:50.990
from the google maps api so i can use it
 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.089
from the google maps api so i can use it
for my location based services

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:52.099
for my location based services
 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:55.209
for my location based services
application i'm developing so i'm not

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:55.219
application i'm developing so i'm not
 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:56.679
application i'm developing so i'm not
sure what sort of data you're looking

00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:56.689
sure what sort of data you're looking
 

00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:59.320
sure what sort of data you're looking
for a pressie but there are a number of

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.330
for a pressie but there are a number of
 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.209
for a pressie but there are a number of
things that you can access already you

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:01.219
things that you can access already you
 

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.179
things that you can access already you
can access the users current location

00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:04.189
can access the users current location
 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:06.790
can access the users current location
via the location manager that's actually

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800
via the location manager that's actually
 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.980
via the location manager that's actually
really doesn't have anything to do

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:07.990
really doesn't have anything to do
 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.320
really doesn't have anything to do
with Google Maps it's just what's the

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330
with Google Maps it's just what's the
 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.170
with Google Maps it's just what's the
users latitude longitude altitude basic

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.180
users latitude longitude altitude basic
 

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.410
users latitude longitude altitude basic
data you get from GPS or if there's a

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:16.420
data you get from GPS or if there's a
 

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.390
data you get from GPS or if there's a
Wi-Fi network nearby it can do course

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400
Wi-Fi network nearby it can do course
 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.180
Wi-Fi network nearby it can do course
location things like that you can also

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.190
location things like that you can also
 

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.510
location things like that you can also
do geocoding which is actually I think

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520
do geocoding which is actually I think
 

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.340
do geocoding which is actually I think
it's reverse geocode that's it no its

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:26.350
it's reverse geocode that's it no its
 

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.730
it's reverse geocode that's it no its
energy I Cody oh yeah so it's converting

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740
energy I Cody oh yeah so it's converting
 

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.910
energy I Cody oh yeah so it's converting
latitude and longitude to a a human

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:32.920
latitude and longitude to a a human
 

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.680
latitude and longitude to a a human
readable address you know that's reverse

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:34.690
readable address you know that's reverse
 

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.950
readable address you know that's reverse
geocoding okay now do we did good yeah i

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:37.960
geocoding okay now do we did good yeah i
 

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.300
geocoding okay now do we did good yeah i
think we support both ways okay i

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.310
think we support both ways okay i
 

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.820
think we support both ways okay i
believe we support both ways those

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:41.830
believe we support both ways those
 

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.060
believe we support both ways those
actually might be via the Maps API

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.070
actually might be via the Maps API
 

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.290
actually might be via the Maps API
actually space via location manager

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:46.300
actually space via location manager
 

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.420
actually space via location manager
interest I think it uses maps under the

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
interest I think it uses maps under the
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.610
interest I think it uses maps under the
hood but it is part of the location

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:50.620
hood but it is part of the location
 

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.860
hood but it is part of the location
manager package so there's utilities to

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:52.870
manager package so there's utilities to
 

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.600
manager package so there's utilities to
go and convert from lifelong to address

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.610
go and convert from lifelong to address
 

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.210
go and convert from lifelong to address
and back from a tour still at long so

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.220
and back from a tour still at long so
 

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.640
and back from a tour still at long so
that's all totally possible now if you

00:08:59.640 --> 00:08:59.650
that's all totally possible now if you
 

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.700
that's all totally possible now if you
want to do something more graphical

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:02.710
want to do something more graphical
 

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.110
want to do something more graphical
right you want to display a map and let

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120
right you want to display a map and let
 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.030
right you want to display a map and let
the user see you know where they are in

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040
the user see you know where they are in
 

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.380
the user see you know where they are in
the world as opposed to just telling

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:07.390
the world as opposed to just telling
 

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.550
the world as opposed to just telling
them their new maker numerical address

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560
them their new maker numerical address
 

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.480
them their new maker numerical address
right you can embed a map view inside of

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:12.490
right you can embed a map view inside of
 

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.160
right you can embed a map view inside of
your application which will render

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170
your application which will render
 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.120
your application which will render
Google Maps the location and there's

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.130
Google Maps the location and there's
 

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.160
Google Maps the location and there's
some limited options to go and customize

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.170
some limited options to go and customize
 

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.050
some limited options to go and customize
that if you want to go a step further

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.060
that if you want to go a step further
 

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.610
that if you want to go a step further
and start adding really complicated

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:23.620
and start adding really complicated
 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.960
and start adding really complicated
stuff like polygons markers markers

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:27.970
stuff like polygons markers markers
 

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.330
stuff like polygons markers markers
custom map tiles you can go ahead and

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.340
custom map tiles you can go ahead and
 

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.020
custom map tiles you can go ahead and
add a web view that loads the google

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.030
add a web view that loads the google
 

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.490
add a web view that loads the google
maps api from the web and that's how you

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.500
maps api from the web and that's how you
 

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.570
maps api from the web and that's how you
can get some of those advanced features

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:36.580
can get some of those advanced features
 

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.220
can get some of those advanced features
we definitely encourage people to use a

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.230
we definitely encourage people to use a
 

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.400
we definitely encourage people to use a
standard map view at first but you know

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:41.410
standard map view at first but you know
 

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.540
standard map view at first but you know
sometimes you do want to do these

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:42.550
sometimes you do want to do these
 

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.010
sometimes you do want to do these
advanced things and that's when you have

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.020
advanced things and that's when you have
 

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.360
advanced things and that's when you have
to look into the web based api's so i

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.370
to look into the web based api's so i
 

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.520
to look into the web based api's so i
think that's a yes as far as the answer

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:50.530
think that's a yes as far as the answer
 

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.220
think that's a yes as far as the answer
to this question now if you want to do

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:53.230
to this question now if you want to do
 

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.690
to this question now if you want to do
something like get driving directions

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:54.700
something like get driving directions
 

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.070
something like get driving directions
though that's where you're going to run

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080
though that's where you're going to run
 

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.630
though that's where you're going to run
into some problems and you won't be able

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640
into some problems and you won't be able
 

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.250
into some problems and you won't be able
to pull that data out to add a google

00:09:59.250 --> 00:09:59.260
to pull that data out to add a google
 

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.130
to pull that data out to add a google
maps but I believe you can send the user

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:02.140
maps but I believe you can send the user
 

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.630
maps but I believe you can send the user
yeah you can totally just send the user

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
yeah you can totally just send the user
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.340
yeah you can totally just send the user
over to google maps and you know

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.350
over to google maps and you know
 

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.500
over to google maps and you know
construct the URL for directions and

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.510
construct the URL for directions and
 

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.960

we have like we I mean we just iterated
 

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.510
we have like we I mean we just iterated
over most of them then there are several

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:19.030
so that it was pretty populated with
hello world hello world and you typed

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.040
hello world hello world and you typed
 

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.789
hello world hello world and you typed
zze in the values hello world zze then

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799
zze in the values hello world zze then
 

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:24.250
zze in the values hello world zze then
you rotated the device the new value

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.260
you rotated the device the new value
 

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.340
you rotated the device the new value
just bzzz okay that one and it was a

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:27.350
just bzzz okay that one and it was a
 

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.680
just bzzz okay that one and it was a
it's an interesting quirk we haven't

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:29.690
it's an interesting quirk we haven't
 

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.720
it's an interesting quirk we haven't
actually had time to determine the cause

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:31.730
actually had time to determine the cause
 

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.750
actually had time to determine the cause
of that but we'll hopefully have time to

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760
of that but we'll hopefully have time to
 

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.980
of that but we'll hopefully have time to
dig in yeah we should get you an answer

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:35.990
dig in yeah we should get you an answer
 

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.490
dig in yeah we should get you an answer
on that one by the end of the day yeah

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:38.500
on that one by the end of the day yeah
 

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.799
on that one by the end of the day yeah

that particular phone there's a crash
 

00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:42.930
that particular phone there's a crash
and that's not really a compatibility

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:42.940
and that's not really a compatibility
 

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.139
and that's not really a compatibility

know the api hasn't changed any it's
 

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.340
know the api hasn't changed any it's
more just an issue of general system

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:50.350
more just an issue of general system
 

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.259
more just an issue of general system
stability as far as i can tell yeah and

00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:52.269
stability as far as i can tell yeah and
 

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:54.539
stability as far as i can tell yeah and
i'm not sure where exactly whether or

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:54.549
i'm not sure where exactly whether or
 

00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:55.680
i'm not sure where exactly whether or
not that's issues because of a

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.690
not that's issues because of a
 

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.479
not that's issues because of a
modification that Samsung's made or if

00:18:57.479 --> 00:18:57.489
modification that Samsung's made or if
 

00:18:57.489 --> 00:18:59.119
modification that Samsung's made or if
it's a problem in the framework code

00:18:59.119 --> 00:18:59.129
it's a problem in the framework code
 

00:18:59.129 --> 00:19:02.159
it's a problem in the framework code
that said since it is a samsung devices

00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:02.169
that said since it is a samsung devices
 

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:05.099
that said since it is a samsung devices
is only happening on my suspicion is

00:19:05.099 --> 00:19:05.109
is only happening on my suspicion is
 

00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:06.690
is only happening on my suspicion is
that there's some some interaction with

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:06.700
that there's some some interaction with
 

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.489
that there's some some interaction with
one of samsung's modifications or a

00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:08.499
one of samsung's modifications or a
 

00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:10.379
one of samsung's modifications or a
driver or something i think this is a

00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:10.389
driver or something i think this is a
 

00:19:10.389 --> 00:19:11.700
driver or something i think this is a
question we have to send over to samsung

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:11.710
question we have to send over to samsung
 

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.639
question we have to send over to samsung
and they'll have to address it's really

00:19:13.639 --> 00:19:13.649
and they'll have to address it's really
 

00:19:13.649 --> 00:19:16.379
and they'll have to address it's really
outside of our hands in that case i mean

00:19:16.379 --> 00:19:16.389
outside of our hands in that case i mean
 

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:18.180
outside of our hands in that case i mean
like if it was a compatibility issue we

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.190
like if it was a compatibility issue we
 

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.060
like if it was a compatibility issue we
could update the the compatibility test

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.070
could update the the compatibility test
 

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.519
could update the the compatibility test
suite but this isn't this is just a more

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:23.529
suite but this isn't this is just a more
 

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.830
suite but this isn't this is just a more
an issue of the system is having some

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840
an issue of the system is having some
 

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.669
an issue of the system is having some
some problem with the clipboard so

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679
some problem with the clipboard so
 

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:31.499
some problem with the clipboard so
definitely a bug we'd like to look into

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:31.509
definitely a bug we'd like to look into
 

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:34.200
definitely a bug we'd like to look into
but it's one that Samsung is going to be

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.210
but it's one that Samsung is going to be
 

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.919
but it's one that Samsung is going to be
after responsible for fixing so that

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:37.929
after responsible for fixing so that
 

00:19:37.929 --> 00:19:39.509
after responsible for fixing so that
being said now that you pointed out i'll

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:39.519
being said now that you pointed out i'll
 

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:40.710
being said now that you pointed out i'll
make sure that somebody attempts and

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720
make sure that somebody attempts and
 

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.700
make sure that somebody attempts and
does see that so let's move on to the

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:44.710
does see that so let's move on to the
 

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.930
does see that so let's move on to the
next question I think Dan is still

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:45.940
next question I think Dan is still
 

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.419
next question I think Dan is still
working on that screen shot when a user

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:48.429
working on that screen shot when a user
 

00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:50.609
working on that screen shot when a user
touches a list view item I would like to

00:19:50.609 --> 00:19:50.619
touches a list view item I would like to
 

00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:52.589
touches a list view item I would like to
hang a view off of the bottom of the

00:19:52.589 --> 00:19:52.599
hang a view off of the bottom of the
 

00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:54.210
hang a view off of the bottom of the
list view items such that it overlaps

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:54.220
list view items such that it overlaps
 

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.119
list view items such that it overlaps
the next list view item do you think

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:57.129
the next list view item do you think
 

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.739
the next list view item do you think
that this is possible and off the top of

00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:58.749
that this is possible and off the top of
 

00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:01.560
that this is possible and off the top of
your head any ideas on how you would do

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:01.570
your head any ideas on how you would do
 

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:08.820
your head any ideas on how you would do
it that's a tricky so I don't know if it

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:08.830
it that's a tricky so I don't know if it
 

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.789
it that's a tricky so I don't know if it
would necessarily be possible to alter

00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799
would necessarily be possible to alter
 

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:13.889
would necessarily be possible to alter
you babe basically you would have to

00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:13.899
you babe basically you would have to
 

00:20:13.899 --> 00:20:17.219
you babe basically you would have to
alter the Z value of so that it could

00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:17.229
alter the Z value of so that it could
 

00:20:17.229 --> 00:20:20.009
alter the Z value of so that it could
over so it sort of hang over the next

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:20.019
over so it sort of hang over the next
 

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:21.210
over so it sort of hang over the next
list view yeah but yeah I don't think

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:21.220
list view yeah but yeah I don't think
 

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.529
list view yeah but yeah I don't think
you'd be you want be able to do it as a

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:22.539
you'd be you want be able to do it as a
 

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:25.019
you'd be you want be able to do it as a
a you're part of the list view it have

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:25.029
a you're part of the list view it have
 

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:26.249
a you're part of the list view it have
to be another view that you stack on top

00:20:26.249 --> 00:20:26.259
to be another view that you stack on top
 

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:28.830
to be another view that you stack on top
and in order to do that you'd have to go

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840
and in order to do that you'd have to go
 

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.560
and in order to do that you'd have to go
to compute where the item is you know on

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:31.570
to compute where the item is you know on
 

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.479
to compute where the item is you know on
your screen and precisely position a

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:33.489
your screen and precisely position a
 

00:20:33.489 --> 00:20:35.909
your screen and precisely position a
window there it's sort of painful I

00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919
window there it's sort of painful I
 

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:38.219
window there it's sort of painful I
think it's totally possible just go and

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:38.229
think it's totally possible just go and
 

00:20:38.229 --> 00:20:41.580
think it's totally possible just go and
create a new view like Alex said you're

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:41.590
create a new view like Alex said you're
 

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.930
create a new view like Alex said you're
going to want to make sure that it's in

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:42.940
going to want to make sure that it's in
 

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.219
going to want to make sure that it's in
front of everything else and then just

00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:44.229
front of everything else and then just
 

00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:47.190
front of everything else and then just
set the XY coordinates that said I think

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200
set the XY coordinates that said I think
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.229
set the XY coordinates that said I think
easier option would just be to go and

00:20:49.229 --> 00:20:49.239
easier option would just be to go and
 

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:50.810
easier option would just be to go and
make your list view item a little bigger

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820
make your list view item a little bigger
 

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.460
make your list view item a little bigger
yeah that's what i would do you still

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.470
yeah that's what i would do you still
 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.169
yeah that's what i would do you still
have the effect of pushing it out of the

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179
have the effect of pushing it out of the
 

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:55.370
have the effect of pushing it out of the
way I mean say it's not going over lap

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380
way I mean say it's not going over lap
 

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.259
way I mean say it's not going over lap
right but it's going to slide the

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:57.269
right but it's going to slide the
 

00:20:57.269 --> 00:20:58.820
right but it's going to slide the
options underneath that out of the way

00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:58.830
options underneath that out of the way
 

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.100
options underneath that out of the way
and if you really wanted to you could

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:01.110
and if you really wanted to you could
 

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.940
and if you really wanted to you could
also maybe alter the like the the

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:04.950
also maybe alter the like the the
 

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.889
also maybe alter the like the the
brightness of the one below its and

00:21:06.889 --> 00:21:06.899
brightness of the one below its and
 

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.509
brightness of the one below its and
above so that the other is around it

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:08.519
above so that the other is around it
 

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:10.879
above so that the other is around it
kind of frayed out now other thing to do

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:10.889
kind of frayed out now other thing to do
 

00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:12.200
kind of frayed out now other thing to do
actually just insert another list view

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.210
actually just insert another list view
 

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.649
actually just insert another list view
item underneath it yeah you can also do

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:15.659
item underneath it yeah you can also do
 

00:21:15.659 --> 00:21:17.419
item underneath it yeah you can also do
that yeah and in either case I'd make

00:21:17.419 --> 00:21:17.429
that yeah and in either case I'd make
 

00:21:17.429 --> 00:21:18.649
that yeah and in either case I'd make
sure you make take advantage the

00:21:18.649 --> 00:21:18.659
sure you make take advantage the
 

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:20.419
sure you make take advantage the
animation framework there's a flag you

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:20.429
animation framework there's a flag you
 

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:21.710
animation framework there's a flag you
can set on the list for you to go and

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720
can set on the list for you to go and
 

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.110
can set on the list for you to go and
make things nicely animate in and out

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120
make things nicely animate in and out
 

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.539
make things nicely animate in and out
and that will get you some nice so nice

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:26.549
and that will get you some nice so nice
 

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:27.769
and that will get you some nice so nice

that is a typical of a list view and it
 

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.389
that is a typical of a list view and it
might be kind of jarring I dance showing
