00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.215
Technology came along

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.225
as a way to allow me
to achieve a balance

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.155
and to help me
get things done.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.497
I am Rafaela.
I'm from Fortaleza.

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.974
I attended a Management School.
I've worked at multinationals,

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.532
mainly in Sales
and Marketing.

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:20.138
I had never considered
learning programming.

00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:22.349
I've always liked logic,

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.302
and I've always worked
with MS Excel.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.470
I was always that person
searching through the menus,

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.135
finding new formulas,

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.412
looking for more practical ways
to do things.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:35.298
After working over 8 years
for several companies,

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:38.569
I made a decision

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:42.721
to start studying Technology
seriously,

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:46.189
coming along in large part
right now

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:48.809
because I'm pregnant,

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:51.853
because of the prospect
of becoming a mother.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.902
That was when
I started thinking

00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:57.442
I needed to follow
a new path

00:00:57.517 --> 00:00:59.588
so I could have
a balanced life

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.096
the way I believe
I should have.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.374
That's what I found
at Udacity.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.613
Because it is online,
it's easier.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.679
Being able to study
at home is great.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.873
After I took the Intro
to Programming course,

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:18.101
my Tech studies
are not something I would

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:19.615
consider temporary.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.704
It's something you get
interested in

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.235
and study more thoroughly.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.649
Today I'm part of a network
of motherhood entrepreneurship

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.488
that helps women who want
to tread new paths

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:35.409
so they can discover a balance
between family and work.

00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:41.219
Motherhood has a great impact
on a person's life and family.

00:01:41.294 --> 00:01:44.342
Many women stop working

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:47.377
because they aren't able
to redefine themselves.

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.163
But when you apply
technology to it,

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:53.854
new opportunities
spring forth

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.211
and these women can assume
roles in the market,

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.348
where they held few positions
before.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.169
It's like a switch flicked on
inside me.

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:06.754
I can start programming.
And I think that's empowering.
