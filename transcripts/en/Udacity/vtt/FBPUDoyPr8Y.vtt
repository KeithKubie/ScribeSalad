00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.510
So, what's all this listening
on a port business?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.890
Well, it's like waiting for
a phone call.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.220
There's a particular phone
number that will reach you,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.540
not just anyone at your address,
but you personally.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.720
That's how a port number distinguishes
different server programs running on

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.770
the same computer, like SSH on port 22,
or HTTP on port 80.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500
Let's see what port's available for
me to listen on.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.150
Okay, here's port 3456,
I'm going to listen on that port now.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.668
Just like NC-L3456.

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:36.125
[NOISE]
Hello.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.400
Yes this is net cat.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.090
All of these other phones, are ports
that no server is listening on.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.582
If someone calls them, they're not
going to get an answer, instead,

00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:49.731
they'll get the equivalent of,
this number is disconnected,

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:52.901
which is an error message called
a reset packet or RST for short.
