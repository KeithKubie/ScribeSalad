00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.211
- I'm just saying, I've
never seen one up close.

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:04.421
- Okay, why don't you let us
know in the YouTube Community

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.924
section if you think bald eagles are real.

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.592
See you next time on "Every Damn Day".

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:09.760
- [Director] Cut.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.511
- [Chris] I mean, have
you seen a bald eagle?

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.848
- Wow guys, great show, great show.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.476
Ryan, little less nose next time.

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.103
Just a quick note,
everybody: research says that

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.523
our show is in dire
need of a bad boy type.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.734
- That's right, so you're gonna
give a little presentation

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.403
for the suits. Unless one of
you can prove that you're the

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:31.990
bad boy, we might have to
look into other options.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.786
As in, replace you because
you're not good at your job.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.621
Okay, good show!

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.707
(upbeat theme music)

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.213
- Hannah, why don't you start us off.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.173
- This is so stupid, why
are we even doing this?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.508
I'm clearly the baddest.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:50.460
- State your case, then.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180
- I show up whenever I want,
I wear a leather jacket,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.840
I put Four Loco in all of
the couch cushions, and

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.434
I've been replacing Ryan's
coffee with dip spit for weeks.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.728
- The viewers don't believe
you're bad boy material.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.272
- Why? Because I'm a woman?

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.774
- Yes. Our research shows
that our audience hates women

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.568
and want to make Comedy
Central great again. That means

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:12.114
bad boys, and saying the
phrase "I'm Rick James, (bleep)."

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:12.948
- This is bull (bleep).

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.533
- No it's not. It's backed by data.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.285
- [Ryan] I'm going to get a new coffee.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:17.995
- Don't be such a little (bleep).

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:20.580
(Chris laughs)

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.672
- I believe I misunderstood
the assignment.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.466
(saxophone music)

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.885
- So, who ate my pasta salad?

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:35.887
- Me.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:40.267
- Oh, excellent. No further
questions, your honor.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.101
(knocks on the table)

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.021
- Shaving it bald and returning
it before they've noticed.

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:45.480
(laughs)

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.817
- Item 14, adult circumcision. Item 15 -

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.610
- We've seen enough.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.445
- (bleep).

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.362
- What about the time I started the

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.697
trash fire in the office?

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.283
- Yeah, and because of that,
Name Tag Terry got promoted

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.743
to safety officer.

00:01:57.743 --> 00:01:58.577
- Thanks, Hannah.

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:01.163
- Yeah, hi Name Tag Terry.

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:03.999
(saxophone music)

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.340
(stomach gurgles)

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.467
- Any pasta salad left?

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.510
(vomits)

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.389
- One part macaroni, three parts worms.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.724
(spits)

00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:22.559
- That's not a recipe.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.814
- Okay, Ryan, you're last up.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:28.648
- This is ridiculous.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.108
- State your case.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.694
- I have no case. I'm not
the bad boy, I don't want

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.197
to be the bad boy. I just
want to make a good show.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.616
(whispering)

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.537
- Okay. We feel that
you're all pretty bad.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.999
- Like, bad-bad. So we're
just gonna go with Ryan for

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.002
any bad boy stuff because
he's easiest to bully.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:49.836
- Come on.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:50.754
- Don't complain.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:51.588
- Okay.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.131
- There's a lot of talent in this room.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.508
(vomits)

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.384
Call my dad.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:57.344
- The macaroni is worms.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.680
(cheerful electronic music)

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.475
- Okay, we asked you what we
should tattoo on Ryan's neck,

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:08.063
and you voted for Selena.
Let's see how it's going.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.899
- [Ryan] I'm a good boy. I'm a good boy!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.318
(jazz music)
