1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.160
I'm a 24 year old machinist.
I work CNC machines,

2
00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:05.080
do setups in order tooling.

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.620
Most of the people I work with have worked here for over 15 years.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.670
The owner of my company wants to make me the shop manager and honestly I'm not

5
00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:13.630
too tore up about it.

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.960
I feel like the older guys who've been around won't want to take scheduling and

7
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.240
Mac manufacturing advice from a young guy.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.770
I have good relationships with all the the shop guys,

9
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.620
but I'm worried about stepping into this role so soon.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.870
Only been with the company for three years.

11
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.490
<v 1>Okay.
Your boss isn't asking you to do this job if you're not ready for it.</v>

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.320
That's,
that's number one.

13
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.780
And the fact that you don't think you're ready as a good sign.

14
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:45.190
I've said this before because it means that you're humble,
so you feel like that.

15
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:45.591
That's good.

16
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:47.510
That's probably one of the reasons why you're doing well and probably one of the

17
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.580
reasons that your boss thinks you're ready for the jobs because you're humble,

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.473
so that's good.

19
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.440
But you also have to remember that being humble has to be balanced.

20
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:58.790
Dichotomy of leadership with confidence and even with a little bit of
aggression.

21
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.510
So there's a reason that you're getting asked to do this job and the boss needs

22
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:03.291
you to step up.

23
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.740
Now just because you become the manager or the boss doesn't mean yet.

24
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.130
You have to start bossing people around,
right?

25
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.410
It actually means that you should remain humble,

26
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.420
that you should take input from them,

27
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.550
that you can still take advice from them as opposed to just giving them advice.

28
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.770
All those things are fine.

29
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.120
And I just kind of asked this question the other day,
a young,
uh,
uh,

30
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.180
construction business and a kid and we were in a big meeting with a,

31
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:36.581
with a bunch of leadership from foreman to engineers all in the same room,

32
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.380
bunch of great guys from a great company.

33
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.890
And one of the young engineers raised his hand and said,
you know,

34
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm young and I am going to be in charge of these guys.

35
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.740
You know,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with these guys.

36
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:54.500
Had been doing it for a lot longer.
What can I do to,
you know,
gain their respect.

37
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.870
And I said,
okay,

38
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.520
who in this room knows more than that?

39
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:05.420
Engineered back there about construction and all these salty construction

40
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.290
foreman's raised their hands.
And I said,
who?
You know,

41
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.420
who's going to think that this guy has got the best idea?
Raise your hands.

42
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.110
All the hands go down.
And I said,
so this is what you're dealing with buddy.

43
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.060
I said,
now let me ask another question to the group group.

44
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.230
If this kid comes in and says,
I know how to do this better than you.

45
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.040
Listen to me and do it my way,
who's going to have respect for him?

46
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.870
Raise your hand.
No hands go up.
If this young kid comes in and says,

47
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:36.950
Hey,
I'm an engineer.
I've been educated,
but I haven't been doing this for long.

48
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.030
Can you give me some recommendations on how we do this so we can do the best job

49
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.790
possible?
Who's going to have respect for them?
Everyone raises their hand.

50
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.470
So there you have it.

51
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.080
You don't have to know everything as a leader,
no one expects you to everything,

52
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.670
especially as a young leader.
That's okay.

53
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.840
And actually when you admit that you actually gained respect,

54
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.940
when you ask for people's input,
you actually gain.

55
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.770
People get the paranoid feeling that if they don't know something,

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.070
they're going to be seen as weak.
It's not true.
So

57
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.610
you can just step up to the physician.
Still be humble.
Still take advice.
Now,

58
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.520
this doesn't mean that you're a pushover,
right?

59
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.800
That doesn't mean that you just listen to what everyone says.
Do.

60
00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:20.200
You don't make any decisions.
No.

61
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.140
It actually means that you show respect to their experience and when it comes

62
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:24.100
time to make a decision,

63
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.700
you get the best input and then you make a decision and you explained your

64
00:03:26.701 --> 00:03:29.320
decision.
And if your decision is wrong,
you admit it,
and if it's not wrong,

65
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.920
you push forward.
So that's you need to do,

66
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.270
you're getting asked to be put in this position for a reason.
So do it gets them.

67
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.430
<v 0>Seems like a common one.
Yeah,
that one.
I'm Stephanie The new role,
for sure.</v>

68
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.090
Everyone asks that question.
Yeah,
man,
I answered it again.
There you go.

69
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.910
For everyone's benefit,
including my own,
I learn from it every time.

70
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.520
That's the ethos,
right?
Coleen humble.
Yeah.
Be Open minded.
Take advice.

71
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.120
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Don't have to know everything.
Yes.

72
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.720
Three days ago,
uh,
our neighbor,
young girl,

73
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.270
one of my daughter's friends,
12 years old,

74
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.160
just comes over there messing around in swimming.
Uh,

75
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.720
she grabs my daughter's jump rope and she's jumping rope and she does the cross,

76
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.140
you know,
you jump up and you cross crossover crossover.
Yeah.
Yeah.

77
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.170
So she does that in man.
I used to jump rope back in the day,

78
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:27.790
but I never really could do the crossover.
Let's face it nonetheless.

79
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.840
So she's jump roping and jumping around and I'm like,
Hey,

80
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.900
do that cross the crossover thing again.
She does it.
She's doing,
you know,

81
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.180
she's 12 years old,
she taught,
I'm like,
Dang,
I never could do that.

82
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:40.060
And she's like,
well,
you just gotta do it like this until that.
So I'm like,
okay.

83
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:45.040
I grabbed the rope and I try and the roads do small cycle.
Grab my rope.

84
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.640
Yeah,
I gotta jump rope.
Oh,
well I told my daughter grab it.
So she grabs it.

85
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:52.750
And this is,
this is like a kind of like one of those pro speed ropes,
you know,

86
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.020
so it's like kind of,
so if I make a mistake on this rope is going to hurt.

87
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.040
I didn't have any shoes on.
I was barefoot.
Solon style,

88
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.720
Hawaiian sell for sure 100% and then so I go forward,

89
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.990
I'm or I can jump rope still pretty good right now.

90
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.640
Still I haven't done in awhile.
And she goes,
okay,

91
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:13.180
so right here at the top,
you know,
you,
you cross you,

92
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:16.420
this is where you want to cross at the top.
I try,
oh,
hits my foot painful.

93
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.190
And she's like,
no,
you got to do,
no,
no,
no,
no.

94
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:25.750
Never showed the paint to the kids.
I try not to anyway.
So I was like,
okay,
boom,

95
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.110
fail.
If she could.
She was like,
no more at the top,
you know,
it'll,

96
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.320
it'll just whatever.
So I'm like,
okay,
I do it.

97
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.720
And it took me four times on my fourth time.

98
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:36.850
I did it for the first time in my life.
By the way,

99
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.450
the crossover with the painful speed rope.
Some,
you know,

100
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.180
some mental fortitude right there,
thrown in so hardcore.
I did it.

101
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:51.160
You should've seen it,
but you should've seen the look on her end,

102
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:54.550
my daughter's face.
They were like,
oh.
Like it was,
you know,

103
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.240
like I just got my purple belt to song nonetheless.
So boom,

104
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.390
what do we have right there?
The situation,
this is what I took from it too.

105
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.460
We have a situation,
a full grown athletic,

106
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.470
arguably person learning to do something that's really not that easy.

107
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.020
Obviously,
if I've never done it in my life,

108
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.570
learning to do something that takes a fair amount of skill from a 12 year old

109
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.640
girl in real time.

110
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.080
And you know what I did
to boot and gave her the credit.

111
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.000
I said,
Dang,
you are the the best teacher.
Yes,

112
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.630
exactly right.
So that's the thing.
You're still home.
The moral of your story,

113
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.770
which was a long story.
Yeah.
Be Humble.
You can learn from anybody.
Yes.

114
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.640
And when you do learn from someone,
give them the credit.
Boom.
That's what I did.

115
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.960
See,
I said that in 13 seconds.
I know brow,

116
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.200
but I'm just saying it was impactful and it reminded me of that story.
