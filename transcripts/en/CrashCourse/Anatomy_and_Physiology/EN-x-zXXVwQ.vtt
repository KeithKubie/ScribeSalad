00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.659
Look at all this stuff!
Soaps, lotions, conditioners, polishes -- all

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.540
from that huge section of your local store
that’s dedicated solely to the grooming

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.580
of your skin, hair, and nails.
Some might see these things as the trappings

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.220
of vanity.
But me? I see them as the tools for the care,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.950
maintenance, and -- sure, sometimes decoration
-- of the integumentary system.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.789
Now, true, in spite of what the cosmetics
industry may lead you to believe, your integumentary

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.369
system is more than just a place to put eye shadow
and hair product in the hopes of attracting a mate.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.170
This collection of resilient tissues, ranging
from the sharp and hard to the soft and fluffy,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.519
serve a whole panoply of functions, the majority
of which you never even notice.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.640
But, when you do notice what your integumentary
system is doing, the results are often uncomfortable

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760
or ugly or both, and that is what this stuff
is mostly for.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.350
Your sweat glands can make you smell.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.030
Your oil glands can give you zits.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.120
Your skin can become either scaly or greasy,
and -- in rare cases -- it can even change color.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.989
And hair, well, let’s just say it takes
a lot of science to tame this mane.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.389
But each of these tissues -- frustrating as
they may be at times -- has a purpose, and

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:00.079
without them you’d be cold and vulnerable
and dead.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.659
I’m not gonna lecture you on personal hygiene
today. But hopefully by the end of this you’ll

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.189
understand the important functions of your
integumentary system, and maybe why it’s

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.269
worth a little bit of time and effort to keep
it healthy.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.269
And hey, it might even score you a date.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.160
If you recall our recent run-ins with rogue

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.340
nails and tattoo needles, you’ll probably
remember that the first and most vital purpose

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.210
of your integumentary system is to act as
a protective barrier.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.820
Your skin, hair, nails and sweat and oil glands
all work together to shield you from all the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.180
things out there that are out to get you:
excessive sunlight, infections, abrasions,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899
and just, you know, getting poked by sharp
sticks and stuff.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.429
But beyond that, this system is also vital
to how you sense the world around you.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.770
Your skin is loaded with structures that are
actually part of your nervous system -- called

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.270
cutaneous sensory receptors -- they’re what
receive stimuli from the outside environment

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.600
and send them to your brain.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.539
These receptors, or corpuscles, as they’re
sometimes called, register all of the different

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.390
sensations that you associate with touch.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.579
Your tactile corpuscles, for instance, are
what make you constantly aware of the tag

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.330
that’s scratching at the back of your neck,
while your lamellar corpuscles register the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.240
sense of pressure, like when someone puts
their hand on your shoulder.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.830
Your hair follicles have receptors, too, which
is why you can feel a slight breeze on your

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.040
skin or through your hair.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.670
Now, on the less-sexy front, your integumentary
system also plays a role in the excretion

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.690
of waste, though not as big as a role as we’re
often led to believe.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
Most nitrogen-containing wastes like urea,
uric acid, and ammonia are disposed of through

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.560
your urine, but small amounts are eliminated
through your skin in sweat.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.780
But despite what you may be told at the beginning
of your hot-yoga class, there isn’t much

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.200
evidence that suggests that heavy sweating
actually rids your body of any extra toxins

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.380
-- if anything, you’re just losing more
water.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.300
When you do exercise, though, you call on
another of your skin’s lesser-known functions

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
-- as a handy blood storage unit.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.360
About 5 percent of your entire blood volume
is retained in your skin at any given time.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.580
And when you suddenly need more blood supplied
to your organs, like when you’re working out,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.720
your nervous system constricts your dermal blood
vessels to squeeze that extra blood into circulation.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.860
Now, during these times of exertion, both
your blood and your sweat glands work together

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.300
to perform a key function: regulating your
body temperature.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.960
Even without exercise, your body oozes out
about half a liter of sweat per day, in an

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.140
effort to keep you at a comfortable temperature.
That’s just your normal, barely noticeable

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.680
sweat called insensible perspiration.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.380
But on a hot day, or if you’re on the dance
floor exerting yourself, that sweat becomes

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.340
much more noticeable. Such sensible perspiration could
produce as much as 12 LITERS of sweat per day!

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.990
Now, if the temperature gets chilly, the surface
of your skin can lose a lot of heat, because

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.640
it has so much warm blood behind it. To regulate
that heat loss, your dermal blood vessels

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.080
constrict, causing your blood to head deeper
into your tissues and help keep your vital organs warm.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.670
Once things warm up, those blood vessels in
the skin gradually relax, and allow that blood

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.690
to return to the surface.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.790
You’ve probably noticed that if you’re
cold for too long, your skin may lose some

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.110
of its color -- or even turn pale blue if
you’re light-skinned -- as that blood retreats

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.230
from the surface.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.480
And in fact, like a litmus test for your body,
changes in the color of your skin can indicate

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.480
a number of homeostatic imbalances.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.120
Blue skin, or cyanosis, in Caucasian people
may indicate heart failure, poor circulation,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.370
or severe respiratory issues. That’s because
blood that’s been depleted of oxygen turns

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.230
darker in color, and when seen through the
tissue of lips or skin, it can look bluish.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.840
A yellowing of the skin, called jaundice,
usually signifies liver disorder, as yellow

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.049
bile starts accumulating in the blood stream.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.480
Reddened skin, or erythema, could indicate
a fever, inflammation, or allergy -- all of

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.310
these conditions cause blood vessels to expand
and more blood to flow to the skin’s surface.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.430
Of course, human skin color spans a pretty
wide spectrum, so some of these conditions

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.330
are easier to diagnose by looking for discolorations
of other tissues, like mucous membranes and

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.110
the beds of finger and toenails.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.120
However light or dark your skin color is,
though, you can thank your melanin for it.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.230
You’ll remember that melanin is a pigment
produced by the melanocyte cells in your epidermis.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.280
Melanin has two forms, producing pigments
that range in color from reddish yellow to

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.710
brownish black.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.430
Because its main job is to protect us from
the sun’s ultraviolet rays, it makes sense

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.500
that, in the distant past, the distribution of these
different skin tones was not at all random.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.400
Historically, where solar radiation is more
intense, higher concentrations of deep-colored

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.930
melanin became an advantage for the protection
it provided.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.120
But closer to the poles, where those solar
rays are weaker and more diffuse, lower concentrations

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.240
of melanin allowed people to collect what
sunlight was available, to manufacture vitamin D.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.210
‘Cause the fact is, we all need some level
of sunlight to hit our skin to survive.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.510
Your bones require vitamin D to keep producing
new bone cells, and it’s the only vitamin

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.700
that your body can actually produce on its
own. Your skin cells contain a molecule that

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.320
converts to vitamin D when it comes in contact
with UV light.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.180
From there the vitamin heads through your
bloodstream to your liver and kidneys where

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.860
it truly becomes activated D, also called calcitriol,
which is circulated to all the bones of your body.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.940
But let’s not just be skin-deep here -- your
integumentary system also involves your so-called

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.600
skin appendages -- your hair, nails, sweat
and sebaceous, or oil glands, which can each

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.250
be fascinating as well as frustrating in its
own way.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.590
If you’re like some people I know and you
spend a fortune on hair conditioner? That’s

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.840
because your cuticles are out of control.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.270
All of your hairs, or pili, are basically
just flexible strands of dead keratin protein

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.520
cells, like your fingernails.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.040
And the outermost layer of these dead cells,
called the cuticle, looks like it’s made

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.950
of overlapping roof shingles. So what you’re
paying the conditioner to do is even out the

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.840
rough surface between those cells of the cuticle
to make it look smooth.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.370
Now if you pluck out a strand of your hair
you will be in pain, but you will also have

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.040
the opportunity to notice that it has two
main regions -- the shaft -- where the keratinization

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.120
is complete -- and the root -- the part inside the
follicle where keratinization is still happening.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.740
Each follicle is just a tube of epidermal
cells, and just like in your epidermis, the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.650
cells at the bottom of each follicle are young
and fresh, continually dividing and pushing

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.070
older cells up through the skin and into the
open air.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.120
And your finger- and toenails pretty much
grow the same way -- starting at the back

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.470
of the nail bed where new cells divide at
the root and get pushed forward, creating

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.590
the scaly-hard keratin that you paint with
polish and keep trimmed during flip-flop season.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.010
But there’s probably no other part of the
integumentary system that you spend more money

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.900
on trying to control than your sweat and oil
glands.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.520
You’ve got up to three million tiny sudoriferous,
or sweat glands distributed throughout your

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.860
body. These guys secrete your salty, watery
sweat, and they come in two types: eccrine

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.669
and apocrine.

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.300
Your eccrine sweat glands are more abundant
-- they’re in your palms, forehead, and

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.290
in the soles of your feet.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.680
They’re just simple coiled tubes that start
in the dermis, extend through a duct, and

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.860
open into a pore on the surface of your skin.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.510
Your apocrine sweat glands are a slightly
different story. You only have about 2000

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.270
of these, and they start cookin’ around
puberty, emptying into the hair follicles

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.930
around your armpits and groin.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.960
These glands secrete a kind of deluxe sweat,
with fats and proteins in it. It’s more

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.330
viscous and sometimes yellowish in color.
When bacteria on the skin get a hold of this

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.860
sweat, it gets odorific, creating what we
generically call body odor.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.820
Deodorants don’t affect how much you sweat,
but they do reduce those smells by attacking

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.930
the stink-making bacteria, while antiperspirants
do the opposite, using ingredients like aluminum

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.050
to block your sweat glands and actually keep
you from perspiring.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.900
Some researchers believe these glands may
be the human equivalent of other animals’

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.490
musky sex scent glands. So while you might
not want to stink up a whole room, a little

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.790
bit of body odor might actually get you a
mate.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.680
Mammary glands, which secrete milk in lactating
people, and ceruminous glands, the ones that

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.490
make your cerumen, or earwax, are two other
types of modified apocrine sweat glands.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.070
Finally, your sebaceous, or oil glands are
found everywhere but the thick skin in your

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.930
palms and foot soles. Their ducts are smaller
on your limbs, but they’re pretty big on

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.870
your face, and neck, and upper chest.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:33.419
Most of your sebaceous glands secrete their
sebum, an oily substance, into hair follicles

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.699
where it can travel to the surface of your
skin.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:40.800
And while yes, they cause wicked pimples,
their primary goal is to soften and lubricate

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.300
your skin and hair, and help slow water loss
from the skin in dry environments.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.680
Try to remember that the next time you have
a break-out before a big date or job interview.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.009
Maybe it’ll make you feel better. It probably
won’t.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.249
The irony here is that about half of the things
I showed at the beginning of this episode

00:08:54.249 --> 00:08:59.499
are used to wash away our natural protective
moisturizing oils, while the other half are

00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:02.069
there to add them back through lotions and
conditioners!

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:05.149
Deodorant, though. I think we’re all glad
that exists.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:09.639
Today you learned how your integumentary system
protects your body, senses the outside world,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:14.509
helps excrete waste, stores blood, regulates
temperature, makes vitamin D, indicates signs

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:18.249
of poor health, and gives you zits. We also
talked about how your hair and nails grow,

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:23.249
the difference between your eccrine and apocrine
sweat glands, and your sebaceous oil glands.
