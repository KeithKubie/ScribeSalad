00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.930
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Hello everybody.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.780
My name is Mary Louise Kelly.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.580
I am the National Security
Correspondent for NPR.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.120
I write spy thrillers
and cover the spy beat.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.630
And I am delighted to be here as
part of the National Book Festival.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.670
And I have been especially
looking forward

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.250
to the chance to talk to you.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.390 position:56%
Please welcome Anne-Marie Slaughter.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.190
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Thank you.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.990
[ Applause ]

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.430
&gt;&gt; So I will introduce
Anne-Marie as President and CEO.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.160
Of the New America Foundation.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.710
Which is a think-tank
based here in Washington.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.750
However, I suspect that
most people in this room.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.840
Knew you, at least initially,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.860
because of a little
article that you wrote.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.340
Which electrified the country,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.230
I think it's safe to
say, four years ago.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.380
The article was headlined, "Why
Women Still Can't Have It All."

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.240
It was the cover of <i>The Atlantic</i>
magazine, in the summer of 2012.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.630
It, overnight, became
the most read article

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.290
in the history of that magazine.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.480
And you have since expanded on
it and turned it into a book.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.300
Which is what we are
here to talk about.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.600
Called <i>Unfinished Business</i>.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Congratulations.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.200
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Thank you.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.500
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And welcome.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.800
[ Applause ]

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.520
So I actually want to
start with that headline.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.300 position:56%
Because, as I say, I've been looking
forward to this conversation.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
And yesterday, I tweeted, why
women still can't have it all.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.570
Looking forward to
putting that question

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.570
to Ann-Marie Slaughter
at the book festival.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.870
And you tweeted back.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.620
And you said, we've actually
moved past that question.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.920
And I thought --

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.220
[ Laughter ]

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.520
-- We have?

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.820
How did I miss that?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.120
[ Laughter ]

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.420
Let me throw that question
to you first.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.720
Have you figured it all out?

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.020
You've cracked this,
and we can have it all?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020
And you're here to tell us how?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.560
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
So, I'm delighted to be

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.450
at the National Book Festival.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.480
What is better than a day
entirely devoted to books?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.010
I -- it is -- it's the best.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.410
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.180
And I love the fact that our
conversation started on Twitter.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.420
And now continues today.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.210
And so what I meant was.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.370
One of the things I've learned
since writing that article.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.320
Is that we really want to move
past the frame of having it all.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.010
And actually, Rebecca Traister
originally wrote a post.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.390
After my article came out.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.310
And taught me things I didn't know.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.720
Which is that having it all
came from Helen Gurley Brown.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.020
The editor of <i>Cosmo</i>.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.020
I think she had a different idea
of what having it all means.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.250
But, more broadly, it
makes women sound selfish.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.300
Right? We're living in
a country where millions

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.770 position:56%
of people are trying to have enough.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.320
To simply get by.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.380
And to pose it as 'can
I have it all?'

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.570
Even though you can say that's
part of the American DNA.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.280 position:56%
I think, starts the whole
conversation off in the wrong place.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.050
So I no longer use the phrase.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.960
I talk about equality
between men and women.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.430
Or gender equality.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.000
And I talk about how can all of us.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 position:56%
And that means men as well as women.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.340
And I am so thrilled to see
so many men in this audience.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.220
How can men and women work?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.030
Live in a way that
they can work and care

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.050
for their loved ones
at the same time?

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.100
You notice, I also
didn't use balance.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.870
How can we fit those
two things together?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.170
That's the question.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Okay.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.770
And I want to hear some of
your specific thoughts on that.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.070
But before we get ahead
of ourselves.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.030 position:56%
Let me let you just tell your story.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.090
Of how you came to write that
article and then the book.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.120
You -- I wonder if you can
take us back to that moment?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.670
Where you had finally
gotten the dream job.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.270
You're this high-power position
at the State Department.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.210
And realized it wasn't
working [inaudible].

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.670
It wasn't working -- you weren't
able to do the job you needed to do

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.970
at home with your family.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.270
What happened?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.320
Tell us where you were and
what was going on in your life.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.940
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: So
the first thing you say is yes.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.230
This was absolutely a dream job.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.880
To be the first woman
director of policy planning.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.810
It's the big think-job
in the State Department.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.910
Secretary Clinton wanted
to put a woman in that job.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.440
To show that, you know, we
could do the big thinking too.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.260
And it, you know, I was there
in her early morning meeting.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.450
Every morning, at 8:45.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.360
That's very heady.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.660
And I loved it.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.230
I left my family in Princeton.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.410
There was no way to move my
husband and sons to Washington.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.540 position:56%
I mean, they were at that point in
middle school and elementary school.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.490
My husband teaches in Princeton.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.010
We would have uprooted them.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.410
My husband would've had to commute.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.930
That was never an option.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.590
In fact, my sons didn't
want me to leave.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.260
But once I said, well, how
about moving to Washington?

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.640
It was, "Bye, mom."

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.210
You know, it's like, no.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.510
They were not moving.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.810
So I --

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: So
you're doing the train commute?

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.410
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
So I would leave.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.710
I would literally leave the
house at 5 A.M. every morning.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.530
Feeling like kind of
a thief in the night.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.040
All three -- got boys are sleeping.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.340
My husband and my sons.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.640
And I would come down here.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.070
Make it in time for
the early meeting.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.660
And go back late on Friday.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.570
So it meant I had two days a week.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.870
And, I mean, look.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.220
People, many people don't
see their families enough.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.710
But it was, it was hard.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.270
But it was doable.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.810
My husband stepped up
and was the lead parent.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.560
And then, as I wrote,
my elder son was,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.390
I think, a not unusual teenager.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.860
I mean, it's not that he --

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Which is to say, what?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.460 position:56%
A complete nightmare at [inaudible]?

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.760
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
More or less.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.060
Yeah.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.360
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Having
a new teenager in our house.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.660
I'll back that up.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.960
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yeah,
so then he turned into, you know.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.040
Kind of, you come downstairs
and say "Good morning."

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.340
And he'd take your head off.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.250
And you'd say, "Excuse
me for living."

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.060
And he would -- but he
was making bad choices.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.800
And indeed, you know,
I didn't expect that.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.940
He was with the wrong crowd.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.380
Many parents know this.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.330
He was tuning out at school.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.380
He started getting into
trouble with the local police.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.680
Little stuff.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.930
But enough that, you
know, I'd get a call.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.890
And Andy would say, you
know, "He's been suspended."

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.500
And I'd be, "Suspended?"

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.900
You know, it was -- I
was not prepared for it.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.430
And it got to the point
that I was literally asking.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.820
What am I doing here?

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.680
You know, why am I here?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.750
When my son so clearly
needs me and his father.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.670
It wasn't like I was
going to go save the day.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.160
It was, we needed both
hands on deck.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.240
And that really just starting

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.300
to change the way I'd
always thought about this.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.510
I had always said to younger women.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.880
Of course you can do it.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.910
You just have to want
to want it enough.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.210
And I believed that.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.980
And I knew I had a
lot of advantages.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.500
A flexible job and money.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.800
I knew that.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.540
But I still really
thought, you can do it.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.220
And when this happened, I
suddenly realized, wait a minute.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.420
All these other women
who had a divorce.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.940
Or a child with special needs.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.240
Or had to move.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.680
Or don't have the advantages I do.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.730 position:56%
It's not that they want to drop out.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.900
They're simply choosing
the people they love.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.260 position:56%
Over the work they may equally love.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.890
But that's something we
should admire and celebrate.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.640
Not accuse them of having
failed some, you know, idea.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.410
That they're supposed
to be able to do it all.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.150
And the other thing was.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.650
There's a huge number of things
we could do in our society.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.940
To make it a lot easier
for women, as well as men.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.800
So that's why I wrote the article.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: So let me walk
you through some of the strategies.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.950
Because I think we're all
sitting here thinking.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.170
Okay, so how do we --
it's not have it all.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.750
That's not the way we
should be framing the goal.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.370
How do we -- how do we try
to have the work we love?

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.510
And take care of the family
that we love at the same time?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.830 position:56%
One of the things that intrigued me.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.430
That you propose, is
interval training.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.730
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yeah.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.030
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Explain what you mean by that.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.330
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
So in the book --

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Because
I'm visioning a treadmill.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.030
And that's just not what it is.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.040
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: So one of
the core reasons this is so hard.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.720
Is that we still have a 1950s
idea of what a career looks like.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.030
You come out of school.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.840
You plunge into your career.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.020
You start climbing this ladder.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.590
In your 30s and 40s, or
in my case, 40s and 50s.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.560
When you are having children.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.550
When, typically, when most
of us are having children.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.480
That's right at the heart of
the hard part of the ladder.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.770
And you're soaring up,
and you reach your peak.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.180
Sometime in your 50s
or your early 60s.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.680 position:56%
You retire at 65, and you die at 75.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.610
That isn't our lives.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.690
That's just not our lives.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.360
Girls today have a
life expectancy of 86.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.890
Which means a large number of
people are expected to live to 100.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.050
And you can read plenty of things
on the cover of <i>TIME</i> magazine.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.680
That says we're going
to live to 120.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.900
And I don't know what
we're going to do then.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.730
But there's plenty of time.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.300
If Hillary Clinton wins, she'll
be 70 when she becomes president.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.540
And she didn't start
her political career

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.830 position:56%
until after Chelsea went to college.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.170
You know, she was a lawyer
and she did lots of things.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.290
But she started --
she ran for Senate.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.590
She ran for president.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.890
She became secretary of state.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.190
She ran for president again.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.700
All after her daughter
went to college.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.780
So interval training
is the idea that all

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.310 position:56%
of us would think about our careers.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.380
As periods where we go hard.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.680
Come out of school.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.980
You're young.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.280
When I was young, I pulled
plenty of all-nighters.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.580
You know, I could travel.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.880
I could do all that.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.180
I didn't have a house or a husband.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.640
Or, you know, I was free.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.840
You go hard and then you slow down.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.400
This is how athletes get
into peak performance.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.700
Training, right?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.000
You think about on a Stairmaster.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.990
You go hard and you slow down.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.670
And women and men should be
able to think of their careers.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.160
In terms of multiple intervals.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.290
So that they're going
to work longer.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.160
But they're also going to have
time for the people they love.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.810
Because your kids are
only young once.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.380
And your parents are only
aging and needing you, once.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.250
Or a spouse who is ill.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.950
Or anybody else in your family.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.680
And in -- really, there's no
reason there isn't time for both.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.890
Except for we have this
very artificial idea

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.890
of how you have to work.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
So where are you

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.590 position:56%
in your interval training right now?

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.260
Because I have to pause and note.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.290
You decided to leave
the high-powered job

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.590
at the State Department.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.000
And kind of, you know,
downshift, let's call it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.340
Leaning out, whatever
you want to call it.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.550
And I have to know that
your version of leaning out.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.140
Involves being a tenured
Princeton professor.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.760
Writing a best-selling, <i>New
York Times</i>, best-seller book.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.640
Founding a think-tank
here in Washington.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.460
And you've got another book
coming out in the spring.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.040
So if that is leaning
out, count me in.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.060
[ Laughter ]

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.970
Where are you now?

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.130
What's -- I mean, how's your
family doing now, if I can ask?

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: So, I mean,
one of the great ironies, of course.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.770 position:56%
Is I write this article about
wanting to be home with my children.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.860
It exploded.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.880 position:56%
And suddenly, I had more invitations
than I knew what to do with.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.030
And I was spending less
time with my children.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.310
And every now and again,
one of my sons will grumble.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.240
I'm going to write an
<i>Atlantic</i> article.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.410
And I'm going to tell you
what it was really like.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.930
That mom was never home.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.740
So I am very high-energy.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.140
No question.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.320
And yes. So what -- but
here's the difference.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.990
I still work a lot.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.870
I love my work.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.630
But there's a huge difference
between what I'm doing.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.900
And taking that really big job.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.140
One more step up in
the State Department.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.620
I would have been an undersecretary
or a deputy secretary.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.080
One more step up as a
professor, or I'd been a dean.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.200
I'd be a president of a University.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.420
Those jobs, your time
is not your own.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.170
You cannot say, it's
my son's birthday.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.720
It's a period of vacation.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.020
Whatever it is.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.340
What I'm doing, I'm
running an organization.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.790
But it's 200 people,
and I'm the boss.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.520
So I can be here two days a week.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.460
But then be home at other times.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.690
I can adjust.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.220
When I needed to take my son to
look at colleges, we could do that.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.600
So I do hope that there is another
really big job in my future.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.840
But it will be after both
sons have left the house.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.880
And so what I've done is to choose
the kinds of work I want to do.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.760
To create a lot of flexibility.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: So talk to
us about a phrase you just used.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.860
The phrase lead parent.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.210
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.770
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: You and I
have talked about that before.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.020
And when I mention that, I'm
always interested to see.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.180
It's men who seem to
really relate to that.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.480
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Because it seems

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.850
to invite a bigger,
more creative vision.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.430
Of how a family can work.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.410
And speak to this idea
of interval training.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.860
And one of you is lead parenting.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.670
While the other one goes
out and does something.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.970
And --

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.270
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
That's right.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
-- Then you flip it.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.870 position:56%
Is that the way it's worked for you?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.170
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
I was going to say yes.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.270
And then I'm thinking, my
husband would say, yeah, my turn.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.110
My turn's next.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.130
So I thought really
hard about lead parent.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.680 position:56%
And talked about it with my husband.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.980
And you're absolutely right.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.440
It is chosen, in part,
because stay-at-home dad.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.790
Is not a status that
most men aspire to.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.920
It is -- and I don't like
stay-at-home mom either.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.520
It implies, you know,
you're a professional.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.820
You're in the office.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.730
And if you're not, if you're
parenting, you're staying at home.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.220
I -- lead parenting is what
my husband's been doing.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.040
That means parenting is hard.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.040
It involves all sorts of things.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.420
He's taking the lead.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.840
He's the one who's there.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.750
He's the one who may call
for all sorts of things.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.180
I'm still actively a parent.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.530
But when somebody's got to
be there, it's my husband.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.790
And yes, I imagine that men

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.630
and women can be lead
parents, and trade off.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.770
And the men who are lead parents.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.760
The reward is they get that special
relationship with their kids.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.290
That women have traditionally had.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.540
And most of us don't
want to give up.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.840
And they can work too.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.910
So it is a very deliberate
construction

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.860
of parenting or caregiving.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.670
You could say, I'm the lead
caregiver for my own parent.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.220
In a way that makes
it equally important.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.400
And not this residual, oh,
I'm just the person at home.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I
mean, it sounds like some

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.000
of the point you're making.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.300
Is it matters what we call things.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.600
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.900
It does.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: A lead
parent who happens to be male.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.500
Is the same thing as a
stay-at-home dad, but --

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: It matters.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: -- It
matters what words we use

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.400
when we talk about it.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.700
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
Well, we used to --

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.000
I lived through changing
Mrs. and Miss,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.550
to Ms. And when that
first was proposed.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.110
It was like, oh, you've
got to be kidding.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.250
M S, Ms.. Although I
was from the south.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.700
So Ms. was pretty common.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.830
But that made a huge difference.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.120
Because before, the thing
you knew about a female.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.760
Was, was she married or not.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.150
And that was sending the signal

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.280
that that was the most important
thing to know about her.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.750
Was she Ms. or Mrs.?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.680
So it does matter how
we talk about things.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.290
We talk about same-sex marriage.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.250
We talk -- we reframe these issues.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Okay,
so here is my confession.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.800
Your publisher was kind enough
to courier your book to me.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.630
At my hotel room, where I was
in New York, on a work trip.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.160
So that I could read it
before I interviewed you.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.360
And I was trying to read it
on the train, on the way home.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.970
And the soccer carpool of
one of my kids fell apart.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.400
And I'm trying and fielding
these frantic phone calls.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.490
From a stranded child
on the soccer field.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.790
In the quiet car.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.090
So we sort that out.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.390
[ Laughter ]

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.690
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
We've all been there.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
I'm trying to read it

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.290
in between doing interviews
for my day job.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.340
And my other son fractured
his ankle.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.850
And we end up in the
emergency pediatrician visit.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.150
Etcetera, etcetera.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.450
Long story short, I end

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.380
up frantically reading the
last chapters in the taxi.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.710
On the way to interview you.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.730
[ Laughter ]

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.210
Which prompts me to wonder.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.930
Are the people who would
benefit from reading your book?

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.230
And some of the ideas in it,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.620
too frazzled to find
the time to read it?

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.700
[ Laughter ]

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.260
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Well, I
have heard from a number of people.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.880
That their mother gave
them the book.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.000
In other words, the person
that had the time to read.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.680
And my mother often now reads
things I don't have time to read.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.590
And lets me know about them.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:57.120
So I do think, yes, the people
who are in the midst of this.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.770
Either mothers or fathers, maybe
can read it chapter by chapter.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.590
And I did have people even
with my <i>Atlantic</i> article.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.990
Telling me, it's 13,000 words.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.330
You can't be a working mother.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.730
Because you know we don't
have time to read that.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.130
I -- you know, what
I would just say is.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.820
I read first thing,
late, last at night.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.660
Always. And I actually
start every day.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.920
And I will wake up
earlier to do this.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.320
I read for 20 minutes
with my cup of coffee.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.620
Because that's --

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.920
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Just
pleasure, or catching up on --

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.220
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Pleasure.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.520
Pleasure. No, no, no.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.820
Only pleasure.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.120
It can fiction or nonfiction.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.420
I generally read fiction at night,
and nonfiction in the morning.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.900
Because my brain is
fresher in the morning.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.770
But it's just this little island.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.710
Of that cup of coffee and my book.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.280
A lot of people meditate.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.270 position:56%
I think about books when I meditate.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.580
So it's just -- and so I think
you can make time to read.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.630
But I agree, I've -- we've all
been to where you described.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: So
you mentioned your boss

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.840
at State Department
was Hillary Clinton.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.140
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yep.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.580
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: A few of her
emails have been making their way

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.920
into the public domain lately.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.240
And your name comes
up in some of them.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.300
And I want to ask about one, in
particular, that caught my eye.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:11.600
This was an email that you wrote
around Christmastime, 2009.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.900
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yep.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And
you wrote to Hillary Clinton,

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.620
begging her to take a day off.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.520
What prompted that?

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.900
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
I just have to say,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.200
before I answer this question.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.380
When that email came out and
people started calling me about it.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.460
I thought, I can't believe this.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.860
I wrote her hundreds of emails.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.820
About things like Middle East
peace, and Syria and China.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.830 position:56%
And all anybody wants to know about.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.050
Is my asking her to take time off.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.070
So even there, it was
kind of a reframing

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.190
of what I've been known for.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.660 position:56%
So that was -- what I actually said.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.060 position:56%
Was, there I was, we're all working.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.590
My husband kind of
believes in Santa Claus.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.590
Which is to say that Christmas
magically appears every year.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.770
I mean, he is -- he's wonderful.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.590
But stockings, and he cooks.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.800
But somebody else organizes
the meal.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.430
So what I was -- I
wrote her, and said.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.010
Would you leave on the 22nd?

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.740
Because if you leave on
the 22nd, we can all leave.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.060
And then a lot of people are
going to be, need to be home.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.130
I needed to be home to
make Christmas happen.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.690
And so I wrote her that.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.540
And she did.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.610
And I knew, because that's
the kind of person she is.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.830
That if I framed it that way.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.380
If I said, take a day off because
you've been working too hard.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.090 position:56%
No. If I said, leave two days early,

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.980
so everybody else can
have the holiday.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.280
She would respond.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.580
And she did.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And she did?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.180
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
And she did.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.480
She left and absolutely anybody.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.780
Anybody in Washington knows,
if the principle is there.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.080
Nobody else leaves.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.660
Right? You have to
-- and so she did.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.220
And then all the rest of us
felt like we could take the day.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.570
You know, vacation
days to go home early.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.870
And she did.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Did you
watch her struggle with the juggle?

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.170
The work-life balance?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.470
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: No.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.250
Because, again, I mean
she's at that stage of life.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.750
Where her family is her
foundation and support.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.330
Rather than her, you know,
needing to attend to them.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.630
So she did go home
almost every weekend.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.600
To be with Bill Clinton.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.490
And she would come home, come
back, refreshed on Sundays.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.720
You rarely saw her
on the Sunday shows.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.020
Only occasionally.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.600
She really would go home.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.090
And it was clear.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.790
I always tell this story.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.370
That before Chelsea got
married, we were in Beijing.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.170
And she was being interviewed
as U.S. Secretary of State.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.360
By some Chinese TV interviewer.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.700
And right at the end
of the interview.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.340
He said to her, "Well, what
about Chelsea's wedding?"

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.130
And she said, with just right
off the top of her head.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.870
She said, "Oh, well,
that's my real life.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.170
" And I thought, yeah.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.470
That's the way I feel too.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.770
That's my real life.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.080
And so, you know, her
family, Chelsea

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.170
and her husband, were
hugely important.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.740
But they were supports, not drains.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: But I want to
stay with this idea of, you know.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.500
You're in this high-power
job at the State Department.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.910
And you're thinking
about, oh, my gosh.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.980
Who's going to put the Christmas
lights on the Christmas tree?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.000
Because I -- you know.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.830
And for so many of us who've
struggled, trying to figure out.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.350
Even, I guess my point is,
I mean, you do knowledge.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.030
You're writing from a
privileged position.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.330
And that, for a lot of people.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.690
The struggle isn't,
can you have it all?

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.910
It's like, can you have enough
to get dinner on the table?

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.210
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And pay the
electric bill to keep the lights on.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.980
But that someone with your
resources and your position.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.960
You're still struggling
with the fact

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.090
that there are only
24 hours in the day.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.390
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.690
So a couple things.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.830
Yes, absolutely.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.570
So first of all, I'm
really easy on myself.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.520
As a -- in the sense that we just
knew we were going to drop balls.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.210
We told our sons early on.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.790
Like, we are not going to
remember to get this form in.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.470
We are not going to
be the class parents.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.270
We're just not.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:11.250
And I figured that parenting
them the way we, best we could.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.550
With a lot of love.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.280
And was going to be more important.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.220
Than a lot of activities I
might otherwise have done.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.520
And the other thing.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.910
And this is, I write about
this at length, in this book.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.860 position:56%
As the woman, you do have to let go.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.330
Right? My husband was
willing to be lead parent.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.800
But at some point, he said to me.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.250
"I'm doing this.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.840
But I'm doing this my way.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.130
You are not micromanaging
how I parent.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.230
If you want to do that,
you come home."

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.110
Right? And he does things
very differently than I do.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.340
I always say, you know,
I'd come home and want them

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.850
to clean their rooms and all this.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.530
And he would spend the weekend
showing them all the Marx

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.830
Brothers movies.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.130
Like --

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.430
[ Laughter ]

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:59.400
-- And I came to realize, you know,
you really, you do have to assume.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.720
That a man is as capable
at home, and as a parent.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.020
As you are in the office.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.980
He is going to do it
differently, often.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.020
And, you know, everybody's
personalities differ.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.420
Sometimes the man is the neat
nick, and the woman isn't.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.040
I mean, it's not -- there
are many differences.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.650
But in the office, even though I do
something differently than a man.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.580
I assume I know what I'm doing.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.540
And I had to come to accept that
although I thought I knew better.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.840
Because my mother raised me.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.140
And her mother raised her.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.720
And her mother raised her.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.310
Who is to say I knew better?

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.840
And he certainly thinks
he knows what he's doing.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.140
And I had to let go.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.360
And so that -- and
balls got dropped.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.410
Things that I thought needed
to be done were not done.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.820
But things that he thought
were important did get done.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.570
And as I look at our sons now.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.760
I think probably knowing
the Marx Brothers movies.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.490
Is more important than
whatever it was.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.790
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Than
whether their beds were made.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.090
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.390
Their beds aren't made.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.580
I can promise you that.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: As you've
talked to people about this.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.120
And been on book tour.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.420
Do you find that men
are as interested

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.770
in this conversation as women are?

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.160 position:56%
I mean, it will not escape
anyone's notice that we're two women

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.460
up here, talking about it.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.760
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes, yes.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I
do notice, like you did,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.360
the number of men in the audience.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.660
Which is great.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.960
But is it a different conversation

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.810
when you find yourself
fielding questions from men?

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.110
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
So I've never been

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.710
in an audience only of men.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.110
That would be great, actually.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:28.550
I have been in a growing number of
audiences that are almost 50-50.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.230
And they are student audiences.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.760
Because young people,
like in business school

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.920
or law school, or university.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.220
Couples come.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.880
And they're assuming that they're
going to both have to do this.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.220
And, you know, I write about
questions and conversations.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.690
You need to have with each other.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.620
To make sure that's
going to be a real thing.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.230
And not just a paper thing.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.740
Because most of my friends
thought it was to be equal too.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.120
And then, when the
guy got a promotion.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.880
And it never occurred to
him, he wouldn't take it.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.790
And then she couldn't
take her promotion.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.880
Because they could both do it.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Like what?

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.870
What are some of the
questions we should be asking?

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.220
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
That's the key one.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.220
Is if, you know, we
support each other's career.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.880
Will you move for me?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.870
Right? If I get a fabulous
job somewhere else.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.170
Will you move?

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.990
Will you leave your job, so I
can take this great opportunity?

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.160
Or will you defer your
promotion so I can take mine?

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.930
That is not generally part
of what most men expect.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.120
But to your original question.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.440
I think this generation of
men want a number of things.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.370
I think they want a closer
relationship with their kids.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.460
Than many of them had
with their fathers.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.500
Just like I wanted to work
in a way my mother didn't.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.850
Many men think, why shouldn't I
have that bond with my children?

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.420
And why shouldn't I have
that side of my life too?

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.100
And lots of men I know
think it's crazy

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.150
that women get maternity leave.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.950
And they get a week.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.390
Right? That's not fair.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.850
Right? That means a mother will
bond more closely with the child.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.470
Not because she's a woman.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.070
But because she's the
one who's, you know,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.710
feeding and diapering the child.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.340
And so if a man does that.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.490
And we have all the same-sex
couples and single fathers.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.990
Of course men can do that.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.690
So I do think -- I
think of my generation.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.590
And certainly my father's
generation, no.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.460
This is a female conversation.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.520
But I think for the younger
generation, it's both.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.470
But again, we have to
assume when men talk about.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.240
What they're doing
with their children.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.880
It's probably a different
conversation in many ways.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.180
And that's normal.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.770
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Let me ask you about some

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.050
of the nitty-gritty details.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.650
As we talk about this stuff.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:42.660
I noticed you were tweeting
this week about a house bill.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.960
That would require
baby changing stations.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.070
In men's and women's room
in federal buildings.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.370
And putting aside the question

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.660
of whether we will even have
separate men's and women's rooms.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.960
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
Yes, exactly.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Five years from now.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.560
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yep.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I
noticed here, we don't.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.820
Unisex. But this should be
as much a men's challenge,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.320
problem, as women's.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.180
And I wondered when I
read that, you know.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.850
Whether you've been on this path.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.910
It's great to think the big
strategic policy thoughts.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.370
But you've also got to
get the details right.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.300
To make any of this work for us.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.600
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yep, yep.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.020
Yes. And I -- you know,
somebody tweeted that at me.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.320
And I thought, yes.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.650
That's a classic example
of reinforcing stereotypes.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.840
Right? Because we are assuming
that men don't change diapers.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.220
That's assuming that women do.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.340
That's assuming that
women are the caregivers

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.640
and men are the breadwinners.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.080
And that's exactly
what we have to undo.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.910
So something as small as that.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.640
And is like the way we talk.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.360
Is very important.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.910
But also, if you are
a single father.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.680
What -- where are you
supposed to change your child?

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.980
Or not a single father.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.850
You're just a father who
is with their children.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.710
What are you supposed to do?

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.370
I mean, you ought to be able to
have a surface to change your baby.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.760
Just as much as a mother does.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.520
So those little things do matter.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.970
And they change our assumptions.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I want to
open it up to questions in a moment.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.230
But let me throw one more at you.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.180
Which is, I have to ask.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.800
We've been talking
about Hillary Clinton.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.410
Your name keeps appearing on lists
of possible cabinet secretaries.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.190 position:56%
Should there be a President Clinton.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.990
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
Unprompted by me, I should add.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.290
But --

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Unsolicited.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.880
But, I mean, where are you
in your personal journey?

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.190
If I can call it that.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.650
Would -- if the right
phone call were to come.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:35.880 position:56%
Are you at a point where you would
lean back into a big Washington job?

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.730
Where you don't have control over,
you know, it's my kids birthday.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.720
And I need to go.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.520
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
So, ideally, not quite yet.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.150
I mean, ideally, I'm very
committed to new American.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.500
I still have a son at home.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.980
Although not for that much longer.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.840
Oh, well, I say that.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.190
We are applying to college.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.680
So I'm going to assume
not for that much longer.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.030
You know, there are things that,
if the president asks you to do.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.480
And probably, for me particularly,
if she's the first woman president.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.780
You say yes.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.000
But I can say, I'm very committed.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.840
I promised the Board of New America

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.470
that I would be there
for five years.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.380
And I'm very committed
to building it.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.870
I certainly would hope to be there
by the end of her administration.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.870
But not necessarily
at the beginning.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.170
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: All right.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.470 position:56%
Let me open it up to your questions.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.770
I think we have microphones here.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.070
And forgive me.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.580
If you can line up at the mics.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.510
And we'll just go back and forth.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.020
If you care to identify
yourself, that would be great.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.320
Ask a question.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.620
And if you can keep it short.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.920
So we can get to as
many of you as possible.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.220
That would be great.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.680
Let me start with this
lady right here.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.470
Please, go ahead.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.070
I could tell where
you were pointing.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.370
I'm Sister Marge Clark.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.210
And I work with Network, which
is a national Catholic social

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.510
justice lobby.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.810
I'm very excited.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.130
I didn't -- I was excited,
looking at the title of your book.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:57.320
One of the things I
work on is legislation.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.520
To improve women's
places in the workplace.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.970
And there are some really
good bills out right now.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.800
And I was interested in
hearing what you said.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.330
About the changing table
in men's rooms and things.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.450
I wonder, are you putting
your name and your power?

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.630
Behind some of these other
bills that are out there?

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:20.850
In terms of things like
pregnancy adaptations.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.320
The things like paid
leave and sick leave.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.420
All really affect women
more than men.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.720
But they affect both.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.020
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.520
&gt;&gt; And I'm just wondering, are you
able to put your power behind that?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.820
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.120
Yes, and I'm glad you asked.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.180
Because, again, so the message
of the book is kind of twofold.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.280
That the unfinished business of the
women's movement is to value care.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.040
As much as we value competition.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.410
So traditional women's work, as
much as traditional men's work.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.180
And then to expect men and
women to do it equally.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.230
So valuing care is, there's
an entire legislative agenda.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.440
And we are seeing it

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.040
in this administrate --
in this election year.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.600
And it's important that we are.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.940
And we're seeing it from
Republicans and Democrats.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.480
I think of it as the care
agenda, not the women's agenda.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.120
Again, because I want to
undo these stereotypes.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.900
But it's the big three.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.780
It's paid family leave.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.080
It should -- we should just --

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.340
this is one place where we could
leapfrog the rest of the world.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.570
And get beyond maternity
leave, paternity leave.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.320
Leave to take care of elders.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.150
Just call it family leave.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.480
And make it available to everyone.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.670
Regardless of whom
they're caring for.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.780
So paid family leave is essential.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.560
And New America is working
hard on paid family leave.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.670 position:56%
Then, affordable, quality childcare.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.540
I'd say childcare and eldercare.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.320
But let's start with childcare.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.940
Because the cost of
childcare for two children.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.300
Is more expensive than the
cost of rent in all 50 states.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.770
And that's driving people
out of the workforce.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.420
So childcare is essential.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.610
And again, you're seeing,
Secretary Clinton has an important

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.910
proposal there.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.080
And then finally, real,
flexible work.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.890
Right? Not just, you
know, a day here or there.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.190
But the ability to work remotely.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.490
Or to come in late.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.790
Or to leave early.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:14.640
A whole set of policies
that other countries.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.850
At least our peer countries, have.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.750
And we can also encourage.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.050
So --

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.350
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: And that's
something you think should be

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.650
federally mandated?

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:24.950
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Well,
I -- so there are things like.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.330
There are things like,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.830
you can mandate not
discriminating against people.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.750
On the basis of part-time
work or flexible work.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.240
That one is harder to legislate.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.630
But there are ways that
you can encourage it.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.930
And provide incentives.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.230
And the first two.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.640
On paid family leave, I
think business is going

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.960
to want federal standards.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.840
Because right now,
we have four states.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.110
Including New York and California.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.800
So two huge states that
have paid family leave.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.260
And a bunch of cities.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.200
That means you're going to
have a patchwork, right?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.750 position:56%
It's going to be very unpredictable,
which city or state you're in.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.270
And gradually, then, business
would prefer one uniform standard.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:04.770
So that one, definitely.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.940
Childcare, you know,
President Nixon vetoed a bill.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.020
That had been passed by
both houses of Congress.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.200
For universal childcare, in 1971.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.670
It'd be great to get back there.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.770
But I'd settle for
lots of incentives.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.050
And other things that
encourage both on-site childcare

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.740
and community care.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
Okay, thank you.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.340
Question right here.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.910
My question is going to be about
transition in interval training.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.610
And my context is, I'm a
military family member.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.910
So my husband is active duty.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.010
He deployed, I ramp it up.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.920
I am also in the military,
as a reservist.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.230
And I have a civilian career.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.820
My turn to deploy is coming.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.120
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yeah.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.420
&gt;&gt; So how, when you're
not changing jobs?

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.170
But you are going to
have different abilities.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.910
In how much time you can devote
to that, and not everything else.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.210
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yep.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.670
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us, what have
your best practices been?

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.530
As you've gone through
some of those intervals?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.830
How did you transition?

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Absolutely.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.430
So thank you.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.730 position:56%
And first of all, I should just say.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.550
When I did feel like I
wasn't ever seeing my family.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.850
And this was hard.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:05.360
I would think to myself, you know.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.140
Our military deploy
for a year at a time.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.920
And I'm seeing my children
every sixth day.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.410
They're seeing -- they're not
seeing their family for a year.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.820
So I want to start by thanking you.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:18.510
For your service and
your husband's service.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:23.880
[ Applause ]

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.370
To your question, this
is really important.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.640
I mean, what we really
do need to do.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.000
Is change employer attitudes.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.610
So that when they see,
you know, a part-time job.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.940
Even no job for a while.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.970
They don't think, oh, I'm not
going to hire this person.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:44.730
I'm going to hire the person that
has that sterling 1950s resume.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.200
Where it just goes straight up.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.960
That's the most important
thing we can do.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.960
But beyond that, you do
need -- I say in the book.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.110
Don't drop out, defer.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.770
Right? So defer the big job.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.860
But keep your skills in.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.920
Keep your contacts ready.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.340
Think about things that, you know,

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.030
let's say you need
to learn fundraising.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.800
Or you need to learn
public speaking.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.430
Or having something written
with your name on it.

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.580
Would help your career
down the line.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.290
Use that time to do those things.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.180
That's also a better story.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.200
So you can say, yes, you know.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.440
It was my turn to be lead parent.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.370
During that time, I wrote this.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.810
Or I took on a new set of
experiences through volunteering.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.420
That, I say, think about
your career as a portfolio

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:33.000
of skills and experiences.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.710
And figure out where you can add,
even as you're being lead parent.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.010
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
That's great advice.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.500
Question here.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.800
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Phil.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.100
I'm a generic guy.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.510
[ Laughter ]

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Welcome.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:47.750
&gt;&gt; You're clearly very successful.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.230
And you talk about success,
and success is good.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.700
I think we all want
to be successful.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.240
But I think a big part of
work-life balance is failure.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.960
It's dealing with your inability to
work as hard as you want at work.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.260
Make a project go.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.710
Being absent from your kids
soccer game, etcetera, etcetera.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.320
Can you tell us about
a time when you failed?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.620
Seriously failed.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.210
Maybe a time when you and your
husband came close to divorce.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.730
Because you couldn't
balance your life and work.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.110
So that we have some perspective
on what it's really like.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.820
To really struggle.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.120
Thank you.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.420
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: Okay.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.720
So I will thank you
for the question.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.960
It's an important one.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.610
And I will say two things.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.660
So one, and I wrote about this.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.760
When my son was in first
grade -- my elder son.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.070
He was asked to draw his family.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.120
And he drew me as a laptop.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.220
[ Laughter ]

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.340
Not a person typing at a laptop.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.850
There was no person in the picture.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.610
There was just a laptop.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Ow!

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.210
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
That was not a good moment.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.100
Right? That he drew
his father cooking.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.210
Right? His father was
there, I wasn't.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.720
I was just become Dean of
the Woodrow Wilson School.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.080
And clearly, I was absent.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.980
So that was not a good moment.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:08.390
And yes, I could write an entire
book on inter-spousal negotiation.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.580
Most of our conversation
consisted of.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.340
You didn't give me credit for this.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.820
I did this, you did this.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.310
We tried every system
under the sun to divide it.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.650
You know, hours on
the refrigerators.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.680
Computer apps, you name it.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.800
Because we were constantly
pulling and tugging.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.130
And, you know, there are
those games we missed.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:34.590
And I don't think my elder son spun
out because I went to Washington.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.380
But I don't think it helped.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.520
I think he was trying
really hard to be mature.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.820
He was 12.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.940
He knew this was an
important job for me.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.970
But he had also just
started middle school.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.640
And I think he felt abandoned.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.310
And knew he couldn't express that.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.190
So no question.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.520
And I'll just conclude that
by saying, at one point.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.750
My husband and I had
been having a discussion.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.830
That you might call a fight,
if you were so inclined.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:06.020
And my older son came in and
said -- this was a while back.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.320
And he said, you know, "Mom.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.650
Are you and dad going to
divorce when we go to college?"

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.110
And I said, "Sweetheart,
when you go to college.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.070
We won't have anything
to fight about."

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.130
[ Laughter ]

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.430
And that's true.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.730
So, absolutely.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.570
But we are -- I mean, all of us.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.870
This is hard.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.170
That's part of my point.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.470
It is hard.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.040
And if you have anything else.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.710
Again, a job away, a child
with special needs, a divorce.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.100
Anything else can tip that.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.810 position:56%
So then I talk about it in the book.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.240
The tipping point, where suddenly,
you just can't do it anymore.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.540
And you've got to change jobs.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.890
Or you have to, you
know, somehow adjust.

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:45.650
So that you can respond to
the needs of the moment.

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.050
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Thank you.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.350
Question here.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.650
Yes, sir.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.880
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering what
advice you would give?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.160
Or what you would say to
a single, working mom.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.800
Who's going to be vacuuming
this room tonight.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.750
Or who's working in security
for this building right now.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.440
Or who's signing up at front.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.600
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: So I
would say, that in my article.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.960
I had nothing to say to her.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.060
Because I wrote that
article from the position

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.360
of privilege that I was in.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.660
I knew it.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.020
I was writing for <i>The Atlantic</i>.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.370
So I knew what my readership
looked like.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.840
But I would say, I also
thought about gender issues.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.690 position:56%
Almost entirely in terms of the fact
there were too few women at the top.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.640
And that what we needed to do
was to get more women at the top.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.150
Four years later.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:42.370
After three years reading,
writing, wrestling with issues.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.000
I think, yep, there are
too few women at the top.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.940
And there are too many
at the bottom.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.970
The poorest people in our society.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.550
The poorest people are
those single mothers.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.940
And two-thirds of minimum
wage workers, shift workers,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.180
and part-time workers, are women.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.060
So the reason I focus on care.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.420
Is because I think the -- I buy
my way out of care problems.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.020
That mother you're
describing, can't.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.490
And so things like
paid family leave.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.580
She can lose her job
when her child is sick.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.370
That's -- a society that
says you have to choose.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.280
Between staying home with
the child, and your job.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.250
Is an immoral society.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.510
So I'm focused on those issues.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.220
[ Applause ]

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.800
So thanks for the question.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: Thank you.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.400
Right here.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.700
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Caroline.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.580
I graduated from college
two years ago.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.380
And I was interested
in what you said

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.590
about the few years
right after you graduate.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.490
Those being really important years

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.510
to just totally be
all in on your career.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.050
And what I have found with my
friends, since we graduated.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.490
And since we lost this incredible
community that we had at school.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.520
People really clung
to relationships.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.460 position:56%
My friends really clung to
boyfriends, or guys they'd just met.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.350
Or partners they'd just met.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:13.670
Because they missed that
feeling of community.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.610
And my question for
you is, you know.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.280
As we think about how much we
want to value our relationships.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.700
This early on in our career.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.210
What's your advice?

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:30.510
Do you think that it is
crucial to have those years?

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:34.370
Where you don't think about a
relationship at all, this early?

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.670
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: That --

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.330
I don't think I've ever
been asked that question.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.990
And it's an important one.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.800
I mean, after I wrote my article.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.650
A young Princeton graduate
wrote to me.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.620
And said she was going
to leave her job

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.170
to follow her boyfriend
across the country.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.830 position:56%
And that everybody was disapproving.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.650
And she said, ironically,
had she been leaving her job

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.180
to follow her girlfriend
across the country.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.900 position:56%
Probably, it would have been better.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.830
But her larger point
was, wait just a minute.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:05.850
Why is it that Princeton
teaches me I should follow my

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.460
career everywhere?

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.340
And not invest in relationships?

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.620
And I would say, again, that's
been part of my journey.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.490
The theme of this entire
book festival is journeys.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:22.140
And I would say, I now think that
investing in those relationships.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.090
And I think that is the
work of a lead parent.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.950
My mother was a homemaker,
was investing in her family.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:29.490
Is critically important.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.470
Because that -- I do think, you
know, you could work harder.

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.770
You can travel.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:35.070
Absolutely.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:39.160
But I do think those
relationships are your foundation.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.590
Right? When things go wrong,
that's what catches you.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.140
Whether it's your family,
or it's your best friends.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.480
And family is anything,
people you love.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.930
Whom you chose to make your family.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.950
So I do think that's important.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.640
I think it's -- I would say
it's a time when you can spend.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.540
More time on your work
than your relationships.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.080
But I would say you
shouldn't ever do only one.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.900
To the exclusion of the other.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.140
If you possibly can.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly:
But to the specific point

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.580
about how important
it is in your 20s.

00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.370
You know, a year out of college.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:13.670
To ramp up --

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.970
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter:
To go for it.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: --
Fast, and just go for it.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.800
I mean, you do write about how much
easier it has made your choices

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.100
and path.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.570
That you got to a pretty
successful point in your career.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:23.870
Relatively early on.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.170
So that you were the boss.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.540
And you could set the
agenda and the schedule.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.840
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: I do.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.670
But I also -- I was divorced at 30.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.130
And married again at 35.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.800
And I got tenure in between.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.440
And I sometimes wonder, what
if I hadn't been divorced?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.190
What if we were having
children in our early 30s?

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.580
And I've also written about my
infertility problems, right?

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.870
I waited until I was 35.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.340
And I had a child at 38.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.410
And that was a terrible period.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.750
Where I really thought, I
have sacrificed my ability.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.500
To have biological
children, to my career.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.770
And so part of what I'm
saying now is, that's right.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:02.070
I mean, if you ask me -- if you
come to me as a young woman.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.050
Given the world we're in.

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:07.940
I'm realistic enough to say,
hey, try to make partner first.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.720
Try to get to a place first.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.170
But I'll also say, try to
do that by your early 30s.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.150
Not your late 30s.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:20.120
But what I'm saying in this book
is, it doesn't have to be that way.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.770
Right? We should be able to
say, you've gotten up to here.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.430
On whatever path you're on.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.880
You now slow down.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.180
You don't drop out.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.480
You slow down.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.780
You have your children.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.080
You do whatever.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.380
And then, when you're ready.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.340
Your workplace ought to say, great.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.640
You're ready.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.940
Let's see if you can do the job.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.560
But yes, given where we are.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.380
It is a good idea to get as high
as you can, as early as you can.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: All right.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.980
I'm going to take one last one.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.280
If you can keep it quick.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.580
Right here.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.880
&gt;&gt; Sure. You talked a little
bit about this in the talk.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.180
But I'd like to hear
a little bit more.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.620 position:56%
What effect do you believe a
continued prevalence and acceptance?

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.760
Of children raised by
same-sex couples will have?

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.480
On accelerating the decoupling
and dismantling of gender-biases.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.450
Related to how we align
caregiving in our careers?

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:12.140
Both in terms of public
policy and corporate practice.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.980
&gt;&gt; Anne-Marie Slaughter: I'm so
glad you asked that question.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.260
I think same-sex couples
are leading the way.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.450
And indeed, it was early on, when
I was giving a talk on my article.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.370
When a young woman
came up to me and said.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.260
You know, I and my partner
-- it was another woman.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.380
She said, there is
no default role here.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.520
There is no, I'm the
woman, so I'm the caregiver.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.100
And she's the woman, so
she's the breadwinner.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.090
And ditto for two men.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:39.470
There is no default.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:43.970
And so what I argue, is we should
all think about it that way.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.530
It depends on your
personality, your ambitions.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.330
Your level of income, your boss.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.680
Where you are in life.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.400
All of those things
should determine.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.000
Who's lead parent and
who's lead breadwinner.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.210
And it doesn't always
have to be, you know,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.610
lead one and lead the other.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.080
There are times you can
really divide it equally.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.570
But those are the factors
that matter.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:11.690
Not whatever genitalia
you were born with.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Louise Kelly: I don't think
we can top that as an end place.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.000
So we will leave it there.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.610
Thank you, Anne-Marie
Slaughter, thank you.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.020
Thank you, everybody.
