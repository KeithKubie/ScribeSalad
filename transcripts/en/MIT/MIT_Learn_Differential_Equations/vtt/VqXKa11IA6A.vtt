00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.240
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.100
This is the second
video for Chapter 3.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.350
And it's going to
be pictures again.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.680
But it's pictures for a
second order equation.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.100
And I'll make them--
these will be nice.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.950
We'll know formulas here.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.950
These will be
constant coefficient,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.310
linear second order equations.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.730
And we know that
the solution-- there

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.300
are two special
solutions, e to the s1 t

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.920
and e to the s2t,
two null solutions,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.450
and any combination
is a null solution.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.980
So we're talking
about null equations,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.060
0 on the right-hand side.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.550
And we just want to
draw that picture that

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.430
goes with solutions like that.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.250
So here is the magic word,
phase plane, phase plane.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.750
We're going to draw the
pictures in a plane.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.450
Because that's what
a blackboard is.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.780
And the axes we'll choose
will be y and y prime, not t.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.150
You'll see how t, time,
comes into the picture.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.300
But we have the two axes
will be y and y prime.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.080
So I had to figure
out what y prime was.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.190
It just brings down
an s1 from that term,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.850
and brings down an
s2 from that term.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730
And now here's the example.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.660
Here is the first example.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.610
So I took this
particular equation.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.670
Notice that the damping
term is negative.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.310
I have negative damping.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.740
This will be unstable.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.710
Solutions will go
out to infinity.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.830
And I can find those solutions.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.800
Because you know that
I look for e to the st.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.170
I always look for e to the
st. I plug in e to the st.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.130
I get an s squared
from two derivatives,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.760
minus 3s from one derivative,
plus 2 equaling 0.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.870
I factor that, and I find
the 2s1 is 1, and s2 is 2.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.130
And now I'm ready for
the phase plane picture.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.020
OK.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.070
Phase plane picture, so
here are my solutions.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.750
s is 1 or 2.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.570
Then the derivative
has a 1 or a 2.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.080
And here's my plane.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.540
Here's my plane.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.130
And I want to draw on
that the solutions.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.600
These solutions, I
actually have formulas.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.130
I just want to draw them.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.120
So I'm plotting.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.360
One example would be that
c1 be 1, and let c2 be 0.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.780
So that's gone.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.650
c1 is 1.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.980
I just have that picture.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.090
What kind of a picture
do I have in the phase

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.870
plane, in the y, y prime
plane, when that's y

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.990
and that's y prime?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.550
Well, those are equal.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.870
So y equals y prime
for that solution.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.180
y equals y prime along
the 45-degree line.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.746
It's just like y equal x.

00:03:08.746 --> 00:03:10.800
y prime is y.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.490
And what's happening
on this 45-degree line?

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.030
The solution is this solution,
is going straight out the line.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.690
As t increases, y and
y prime both increase.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.910
I go out.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.830
This is t going to infinity.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.580
And what about t going
to minus infinity?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.470
Because we got the
whole picture here.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.830
When t goes to minus infinity
that goes to 0, that goes to 0.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.470
Here is the point where
the universe began.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.480
The Big Bang is right there
at t equal minus infinity.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.730
And as t increases,
this point, y, y prime,

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.110
is traveling along
that 45-degree line.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.170
Because y equals y
prime, and out there.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.910
And what about the
rest of the line?

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.810
Well, if c1 was negative,
if c1 was negative

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.529
I'd have a minus there,
and a minus there.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.140
I would just have minuses.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.300
And I'd be going out that line.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.470
Well, that's one line in my
whole plane, but not all.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.340
Now let me take as a
second line c1 equals 0.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.180
So nothing from e to the t, and
let me take y as e to the 2t,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.840
and y prime then
would be 2e to the 2t.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.050
OK.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.660
What's happening in the phase
plane for this solution,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.100
now looking at this one?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.870
Well in this solution, in this
case, y prime is 2 times y.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.430
y prime is 2 times y.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.130
So I'm staying on
the line y prime,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.630
where y prime is 2 times y.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.450
It's a steeper
line, steeper line.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.160
So that was the case, this
was the line where c2 was 0.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.950
There was no e to the 2t on
that first line that we drew.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.570
In the second line
that we drew, c1 is 0.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.420
There's no e to the t.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.600
Everything is in e to the 2t.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.650
So now c1 is 0 on this line.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.150
OK.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
And we just go out it.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.660
As t increases, y
prime increases faster.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.430
Because of the factor 2.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.120
So it goes up steeply.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.365
And it goes this way.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.930
When c2 is negative, if I
took a minus and a minus,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.130
I would just go down the
other way on the same line.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.040
And this is still the Big
Bang, t equal minus infinity,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.830
where everything starts.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.990
OK.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.250
So that is two lines,
the two special lines

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.680
in the phase plane.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.000
But now I have to draw
all the other curves.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.880
And they will be curves.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.550
And where will they come from?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.460
They will come
from a combination.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.090
So now I'm ready for that one.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.840
Let me take the case
c1 equal 1, c2 equal 1.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.210
Yeah, why not? c1 equal 1.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.340
So I can erase c1.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.270
c2 equal 1, I can erase c2.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.540
And now I have another
solution, y and y prime.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.200
And I want to put it
in the phase plane.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.390
So at every value of t, at
every value of t that's a point.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.130
That's a value of y.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.050
This is a value of y prime.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.720
I plot the points y and y prime,
and I look at the picture.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.370
And again as t
changes, as t changes

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.710
I'll travel along the solution
curve in the phase plane.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.850
I'll travel along.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.130
As t changes, y will
grow, y prime will grow.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.110
I'll head out here.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.250
But I won't be on that straight
line or that straight line.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.580
Because those were the
cases when I had only one

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.070
of the two solutions.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.670
These were the
special solutions.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.310
And now I have a combination.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.100
So what happens as
t goes to infinity?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.330
As t goes to
infinity, this wins.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.930
As t goes to infinity,
the e to the 2t

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.270
is bigger than e to the t.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.280
So this is the larger term.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.200
So it approaches.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.450
This curve now will
approach closer and closer

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.580
to the one when the
line with slope 2.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.600
The 2 will be the
winner out here.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.050
But at t equal minus
infinity, near the Big Bang,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:27.480
at t equal minus infinity, e
to the 2t is even more small.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.299
So at t equal minus infinity,
or t equal minus 10,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.919
let's say, this is
e to the minus 10.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.820
This would be e to the minus
20; very, very, very small.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.020
These would win.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.690
So what happens
for this solution

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:55.970
is it starts out along the line
given by the not-so-small t,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.620
the not-so-small exponent.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.620
It starts up that line.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.830
But t is increasing.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:08.450
When t passes some point,
this 2t will be bigger than t.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:15.190
And it will, I guess,
at t equals 0, 2t

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.840
will be bigger than t.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.500
And from that point on, from
the t equal 0 point-- oh,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.740
I could even plot
the t equals 0.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.130
So at t equals 0, y
is 2 and y prime is 3.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:34.190
So at 1, 2, 1, 2, 3;
somewhere in there.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:43.400
So you see, the curve starts up
along the line where e to the t

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.010
is bigger.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:51.140
They have the same size at
t equals 0, both equal 1.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.710
This is at t equals 0.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:59.530
And then for large
times, this one wins.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.580
So I approach that line.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.610
I don't know if you
can see that curve.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.300
And I don't swear to the
slopes of that curve.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.250
But in between in
there is filled

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.570
with curves that start
out with this slope,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.590
and end with that slope.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.630
And the same here, it'll
start with this slope.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.611
But then go-- probably
this is a better picture.

00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:30.110
Yeah.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.350
That's a better picture.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.870
Yeah.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.310
It will just go up with slope.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.626
At the end it will have
slope 2 going upwards.

00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:40.520
Yeah.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.240
That looks good.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.180
Well, you could say I only
drew part of the phase plane.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.880
And you're completely right.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.876
If I start somewhere here, what
would you think would happen?

00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:52.250
What would you
think would happen

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.360
if I start with that value of y
that much, and that value of y

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.230
prime?

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:06.540
It would have some mixture of--
there would be a c1 and a c2.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.500
So the other curves
that I haven't drawn yet

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.380
come from the other c1 and c2.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.120
I've done c1 equal
1, and c2 equal 1.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.990
And c1 equal c2 equal 1.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.660
But now I have many
more possibilities.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:30.465
And what they do is they will--
so suppose I start there.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:43.030
It will approach--
this is the winner.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.260
This is the winner.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.620
Where c1 is 1, where
this is happening,

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.160
there is the winner
for large time.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.740
So all curves swing up
toward parallel to that line.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.360
Or down here, they swing
down parallel to that line.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.520
So things here will
swing down this way.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.250
That's the phase plane.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.550
May I do one more example to
show that this was a source?

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.370
This is called a source.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:25.610
Because the solution
goes to infinity.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.420
Wherever you start, the
solution goes to infinity.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.600
It's unstable, totally unstable.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.520
Now if I change to
a positive damping,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.870
then I would have
a plus sign there.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.830
These would be plus signs.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.860
I would have s equal minus
1, or s equal minus 2.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.310
So with positive damping,
I damp out naturally.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.880
And this picture
would be the same,

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.070
except all the lines
are coming in to 0, 0.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.810
The solutions are damping to
0, 0; to nothing happening.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.920
So I just track the same lines,
but in the opposite direction.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.020
So instead of this
being the Big Bang,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.440
it's the end of the
universe, t equal infinity.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.590
OK.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:18.310
I'm up for one more picture
of this possibility.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:25.710
And let me take the equation
y double prime equal 4y.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:33.190
So my equation will be s squared
equal 4, s equals 2 or minus 2.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:38.930
And when I draw the phase
plane and the solutions,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:46.940
the solutions will be c1 e to
the 2t, and c2 e to the minus

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.000
2t, from a 2 and a minus 2.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.400
That's the solution we all know.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.250
And now I should
compute its slope.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:06.030
y prime will be 2c1 e to the
2t minus 2c2 e to the 2t.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.400
And now you just want me
to draw those pictures.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.370
You just want me to
draw those pictures,

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.900
and let me try to say
what happens here.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.050
This is a saddle point.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.520
It's called a saddle, when we
have in one direction things

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.720
are growing, but in the
other, things are decreasing.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:33.660
So most solutions,
if c1 is not 0,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.100
then the growth is going to
win, and that will disappear.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.170
But there is the
possibility that c1 is 0.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.650
So there will be one
line coming from there.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.600
There will be one line
coming from there.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.970
Maybe I can try to draw that.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:56.140
Again, I'll draw that
pure line, where c1 is 0.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.070
So that pure line is coming.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.730
These are minuses here.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.560
So that line is coming
in to the center.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.490
So that's why we have a saddle.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:15.165
We approach a saddle if along
this where this is minus 2

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:17.950
of that, so I
think it would be--

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.310
so it's a slope of minus 2.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:29.050
So I think a slope like
that, so again this is y.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.220
This is y prime.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.270
This is the slope of minus 2.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.780
And that's this curve.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:49.160
So it will be very exceptional
that we're right on that line.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.460
All other points, all other
curves in this phase plane,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.180
are going to have a
little c1 in them.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.350
And then this will take over.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.250
And that gives us, as we
saw before, this slope.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.180
This is 2 times that.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.360
So that line is where
everybody wants to go.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.900
And only if you start
exactly on this line

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.760
do you get this picture, and
you come into the saddle.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.770
Instead of the Big Bang,
or the end of the universe,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.910
this is now the
saddle point, where

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:32.630
we come in on this most
special of all lines,

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.960
coming from this picture.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.540
But almost always this
is the dominant thing.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.120
And we go out.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.170
So if I take a typical
starting point,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:52.280
I'll go out this like
that, or like this, oh no.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.170
Yeah, no.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.460
I'll go out.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.170
It'll have to go out.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.720
So if I start anywhere
here, these are probably

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:07.374
they're hyperbolas going
out in that direction.

00:17:07.374 --> 00:17:09.750
I don't swear that
they're hyperbolas.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.200
Here again we might start in.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.710
Because we have
big numbers here.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.680
But then e to the t takes over.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.190
And we go out.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.980
So those go out.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.670
These go out.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.420
And these go out.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.540
So this is the big line.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.360
That's the line
coming from here.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.130
And that's where
everything wants to go,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.360
and everything eventually
goes that way, except the one

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.100
line where c1 is 0.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.700
So this dominant term
is not even here then.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.970
And then we should
become inwards.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.280
So that saddle point
is the special point

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.320
where you could go out,
if you go the right way.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.761
Or you could come in, if you go
the other special, special way.

00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:06.260
OK.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.370
So that sources,
sinks and saddles.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.010
And I still have to
draw the pictures, which

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:17.080
involves spirals that
come from complex s,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.640
where we have oscillation.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.030
That'll be the next video.
