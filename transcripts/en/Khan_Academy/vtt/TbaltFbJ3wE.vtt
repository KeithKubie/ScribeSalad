00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.402
Now that we know
what a matrix is,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.860
let's see if we
can start to define

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.380
some operations on matrices.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.810
So let's say I have the 2 by 3
matrix, so two rows and three

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:19.840
columns, and the entries are
7, 5, negative 10, 3, 8, and 0.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.530
And I want to define what
happens when I multiply 3 times

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.795
this whole thing.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.920
So first of all, let's get
a little terminology out

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.880
of the way.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.850
The number three, in
just the everyday world,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.290
if you weren't dealing
with matrices or vectors,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.360
and if you don't know
what vectors are,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.710
don't worry about
them just now, you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.680
would just call that a number.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.840
You would call
this a real number.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.960
It's just a regular
number sitting out there.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.376
But now in the
world where we have

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.620
these new structured
things, these matrices,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.560
these arrays of
numbers, we will refer

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.720
to these just plain
old real numbers that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.770
aren't part of some
type of an array here,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.270
we call these scalars.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.550
So essentially what
we're defining here,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.880
we don't know-- I haven't
said what this is actually

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.140
going to turn out to be,
but whatever this turns out

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.155
to be will be a product
of scalar multiplication,

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:09.270
where we're multiplying
a scalar times a matrix.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.656
And so how would
you define this?

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.030
What do you think
this should be?

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.650
3 times this stuff
right over here.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.170
Well, the world could have
defined scalar multiplication

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.060
however it saw fit, but
one way that we find,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.820
perhaps, the most obvious
and the most useful,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.930
is to multiply this
scalar quantity times each

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.390
of the entries.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.030
So this is going to
be equal to 3 times 7

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.190
in the top left, 3 times
5, 3 times negative 10,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.410
3 times 3, 3 times
8, and 3 times 0,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.070
which will give us--
it didn't change

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.342
the dimensions of the matrix.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.800
It didn't change,
I guess you could

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.920
say, the structure
of the matrix,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
it just multiplied each
of the entries times 3.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.640
So the top left
entry is now going

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.980
to be 21, the entry
in the middle row,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:10.030
top column is going to be
15, negative 30, 9, 24 and 0.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.230
So when you multiply a
matrix times a scalar,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.670
you just multiply each of
those entries times that scalar

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.938
quantity.
