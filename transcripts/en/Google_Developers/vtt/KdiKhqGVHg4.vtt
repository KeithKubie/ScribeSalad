JOHN: Hi, thank you
all for joining us here

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.720
at the YouTube distribute space.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.230
We're so excited to be
here with Sean Rad who

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.440
is the CEO and
co-founder of Tinder.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.327
He literally flew in
from LA a few minutes ago

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.660
and will be leaving right after.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.410
So we're so excited
to have you here with.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.627
SEAN RAD: My pleasure.

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:16.210
JOHN: Awesome.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.709
Awesome.

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:19.310
So just to give a gist of
what we can expect here.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.030
So this is all about distribute.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.721
So here at I/O we have the
design, the develop spaces,

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.470
but we really want to
focus on distribute.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.130
So after you build
a great product,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.490
what exactly happens for
you to get out there?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.310
And we have a perfect
example here with Tinder.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.830
I'm sure it's an app that
I imagine a lot of you use.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.650
If not, I feel like I've come
up with the usage of I've-- I

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.150
think 20% of your traffic
from San Francisco comes from

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.290
my user account.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.260
Is that what you were
telling me the other day?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.130
SEAN RAD: Pretty active, yeah.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.588
JOHN: Yeah, that
was our trade-off.

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.940
So he revived my social
life and I brought Sean

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.190
in for I/O. So that's
how this works.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.969
So Sean, why don't you let us
know a little bit about Tinder,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.010
what it's about for those
of us who may not know,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.050
and then we'll dive
into the interview.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.110
SEAN RAD: So who's used
Tinder in the room?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.280
OK.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.120
Basically Tinder
makes it very easy

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.540
for you to meet somebody new.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.710
When you want to meet somebody
new there's always this,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.070
there's this challenge,
whether it's romantic

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.969
or a business relationship.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.510
Or you have to put
yourself out there

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.659
and you feel like you're
about to get rejected

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.700
and you feel overwhelmed.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.310
Or somebody's coming
after you and you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.930
feel like, again, overwhelmed.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.900
Or you're going to
have to reject another.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.430
And so there's this
inherent friction.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.330
And we started Tinder because we
just wanted to break that down.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.790
We didn't want to create
a directory of people

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.639
and just sort of let
everyone figure out

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:36.680
how to connect with them.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.900
We really wanted to
sort of give people

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.970
a way to overcome
the barriers when

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.380
it comes to meeting new people.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
And the way we do
that is simple.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.152
We find out when somebody
you want to meet actually

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:50.110
wants to meet you back.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.800
And we do so in a way
that doesn't require

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.330
you putting yourself out there.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.480
And it's sort of like you walk
into a room and what people do

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.235
is they sort of look
at people in the room

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:03.770
and say yes or no in
their head subconsciously.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.690
And then once in a while
you look at somebody

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.570
across the room and
they look back and know

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.360
you both want to meet each other
and at that moment nobody's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.580
the aggressor, you're
both just responding

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.970
to this sort double
opt in, as we call it.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.120
And sort of a conversation
progresses from there.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.717
And Tinder works
very similar to that.

00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:23.300
JOHN: Awesome.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.780
So John let's rewind
the clocks back.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300
When did you guys start?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.980
When was Tinder officially
launched to the market.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.750
And take me through
what was day one like?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.252
What was going
through your head?

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:34.210
Take me to that moment.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.980
SEAN RAD: Yeah.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.390
So we launched in August 2012.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.574
And the way we launched is
everyone in the room who

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:45.990
was with us at the
time, basically

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.920
I instructed everyone
to take out their phones

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.910
and text a hundred
of their friends.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.460
And what we saw was amazing.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.150
There was when we started
basically spreading

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.400
the word through social media
and through our friends,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.110
we had 500 users that night.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.850
The next day, just through
organic word of mouth,

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.200
we had 1,000.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.526
And what happened was, a lot
of our friends came back to us

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:14.809
and they're like, wow, I
connected with this girl

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.100
that I would see around town,
I had no idea who it was,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.580
your common friend, and I'm
going out with her tonight.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.570
And I was just like,
wow, that was quick.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.070
It worked.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.520
And literally within
24 hours we started

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.060
seeing all these results
within our group of friends.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.430
Friendships being formed,
relationships being formed.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.065
And a week later, that
same group-- so there

00:03:38.065 --> 00:03:43.520
was like a 99.5 retention
rate-- daily retention rates.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.220
So like everyone was opening
up the app every single day.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.210
And we knew we had something.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.280
And there was value that
we were giving our users.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.650
So from there what
we did, we realized

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.980
that in order to retain
the essence of Tinder

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.840
and to have a valuable ecosystem
where people are actually

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.150
engaged and they're actually
using it the right way,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.270
we needed the product
to grow organically.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.580
And for two reasons.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.329
One, a user who comes in
organically through a friend,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.220
through word of mouth
is way more valuable

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.519
because they're more engaged.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.560
And when you sort of
have this network effect,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.647
you want your user to be
engaged and if they're not

00:04:25.647 --> 00:04:28.230
when I swipe right on somebody
I'm not going to get a response

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.970
and the overall value of
our ecosystem goes down.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.700
So every incremental
user that is organic

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.650
increases the sort of overall
value of the ecosystem.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.320
Any user who comes in deflects
decreases the overall value.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.010
And the second
thing is we realized

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.160
that to really
understand Tinder,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.540
it's something that your
friend need to teach you.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.659
And that the people who
would make the most out

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.700
of the experience, it's
just like every ecosystem

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.040
has this inherent language
on what you do, what you say,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.580
when you match, for example, or
what do you send in a Snapshot

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.670
to your friends?

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.350
These things get
developed through social--

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.600
they're sort of these social
norms that get developed.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.670
And we knew that those fibers
needed to be built on Tinder

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.110
and it needed to
happen organically.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.890
So we actually had access
to a lot of channels

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.291
where we could acquire
a lot of users quickly

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.790
but we sort of let the platform
grow organically from there.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.610
JOHN: So you guys didn't take
advantage of those channels.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.220
What were some of those
channels that you could've taken

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.610
advantage of but you didn't?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.020
SEAN RAD: So for
example, an early-- one

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.670
of our major investors
and shareholders is IAC

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.150
and they were like, hey, feel
free to use or email lists.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.529
We had celebrities, for example,
who wanted to tweet it out,

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.070
celebrities that
are friends of ours,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.090
I mean very big celebrities
that could get access--

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.320
could give us a lot of
eyeballs immediately.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.290
We didn't want to do
that because we weren't

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.150
ready to the
training wheels off.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.240
We wanted sort of the
ecosystem to develop.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.780
Also we knew our product it's a
location based product, right?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.745
And you want to go to places
where there's density.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.299
So here's what we did do.

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:23.340
I'm sure that was going
to be your next question.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.850
JOHN: You read my
mind, yes, exactly.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.160
SEAN RAD: What we realized is
that in order to truly test

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.640
whether we're solving
a real problem

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.790
we had to go to an environment
where people were already

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.834
very social charged
and had a lot of access

00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:43.750
to meeting new people.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.760
Meaning we weren't
trying to help you--

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.240
our goal isn't to create
this directory of people

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.820
to solve a problem where
you as an individual

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.180
might not have access
to enough people.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.960
We were trying to solve
the problem of you knowing

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.520
who you want to talk to, or
sort of going about your life

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.830
and seeing a lot of people
that you want to talk to,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.940
but not having the context
to sort of go up to them

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.470
and start a conversation.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.960
And we felt that that was a
problem for most of humanity.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.680
And in order to really, really
test whether that is a problem

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.720
and whether our
solution had value,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.430
we went to colleges
because college,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.430
that's an environment
where if you really

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.596
want to stress test our
product, you go to colleges.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:34.000
Because it's a group of
people who have access

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.680
to a lot of like-minded
individuals,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.660
they're in a socially
charged environment.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.650
You would imagine there are a
lot of opportunities to go over

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.270
and say hello, there
is a lot of context--

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.130
we're in the same
class together.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.300
So we thought if we could
deliver a lot of value

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.350
to colleges, then the
rest of the world--

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.350
and they had a problem
that needed to be solved,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.600
then the rest of
world certainly had

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.590
a problem that
needs to be solved.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.465
Then we could deliver
a lot of value to them.

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:03.420
So we went to
colleges, A, because it

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.210
was like shooting
fish in a barrel.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.070
It was a highly
dense environment

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.320
where the word can travel
and people can sort of

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.820
teach each other
how to use Tinder.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.410
And, B, because, like I said,
it was a good way to stress

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.910
test the problem and the
solution and sort of figure

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.840
out if we truly were
on to something.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.614
So how did we-- which
I'm sure is going

00:08:25.614 --> 00:08:27.780
to be the next question--
how did we go to colleges?

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.280
JOHN: I feel like he's doing
the interview for himself.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.500
SEAN RAD: Well, we
did over the phone.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.975
So what we did is we
identified in every college,

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:42.110
in every sort of location,
a key influencer, somebody

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.590
who is looked up to
amongst his peers

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.270
and can really cause change.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.250
And I think a lot
of times people

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.250
think that is a quantity
thing, it's not.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.840
Meaning if you really
look at college campuses--

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.140
I don't know if you've gone
to college or sort of think

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.330
about how trends
start and everything.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.530
It doesn't start through a
lot of people using something

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.880
at once.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.400
I'm sorry, that's not
what I wanted to say.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.280
A habit or trend isn't
formed because you

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.300
go to like 100 or 200
people and basically

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.130
tell them to use the product
and sort of tell their friends.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.410
A habit is formed because
there's this one person

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.940
that a group of
people look up to.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.360
And that person does
something and it's

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.430
like top down marketing.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.440
Everyone else follows.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.526
Then there's another layer
that follows that group

00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:36.150
and it just sort of
expands from there.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.950
So it's like who's that
patient zero and finding

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.230
that patient zero was something
that we thought a lot about.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.770
And we were lucky that at USC,
which is where I went to school

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.180
and my partner Justin
went to school,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.892
patient zero was
somebody that we

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:53.392
Knew.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:56.570
We knew, basically, the
big person on campus

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.020
that everyone looked up to.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.130
And then from there that
person knew somebody else

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.830
at another college campus, and
that person knew somebody else.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.310
And then that network of
reps, that we called them,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.170
became international
because that person

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.910
had a friend who lives in Paris.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.050
And then what
became college reps

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.150
ended up becoming very
socialites and influential

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.250
individuals in just
sort of cities,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.290
not necessarily on a college
but in a larger area.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:34.360
And then from there that
grew into celebrities.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.910
And at a certain point
we stop-- I mean,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.864
now every day there's
influencers, there's press,

00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:42.780
there are a lot of people
talking about Tinder

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.450
and none of that is, I
would say, provoked by us.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.600
This is just all organic.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.660
We take inbound requests
and our job today when

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.030
it comes to marketing is to
ensure that people are saying

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.767
the right things,
not to encourage

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:00.850
them to talk about Tinder.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.391
Because it seems
like a lot of people

00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:05.080
want to talk about Tinder,
it's about supplying them

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.100
with the right language
and our vision.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.170
So they understand what
is the actual story here.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.077
And we don't like
people going off

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:17.160
and certain making their
own stories, particularly

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.784
with the press.

00:11:17.784 --> 00:11:20.500
We want to help guide them
to understand what is working

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.550
and what the facts are.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.090
JOHN: Of course, yeah.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.340
Something that really stuck
out to me as you were just

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.260
describing it here, is like,
my goodness, Sean and Tinder

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.310
have brought Malcolm Gladwell's
Tipping Point to light.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.230
They talk about all
the theories there

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.556
but here's an example of how
you've identified a influencer

00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:36.930
and they have
spread your message

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.304
as an evangelizer for Tinder.

00:11:38.304 --> 00:11:40.220
And I think that's
something really beautiful.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.886
And I want to dive
more into the details

00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:44.492
of how did you enable them
to talk about your message?

00:11:44.492 --> 00:11:45.450
What did you give them?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.400
Because I think so many
people, here at I/O, you're

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.850
working on a proj,
you're working on an app,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.330
you're thinking about
how to distribute it

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.621
and how to get it out there,
but what specific stuff do

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.891
you give an influencer, whether
they're on a college campus

00:11:55.891 --> 00:11:56.390
or not?

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.720
Are you sending them an email
with here are attachments

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.720
and talking points of
what to talk about Tinder?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.230
Let's get real specific
about what do you give them?

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.870
SEAN RAD: So we first and
foremost supplied them

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.570
with a very simple way to
describe the value proposition,

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.490
something that resonates
with their friends.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.582
Meaning, they might
look at the product

00:12:17.582 --> 00:12:19.540
and sort of feel the
benefits and understand it

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.270
but articulating those
benefits is a science.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:28.030
And so we had effective
ways of articulating it

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.350
and we sort of supplied
these reps with the language.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.410
And sort of guided
them on the best ways

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.982
to just verbalize their
thoughts in explaining it

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:38.690
to their friends.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.404
And then from
there giving them--

00:12:42.404 --> 00:12:44.820
I don't want to get into details
as far as like what is it

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.028
that we do because that
would kind of give away parts

00:12:47.028 --> 00:12:50.590
of our secret sauce-- but
there is sort of a playbook

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.752
that we had on college campuses.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:56.335
One of the things that we would
do, I'll give you one example.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.680
Sororities and fraternities
have Monday night dinners

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.810
where basically everyone in
the sorority or fraternity

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.924
is present and there's various
announcements and whatnot.

00:13:12.924 --> 00:13:14.590
We went into the
sorority and fraternity

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.660
dinners disguised as students.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.660
We told the sororities--

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.360
JOHN: Did you wear
the whole gear,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.100
everything, like a hoodie?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.090
SEAN RAD: It wasn't me.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.989
It was our team and my partner.

00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:24.780
JOHN: That must have
been a fun assignment.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.310
I would have loved to
join the Tinder team just

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.150
for that assignment.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.660
SEAN RAD: It was--

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.670
JOHN: John, we're putting
you into a fraternity.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.586
SEAN RAD: There were
some funny stories there.

00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:33.840
But basically, we would
go to the sororities

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.460
and say, hey, the guys
at the fraternities

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.825
are swiping on Tinder right now.

00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:41.700
You should get on it.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.350
And then we do vice versa.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.850
We'd have girls go visit the
guys and guys visit the girls.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.380
And it would sort of
just create this ruckus.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.755
So every time we
would do that there

00:13:53.755 --> 00:13:56.476
would be like an instant
150 user, 300 user bump.

00:13:56.476 --> 00:13:58.100
And I know it doesn't
sound like a lot,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.700
I mean right now we had more
than multiple college campuses

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.260
and users a day.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.767
But 200, 300 users
when we just launched--

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.350
JOHN: And how long
ago was this, Sean?

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.602
This is only about a year ago?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.560
SEAN RAD: This is a year,
over year and a half.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.240
JOHN: Isn't that
amazing that just

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.610
a year ago just these
little 100 sign ups there,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.410
they just grow into
what it is today.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.368
SEAN RAD: It's amazing.

00:14:19.368 --> 00:14:23.000
And what happened was-- so we
did a lot on college campuses.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.620
We threw events,
we threw parties.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.161
Again, when you have
the right crowd,

00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.690
you have the right social
influencers, it helps.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.746
We threw parties where
you couldn't get access

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:32.870
to the parties unless you
had Tinder on your phone.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.161
And you have to show the
bouncer that you were actually

00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:36.630
active on Tinder.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.180
What really happened, and
this was the tipping point,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.780
we hit 20,000 users in
January of last year.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.510
And everyone left
for college break.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.219
Winter break?

00:14:49.219 --> 00:14:51.260
Everyone left for winter
break and they went home

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.445
and they started
telling their friends,

00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:54.361
and they started telling
their older brothers,

00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:57.110
younger brothers, younger
sisters, whatever.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:02.520
And from January 1st
we have 20,000 users.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.430
On January 30th we
had 500,000 users.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.520
And this is all organic.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.710
There is nothing we did
outside of supplying

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.930
the reps-- outside of basically
identifying and encouraging

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.820
people to be our
advocates, and sort

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.710
of finding that patient zero
and then enabling patient

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.740
zero to express themselves.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.665
And I think for all
of you guys, if you

00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:32.510
have a product
that if you really

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.690
understand who your
customer is, it

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.497
will help you identify who
that sort of key influencer is.

00:15:38.497 --> 00:15:40.080
And it doesn't need
to be a celebrity.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.080
It doesn't need to
be somebody who's

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.450
recognizable to the masses.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.790
It could be somebody who's
recognizable to just like

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.200
a core subset of your user base.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.990
Somebody who's
influential there.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.360
And having that person promote
your product and believe in it.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.817
I mean frankly, there's no
substitute for bad products.

00:15:57.817 --> 00:16:00.400
So you actually have to have a
product that works and is good,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.930
right?

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.013
But having that person, I
think, is going give you

00:16:03.013 --> 00:16:10.070
invaluable feedback, it's going
to make all the difference,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.360
at least for Tinder it
made all the difference.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.430
And again, it's not,
when you're growing,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.810
it's not about quantity.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.680
I mean, there are plenty of
apps that shoot up to the top 10

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.600
and the day after are just
gone, right, from the top.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.340
Actually there's
a famous app that

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.400
just launched that, I'll just
say it, Slingshot, right?

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.434
It's just like I was looking
at the app store today.

00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:33.600
I'm like, where's Slingshot?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.900
I can't even find it.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.470
And it was like top 10
and like literally it's

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.660
not even in the top
300, or the top 200.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.360
And I think it's a
perfect example, right?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:49.060
If you look at our growth, we
didn't have many fluctuations.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.920
It was like we were consistently
in like the top 100,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.275
and then consistently
in like the top 75,

00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.680
and then consistently
in the top 50.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.530
And it's more powerful
because our users,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.910
if you look at our DAU to MAU
ratio, it's incredibly strong.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.569
If you look at the engagement
that we have every single day,

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.210
it's incred-- I
mean, our users spend

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.560
an average of 77 minutes
a day in the app.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.030
And we get a billion
swipes every single day.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.300
And we create over
12 million matches.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.849
We would never get-- I
mean, even if you gave me

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.200
like a billion email
addresses, and I

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.410
emailed a billion
email addresses,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.870
I don't think we would get
to where we're at today.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.960
I think there's these social
norms that have to develop,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.730
the product has to
grow organically,

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.200
there's a language
that builds over time,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.516
and how you launch these
things are very important.

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.390
JOHN: That's awesome.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.889
Sean, I think you've done so
many smart things, like holding

00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:44.700
back on having celebrities
tweet before it was too

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.750
soon to obviously set up
these influencer programs

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.610
and reaching out, but what's
something that you look back on

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.235
and you're like, hmm,
maybe I shouldn't

00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:54.025
have done that, maybe
it was a mistake.

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:55.400
You're obviously
more experienced

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.608
now than you were a year ago.

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.990
SEAN RAD: I make
mistakes every day.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:04.020
I mean, I go back to yesterday,
probably made like 10 mistakes.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.960
I think great leaders
and great innovators

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.590
make mistakes every
day but learn from them

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.810
and not only improve
themselves but improve everyone

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.090
around them as a result
of those mistakes.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.690
So it's a tough question only
because there's like 100 things

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.970
that I can think of.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.125
When it comes to distribution
though, a mistake that we made.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:38.580
I think we underestimated how
popular Tinder would become.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.300
And I can't explain
how stressful

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.170
it was in the first three months
when we're growing like this

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.920
and our prototype code is
just crashing left and right.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.820
And it's stressful when
you're sort of just

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.010
trying to get attention.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.900
When you have all the
attention and then some

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.146
and you have everything
to lose, that's

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:01.270
a different kind of stress.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.070
And believe me, it
keeps you up at night

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.400
just probably even more than
not having a lot of attention

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.937
and trying to get customers.

00:19:08.937 --> 00:19:11.270
Once you have a lot of customers
and you have everything

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.870
to lose, the way you think
about the world really changes.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.090
I think the biggest
mistake that we made,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.057
and maybe it's not a
mistake in retrospect

00:19:20.057 --> 00:19:22.140
because it maybe would
have impacted other things,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.890
is I probably would
have encouraged our team

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.010
to take a little
more care in the code

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.694
and basically design
it for scale day one

00:19:31.694 --> 00:19:33.650
versus, you always
hear about MVP,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.710
MVP this, MVP that,
and everyone's just

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.600
trying to get the
product out there.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:44.310
I think they're defining
what that MVP is is the trick

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.770
and really understanding what
are the benchmarks of success

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.570
and are you prepared
for each benchmark.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.532
What are the benchmarks,
not only of success

00:19:52.532 --> 00:19:54.990
from a technical standpoint,
but from a product standpoint?

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.650
Understanding like what
is it that you're truly

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.810
trying to accomplish?

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.970
And have you sort of put a
check mark on the truly minimal

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:09.781
things that you need to sort of
create an experience that I'm

00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:12.030
willing to tell my friends
who then is willing to tell

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.610
somebody else and then
we're able to extract

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.720
the core value of Tinder.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.750
So I think one of the
things that I wouldn't

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.510
say we drastically
underestimated

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.500
what that MVP was, we
sort of underestimated it.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.402
And there was a
point in January when

00:20:28.402 --> 00:20:29.860
we were growing
like this-- we went

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:33.860
from 20,000 to 500,000
almost overnight-- where

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.590
I was literally like,
OK, we're going to have,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.600
like we had maybe 30
minutes of down time, which

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.350
is amazing in retrospect.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.702
But I was like at any
minute, everything

00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.160
is just going to
collapse and we're

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.330
going to be down for 24 hours
because this architecture has

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:53.195
its bottleneck and
won't go past that.

00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:55.065
And hard work can't solve it.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.470
And we recover-- I
mean, that didn't

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.380
happen because we were
maintaining our existing code

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.790
base while we were
sort of, we were

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.825
like rebuilding the plane
while it was flying in the air

00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:12.129
at like tens of
thousands of feet.

00:21:12.129 --> 00:21:13.920
And it was stressful
but we got through it.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.910
So I think in retrospect I would
have planned a little bit more

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.782
for success.

00:21:18.782 --> 00:21:19.740
JOHN: That's fantastic.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.610
Thanks for being so
open about it that.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.260
So I want to open
it up to you guys

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.800
to be able to ask
questions because I think

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.508
the most amazing thing
about this journey

00:21:26.508 --> 00:21:29.180
is that, Sean, it could be
one of you guys in this seat

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.680
next year.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.670
Just a year, what
a difference makes

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.120
when you're smart about how
to develop and distribute

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.780
your product.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.600
So Sean, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.264
And then we'll pass around the
mic to open it up to you guys.

00:21:40.264 --> 00:21:41.555
If you guys have any questions.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.604
SEAN RAD: I guess
I'm really boring.

00:21:46.604 --> 00:21:47.175
Shit.

00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:49.300
JOHN: Or maybe you just
answered all the questions.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.800
Yeah.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.685
AUDIENCE: Hey, Sean.

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.670
SEAN RAD: Hey, how are you, man?

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.330
AUDIENCE: Could
you tell us what--

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.050
I mean as you've
grown into this stage

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.620
and as you said kind of
where you were two years ago,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.630
or year and a half ago, to where
you are today, your mind has

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.350
shifted and into the
challenges that you have.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.700
What are the challenges
that you all face today

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.280
as you've grown to, did you
say a billion swipes a day?

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.340
SEAN RAD: A day, yeah.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.330
A billion swipes a day.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.871
AUDIENCE: What are the things
that you lose sleep over today?

00:22:21.045 --> 00:22:22.420
SEAN RAD: I lose
sleep over right

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:28.630
now is recruiting the
best minds to join us.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.500
People who understand our
vision, believe in it,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.732
and sort of have
unique talents that we

00:22:35.732 --> 00:22:36.940
require to sort of get there.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.110
Right now it's all about
scale, scale, scale.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:43.590
There was a period of time
where-- I still to this day I

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.767
hate large teams.

00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:46.850
I don't think I know anyone
who likes large teams.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.391
JOHN: How big is
the Tinder team now?

00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:50.750
SEAN RAD: Right now
the team's 40 people.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.460
And we've sort of
hit this point where

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.000
it's like we can't
stay small anymore

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.790
because shit's breaking.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:03.890
And we're recruiting but
as much as there's a need

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:10.990
to bring in help,
I'm trying my hardest

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.280
to sort of keep the
bar on excellence

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.070
on who we bring in very high.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:20.450
And we're slow to
hire because we're

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.860
so careful that every
person who comes in

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.130
understands sort of our core
principles, our culture,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.820
and has the curiosity
and the talent that's

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.260
needed to propel us forward.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.770
Finding great people is the
hardest thing in the world.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.220
I mean it's people.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.510
What builds great
companies are people.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.620
And what got us
here are great minds

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.100
that I was fortunate enough
to surround myself with.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.810
And what will usher us into
the future is the same thing.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.920
So if anyone's
looking, if anyone's

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.400
looking to join an awesome
team, come talk to me, please.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.470
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sean.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.540
Oh, here.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.590
Can you hear me?

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.596
SEAN RAD: Yeah.

00:23:57.596 --> 00:23:59.470
AUDIENCE: I want to ask
you how do you guys--

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.428
JOHN: I can't year you.

00:24:00.428 --> 00:24:02.240
Could you move the mic up?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.570
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me now?

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.930
How did you guys deal
with competition?

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:09.160
Because there's a lot of
apps similar to Tinder

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.600
in the markets, that were in the
market for quite a long time.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.797
So like what were your goals
in trying to like overcome?

00:24:17.797 --> 00:24:18.880
SEAN RAD: The competition?

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.220
SEAN RAD: Honestly,
we till this day,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.520
I can confidently
say we don't give

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.430
a shit about the competition.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.480
The reason-- but
it's not because.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.710
Like actually, we do
look at the competition

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.760
to see where we can learn.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.690
But the reason we don't care is
we have our own vision of where

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.240
we want to be and
what others are doing

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.460
is irrelevant to that.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.620
We have a roadmap.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.279
Like I have a list so long
of what I want to accomplish.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.820
And you go to everyone
in the company

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.265
and it's like they've
got their list

00:24:52.265 --> 00:24:53.806
and together we're
prioritizing, sort

00:24:53.806 --> 00:24:57.490
of building this roadmap that
gets us closer to our vision.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.010
And the competition
in some cases

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.420
could help you
figure out what are

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.080
the right steps through
their own experiences

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.040
that you can learn
from as a bystander.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.010
But ultimately, at the end
of the day, what builds

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.810
great companies is sort of
a very common understanding

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.660
amongst great people that
are working with you on where

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.310
you want to be and what
it takes to get there.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.080
And there are a lot
of people at Tinder

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.920
who put a lot of time and energy
into thinking about those steps

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.630
and analyzing what
did we do, sometimes

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.440
we unknowingly did it, that
brought us to where we are.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.870
And that knowledge is
knowledge that the competition

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.720
doesn't have.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.260
The passion that we
have and the investment

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.070
we've made in sort of getting
to our ultimate vision

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:50.490
is an investment a lot of
times copycats haven't made.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.450
And that's why they
just drop like flies.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.470
And I'm still waiting
for a viable competitor,

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.580
like somebody who's not
like we're literally

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.127
going to take an x, a
heart, a stack of cards,

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.960
and put people in it
and just let you swipe,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.980
because that's not
what Tinder is.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.521
There's a lot under
the hood, there's

00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:07.940
a lot more science behind it.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.570
But like there's certainly a lot
of competition who does that.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.140
But I'm still
waiting for somebody

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.575
who's sort of not
thinking about Tinder

00:26:14.575 --> 00:26:16.950
but thinking about the problem
that we're trying to solve

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.940
and is going to come up
with a unique solution.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.710
And that somebody
I want to talk to.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:25.360
But it's about
identifying the problem.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.614
And our solution is
just one solution.

00:26:29.614 --> 00:26:31.780
There are potentially 100
ways to solve the problems

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.321
that we have.

00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:34.730
But what makes a
company is everyone

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.430
is unified around what that
vision is and what is it

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.430
that you're trying to
deliver to your customers.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.600
And I think we know
that very well.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.860
And that is where we compete,
not in the product and the user

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.230
base but in a team who
understands what they're doing.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.897
JOHN: Fantastic.

00:26:49.897 --> 00:26:50.729
SEAN RAD: What's up?

00:26:50.729 --> 00:26:52.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.720
My name's Al.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.240
Tinder specific
strategy question.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.370
You swipe right, a
couple moments later

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.700
you have a chat line open up.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.750
How do you personally start
your Tinder conversations?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.560
JOHN: The most pressing
question of the day.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.427
SEAN RAD: So it's easier for
me because I could ask, hey,

00:27:10.427 --> 00:27:11.510
how are you liking Tinder?

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.490
And everyone wants to tell
me about their experiences.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.140
But that's a great question.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.860
I struggled with that.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.020
A lot of people
struggle with that.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.660
And what we realized is we did
a really good job of helping

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.090
you say hi, like
connect with somebody,

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.560
and then we created
another problem

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.340
which is we've now create
2 billion total matches

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.550
and that's growing.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:40.180
And people sort of
don't know what to say.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.680
Now that they're
in front of someone

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.888
they know that that person's
interested in them back.

00:27:43.888 --> 00:27:48.350
And the tools to
get to know somebody

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.847
are very primitive
in my opinion.

00:27:49.847 --> 00:27:51.430
And then the tools
to express yourself

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.030
are also primitive, at least on
Tinder they're very primitive.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.009
So moments.

00:27:55.009 --> 00:27:56.050
We just launched moments.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.900
And the idea behind moments was
to solve that exact problem.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:05.550
What you say could be something
that's in response to a moment

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.910
that that person has expressed
or shared with their followers.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.050
And so I think the
best answer I would

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.356
say is like pay attention to who
the person is in their profile

00:28:18.356 --> 00:28:19.730
and what they're
trying to convey

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.313
and then what they're
trying to convey

00:28:21.313 --> 00:28:25.270
in the moment, in their moments,
and have a response that's

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.820
personal that's related to that.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.750
Hay is for horses, hey's
work actually on Tinder,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.200
but probably aren't
going to help

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.680
you get closer to an individual.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.010
But starting with something
that's more personal

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.980
probably is my best advice,
and it works, that works best.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.180
JOHN: Awesome.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:50.990
This is maybe more of--
based on your users,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.650
have you seen may
perhaps a cultural shift

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.650
in dating culture in general?

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.530
Or maybe a lack of bias?

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.770
Because there used to be a lot
of bias towards internet dating

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.117
and now people seem to be more--

00:29:05.117 --> 00:29:06.460
SEAN RAD: Yeah.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:12.664
I think there's been a stigma
around online or mobile dating.

00:29:12.664 --> 00:29:14.330
I actually don't even
think about Tinder

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.650
as online or mobile dating.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.240
I think about Tinder
as solving a problem

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.990
that we all face, whether it's
offline or online, or anywhere.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.321
And it's a psychological, it's a
human issue that we're solving.

00:29:27.321 --> 00:29:29.070
And again, we're not
building a directory.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.770
Were sort of helping to
solve the question of

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.272
is that person interested in me?

00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:36.230
Should I approach them?

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.670
Should I not approach them?

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.670
Is their context there?

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.690
And that is a
problem that exists

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.800
in romantic relationships,
business relationships,

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.400
friendships, anything,
and it's something

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.760
that Tinder is solving.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.690
And I think there's
another set of problems

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.270
that other products are solving
which aren't necessarily

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.410
what Tinder is doing.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:02.610
Have we seen a shift in sort
of just the overall attitude

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.470
towards using an app
to meet somebody?

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.400
Yes.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.370
I think if you look at the
user base that we have,

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.910
which is growing
incredibly fast,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.670
and you actually just
once we survey those users

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.910
and actually compare
them to other data

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.580
that we have through
some of our partners,

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.840
there is a vast
majority of our users

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.730
are new entrants into the space.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.230
Right?

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:35.030
These are people who are
this is their first app

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.261
for social discovery, this
is their first platform

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:38.510
that they're using to do that.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.420
They haven't necessarily
used a new product

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.620
in the past, another
product in the past.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.790
And I think, so yeah, I think
we are making a change as far

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.720
as people's attitudes
towards using these tools.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.410
I think we're also making
a change in society.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:56.890
Making 2 billion connections
in less than a year and a half

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.310
has, I hope, has
changed society.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.750
I hope has provided
a lot of life

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.960
altering value for a
lot of people out there.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.480
And I hope it's made it easier
and more fun to meet people.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.630
And that was our goal and
I think we're doing it.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.171
JOHN: Are you going to be the
best man at any Tinder weddings

00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:14.760
coming up?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.510
That'd be the day.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.200
SEAN RAD: I've been
invited to more weddings

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.422
than I could possibly attend.

00:31:18.422 --> 00:31:24.106
But I'm too busy trying to help
create other weddings to go

00:31:24.106 --> 00:31:25.730
to any of the ones
that I'm invited to.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.855
JOHN: Well said, well said.

00:31:26.855 --> 00:31:28.521
I think we have one
more question there.

00:31:28.521 --> 00:31:30.472
AUDIENCE: Hi Sean, thanks
so much for coming.

00:31:30.472 --> 00:31:30.820
SEAN RAD: Thank you.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.060
AUDIENCE: So two
questions for you.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.434
First is can you talk a little
bit about your experience.

00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:37.270
Like have you built
other companies

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.080
and how has that influenced
the trajectory of Tinder?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.920
And then the other one
is I know you're Persian,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.200
we're Persian as well.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.320
I'm just wondering how
that's at all influenced

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.429
the inspiration or
the idea for this app?

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:52.970
SEAN RAD: OK, I'll answer the
first question then the second.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.928
OK, the first question.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.470
So let me come back
to the first question.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.850
Because now you got me thinking
about the Persian thing.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:05.760
Has that helped?

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.900
JOHN: Perhaps you're
operating in your childhood.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:20.290
SEAN RAD: I mean, I think I
come from a family of immigrants

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:25.170
who were encouraged
as children and then

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.570
encouraged me to do
the most with my life.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.840
Because you look at immigrants
like they had to make the most

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.100
and sort of achieve
high goals in order

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.704
to survive and
assimilate into culture.

00:32:37.704 --> 00:32:39.120
And they had to
be high achievers.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.630
And I think my
parents definitely

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:48.360
pushed me to do the
most that I can.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.240
And I think that that's
definitely given me

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.690
a sense of drive and
a sense of purpose.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.670
I don't know if it's because
I have a family of immigrants

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.440
or just my family
themselves and maybe there

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.340
are other families
who do this too,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.099
but I think definitely my
parents have impacted me.

00:33:05.099 --> 00:33:06.515
And they are
entrepreneurs as well

00:33:06.515 --> 00:33:09.170
and they've sort of achieved
great things in their lives.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.862
And watching them
has inspired me.

00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:13.184
What was the first question?

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.080
AUDIENCE: Do you have other
experiences from the past,

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.780
like building other
businesses that, yeah.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.990
SEAN RAD: So the common thread--
so this is my third company.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.300
My last company was Adly,
which sort of started celebrity

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.610
endorsements in social media.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.440
So pretty much if a
celebrity endorses a brand

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.490
and gets paid for it, it
probably comes through Adly.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:37.970
Sorry if you don't like that.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.490
And then my last company was a
unified communications company

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.650
called Orgoo and we took
all your email accounts,

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.233
instant messaging,
all the ways people

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.340
communicated integrated
into one platform.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.130
The common thread across
all of that and Tinder

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.550
is that I am so
passionate and curious

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.420
about how we
communicate as humans.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.880
How do we express ourselves?

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.780
And frankly, simplifying
and sort of just

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.690
like breaking down the
barriers in communication.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:13.469
And my last two companies
were more utilities.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:17.260
So how do I actually enhance
my communication tools

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.440
and how do I as a brand
communicate a message

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.639
to an audience.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.670
Tinder, I think is less
of a utility and more

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.440
of how do I solve just
like-- how do I break down

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.679
some of the social norms that
we've developed as a society

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.719
and how do we work around
them to sort of enhance

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.670
communication and bring
people closer together?

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.320
But there are
underlying utilities

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.300
as well that we're building
to sort of do that.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.889
But it's more of the context and
the ecosystem that we've built.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.960
But yeah, the common thread
throughout all these companies

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.710
have been an interest
in communication

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.510
and the people around me
that have sort of shared

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.994
that passion and interest.

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:01.160
And then I've learned a lot.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.860
I mean, like I said, I
make mistakes every day.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.980
I fail in a small way and
sometimes in a big way

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.610
all the time.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.710
But the beauty of
failing is if you're

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.070
open to admitting the
failure and learning from it,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.870
you probably won't fail
again in that one department,

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:18.810
and you'll know what
to expect next time

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.720
and that just makes
you stronger and more

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.540
accurate with the
risks that you take.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.100
So it's definitely
impacted what I've done

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.117
and the way I look at the world.

00:35:31.117 --> 00:35:31.700
JOHN: Awesome.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.040
So with that I just want
to thank Sean for his time.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.381
SEAN RAD: Thanks for
having me, thanks guys.

00:35:36.381 --> 00:35:37.380
JOHN: It was a pleasure.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:37.870
Awesome.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:38.578
SEAN RAD: Thanks.

00:35:38.578 --> 00:35:39.790
JOHN: Thanks, guys.
