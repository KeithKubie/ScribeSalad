00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.844
The advantage to this technique is that many people can rate their own

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:08.436
personalities relatively quickly. Also, because the answers are limited to

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:13.805
usually around five categories. Such as strongly disagree, disagree, neither

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:19.624
agree nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree. They can be scored and summed

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:24.640
easily. They're objectively scored, not subjectively, like projective tests

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.198
are. Now the problem, as always, is the questions and the answers must be

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:35.695
reliable and valid. If people answer questions one way at one point in time

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:39.223
,but differently, say, a month later, then we don't have a reliable

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:45.237
questionnaire. In addition, sometimes people may give biased answers. And

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:49.722
finally, if a person doesn't really read the question or, take them seriously

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:54.138
and just puts random answers in, they're not valid reflections of a person's

00:00:54.138 --> 00:01:00.498
personality. So good personality questionnaires take years of research to

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:06.000
establish the reliability and validity. And have ways of detecting random or

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.080
inconsistent answers.
