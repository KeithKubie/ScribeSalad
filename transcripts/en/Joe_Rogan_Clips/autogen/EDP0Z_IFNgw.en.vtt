there's something wrong with your
 

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.920
there's something wrong with your
argument

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:53.930
argument
 

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.780
argument
is if what you're trying to do is you're

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.790
is if what you're trying to do is you're
 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.210
is if what you're trying to do is you're
sneakily trying to silence these voices

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.220
sneakily trying to silence these voices
 

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.950
sneakily trying to silence these voices
and again as long as we're not talking

00:08:59.950 --> 00:08:59.960
and again as long as we're not talking
 

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.630
and again as long as we're not talking
about threats of violence and as long as

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640
about threats of violence and as long as
 

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.889
about threats of violence and as long as
we're not talking about harassment or

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:02.899
we're not talking about harassment or
 

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.240
we're not talking about harassment or
daxing right we're just talking about

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.250
daxing right we're just talking about
 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.040
daxing right we're just talking about
conversation you're just talking about

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.050
conversation you're just talking about
 

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.660
conversation you're just talking about
people with differing points of view if

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670
people with differing points of view if
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.460
people with differing points of view if
you want to silence differing points of

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:09.470
you want to silence differing points of
 

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.260
you want to silence differing points of
view I have to wonder about your intent

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.270
view I have to wonder about your intent
 

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.670
view I have to wonder about your intent

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680
I have to wonder about whether you're
 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.960
I have to wonder about whether you're
going into this conversation with good

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:13.970
going into this conversation with good
 

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.490
going into this conversation with good
faith I have to wonder whether you've

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:15.500
faith I have to wonder whether you've
 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.980
faith I have to wonder whether you've
really objectively assessed whether or

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:17.990
really objectively assessed whether or
 

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.019
really objectively assessed whether or
not you your argument does hold up

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:20.029
not you your argument does hold up
 

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:22.269
not you your argument does hold up
against scrutiny because this is also

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279
against scrutiny because this is also
 

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.710
against scrutiny because this is also
part of the problem and when you're in

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720
part of the problem and when you're in
 

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.269
part of the problem and when you're in
an echo chamber you often don't

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279
an echo chamber you often don't
 

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.100
an echo chamber you often don't
formulate these arguments very well like

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.110
formulate these arguments very well like
 

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.780
formulate these arguments very well like
when you confront people about certain

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:28.790
when you confront people about certain
 

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.150
when you confront people about certain
bias beliefs that they have and you you

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160
bias beliefs that they have and you you
 

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.280
bias beliefs that they have and you you
have an opposing belief if they're part

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.290
have an opposing belief if they're part
 

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.750
have an opposing belief if they're part
of a bubble like sometimes they might

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760
of a bubble like sometimes they might
 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760
of a bubble like sometimes they might
not have even ever considered some of

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:36.770
not have even ever considered some of
 

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.750
not have even ever considered some of
the things you have to say and I've seen

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760
the things you have to say and I've seen
 

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.350
