there's some fixed pool of demand and
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.700
there's some fixed pool of demand and
it's question of who can compete to

it's question of who can compete to
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470
it's question of who can compete to
serve that demand there's this giant

serve that demand there's this giant
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.350
serve that demand there's this giant
pool of needs and if we can get more

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
pool of needs and if we can get more
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970

you're in serving those needs and and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
you're in serving those needs and and
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.619
you're in serving those needs and and
we've got this capacity to get used to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
we've got this capacity to get used to
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.770
we've got this capacity to get used to
take you know 50 years for an economy to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
take you know 50 years for an economy to
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170
take you know 50 years for an economy to
grow learn and develop technology and

of stole a title for I gave a lecture at

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
of stole a title for I gave a lecture at
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710
of stole a title for I gave a lecture at
the Kennedy School about six or seven

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
the Kennedy School about six or seven
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660
the Kennedy School about six or seven
years ago which way i think i think the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
years ago which way i think i think the
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670
years ago which way i think i think the
lecture was titled the end of poverty i

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
lecture was titled the end of poverty i
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.920
lecture was titled the end of poverty i
think he used that title and i think we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
think he used that title and i think we
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410
think he used that title and i think we
have in our reach the capacity to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
have in our reach the capacity to
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.100
have in our reach the capacity to
eliminate these tremendous disparities

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
eliminate these tremendous disparities
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.289
eliminate these tremendous disparities
in different parts of the world if we

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
in different parts of the world if we
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.550
in different parts of the world if we
can harness these forces so so i think i

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
can harness these forces so so i think i
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.830
can harness these forces so so i think i
think these changes are our epic changes

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.899
