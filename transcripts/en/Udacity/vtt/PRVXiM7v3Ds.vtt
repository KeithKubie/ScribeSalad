00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.260
In order for strings to be localized,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.680
it helps to move all
strings into strings.xml.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.390
Any string that is hard
coded cannot be translated

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.936
without modifying the compiled code.

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:13.800
In the strings.xml file, you

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.220
will want to comment thoroughly in order
to provide the context for the string.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.390
This will result in higher
quality translations.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.040
You may want to include information
such as, what is this string for,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.600
when is it presented to the user,
where is this in the layout?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.680
For example, translations are less
flexible for a button than a text box.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.820
You can also specify strings that
should not be translated simply with

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.310
a placeholder tag.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.470
Finally, there are a variety of system
provided formats for dates, times,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.700
numbers, and currencies.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.480
So take advantage of our
utils such as date format for

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.740
dates, decimal format and string
format for numbers and currency, and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.790
phone number utils for phone numbers to
simplify formatting across your locals.
