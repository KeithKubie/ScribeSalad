00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.255
MALE SPEAKER: And welcome to
Authors at Google, Cambridge

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:12.205
Edition.

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:14.580
We're very happy today
to have two guests

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.480
from central Massachusetts.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.432
Or is it western?

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:18.390
DEAN STIGLITZ: Central.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.272
MALE SPEAKER: Central
Massachusetts with us.

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:23.472
Laurie Herboldsheimer
and Dean Stiglitz.

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:27.232
Laurie and Dean
live in Leominster.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:27.920
Quick quiz.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.286
Birthplace of Johnny Appleseed.

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:34.563
DEAN STIGLITZ: And the
pink plastic lawn flamingo.

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:35.688
LAURIE HERBOLDSHEIMER: Ooh.

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:39.080
And Tupperware.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.580
OK.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.080
MALE SPEAKER: And
Golden Rule honey.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.911
DEAN STIGLITZ: Yes.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.145
Especially.

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:45.770
MALE SPEAKER: They
breed and keep bees.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.910
They market
treatment-free honey.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.400
They run beekeeping
conferences and classes.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
They write and do research.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.200
They're active in the Worcester
Beekeepers Association.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.337
They travel around
the country speaking

00:00:58.337 --> 00:01:00.453
about treatment-free
beekeeping and the importance

00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:05.570
of microbial
environment in beehive.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.820
Golden Rule Honey LLC
is their honey business.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.520
And they maintain a certified
food production facility

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.422
located in the building where
the pink plastic flamingo was

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:16.922
born.

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:20.810
So you're getting a piece of
history with every container.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.818
Very important.

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:23.776
DEAN STIGLITZ: The future's
in plastics, right?

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:25.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:27.240
MALE SPEAKER: That
and they package,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.614
distribute, and
retail honey from

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:33.222
other treatment-free
beekeeping operations.

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:35.230
And they produce the
queen of chocolate

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.134
as the king of chocolate.

00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:40.466
I feel I need to
meet this individual.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:44.170
But it's actually a unique
cocoa-free mix, dairy products

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.882
and sweetened only with honey.

00:01:46.882 --> 00:01:49.090
And if you want to get in
touch with them after this,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.275
you can go to their site which
is beeuntothers.com or email

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.512
them at info@ beeuntoothers.com.

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:00.890
So please join me in
welcoming Dean and Laurie.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.753
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:10.169
DEAN STIGLITZ: Well, I'm really
glad to be here at Google,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.200
and I'm hoping that
one of you is working

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.022
on charging my phone over
4G because the battery keeps

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:17.980
dying.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.820
We're really happy to be here
and talk about some things

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.680
about beekeeping.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.385
This is going to be a little
bit of a mishmash of a talk.

00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:26.340
I'm going to cover a
lot of different bases,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.710
things that are on our mind
that we think are important

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.380
and we think that are important
that other people understand

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.460
as well.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.510
So first, a little bit
of baseline beekeeping.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.373
So a few facts and numbers
to put the beekeeping

00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:43.890
industry in this
country in perspective.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.580
It's a little bit like
the Occupy Movement

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.770
except the opposite, that
99% of the bees in the US

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.537
are owned by 1%
of the beekeepers.

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:53.745
It's not terribly surprising.

00:02:53.745 --> 00:02:56.110
Some of these beekeepers
have 70,000 colonies.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.000
But we're talking
about somewhere

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.950
in the order of
1,000 beekeepers that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.807
are keeping 99% of the
bees in this country.

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:06.890
Three quarters of the bees
in this country-- which

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.910
is, of course, mostly
from these 1,000

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.400
beekeepers-- they
all go to California

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.600
to pollinate the almonds.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.010
The beehives are
loaded on trucks

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.980
from all over the
country and trucked

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.170
into the same part of California
for the same two, three weeks

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.400
every spring in order to
pollinate the almonds.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.389
And then all those bees,
they leave that area

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.180
and they go everywhere
else in the country.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.140
And if you were
going to design a way

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.600
to refine new
diseases and pathogens

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600
and spread them as quickly
around the country as

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.100
possible--

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.750
Did anybody else,
when they were a kid,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.575
get sent to a
chickenpox party so

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.732
that you could catch chickenpox?

00:03:46.732 --> 00:03:48.958
That's what this
almond thing is.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.252
It really is an incredible
thing that happens.

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:55.710
Another thing that's kind of
interesting that's easy for us

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.834
to lose sight of is that
the value of hive products

00:03:57.834 --> 00:03:59.600
have shifted over time.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.040
And what I mean by that is
that honey hasn't always

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.450
been the thing of value.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.460
And honey today isn't
the thing of value.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.180
The thing of value
today is pollination.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.030
That's how we feed our country
with our monocrop system

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.550
that we employ to
feed the masses.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.050
And I'm not going to talk
too much about that today.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.019
But understand that
in colonial England

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.420
the wax was what was important.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.920
How come?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.628
Because they didn't
have electric lights.

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:28.210
And beeswax candles put out
a very bright white light

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.700
and they don't produce soot.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.880
Whereas other oils
and stuff produced

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.610
soot and dirtied the air
and dirtied the walls.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.360
So beeswax was the
important thing.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.750
And we went from a time when
wax was the important product

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.016
and now we've got all kinds
of substitutes for the beeswax

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:43.890
like electric lights.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.720
And then honey became
the important thing.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.460
But really, what's important
right now is the pollination.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.876
Actually, we've got one customer
that eats a lot of honey,

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.292
but aside from
him, nobody's going

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:56.289
to go hungry if they
don't get honey.

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.830
The other thing that's important
is that treating and feeding

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.028
the bees is near
universal, and I'm

00:05:01.028 --> 00:05:03.720
going to talk a
little bit about that.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.859
So when I say treatments--
talk about the reasons

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:09.150
that treatments are used--
when I talk about treatments

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.175
I'm talking about
medications, substances

00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:14.590
that are put in the hive
specifically to fight disease

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.010
or to fight something
or to boost something.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.430
This particular bee here, if
you can see closely right where

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.588
I'm circling, that bee actually
has a varroa mite on its back.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:30.020
That's an exotic Asian mite
that came to this country

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.275
sometime around 1985.

00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:36.600
And it really is probably the
biggest problem that we've got.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.160
It looks like a little limpet
or something sitting on the bee.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.595
It's a mite, so
it has eight legs.

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:45.331
It's a little oval shaped.

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:47.080
If you look closely--
not on that picture,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.205
but on other pictures--
you can see the little legs

00:05:49.205 --> 00:05:50.923
on the sides.

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:53.540
Aside from mites-- and
that's a varroa mite,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.870
which is one type of mite
that we have-- we also

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.935
have a tracheal mite, which is
a microscopic internal mite.

00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:00.910
There are also some
bacterial infections

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.550
that we have to deal with.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.570
There's nosema, and I put
that it's own category

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.450
because nosema is one of
our oldest known microbial

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.454
pathogens.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.770
Nosema is what Pasteur was
looking at with the silk worm

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.560
larvae when he kind of figured
out that the infection was

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.630
coming from, actually,
this microscopic organism.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.160
There are different kinds of
nosema that we have with bees.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.510
But it's nosema nonetheless.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.090
And nosema is kind
of a funny thing.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.970
It's been classified
as a fungi in the past.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.332
It's now classified as a
microsporidian which, best I

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:37.790
can tell you is that's something
that's almost like a fungi

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.725
but isn't quite.

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:42.462
And of course, the
overall reason to treat

00:06:42.462 --> 00:06:45.950
is to increase productivity.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.840
Now there are several
types of treatments

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.397
that are used in beehives.

00:06:49.397 --> 00:06:51.230
And remember, I was
talking about treatments

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.380
that are near universal.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.770
That really pretty much
anybody keeping bees,

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.730
whether they're going to a hobby
beekeeping class or they're

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.640
commercial beekeepers,
using some of this stuff.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.850
The most obvious stuff are
the synthetic chemicals.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.953
And these are
synthetic pesticides.

00:07:05.953 --> 00:07:07.494
We have the same
kinds of pesticides.

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:08.994
We have the same
pesticides that are

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:10.650
used in agriculture
and other areas.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.920
Fluvalinate is the first one.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.170
This is something
that's used for mites.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.300
And it a pyrethroid, which
is a synthetic analog

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.204
of a toxin from a
chrysanthemum flower.

00:07:22.204 --> 00:07:24.480
There's a lot of different
pyrethroids out there.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.460
Fluvalinate is one of them.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.270
Coumaphos.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.930
Anybody heard the
term organophosphate?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.929
Does everyone know that?

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:35.950
Organophosphates are
a class of pesticides

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.790
that were pretty much phased
out of as much of agriculture

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.420
as we possibly can.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.090
Would it surprise you
to know that coumaphos

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.000
is a organophosphate that's
allowed to be used in beehives

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.510
that are going to be producing
honey for human consumption?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.160
Hopefully there's not very
much of it left in the hive

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.120
when the honey's
being taken out.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.430
But these are serious
synthetic pesticides,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.670
the kinds of things that
as environmentalists we're

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.726
all trying to get out
of the environment.

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:04.600
But of course, beekeepers
are telling farmers

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.850
not to use some of this stuff
while they're putting it

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.020
in the hives, which makes
it a little bit difficult.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.180
So those synthetic
chemicals, they

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.650
are agricultural pesticides.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.580
Then we have some antibiotics
for the bacterial diseases

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.810
that we were talking about.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.584
Specifically, TM is an
abbreviation for Terramycin,

00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:27.640
tertracycline, kind of the
standard broad spectrum

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.678
antibiotics that we're
used to in agriculture

00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:31.142
and in human use.

00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:33.900
And Tylan is a newer
antibiotic that's

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.500
been introduced because, of
course, the bacterial diseases

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.480
that Terramycin
is being used for

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.169
are becoming resistant to it.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.362
So they have to add
another antibiotic that

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:44.445
lasts a little bit longer.

00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:46.015
And there's been
a third one that's

00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:47.931
been added there that I
forget the name of it.

00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:50.640
And I have never used
any of these in a hive,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.955
so I don't have any direct
first-hand experience

00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:54.770
with them.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.370
Fumidil is really interesting.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.991
It's classified as an antibiotic
so I have it under there.

00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:04.200
Fumidil is a fungal toxin
like a lot of antibiotics.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.960
It's produced by a fungus.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.805
And it's actually
produced by a fungus that

00:09:08.805 --> 00:09:11.290
causes another disease
in the beehive.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.760
There's a whole balancing act of
all these microbes in the hive.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.370
And just like any complex
microbial culture,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.160
they have antagonistic
relationships

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.090
towards one another.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.500
So a disease called stonebrood,
and the causative organism

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.035
for stonebrood produces
this toxin called Fumidil.

00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:30.740
Now Fumidil, we
use against nosema.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.016
Or, I shouldn't say we.

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:33.940
Again, it's something
I've never used.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.190
Fumidil's used against nosema.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.290
It's really the only thing
that works against nosema.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.930
It was originally
developed for human use,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.667
but it was not
approved for human use

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:44.910
because it causes
massive birth defects.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.250
And like a lot of fungal toxins,
I put this in its own category

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.840
here because even though it's
technically an antibiotic,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.790
we're using it against
a microsporidian which

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.670
is much closer to a
fungi than a bacteria.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.970
But like a lot of
fungal toxins, it

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.470
has a lot of other
weird qualities.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.428
The reason it was being
developed for human use

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:08.169
was it actually restricts
blood supply to tumors.

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:10.710
This isn't what we think of when
we think of a broad spectrum

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.350
antibiotic that kills bacteria.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.450
This has a lot of different
effects on things.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.460
And I don't ever want to be
in contact with it myself.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.410
Then in addition
to these treatments

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.065
there are-- I should
have little finger

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:27.580
quotes on there--
natural treatments.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.707
These are substances that
do occur naturally, never

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:33.040
naturally in the concentrations.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.470
They're used in the
hive as a medication.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.940
In the concentrations
that they're used,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.830
they're just as unnatural
as anything synthetic.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.867
Nature doesn't concentrate
them to that amount.

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.450
They're in a
concentration that nature

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.174
doesn't have any
way to deal with.

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:52.590
This would never
happen in nature.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.434
It's kind of like
making 180 proof vodka.

00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:58.850
Yeah, you might get some fruit
that ferments a little bit.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.399
You have some alcohol in nature.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.690
But that's totally different
than Devils Springs vodka,

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.830
and I know that firsthand.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.950
So the organic acids
are natural treatments.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.335
They do occur naturally
in the hive and in honey.

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:12.843
And therefore in
both cases they're

00:11:12.843 --> 00:11:14.510
not detectable in
honey as residue

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.955
because you'd have to determine
what was in the honey before

00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:19.670
and what was added to the honey.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.582
They're substances that do occur
in honey in varying amounts.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:26.370
And essential oils are
a really important one.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.048
Plants produce essential oils
for a very specific reason.

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:32.470
They do that in order to
prevent microbes and insects

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.999
and other small critters
from eating them.

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:35.665
They are toxins.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.000
And essential oils
are used in the hive

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.050
by a lot of beekeepers,
a lot of beekeepers

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.581
who consider what they're
doing natural and sustainable.

00:11:45.581 --> 00:11:48.080
They certainly consider it more
natural and more sustainable

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.340
and better for the bees
than the beekeepers that

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.210
are using the synthetic
chemicals up there.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.500
But I'm not really
convinced that the impacts

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.406
are any less of a problem.

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:01.030
That the essential
oils, do they really

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.501
knock out a lot of the microbes?

00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:04.750
As we'll talk about in a
little bit, although it's not

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.470
the main focus of this talk, the
microbial culture in the hive

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.390
and in the bees is
just as important

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.600
as the bees are for the bees.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.635
So what happens
when you treat bees?

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:17.510
What are the impacts?

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.050
Why am I up here talking
to you about treating

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.750
bees and why I don't
think it's right?

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.160
Well, first of all, it
interrupts a whole bunch

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.460
of these abbreviated CAS,
Complex Adaptive Systems.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.985
A beehive is one giant set
of complex adaptive systems.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:40.490
The bees, as a colony, they
have this very complex behavior

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.664
that we can observe.

00:12:41.664 --> 00:12:43.330
But on an individual
level we're looking

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.310
at little tiny robots with
very similar programs.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.650
And it's when they get
together, and it's not

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.150
like unlike if anybody's ever
read the Isaac Asimov "I,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.040
Robot" stories.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.310
In the first volume
there's one story

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.700
about these very simple
robots that actually

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.405
work as a little
social organization.

00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:02.179
And I think of that every
time I think of the bees.

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:03.595
And that's how
everything happens.

00:13:03.595 --> 00:13:05.040
There isn't a queen
that's sitting

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.230
on a throne telling
everybody what to do.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.430
When there's more brood
in the hive, more baby

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.945
bees in the hive than they
have food to provide for them,

00:13:12.945 --> 00:13:16.210
then more bees get allocated
to procuring more food.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.750
It really is as simple as that.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.170
And so when you put these
treatments in the hive-- first

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.110
of all, most of them have
not the synthetic pesticides

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.236
but the other ones, tend
to have very strong scents.

00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:31.360
And of course the bees
communicate with one another

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.890
through pheromones.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.199
As a super organism
body, the communication

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:37.865
between individuals
is through smelling.

00:13:37.865 --> 00:13:40.085
When you throw something
strong in there

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:43.480
like vaporized organic acid
or an essential oil that

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.430
has a very strong smell,
you're interrupting

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.897
all that communication
that happens

00:13:47.897 --> 00:13:50.820
between individuals
and groups of bees.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.320
All this stuff
affects the microbes.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.860
Especially, of course, the
antibiotics, and of course

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.830
the synthetic
pesticides do as well.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.670
And unfortunately so do
the more natural ones,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.110
the essential oils
and the organic acids.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.910
But more importantly, if you
take a step back on a bigger

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.650
scale, we've got
this hive of bees

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.042
and we're medicating
them every year

00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:15.750
or every two months
or every three months

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.140
or whatever we're
doing to get rid

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.750
of some parasite
or some disease,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.220
we're constantly
interfering with the balance

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.020
between the host
and the parasite.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.720
We can never achieve balance
because we're constantly

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.030
pushing in one direction,
which is causing the push

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.150
to come back from the
opposite direction.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.361
So the direct effects
of treatments.

00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:39.607
Brood loss-- almost all the
treatments that I've listed,

00:14:39.607 --> 00:14:41.440
almost anything that
you can put in the hive

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.630
has the potential certainly to
kill some of the young bees.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.976
That isn't a disaster
all the time,

00:14:47.976 --> 00:14:51.470
but it does have an
impact on the hive.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.000
Most of them affect
fertility, and that's

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.400
both of queens and of drones.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.647
So both halves of
the mating system.

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.105
If you have drones
that are sterile

00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:01.974
or drones that have sperm
that's affected that goes

00:15:01.974 --> 00:15:03.640
and mates with the
queen that's supposed

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.170
to live for three years and
store that sperm for that three

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.770
years.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.280
If that sperm dies
in four months

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.910
like one study out of
Virginia Tech has shown, then

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.800
what good has that mating
done for a year from now?

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.260
You've got dead
sperm in the queen.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.880
She can't produce
a viable offspring.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.820
It impacts the queen.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.520
It's very common
that the queen gets

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.409
replaced after
treatments are used.

00:15:26.409 --> 00:15:27.700
LAURIE HERBOLDSHEIMER: By bees.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.080
DEAN STIGLITZ: By the bees.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.260
The imbalance and the
smells and all that stuff.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.843
The bees think that
something's wrong.

00:15:33.843 --> 00:15:36.370
And when something's wrong, you
always go to the CEO, right?

00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:42.590
The microbial impacts, again.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.860
A lot of these treatments,
they encourage some microbes

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.570
and they put back
some other microbes.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.997
It just throws off the
whole balance of things

00:15:49.997 --> 00:15:52.540
and keeps things running.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.620
It perverts the
reproductive selection.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.994
What bees are we selecting from?

00:15:55.994 --> 00:15:58.410
If we're treating them, how
do we know which ones we want?

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.754
If we want bees that don't
need to be treated how do we--

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.420
We can have all the
metrics in the world

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.290
about the number of
mites, how quickly

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.760
they build up and
all this stuff.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.320
But if what we
want are bees that

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.955
can take care of themselves and
survive despite the challenges,

00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:14.080
there's really only one
way to measure that metric.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.580
And that is to let bees survive
without the challenges, and to,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.530
as I flippantly say,
not breed from the ones

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.304
that died over the winter.

00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:22.220
It is that simple.

00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:27.050
And the use of many
of these treatments

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.466
requires more
treatments, and I'll

00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:34.305
talk about that in a couple
of specific cases coming up.

00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:35.337
But we sell honey.

00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:37.170
And we talk to a lot
of people all the time.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.777
And when we say,
oh, we have honey

00:16:38.777 --> 00:16:40.860
from bees that are never
medicated they say, well,

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.522
what about the crops that
the bees are foraging on?

00:16:43.522 --> 00:16:45.563
You can't keep all the
chemicals out of the hive,

00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:47.199
and that's absolutely true.

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:49.240
But there's been very good
work out of Penn State

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.720
specifically that looked
at the amount of pesticides

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.880
and agricultural
chemicals in the hive.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.324
And what was found was that
by far, the highest levels

00:16:57.324 --> 00:16:58.865
were the ones that
the beekeepers are

00:16:58.865 --> 00:17:01.690
putting in the hive.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.970
And specifically
fluvalinate and coumaphos.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.121
We're not talking about
the greener stuff.

00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.829
We're talking about
synthetic pesticides.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.304
We're talking about
organophosphates in hives.

00:17:12.304 --> 00:17:14.970
These are the things that are at
the highest level in the hives.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.910
So obviously, any of you
that have worked on teams,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.359
it's the low hanging
fruit that you go for.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.430
Well, I can't really
dictate what a farmer does

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.434
or what a neighbor does.

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:26.619
But I can dictate what
I put in the hives.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.625
So beekeepers can actually
control what goes in the hives.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:31.290
So that's really
a good reason why

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.081
we ought to control
what it is because it's

00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:34.957
at the highest levels.

00:17:34.957 --> 00:17:37.040
We've got a lot of issues
with synergistic effects

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.030
in some of these pesticides with
other agricultural chemicals.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.250
That something like
fluvalinate, when

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.970
it gets combined with
a fungicide that's

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.030
being used in the field, it can
increase the toxicity to bees,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.470
and in some cases has been
reported as much as 1,000

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.540
times.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.010
That's a problem.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.610
But it isn't just
the farmers' problem.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.060
The example I like to use is
if you walk to work everyday

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.360
and there's a bus that comes
by, and every time that bus goes

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.870
by a cloud of exhaust
comes right in your face

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.870
and you start coughing.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.410
And you complain, I'm
going to be sick from this

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.590
and I'm not well, well, you
might have a case there.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.062
But if you're also smoking
three packs of cigarettes a day,

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:17.270
you're going to have a little
bit more trouble making

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.530
that case.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.080
And that's one of
the problems is

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.380
once we start talking
about synergistic effects,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.556
we the beekeepers have to take
some responsibility for that.

00:18:25.556 --> 00:18:29.380
And there's a lot of controversy
about what pesticides

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.880
are doing what to what
bees and what effects they

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.920
have on the environment.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.485
But only when all
the contamination

00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:38.140
is coming into the hive is
coming in from the outside

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.940
and not being put
there by the beekeeper,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.190
are we going to have any
clue what's actually going on

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.110
and what things
have what effect.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.340
So now I'll talk a
little bit about feeding.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.240
Because as you'll
see, feeding is also

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.240
a universal practice
among beekeepers.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.970
There's a bunch of
reasons for feeding.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.465
Most obviously is to
prevent starvation.

00:18:59.465 --> 00:19:03.025
That's not a terrible
reason to feed the bees.

00:19:03.025 --> 00:19:05.730
Feeding is also done to
replace harvested stores.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.980
The honey gets taken
off in the fall.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.865
Then the bees are fed.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.870
Generally around here we
don't have a whole lot

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.590
of beekeepers that are big
enough operations if they're

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.560
buying truckloads of
high fructose corn syrup.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.140
But that's the common practice.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.190
And what you'll see is certainly
white sugar, table sugar,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.990
just being mixed into
a serum and being

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.250
fed to the bees for
them to over winter

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.912
on so that the
beekeeper can have

00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:28.370
the honey on their
breakfast table.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.800
I think the bees want the
honey on their breakfast table.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.530
They don't want
that refined sugar

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.037
just as much as
we don't want it.

00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:35.620
If there was no
difference we wouldn't

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.390
be doing all this work.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.075
We'd just be taking
that refined sugar

00:19:39.075 --> 00:19:41.575
and putting it on the breakfast
table and skipping the honey

00:19:41.575 --> 00:19:44.210
and letting the bees keep it.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.960
Feeding can be done
to stimulate the bees.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.420
Sometimes, and under the
proper circumstances,

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.935
a small amount of
feeding does a great job

00:19:50.935 --> 00:19:55.640
of stimulating the bees to go
out and actually collect honey.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.710
Stimulation's a great
reason to feed the bees.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.620
And of course it doesn't
have to be artificial sugar.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.574
It could be honey.

00:20:05.403 --> 00:20:07.278
One of the most important
reasons for feeding

00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:10.510
is to increase the carrying
capacity of an area.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.050
Because what we get in nature
from the flowers, which

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.910
is where the bees
get the nectar, is we

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.290
get what beekeepers
call honey flows.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.980
That's a time and an
area where there's

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.580
a lot of nectar available.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.574
Well, when there's a
lot of nectar available,

00:20:24.574 --> 00:20:26.240
when there's a flow
going on, you almost

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.990
can't have too many
hives in an area.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.107
There is more for
the bees to collect

00:20:30.107 --> 00:20:32.730
than you could
fit bees in there.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.896
So you're not going
to run out of food.

00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:36.020
You've got 100 hives there.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.770
They're all gaining weight.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.853
They're all storing honey.

00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:38.654
Well, that's fine.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:41.070
But we've got the flip side
of that coin, which is dearth.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.710
So you've got that same area.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.660
You've got that
same hundred hives.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.700
And there's rarely
nothing blooming.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.055
But maybe there's only
enough forage in that area

00:20:50.055 --> 00:20:52.610
to support five
hives, not a hundred.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.340
Well, what you're going
to see is all the hives

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.860
losing population and
losing their stores

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.050
because it isn't there.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.780
And so to increase the carrying
capacity of the area, what

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.690
I'm talking about is feeding the
bees during a dearth in order

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.104
to be able to take
advantage of the flow.

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:10.645
In order to have
the large population

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.180
of bees for the flow.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.520
And of course the most
common reason to feed bees

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.710
is to produce more bees.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.793
Again, we have talked about
the almond pollination

00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:19.752
in California.

00:21:19.752 --> 00:21:21.570
That happens in February.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.439
In order to have
large numbers of bees

00:21:23.439 --> 00:21:24.855
to do pollination
in February, you

00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:26.866
have to start building
them up in November.

00:21:26.866 --> 00:21:28.740
And you start building
them up in November

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.910
when, if left to
their own devices,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.939
they'd be winding
down to not hibernate,

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:35.980
but to be a little bit
dormant during the winter.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.420
And we're doing the
opposite to them.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.472
So producing more
bees, that's what

00:21:40.472 --> 00:21:41.930
you do when you
want to do almonds,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.900
and it's what you do when you
want to have bees to sell.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.330
When you're part of the
package industry in the south

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.216
or in California, they
have bees that they

00:21:50.216 --> 00:21:51.900
feed a lot that turn
them into more bees

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:52.950
so they can sell bees.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.700
And in fact, those are
the characteristics

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.651
that those bees are
bred for, is to be

00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:58.400
able to feed them and
have them reproduce.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.715
Because remember, the
product is pollination.

00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:01.992
It isn't honey.

00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:04.050
And if the product
is pollination,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.630
you want to be
able to get numbers

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.310
of bees almost on demand.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.380
So as I said, of course feed
is not equivalent to honey.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.930
It's very common around here.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.905
In the middle of the
summer, we get a dearth.

00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:20.863
And it's very common
around here for beekeepers

00:22:20.863 --> 00:22:22.462
to just toss feed on them.

00:22:22.462 --> 00:22:24.420
Sugar on the hives as
soon as there's a dearth.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.682
So they can keep the numbers up.

00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:29.514
And it's not a
ridiculous theory.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.930
But what they're trying to do
is to keep the population up

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.190
so when the next
honey flow comes,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.090
they have enough bees
to collect that honey.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.550
Because each bee
in their lifetime

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:39.120
can only collect about a
twelfth of a teaspoon of honey.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.800
So it really is about having
a large number of bees

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.240
when that nectar is available.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.130
Feeding effects the
microbial cultures much

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.280
like the treatments do.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.550
But most importantly, it
prevents the selection

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.180
for bees that don't
require feeding.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.240
We overwinter some
very small colonies.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.280
And when they come
out of winter,

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.674
they started out full of honey.

00:23:01.674 --> 00:23:03.840
And when they come out of
winter, still with stores.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.690
We know that they didn't
consume very much honey

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.023
over the winter, because where
would they have gotten it

00:23:08.023 --> 00:23:09.840
if wasn't in that one box?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.380
And what we've found is
that as we're selecting bees

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.450
to survive in this area
that they are being selected

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.565
for frugality, for not going
through a whole lot of stores

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:20.315
in the wintertime.

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:22.860
Whereas the bees that
you purchase generally

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.610
do through a lot of
stores because they're

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:30.700
designed to feed and
turn into young bees.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:34.320
And of course, feed can
easily get into honey.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.910
We've had honey
tested off the shelf

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.500
and found up to 30% bee sugar
in honey that was $11 a pound

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.300
and supposedly from an
organic farm in Massachusetts.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:49.330
And my contention is that
if beekeepers really wanted

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.800
to keep the feed
out of the honey,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.910
really wanted to keep
that sugar syrup,

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.261
whether it's bee sugar or
corn sugar or cane sugar out

00:23:56.261 --> 00:23:58.920
of the honey, they'd flavor
it or they'd color it

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.880
so that if it got into
the honey they'd know it

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.600
and they wouldn't
sell the honey.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.339
Nobody does that.

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:06.880
And everybody claims that not
much sugar gets into the honey,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.960
but nobody really
tries to verify that.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.690
When it's done conscientiously
it does not get into the honey.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.690
It's very easy not to
do it conscientiously.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.850
And of course, when you're
running a big operation,

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.050
every visit to the bee
yard costs you something.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.630
And so you tend to kind of stack
things on top of each other.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.497
And so you put your
feeders on and you

00:24:27.497 --> 00:24:29.580
put your honey [? sweepers
?] on at the same time,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.840
and that's actually
fairly common practice.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.910
So another thing I'd
like to talk to you about

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.490
is bees being wild animals and
not domesticated livestock.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.730
Bees are wild and I think
they should stay wild.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.888
It's their wildness that
makes them valuable to us.

00:24:46.888 --> 00:24:48.682
We often get this
question, how do you

00:24:48.682 --> 00:24:50.606
get the bees to come home?

00:24:50.606 --> 00:24:52.480
This picture is actually
of some of our hives

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.520
on the roof of the restaurant
at the Intercontinental Hotel

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.150
right on the waterfront.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.890
And bees come home because
that's where their nest it.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.920
As individuals they
don't really exist.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.060
They exist as part of
this super organism.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.430
Well, what's in the hive?

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.950
Well, the queen's in the hive.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.275
All their comb is in the hive.

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:11.775
Their food stores
are in their hive.

00:25:11.775 --> 00:25:12.610
Their young are in the hive.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.734
Their future's in the hive.

00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:15.110
Everything's in the hive.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.780
So getting the bees to come
home is not hard as long

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.512
as you get them established
in their home first.

00:25:21.512 --> 00:25:23.640
So some of the things
that make bees wild

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.224
is that unlike
livestock, the bees,

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:28.140
they pretty much feed
and care for themselves.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.940
And they're not confined.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.020
They go out and they fly.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.895
They might fly three
miles away from the hive

00:25:31.895 --> 00:25:35.230
and come back, or even further.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.020
So this picture,
of course, you can

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.465
see a bee forging
on a sunflower.

00:25:39.465 --> 00:25:43.690
And I think this is
on the Greenway Park.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.820
And this is actually pollen
that the bees have stored

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.936
in the comb and it's
actually being fermented.

00:25:48.936 --> 00:25:52.630
And the fermented pollen, when
they ferment it-- just like,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.120
anybody here ever made pickles?

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.660
Like, not vinegar pickles
but lacto fermented pickles.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.930
They get sour.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.090
They get preserved.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.330
But more importantly,
the process

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.490
of fermentation in that this
is a process of microorganisms,

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.590
mostly fungi and bacteria
actually transforming

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.335
the substance of the
pollen into substances

00:26:14.335 --> 00:26:16.920
that the bees need
outside of the bee's body.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.290
They're actually
synthesizing proteins

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.900
and they're synthesizing
enzymes that they actually need

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.104
and that they can't
get anywhere else

00:26:26.104 --> 00:26:27.520
from this process
of fermentation.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.850
It's not just about storage.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.350
It's about increasing
the nutrition.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.080
Also unlike other
livestock, bees

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.414
retain the resources
to protect themselves.

00:26:37.414 --> 00:26:42.386
And that one's I think
fairly straightforward.

00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:45.105
The bee's main means
of protecting itself

00:26:45.105 --> 00:26:47.790
are the one that we recognize.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.970
But I also wanted to
include this picture.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.250
This is a bee that has
come back from the field.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.420
And on her hind legs
where normally she

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.990
stores pollen, where normally
we see pollen being brought

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.895
into the hive, that's
actually plant resin.

00:27:00.895 --> 00:27:02.752
That's propolis.

00:27:02.752 --> 00:27:04.650
What's going to
become propolis which

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.870
is the plant resin
that the bees refine.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.160
They use it to coat
the inside of the hive.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.720
They use it to stiffen the comb.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.340
They use it to glue
the stuff together.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.270
Yeah.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.770
They use it to glue
things together.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.811
They use it to reduce the
size of their entrance,

00:27:19.811 --> 00:27:20.570
to fill in cracks.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.075
They use it for everything.

00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:23.450
But what's important
is, remember

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.850
when we were talking a little
bit about essential oils

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.780
and that plants produce
essential oils in order

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.290
to keep things from eating them.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.760
Well, when they analyzed
the honeybee genome

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.850
a couple of years ago, what
they found that was surprising,

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.860
the most surprising
thing that we found,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.620
was that there was
almost no immune system.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.135
For a social insect that
lives in this tight colony

00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:49.680
with 50,000 or 100,000
individuals in close quarters

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.450
and all rubbing
against each other

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.850
and going out in the field
and picking up who knows what

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.960
and coming back, that they
really didn't have much

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.630
in the way of an immune system
the way we understand it.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.420
But what the bees do is they
have this social immunity.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.880
And what they do is they
collect these plant resins which

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.720
have substances in them
that protect the plant.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.145
And they're really appropriating
the defense mechanism

00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:14.110
of the plant and using it in
their hive for themselves.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.560
Which is really
kind of brilliant.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.425
And of course, if you've
studied the history of medicine

00:28:19.425 --> 00:28:21.600
or know anything about
natural medicine,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.396
propolis is one of the oldest
human medicines as well.

00:28:25.396 --> 00:28:27.550
Well, I won't go
into detail of that.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.750
But you can, of
course, google it

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.240
or Ask Jeeves or whatever
you do around here.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.510
But it's very good
stuff and very powerful.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:47.520
And as one genius
researcher remarked, well,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.770
if it's good for the humans,
if humans use it and have

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.970
medical benefits, maybe
the bees are using it

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.395
for a specific reason.

00:28:54.395 --> 00:28:58.310
Well, that's why we're using it.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.420
The other thing is that
unlike livestock, bees

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.065
are adaptable without
domestication.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.480
We don't have to
domesticate wildebeest

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.600
into something that will live
in a barn and get milked.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.660
Bees, they move into
cavities on their own.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.805
This is actually a
ceiling in West Roxbury.

00:29:16.805 --> 00:29:18.970
This is a colony that
we removed there.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.530
And this is a telephone pedestal
in Florida, south Florida.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.530
Anywhere where there's a
cavity the bees will move in.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.280
So it doesn't really
take much to convince

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.500
them to move into a box.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.868
They're pretty happy to do that.

00:29:32.868 --> 00:29:35.960
The other thing that
is kind of worth noting

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.756
is that bees are fascinating.

00:29:37.756 --> 00:29:39.930
Obviously we're all
here, so there's

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.950
some interest in
bees in all of us,

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.730
or we wouldn't be in this room.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.100
But when I say bees
are fascinating they

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.570
capture our imagination.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.451
And when you look
in a hive, when

00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:55.825
you look at
something like this--

00:29:55.825 --> 00:29:57.715
this is actually a piece
of comb that was in a wall

00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:59.366
that we were
removing in Florida--

00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:01.870
but if you ever
looked in a beehive,

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.890
or seen pictures of a beehive,
or seen an observation hive,

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.455
you have these parallel combs.

00:30:06.455 --> 00:30:11.276
And the bees are living on
the comb and between the comb.

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:14.495
And when you observe the
hive, you open it up.

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:15.995
And the bees don't
totally freak out

00:30:15.995 --> 00:30:17.630
because you're taking
their home apart

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.960
because whoever took their
home apart before we showed up

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.888
there, they got 50 million
years of not having anybody

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:29.312
open up their hive gently.

00:30:29.312 --> 00:30:31.940
Just a bear ripping
it apart is one thing.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.930
But somebody gently smoking
them and taking the hive

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.740
apart, what we're
able to see, it's

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.120
almost like reading a book.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.490
That each comb is like
a page of this book.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.967
And as you move
through the combs,

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.800
you can see all of these
different processes

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.290
that we recognize as
happening in all life.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.980
We see how they assimilate
and digest food,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.172
how they rear their
young, how they reproduce.

00:30:55.172 --> 00:30:57.755
We can see them out in the field
doing their thing, collecting

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:02.160
the carbohydrates from the
flowers and the propolis

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.467
and the pollen.

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:05.550
We can see all this stuff.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.925
We can see their
stress response.

00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:09.280
But as we've got the
hive open for a long time

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.871
we can hear them start
to get a little bit

00:31:11.871 --> 00:31:14.245
agitated and annoyed.

00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:17.360
And so it's very much
like reading a book.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.210
And it's very much like reading
a children's book where you're

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.950
looking at an organism, and
each cell in the organism

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.210
is kind of animated into
a little character that

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.990
has a little antennae and
little wings that goes around

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.081
and does their part
of the process.

00:31:32.081 --> 00:31:34.330
They go out and they bring
a little bit of nectar back

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.710
and they hand it off to
another bee, and that bee

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.922
takes that nectar and goes
and puts it into a cell.

00:31:38.922 --> 00:31:41.255
And then another bee comes
along and refines that nectar

00:31:41.255 --> 00:31:42.129
into honey.

00:31:42.129 --> 00:31:44.420
And then another bee comes
along and takes some of that

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.750
and eats it so they can
go and generate heat

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.560
somewhere else in the colony.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.790
We can actually
observe all this stuff,

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.850
where observing it in an
organism they way we're

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.642
used to really almost
requires computer animation.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.860
On an even larger
scale-- remember,

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:08.000
plants don't have legs and
they have a hard time moving.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.040
Bees kind of facilitate the
mating dance between plants.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.910
They move the pollen from
one flower to another.

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.367
Not for all plants,
but for many plants.

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:20.620
And they're kind
of acting as kind

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:25.420
of a third party in the
mating of all these plants.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.350
And this system of
flowers that require

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.240
pollinators, bees being one
of the major pollinators,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.730
this is a very old system.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:36.290
Not quite as old as the
microbial foundation of life,

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.610
but it's kind of the next
step up of life as we know it,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.940
this is the foundation.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.260
The plants produce the sugar
from the sun and sugar,

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.340
that sugar that's
produced by the plants,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.460
by the chlorophyll,
that's really

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.110
the currency that
life trades on.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.540
That sugar gets traded all
up and down the food chain.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:33:00.530
And of course, anybody that's
spent time watching bees

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.030
knows that they're
kind of quirky

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.121
and they're kind
of fun to watch.

00:33:04.121 --> 00:33:05.495
And they capture
our imagination,

00:33:05.495 --> 00:33:07.260
and they make an
interesting lens

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.950
to look at the natural world.

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:11.669
Because they do things so
differently than we do,

00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:12.960
but they're social like we are.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.820
And they do things
so differently

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.800
than other kinds of insects
or mice or other animals

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.620
that we have.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.100
Yet even though mice are a
lot more like us in many ways,

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.920
a lot of social
behavior stuff in humans

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.400
is actually modeled in bees.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.290
So a few things about beekeeping
in Massachusetts today

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:35.350
is that land use has
changed quite a bit.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:40.030
Massachusetts used to be a
major center for beekeeping.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.690
The first Italian queens
to be imported into the US

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.060
were imported into
Massachusetts into Colrain

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.582
which is in the Western
part of the state.

00:33:47.582 --> 00:33:49.540
But what's happened, of
course, is development.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.487
And we know all
about development.

00:33:52.487 --> 00:33:54.363
And that's gotten
rid of a lot of land.

00:33:54.363 --> 00:33:56.240
But-- and I usually
turn to tree hugging

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.554
here, not in the
traditional sense.

00:33:58.554 --> 00:33:59.970
The other thing
that's happened is

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.830
places that used to
be open fields, that

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.420
used to have a
lot of wildflowers

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.424
and a lot of nature-- well,
when I was a kid growing up

00:34:06.424 --> 00:34:08.639
in this area, they
used to burn them

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.139
every few years
to keep them open.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.250
And they stopped doing
that for the most part.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.659
And what happens is, of
course, trees grow up.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.600
And once there are trees, nobody
wants to cut the trees down.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.455
There's a huge resistance
to cutting a tree.

00:34:19.455 --> 00:34:21.330
The idea that you're
going to cut a tree down

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.704
makes you not an
environmentalist

00:34:22.704 --> 00:34:24.350
for some reason.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.269
If, though, you want a
different environment,

00:34:26.269 --> 00:34:29.821
the environment that
was there before.

00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:32.159
And that's a big problem.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.110
Because areas that used to
be able to support bees,

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.652
because of the green
influence, trees

00:34:36.652 --> 00:34:38.526
have been allowed to
grow up, and now they're

00:34:38.526 --> 00:34:40.120
not so good for bees anymore.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.570
And we don't really
have a way to handle it.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.834
The other issue is,
well, the land use

00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:47.500
and the tree hugging
has been happening.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.041
We've have a few
invasive plants that

00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:51.690
have turned into excellent
honey producers, Purple

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.659
loosestrife and
Japanese knotweed.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.820
What two invasive
plants does the state

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.552
spend money trying to eradicate?

00:34:58.552 --> 00:35:01.500
Purple loosestrife
and Japanese knotweed.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.850
I'm not advocating that we
let these things grow wild.

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.322
I'm just saying that from
a beekeeper's perspective,

00:35:07.322 --> 00:35:09.306
these two things
have been happening.

00:35:09.306 --> 00:35:12.282
And this has kind
of been our savior.

00:35:12.282 --> 00:35:13.430
And now it's a problem.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.430
And it may just be that
we don't have the budget

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.230
to fight this stuff anymore,
and it will take care of itself.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.660
And I don't really have a good
solution for this problem,

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.460
but it's one worth pointing out.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.990
And recently, we've
been thinking about,

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.610
are there unexploited
resources in the state?

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.260
And one thought that
has come to mind

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.525
is the power line right of ways.

00:35:33.525 --> 00:35:35.557
They do use herbicides
on them periodically,

00:35:35.557 --> 00:35:36.640
I think every three years.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.690
But kind of trying
to put together

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.774
a little plan of
some way to utilize,

00:35:40.774 --> 00:35:42.690
because that's excellent
honey producing land.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.660
So all young plants, things
like sumac and wildflowers,

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.620
everything's low.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.810
There's plenty of sunlight
because it's kept clear.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.260
This is really something.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.885
And we'd have to work out a way
that we could move the bees out

00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:57.426
of the areas that are going to
have the herbicide treatments,

00:35:57.426 --> 00:35:58.895
and there's a lot
of infrastructure

00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:00.700
that would have to go into this.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.350
But this is one of
the plans that we're

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.685
trying to look into as a way
to increase our beekeeping

00:36:05.685 --> 00:36:08.360
operation here in Massachusetts.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.170
So a few things that you don't
know about beekeeping but you

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.920
should.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.440
Treatments are universal
and feeding is universal.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.636
Almost to a tee.

00:36:16.636 --> 00:36:18.260
Almost every beekeeper,
whether they're

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.850
a hobbyist or a commercial
beekeeper feeds and treats.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.090
The selection criteria
for breeding stock

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.600
is skewed towards the production
of almond and packaged bee

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.100
production.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.850
And this is what I was
just talking about,

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:30.727
that there are
bees that are being

00:36:30.727 --> 00:36:35.222
bred for the quality of if you
feed them, they make more bees.

00:36:35.222 --> 00:36:37.680
That's different than bees that
can take care of themselves

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.522
and can regulate their
populations to the environment.

00:36:40.522 --> 00:36:43.980
We had about an 80% die off
of bees in Massachusetts

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.543
last winter according to
our state bee inspector.

00:36:46.543 --> 00:36:48.131
That's significant.

00:36:48.131 --> 00:36:50.630
We've got a lot of beekeepers
in the state, but most of them

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.371
are hobby beekeepers
with one or two hives.

00:36:54.371 --> 00:36:55.870
We did a little bit
better than 80%.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.040
Not a whole lot better.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.330
I think probably about 60%
die off with our own colonies

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:02.242
last winter.

00:37:02.242 --> 00:37:04.130
But our bees were
never artificially fed

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.550
and they were never medicated.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.000
So I feel like we're a little
bit ahead of the eight ball

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.459
there because the bulk of
those bees are medicated.

00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:13.625
And if they're being medicated
and they're being fed

00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:15.200
and there's still
an 80% die off,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.190
there's something wrong
with that procedure.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.754
And if you're buying honey
from somebody who's a beekeeper

00:37:22.754 --> 00:37:24.760
and they never run out
of honey, then you've

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.310
got to suspect that they might
be buying in honey sometimes.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.522
And people generally
aren't open about that.

00:37:31.522 --> 00:37:32.980
Our model's a little
bit different.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.437
And in fact when
we're done, we've

00:37:34.437 --> 00:37:36.270
got some honey for you
all to taste as well.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.390
Now there's a very
strong movement out there

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:48.820
that wants to ban neonicotinoid
insecticides as a way

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.670
to save the bees.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.300
This is something that's
swept through Europe

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.190
and through the US.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:59.340
As far as I can tell it's mostly
through very anti-corporate

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.670
green groups that
are promoting this.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.088
And they do a very
disingenuous thing.

00:38:05.088 --> 00:38:07.160
At least as this
point, we don't have

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.354
a cause for CCD, Colony
Collapse Disorder.

00:38:09.354 --> 00:38:11.020
We don't have something
that we can say,

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.300
this is what causes it.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.900
Nobody has been able to
replicate it in the field

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.640
and say, I did this and the bees
died in consistent with manners

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.760
they do to colony
collapse disorder.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.164
This is what causes it.

00:38:25.164 --> 00:38:28.530
And I'll get into that later.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.680
But what's happened
is that there's

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.860
been a move to kind of muddy
the waters a little bit.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.522
And so what happens
is neonicotinoids,

00:38:39.522 --> 00:38:41.660
this class of
insecticides, there

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.250
have definitely been
overt pesticide poisonings

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.690
that have killed a lot
of bees from them, mostly

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.247
through the dust they
produce when they plant them.

00:38:49.247 --> 00:38:51.330
This is hopefully something
that's being worked on

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.455
and something that's going
to get better over time.

00:38:53.455 --> 00:38:55.375
If we have a problem
we like to work on it

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:56.760
and we like to solve it.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.830
But the problem is
that in those cases

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.050
it's definitely not CCD because
it's overt pesticide poisoning.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.580
We know what the cause is.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.910
They were exposed to a
pesticide and they died.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.730
So what happens is-- and I like
to kind of squish these two

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.144
groups together and say, OK.

00:39:11.144 --> 00:39:13.560
We have these bees that died
from colony collapse disorder

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.810
that we don't what caused it.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.930
But we think it's from
neonicotinoids even though we

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.885
can't find the neonicotinoids
in the dying or dead colonies.

00:39:22.885 --> 00:39:25.631
Then we've got these bees
that died from overt pesticide

00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:26.130
poisoning.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.242
And since we think that that
overt pesticide poisoning is

00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:32.950
CCD we're going to
mush them all together

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.985
and say that both
groups together all died

00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:39.050
from pesticides and
they all died from CCD.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.400
Therefore, CCD is
pesticide poisoning.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.635
This is the logic,
and it isn't true.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.306
And it doesn't do any favors.

00:39:49.306 --> 00:39:52.000
We're really a point where
when we talk about CCD,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
we're talking about things
that are unexplained.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.083
We're not talking about
overt pesticide poisoning.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.930
The Penn State work that I
was talking about earlier that

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.891
looked at the
pesticides in the hive,

00:40:02.891 --> 00:40:05.390
when they found those extremely
high levels of the beekeeper

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.750
applied pesticides in the
hive, what they were looking

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.490
for was the neonicotinoids.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.500
They assumed they were
going to find them.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.001
This was in 2008.

00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:14.875
Colony collapse disorder
was big in the news.

00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:16.270
It was a new thing.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:20.400
And the theory that
these pesticides

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.960
that were becoming
more and more prevalent

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.850
and that were very
toxic to the bees

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.550
and that the bees are exposed
to caused this die off

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.800
was what everybody
expected to find.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.780
But the studies
haven't backed it up.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.582
And that's been
problematic for those

00:40:35.582 --> 00:40:37.770
that have wanted to
stick by that story.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.800
Obviously by this
point, cell phones.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.275
You know, we heard that cell
phones were killing the bees

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.570
and cell phone towers
were disorienting them.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.100
That was a German study
on not cell phones

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.390
but wireless phones.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.010
And it was mistranslated
and then made all the media

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.510
here in this country that cell
phones were killing the bees.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.300
It just simply isn't true.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.250
Did anybody here see this
story about a month or a month

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:02.879
and a half ago?

00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:03.920
I think it was in Oregon.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.030
It was all these bumblebees
died in a Target parking lot.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.436
I think they had 17 Linden
trees in this parking lot.

00:41:10.436 --> 00:41:11.810
And they were
sprayed with one of

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.740
these neonicotinoid
insecticides.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.790
And they had 25,000
bumblebees die.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.824
And they were calling
it a disaster.

00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:20.490
Well I'd like to just
offer a little bit

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.880
different perspective on that.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.770
You've got a Target parking lot.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.520
You planted 17 trees
to attract pollinators

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.127
and you've got 25,000
bumblebees that showed up.

00:41:32.127 --> 00:41:34.585
We're told that all these native
pollinators are in decline

00:41:34.585 --> 00:41:35.977
and they don't
exist in the wild.

00:41:35.977 --> 00:41:37.310
But you've got this parking lot.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.760
Not only were there
25,000 bumblebees

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.785
there, but they had
put nets over the trees

00:41:41.785 --> 00:41:44.010
because they estimated there
were another 25,000 that

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:45.910
were in danger of
picking up the pesticide.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.990
So you've got one
Target parking lot

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.850
with 17 trees attracting
50,000 bumblebees?

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:55.150
I don't think things are quite
as grim as we're told they are.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.710
The other example
on that same line

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.435
is we have bees at the
Intercontinental Hotel, which

00:42:00.435 --> 00:42:01.630
is right along the Greenway.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:05.120
And we do a farmer's
market on the Greenway.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.345
And I'm amazed.

00:42:06.345 --> 00:42:09.845
It wasn't that along ago that
the Greenway wasn't so green.

00:42:09.845 --> 00:42:14.020
Big green steel structure,
but not green in that sense.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.930
And I go around there and I
take pictures of our honeybees

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.640
in the flowers on the Greenway
because I like to show those

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.655
to the people at
the Intercontinental

00:42:21.655 --> 00:42:23.330
and show them what
their bees are doing.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.100
Well what's been amazing is the
number of native pollinators

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.294
that have shown up there.

00:42:28.294 --> 00:42:29.960
Now, I know why the
honeybees are there.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.130
I've got bees on the roof
a quarter a mile away.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.840
But really, if you
build it they will come.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.390
All they had to do was build
this park, plant flowers

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.429
in the middle of the
city-- even though it's

00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:41.595
in the middle of the city--
and all these bumblebees

00:42:41.595 --> 00:42:44.740
and wasps and all these
tiny native pollinators,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.840
all these pollinators
just showed up.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.570
So again, I don't think things
are quite as grim as they

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.840
may appear if one
reads the media.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.930
Fungicides aren't
supposed to hurt bees.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.388
And in fact,
fungicides are allowed

00:42:57.388 --> 00:43:00.690
to be used on a lot of crops on
the open bloom, the bloom that

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.820
is designed for
the bee to visit.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.715
So that the bees
are actually being

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:07.970
asked to be exposed
to these fungicides

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.960
and bring them back to the hive.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.410
I think one report was
that hives coming off

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.410
the cranberries in
southern Massachusetts

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.720
had 7,000 parts per
billion of a fungicide

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.200
in the bees when they came off.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.575
But there's more
and more studies

00:43:21.575 --> 00:43:24.066
that are showing even though
the fungicides don't just

00:43:24.066 --> 00:43:25.732
kill the bees outright
like a pesticide,

00:43:25.732 --> 00:43:28.350
like an insecticide does,
it affects their ability

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.130
to raise queens.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.610
It affects their
reproductive ability.

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.770
It affects a lot of stuff.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.200
LAURIE HERBOLDSHEIMER:
Their food supply.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.950
DEAN STIGLITZ: It
affects the food supply.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.010
Remember the fermented pollen?

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.105
Well, if you need fungi
to do the fermentation

00:43:40.105 --> 00:43:42.490
and you've got
fungicides in there

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.675
it's kind of like
trying to brew beer

00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:47.296
and putting a yeast
killer in the vat.

00:43:47.296 --> 00:43:49.610
It doesn't really work.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.260
Insecticides other
than neonicotinoids.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.050
And I talk about
this because how many

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.985
here have gotten a petition on
their email that says, oh, we

00:43:56.985 --> 00:43:59.450
need to ban these
neonicotinoid pesticides.

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:00.710
Sign this petition.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.990
Well, you go ahead and
you sign that petition.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.269
And I know we're all very
well meaning when we do that.

00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:08.310
But do you think that
means that the farmers that

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.934
are being banned from using the
pesticide that they want to use

00:44:10.934 --> 00:44:12.975
are going to not
use any pesticide?

00:44:12.975 --> 00:44:14.975
The reason that we moved
to these neonicotinoids

00:44:14.975 --> 00:44:19.095
is they don't require the kind
of aerial broadcasting of crop

00:44:19.095 --> 00:44:21.589
dusters that we kind of
are used to historically.

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:23.380
And believe me, there
are a lot of beehives

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.444
that died from those
kinds of pesticides.

00:44:26.444 --> 00:44:28.860
The idea that you're going to
ban one class of pesticides,

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.510
you've got to look
and see what is going

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.827
to be used in its
place, and is it

00:44:31.827 --> 00:44:33.326
going to be any
better for the bees?

00:44:33.326 --> 00:44:36.179
And I think the answer is no.

00:44:36.179 --> 00:44:37.720
The treatments,
obviously I've talked

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.840
a lot about why I think
the treatments are bad

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.920
and why I think the
treatments are a problem,

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.060
the feeds are a problem.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.490
Another real issue
is the science.

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:52.540
And although Laurie and I
are not trained scientists,

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.930
we're not stupid and
we understand English.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.460
And I have a mind, right?

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.230
I can read scientific studies.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.110
And I can understand them
and I can find the flaw.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.599
And there's always a flaw.

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:05.890
Especially when you're dealing
with biological systems.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.892
It's not quite like growing
a crystal or something

00:45:08.892 --> 00:45:10.475
like that in a
laboratory environment.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.705
But we've really
gotten the shaft

00:45:14.705 --> 00:45:16.436
from the scientists
with the bees.

00:45:16.436 --> 00:45:19.580
And a couple that I'd
like to just point out.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.045
Jeff Pettis who is the top
bee researcher with the USDA.

00:45:25.563 --> 00:45:26.896
He's our national bee scientist.

00:45:26.896 --> 00:45:28.760
He's the guy.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.390
He did a study that showed
that undetectable levels

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.220
of neonicotinoid pesticides
make the bees more

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.782
susceptible to a
disease, to nosema,

00:45:38.782 --> 00:45:41.560
the disease we were
talking about earlier.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.345
AUDIENCE: If they were
undetectable, how do they know?

00:45:45.345 --> 00:45:47.720
DEAN STIGLITZ: Well, because
they know if they put it in,

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.500
and they know it was diluted.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.110
But here's the problem.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:57.030
What they did essentially
is they took a hive of bees.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.237
They had controls and
experimental colonies.

00:45:59.237 --> 00:46:00.445
But they take a hive of bees.

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:02.230
And for the
experimental colonies,

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.180
they'd actually give
them this tiny dose

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.720
of neonicotinoid insecticide.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.250
Then after a week or
some period of time

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.160
they collected bees from that
hive and put them in a cage.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.550
And they fed those bees
for 30 days in the cage.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.625
And what they did is for some
of them they exposed them

00:46:18.625 --> 00:46:21.241
to nosema and some
of them they didn't.

00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:21.740
OK?

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.835
And the idea was to see if the
bees from the hives that had

00:46:24.835 --> 00:46:28.040
this very tiny dose of an
insecticide had more nosema

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.450
than the bees that didn't.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.310
Now before this
study was published,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:36.070
Jeff Pettis was interviewed
in a European film talking

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.230
about this.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.750
And this is before the
study was released.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.080
He wouldn't discuss it with
anybody in this country.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.060
Well, when the study
was finally released

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.430
and I got a chance to
read it, what I found--

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.250
and it's not very hard to find.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:55.330
It's very straightforward
if you read the procedure.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.800
In that time period where the
bees were caged and exposed

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.585
to the nosema--
there were 30 days,

00:47:00.585 --> 00:47:04.950
I believe it was, before
they tested the end result--

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.030
any bees that died in that
30 days were discarded

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.940
and they were never tested
to see if they had nosema.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.520
They had one whole control
set that all died in the cage

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.368
and they never tested them.

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:21.270
Now if those bees had
nosema, whether or not

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:22.650
that's what killed
them, it would

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.505
have made the results of this
study exactly the opposite.

00:47:26.505 --> 00:47:29.720
They just threw away the
data that didn't fit neatly

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.190
or that they were afraid
wouldn't fit neatly

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:35.550
into what they were looking at.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.328
You can't do science that way.

00:47:37.328 --> 00:47:39.956
It doesn't help anything.

00:47:39.956 --> 00:47:42.370
In addition we've got
some other studies.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.905
Tom Seeley is an excellent
researcher at Cornell

00:47:44.905 --> 00:47:46.430
and has done some
incredible work

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:51.860
on swarming, the definitive
work on swarming behavior.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.573
He did a study regarding
our practices that we do.

00:47:56.573 --> 00:48:01.725
And he claimed that all of his
colonies-- this is controlled

00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:04.830
and experimentals-- never
raised a single drone,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.300
never raised a single male
bee throughout the entire

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.250
experimental period,
throughout the entire year.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.960
Just simply isn't believable
to anybody that's kept bees.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.840
If you have bees that
aren't raising drones,

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.330
there's something
weird going on.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.386
Drones are from
unfertilized eggs.

00:48:19.386 --> 00:48:21.760
Even if the queen wasn't
mating, she'd be raising drones.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.200
Even if the sperm wasn't
viable she'd be raising drones.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.590
This was a way to just make
the data a little bit easier

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:29.590
to digest.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.740
And then in another
case, Doctor [? Lu ?]--

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.840
this is a study that came out
of the Harvard School of Public

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.064
Health that's had a lot of press
nationally, internationally,

00:48:40.064 --> 00:48:42.570
and here in the Boston area.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:46.900
If you look at what was
reported in their study

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.650
for the management
of the bees, they

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.240
started out the year
in March with hives

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.592
that were full of bees
and full of honey.

00:48:53.592 --> 00:48:55.080
They fed them every week.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.570
They never took any honey out.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.980
They never gave them more room.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.170
The bees never swarmed.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.109
They were full come fall.

00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:06.080
And then within a
month of them having

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.067
14 frames of honey,
which is more

00:49:09.067 --> 00:49:10.900
than the bees need to
go through the winter,

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:15.170
within a month of that, they
were feeding them again.

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.010
None of this makes any sense.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.680
That in March if you
have a full hive of bees,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.130
they're going to swarm.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.505
That colony's
going to reproduce.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.485
If you would see this with
one hive or something,

00:49:28.485 --> 00:49:29.290
that's one thing.

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.001
But if your entire
experiment are

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:33.500
these bees that were so strong
that they should have swarmed

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.655
and they should
have produced honey,

00:49:34.655 --> 00:49:36.320
and they should have
needed more room

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.739
and none of those
things happened,

00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:38.780
it just isn't believable.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:43.220
And it makes it difficult to
accept anything that they say.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.171
The other one that really gets
me is we get a lot of studies

00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:49.295
with bees that only are
looking at one or two hives

00:49:49.295 --> 00:49:50.419
or five hives or something.

00:49:52.895 --> 00:49:55.270
I'm not a math guy.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.050
But they use statistics
to try to say,

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.830
OK, we only had five hives.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.490
But we can apply all
this math and determine

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.479
how representative those
five hives are of some whole

00:50:07.479 --> 00:50:09.020
that we haven't
measured and we don't

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.640
know what the
characteristics are.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.890
I simply don't believe it.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:13.390
Yes?

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.889
AUDIENCE: So what
would you count it

00:50:14.889 --> 00:50:17.004
if they had to observe
every hive in the world?

00:50:17.004 --> 00:50:18.260
DEAN STIGLITZ: No.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.030
But the problem is
with bees, no matter

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.530
how experienced a
beekeeper you are,

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.560
if you start two hives next
to each other with as close

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:31.350
to the same lineages as
possible, the same equipment,

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.296
to laboratory standards
exactly the same as possible

00:50:34.296 --> 00:50:37.179
and manage them exactly the
same throughout the season,

00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:39.720
they are not going to look the
same at the end of the season.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.190
So you have a problem
that you haven't

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.231
correlated your controls.

00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:44.700
And in fact in a
later slide I'll

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.242
point out that one of the things
that I think needs to happen

00:50:47.242 --> 00:50:49.783
is I think that there need to
be multiple control groups that

00:50:49.783 --> 00:50:50.300
get done.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.400
Because multiple control
groups will show you

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.152
very quickly if your
statistics are dishonest.

00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:57.735
And I'm not saying
that they're always

00:50:57.735 --> 00:50:59.570
dishonest-- you're
probably the guy that

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:04.900
does the statistics
here at Google--

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.480
but when you're looking at
three hives or five hives

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.540
and you try to make this
broad, sweeping thing

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.339
and you have all this
math and then you say, OK.

00:51:12.339 --> 00:51:13.880
Well, we only have
five hives, but we

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.243
can extrapolate what 1,000 hives
looks like, three hives isn't

00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:22.289
enough to do that, no matter
how good your math is.

00:51:22.289 --> 00:51:24.580
And the problem with all of
this, with the researchers,

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.830
there's no good
solution in sight.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.290
You're the researcher.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.432
You made a mistake.

00:51:30.432 --> 00:51:31.640
Let's say you made a mistake.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.181
Let's say you know
you made a mistake

00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:34.490
or you did something sloppy.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:35.900
Can you admit it?

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.620
No.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.200
Who's going to fund your
next study if you say,

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.130
oh, that study that I just spent
three years on that somebody

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.694
else paid for, I screwed up
and the data isn't relevant.

00:51:44.694 --> 00:51:46.860
But I have this other study
that I really want to do

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.479
and I need money for it.

00:51:48.479 --> 00:51:49.395
It makes it difficult.

00:51:49.395 --> 00:51:51.728
And of course, there's all
kinds of reputations at stake

00:51:51.728 --> 00:51:53.620
as well.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:58.160
So what is the inevitable
outcome of mainstream practice?

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.540
Honey that isn't pure because
the feeding is so ubiquitous.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.284
So when I say honey
that isn't pure,

00:52:05.284 --> 00:52:07.325
I talk about sugar that
gets into the honey, feed

00:52:07.325 --> 00:52:08.450
that gets into the honey.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.510
That's something different than
somebody purposefully mixing

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:14.727
a cheaper sugar in with the
honey, which also happens.

00:52:14.727 --> 00:52:16.310
And these beekeeper
applied treatments

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.620
can get into the honey as well.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.030
And that can be more of a
problem or less of a problem,

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.870
depending on the beekeeper
and the procedures used.

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:24.245
Really what we're
going to end up

00:52:24.245 --> 00:52:26.790
is bees that actually
require treatments.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.950
So I talked about if
we treat the bees,

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:32.918
we can't select for bees that
don't require the treatments.

00:52:32.918 --> 00:52:35.200
And any kind of
resistance mechanism

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.400
has a metabolic
cost to the colony.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.130
So if we remove those
kinds of challenges

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.420
we're selecting against
those kinds of strategies

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.760
because that metabolic cost
doesn't get them anything.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.740
But really, and this
is kind of interesting

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.780
is that there are specific
treatments that literally

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.490
become the treatment treadmill.

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:54.990
That you use this
treatment and you

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.560
have to use more treatments.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.111
Antibiotics.

00:52:58.111 --> 00:52:59.860
I'm talking about for
American [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.360
is a very specific disease.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.060
It is a bacterial infection
that produces spores.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.950
And the spores can live
for 40 years in the hive.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:10.800
So what happens is
beekeepers use antibiotics

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.704
in the hive to kill
the live organism.

00:53:13.704 --> 00:53:15.370
And once you start
that cycle and you've

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:18.130
got this healthy population
of spores in the hive,

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.450
well those spores are
constantly germinating.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.960
And if you're not constantly
using the antibiotics then

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.156
you constantly have
this infection blooming,

00:53:25.156 --> 00:53:27.130
and that's a problem.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.046
Fumidil, which is
that stuff for nosema

00:53:29.046 --> 00:53:32.690
that I was talking about, what
the new studies have shown

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.650
is that yes, using
Fumidil actually

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:40.137
does reduce the nosema
infection in an individual bee.

00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:41.720
But when you have
low doses of Fumidil

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.206
in the hive like after
it's dissipated sometime

00:53:44.206 --> 00:53:48.010
after the treatment,
you know what it does?

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.390
It actually
stimulates the nosema

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.200
that's left to
produce more spores.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.330
So it's actually a stimulant to
reproducing this thing that you

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:59.220
use the treatment for
in the first place.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:04.655
So as the concentration dips
down, you've got more spores.

00:54:04.655 --> 00:54:05.895
The infection shows up again.

00:54:05.895 --> 00:54:09.870
You use the Fumidil
again and it never ends.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.865
We end up with
resistant diseases

00:54:11.865 --> 00:54:13.268
and stronger parasites.

00:54:13.268 --> 00:54:15.142
And we end up with bees
that require feeding.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.470
One of the other kind of
activist things that comes up

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:23.010
is there's this company
called Beeologics

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:27.906
that has tried to produce
a vaccine for a virus

00:54:27.906 --> 00:54:32.541
in bees using this RNAi
technology, which there's

00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:37.880
a pretty good Wikipedia article
on RNAi if you're interested.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.889
But how the narrative has
been from the activists that

00:54:42.889 --> 00:54:44.910
want you to rally
against Monsanto

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.826
is that, oh, there was
this small company that

00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:50.510
was looking out for the health
of the bees called Beeologics.

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.620
And they were bought out
by the evil Monsanto.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:55.070
If you do a little
bit of homework

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:56.785
this company was
started by people

00:54:56.785 --> 00:55:00.140
who do start ups
and sell companies.

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.720
Familiar with the model?

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.624
It was started by
a guy who developed

00:55:03.624 --> 00:55:08.610
this technology, this RNAi
technology which is useful.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.765
I mean, it's a whole new
technology for agriculture,

00:55:12.765 --> 00:55:14.500
for medicine.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.710
Not clear what the
downside is yet.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:22.299
But basically what was happening
is that he had this technology.

00:55:22.299 --> 00:55:23.840
And actually, insects
are an easy way

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.631
to demonstrate this
technology because they

00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:28.750
can ingest the substance
and incorporate it.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.870
And at the time that they
were coming out with this 2008

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.820
colony collapse
disorder was big.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.840
And there was a virus
that was being implicated

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.190
called Israeli Acute
Paralysis Virus.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:44.980
And so they developed a vaccine
against this virus-- which

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.960
probably is somewhat
effective-- and claimed

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.220
that they could solve CCD.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:52.345
But we've since learned that
CCD is not really correlated

00:55:52.345 --> 00:55:55.470
with Israeli Acute
Paralysis Virus.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.370
But what I just wanted
to get across to you

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.102
is that these are part
of the same animal.

00:56:01.102 --> 00:56:02.810
This isn't something
nice that was

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:05.200
co-opted by the
big, bad Monsanto.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.940
And what's going
to happen, what I

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.097
think is going to happen
if they end up using this,

00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:11.930
is that every year
they'll go to the almonds

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.830
where three quarters
of the bees congregate,

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.117
where you can get
samples very easily.

00:56:16.117 --> 00:56:17.950
And they'll sample and
find all the diseases

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.740
that are in the populations
of bees that year.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.752
Much like we do with the flu,
kind of like the flu vaccine.

00:56:23.752 --> 00:56:25.710
And then they'll have a
product that beekeepers

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.350
can buy that have the up to
date stuff with the up to date

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:29.850
vaccines.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:33.230
And the problem with that is
how do you compete with that?

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.002
If you really have bees that are
resistant to every disease that

00:56:36.002 --> 00:56:38.085
comes up for bees and every
parasite that comes up

00:56:38.085 --> 00:56:40.807
for bees, we're definitely
going to lose our wild bees

00:56:40.807 --> 00:56:42.390
because how can you
compete with that?

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:45.865
It's just easy to keep
bees at that point.

00:56:45.865 --> 00:56:47.490
What happens to native
pollinators that

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:50.230
have to compete with bees that
don't have to face challenges

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:53.145
and don't have to expend
energy on resistance

00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:54.780
to these challenges?

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.930
And what happens to the
gene pool of bees over time

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:00.320
if we're not selecting bees
that actually have an ability

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.540
to adapt to challenges?

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.926
Well, we know what happens.

00:57:04.926 --> 00:57:06.720
I'm almost done here.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.440
So a little sampling
check on CCD.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.970
There are increased losses.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.930
There are many reasons for these
losses including pesticides,

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.460
including fungicides, including
disease, including mites.

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.880
Unlike what you may have heard,
there is capacity for more bees

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.479
than we have.

00:57:24.479 --> 00:57:26.270
Commercial beekeepers
can produce more bees

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:27.380
if they need them.

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:31.330
We're not at any kind of tipping
point where we're out of bees.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.730
The number of
colonies is largely

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:35.130
a product of market forces.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:37.455
At this point the
almond pollination

00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:40.476
is the thing that runs
the beekeeping industry.

00:57:40.476 --> 00:57:43.650
And at $200 a hive
for three weeks

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:48.160
rental a beekeeper is very
motivated to produce more bees

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.450
to bring to the almonds if
the market's there for them.

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:54.700
And whereas some years
we do have a little bit

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.690
of trouble getting all
the almonds pollinated,

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:57.920
nobody's starving
because we don't

00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.211
get all the almonds pollinated.

00:57:59.211 --> 00:58:02.182
This isn't the kind of crop that
people are eating to survive.

00:58:02.182 --> 00:58:04.140
And the other thing that
you have to understand

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.264
is that they're planting
almond trees faster

00:58:06.264 --> 00:58:07.930
than they have water
to water them with.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:10.090
So some years the almond
growers are actually

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.705
renting beehives
for almond trees

00:58:11.705 --> 00:58:13.330
that are never going
to produce almonds

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:14.579
because they don't have water.

00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:15.745
Well, why do they do that?

00:58:15.745 --> 00:58:17.120
Because they have
crop insurance.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.120
In order to collect
on the crop insurance,

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.800
they have to do
everything that they're

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.400
supposed to do in order to try
to secure the crop including

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.888
renting the bees,
even if they know

00:58:24.888 --> 00:58:27.138
that they don't have any
water to produce the almonds.

00:58:30.387 --> 00:58:32.720
There are certainly some
businesses that are in trouble.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.790
This is what happens in
industries, the computer

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:37.940
industry, the
information industry.

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.736
We see companies fall by
the wayside all the time.

00:58:40.736 --> 00:58:44.296
There's nothing
unhealthy about that.

00:58:44.296 --> 00:58:47.200
But agriculture, we're
dealing with nature.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.803
And agriculture is always trying
to produce more with less.

00:58:50.803 --> 00:58:54.710
Not much different than a
lot of kinds of businesses.

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:56.710
But you can't cure the horse.

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.750
You know the story about the
very frugal gentleman that

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.360
bought a horse, and they guy
he bought it from said, well,

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.660
give him one pail of
oats every day for feed.

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.805
Well, this frugal
gentleman didn't really

00:59:07.805 --> 00:59:12.190
like the idea of feeding
all these oats to the horse.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.720
So the first day he gave
him the full bucket of oats.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.360
And the second day, he gave
him a half a bucket of oats.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.568
Third day, he gave him a
quarter of a bucket of oats.

00:59:19.568 --> 00:59:23.620
And every day he cut it in half,
and the horse was doing fine.

00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.290
And then one day he saw the
guy who sold him the horse.

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:27.540
And he told him his plan.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:30.040
And they guy said, well, you
let me know how that works out.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.152
So he ran into the guy
who sold him the horse.

00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:34.110
And they guy said, hey,
how's that horse doing?

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:35.290
He said, ah.

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:37.975
He said, you know, he died.

00:59:37.975 --> 00:59:40.346
He said, I don't
know what happened.

00:59:40.346 --> 00:59:43.237
I had him down to one
grain of oats a day,

00:59:43.237 --> 00:59:46.159
and I was going to give him
a half a grain the next day.

00:59:46.159 --> 00:59:49.570
I almost had him cured.

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:50.760
You can't cure the horse.

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:53.051
And at some point when you're
dealing with agriculture,

00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:55.610
you're dealing with nature or
you're dealing with people.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.122
You can't get more with less.

00:59:57.122 --> 00:59:58.580
And at some point
you hit the wall.

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.630
And that really
has been what has

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.426
happened with the
beekeeping industry.

01:00:03.426 --> 01:00:04.800
Tangled up with
some other things

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.420
with pesticides and
other agriculture

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.760
issues that are going on.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.530
So what can you all
do to help the bees?

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:13.572
You can support sustainable
models of beekeeping.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:15.488
And I would submit that
there's no sustainable

01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:16.990
model of beekeeping
that includes

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.320
artificial feeds
and medications.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.350
No matter how you want
to do your accounting,

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.690
there's nothing
sustainable about producing

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:28.470
cane sugar in South America,
refining it, shipping it up

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.550
to New England to feed your
bees so that you can extract

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.095
some honey out of the
hive that they produced.

01:00:34.095 --> 01:00:36.220
Even if you can make that
work on paper money wise,

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.270
there's nothing
sustainable about that.

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:40.500
That's Kirk Webster.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.290
If anybody has read the
new Bill McKibben book,

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:47.004
"Oil and Honey,"
half the book is

01:00:47.004 --> 01:00:49.499
about Bill McKibben and the
other half is about Kirk.

01:00:49.499 --> 01:00:53.145
He's one of the beekeepers
who's honey we sell.

01:00:53.145 --> 01:00:54.967
Be a critical
thinker and don't buy

01:00:54.967 --> 01:00:56.300
into all the mass marketed hype.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.980
And I mean that especially with
the email stuff that you read.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.630
I wish it were so simple
that you could just

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:06.270
click on a petition
and make things better.

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.850
But it isn't.

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:09.620
And things don't get better
unless you put yourself out.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.125
Clicking on a petition,
even if it's a good petition

01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:13.700
doesn't really do any good.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.200
Because the person
that's reading it

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.075
knows that all you had
to do was click on it.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.620
Recognize that beekeeping
and agricultural practices

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.500
vary widely.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.940
And different
practices and ideals

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.280
have different roles
our overall system.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.780
And I say that
because I don't want

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.050
to vilify the
migratory beekeepers.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.570
They're doing an important job.

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:34.410
They are feeding the
masses of the country.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:36.887
We have this monocrop system.

01:01:36.887 --> 01:01:39.220
When we talk about monocrops
we're talking about an area

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.761
where there's only
one thing growing.

01:01:40.761 --> 01:01:42.500
When there's only
one thing growing

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.400
it only blooms for two
weeks during the year

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.760
where it needs
insect pollinators.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.210
For the other 50
weeks of the year

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.977
there's nothing for
pollinators to eat.

01:01:51.977 --> 01:01:53.310
There's nothing to sustain them.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.146
And that's why we have to
be moving these bees around

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.535
because they have
two weeks here,

01:01:56.535 --> 01:01:57.930
two weeks here, two weeks here.

01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:01.480
That's how we grow food
in this country for better

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.090
or for worse.

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.000
For better if you like feeding
a whole lot of people cheaply.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.827
And for worse if
you like to think

01:02:06.827 --> 01:02:09.320
about our environment
and the long term

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.380
and where we're
headed and what that

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.310
might look like in the future.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:17.884
Understand the true cost and
true meaning of sustainability.

01:02:17.884 --> 01:02:23.690
Again, the honey that we
sell is actually a surplus.

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:26.663
Whether they're from our bees
or from one of our suppliers,

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:29.037
this is not honey from bees
that are being fed back sugar

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.985
to make up for
what was harvested.

01:02:30.985 --> 01:02:36.030
The art of beekeeping is having
the bees harvest all that stuff

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.530
from the land and
providing for themselves

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.380
and providing for
you at the same time.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.280
That's when you're doing it.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.610
And there's a cost to that.

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:47.667
It means that you can't
produce as much honey

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:49.455
as if you fed 100
pounds of sugar

01:02:49.455 --> 01:02:53.880
and harvested another 100
pounds of honey from that hive.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.640
Support important research that
isn't supported by industry.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.010
Remember that industry,
that 99% of the bees

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:01.115
is 1% of the beekeepers.

01:03:01.115 --> 01:03:03.850
And their interest is largely
in that migratory pollination

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:09.020
world, not in the wild bees
that I was talking about.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.340
So that's really what I have
to share with you today.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.340
We have a lot of projects
that we're working on.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.184
We have some research
projects that we're

01:03:17.184 --> 01:03:20.870
hoping to collaborate with some
major labs in this coming year.

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:23.869
And we have bees
all around Boston.

01:03:23.869 --> 01:03:25.410
We have bees at the
Intercontinental,

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:28.250
at the Lenox Hotel and at
the Fenway Victory Garden.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.170
As you all know by now we wrote
"The Complete Idiots Guide

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:33.260
to Beekeeping."

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.670
And we have some honey
for you to taste.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.410
And what we've got
today for honey--

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.730
we do different kinds of
tastings different times--

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:41.590
we have three different
kinds of honey.

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:44.690
All from different places,
all from different flowers,

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.350
all from different beekeepers,
all from different seasons.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.980
But they all look
almost exactly the same.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.688
And they taste totally
different and they

01:03:53.688 --> 01:03:55.025
have totally different textures.

01:03:55.025 --> 01:03:56.775
Because it really is
all about the flowers

01:03:56.775 --> 01:03:58.930
and not about the bees.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.130
So thank you very much.

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.580
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.939
Yes, I have a comment
and a question.

01:04:05.939 --> 01:04:07.480
I don't know how
coincidental it was,

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.854
but yesterday
there was a program

01:04:08.854 --> 01:04:11.890
on NPR about [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.770
And also with the
kinds of [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.710
The reason we all must
harvest the [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:25.142
is due to the fact that--
well, [INAUDIBLE] Fumidil

01:04:25.142 --> 01:04:28.118
could be due to the
beekeepers trying

01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:33.279
to keep their number of colonies
up to sustainable levels.

01:04:33.279 --> 01:04:34.070
DEAN STIGLITZ: Yep.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.054
AUDIENCE: So I listen
to your [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:40.980
DEAN STIGLITZ: Well, no.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.420
I mean, sustainable for what?

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.142
Sustainable for the pollination
that has to happen, absolutely.

01:04:46.142 --> 01:04:47.621
That's the gig.

01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:49.593
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:04:49.593 --> 01:04:52.551
So that was very interesting
and coincidental.

01:04:52.551 --> 01:04:56.495
The second question was back
in 2000 I stumbled upon a book,

01:04:56.495 --> 01:04:58.960
and it was before
the CCD [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.390
written in 1923 that basically
predicted colony collapse

01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.890
disorder.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:08.327
And it was talking about exact
words what was going to happen.

01:05:08.327 --> 01:05:11.285
And I actually
never read the book.

01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:11.830
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.600
DEAN STIGLITZ: Was
it the Steiner book?

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.099
Yes.

01:05:14.099 --> 01:05:18.160
OK, so he's talking about a
Rudolf Steiner book in 1923

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.040
that actually described
colony collapse disorder.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.290
Well, I can one up you on that.

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.850
We should have brought
that big poster.

01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:31.832
But if you email me
later I'll send you

01:05:31.832 --> 01:05:33.290
this document
because it's amazing.

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:36.450
It is a document from the
Secretary of Agriculture,

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:38.630
I think in 1879.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:39.400
Was that it?

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.566
LAURIE HERBOLDSHEIMER: 1870.

01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:42.876
DEAN STIGLITZ: 1860
something, 1870 something.

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:48.644
And it describes colony
collapse disorder to a T.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:51.060
These kinds of boom and bust
cycles are common in insects.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.480
We even see it in the
Bible with locusts.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.450
That's how insects kind of live.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:02.245
So I can one up Steiner
and show you actually

01:06:02.245 --> 01:06:05.850
the Secretary of Agriculture
describing-- not predicting it,

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:06.780
but it happening.

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.020
And so I don't find
it that surprising

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.470
because it is kind of what
happens when things break down.

01:06:15.499 --> 01:06:16.790
Steiner was an interesting guy.

01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:24.180
So some of the information's
a little bit wishy washy.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:28.440
But he certainly
wasn't the only one

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:34.690
to consider that industry and
nature are oftentimes at odds,

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.709
and that one's going to beat
down the other eventually.

01:06:37.709 --> 01:06:38.250
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.162
So to repeat your
answer to the question.

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.074
The question was whether
you were aware of it

01:06:42.074 --> 01:06:43.365
and whether you agreed with it.

01:06:43.365 --> 01:06:44.470
DEAN STIGLITZ: Yeah.

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.030
I don't disagree with it.

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:49.185
I agree that where
humans and human nature,

01:06:49.185 --> 01:06:51.670
we're not at a place
in our human nature

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:54.880
where we can give
nature it's due.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.620
And that's always
going to cause problems

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.770
and disaster and conflict.

01:07:05.070 --> 01:07:08.330
I don't know that it takes real
precedence to predict disaster.

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.980
Disaster's always
around the corner.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.110
Any other questions or comments?

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.817
OK, well if you'd like to come
up we'll do some honey tasting.

01:07:16.817 --> 01:07:18.275
And if you'd like
to have your book

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:20.950
signed we can do that as well.

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.284
And I appreciate you all coming.

01:07:22.284 --> 01:07:24.116
And thank you, Jonathan,
for bringing us in.

01:07:24.116 --> 01:07:24.980
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.235
