ANATOLY SPITKOVSKY:
Well, I think

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:06.050
the Jacobus prize
is very special

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.565
because it recognizes a
particularly high achievement.

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:11.630
And there are so few
of them given out.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.720
And it's a big honor.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.720
ALEXANDER "SASHA" PHILIPPOV:
My name is Sasha Philippov.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.530
I am a fifth-year
graduate student

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.730
in the Department of
Astrophysical Sciences working

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.140
on understanding how neutron
stars work, in particular how

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.050
pulsars produce their
electromagnetic radiation.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.330
ANATOLY SPITKOVSKY: Sasha's
work has stood out to me

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.730
because he has
been able to solve

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.850
a very important and difficult
problem in astrophysics.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.080
It's a problem about
understanding how pulsars work.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.070
So pulsars are rotating
neutron stars --

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.150
very strongly magnetized,
very compact stars,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.324
10 kilometers in radius
spinning very, very fast.

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.740
SASHA PHILIPPOV:
The frequency

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.710
at which you hear the bits
is the frequency of pulsar's

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.210
rotation.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.750
So it rotates.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.545
And once per period
it emits this burst.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:08.700
And you see the
voice. Boom, boom.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.445
And the clock is very steady.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.800
So, over many years,
the thing rotates.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.170
And the frequency at
which it emits radiation

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.460
is mostly constant.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.043
ANATOLY SPITKOVSKY:
They've been known

00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:21.210
to astronomers since 1967.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.770
And they're emitting a lot
of interesting radiation.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.040
They're emitting radio waves.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.500
They're emitting gamma rays.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.220
And, for a long time,
people couldn't understand

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.640
how they actually do this.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.650
So what is going on
inside of these stars

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.040
and outside of these stars
in their magnetospheres?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.650
So Sasha was able to
find a numerical solution

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.470
to this problem by putting
equations of plasma physics

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
on a computer and solving
this problem using

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.650
large, three-dimensional
simulations.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.300
So he's been able to
achieve this breakthrough

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.842
in our understanding of how
these magnetospheres work.

00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:06.300
SASHA PHILIPPOV:
I think, like,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
science is driven mostly
by people's curiosity.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.310
So it's just exotic.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.520
It's hard to understand.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.012
And that's what drives
people curious about them,

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:17.250
at least for me.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.700
