00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.555
So, how do the other cues work, the ones that require two eyes?

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.408
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You mean, the ones that require one eye?

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:06.420
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.496
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, those are called monocular cues.

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:09.586
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, monocular.

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:13.904
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Distinguished from binocular. and actually, I'm not really certain. Why don't

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.170
we go to Susan? Susan, how are things going over there?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.255
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great. I'm with Paul, our winner.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.783
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Could you go into more detail about how we can perceive depth even when we're

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.962
not using both eyes.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:29.622
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Monocular cues, sure. Well, there's a thing called interposition, which is a

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:33.002
fancy word for saying when one thing appears in front of the other, it's closer

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:38.060
to you. So, for example, viewers at home know that this hand is closer because

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.350
it appears in front of this one.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.745
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's interesting. So, are there any other monocular clues?

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:47.682
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, linear perspective. But this one's a little more difficult to explain, so

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:51.345
I'm going to send it back to the studio for you guys to do an illustration.

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:53.519
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. Thanks again, Susan.
