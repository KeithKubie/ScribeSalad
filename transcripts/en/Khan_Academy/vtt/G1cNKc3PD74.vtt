00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:05.170
So, we have the number 35. The 3 is in the tens place

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.247
so it represents 30 or 3 tens—

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.881
one 10, two groups of 10, three groups of 10

00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.108
and then the 5 is in the ones place

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:17.638
so it represents five ones. We see them right over here

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.740
—one, two, three, four, five.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.421
Now, we want to take that 35 or those 3 tens

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.382
and 5 ones and add 6. 6 ones.

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:26.845
The 6 is in the ones place—

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:30.837
one, two three, four, five, six ones.

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.381
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.458
and try to do that. Add 35 to 6.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.479
So let's think about it now.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.162
So I'm gonna start with the ones.

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.958
So I have 5 ones and I want to add 6 ones.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.544
So what's that going to be altogether?

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.583
Well, 5 ones plus 6 ones, that's going to be 11 ones

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:55.159
and I still have 3 tens so we could say it's going to be

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.580
3 tens, 3 tens and 11 ones.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.157
3 tens, I could write, plus 11 ones here.

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:05.396
Now this is a little bit of a problem because

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.860
we can't write a two-digit number

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.821
in the ones place or in any one of the places.

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.583
I can't, this number isn't going to be 311.

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.881
It's going to be 3 tens and 11 ones

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:19.620
but how can I rewrite this or how can I regroup things

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.174
so that I only have a single-digit number here?

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:24.820
I have zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.800
or nine here instead of a two-digit number— the 1 one.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.637
Well, I can regroup. I can say,

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:34.560
"Look, I have enough ones here to create a group of ten."

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.780
I could take 10 of them, so let's take these 10,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.398
right over here, and put them together

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.834
and make a new group of ten.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:48.730
So, a new group of ten right over there.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.440
So if I take, so just to be clear, what I just did

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.655
I just took these 10, these 10 ones

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.837
and I stuck them together and I turned it

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:00.913
into this new group of, this new group of ten.

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:02.561
So now what do we have?

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.975
So when you regroup like this you see that you have

00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:09.678
one, two, three, four tens. 4 tens.

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:12.579
And how many ones do you have now?

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.156
4 tens plus? Well, I've regrouped all of these 10 ones

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:20.335
and all I have left is this 1 one right over there.

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:24.270
So I could write this as 4 tens plus 1 one.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.894
Once again, 3 tens and 11 ones,

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.831
that's the same thing as 4 tens and 1 one.

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.734
And so we can write that over here,

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:40.266
we can write this as, 1 one and 4 tens.

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:43.550
Now how could you get this if you weren't,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.655
if you didn't do it like this and drawing everything out

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:47.755
and regrouping like this and this is actually

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:49.591
what you should be doing in your head

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.318
but another way of thinking about it, you could say,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:55.882
"Alright 5 plus 6," that's going to be 11 ones

00:02:55.882 --> 00:02:59.640
but I can't write an 11 here in the ones place

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.594
so I could say, "That's going to be the same thing

00:03:01.594 --> 00:03:07.736
as 1 ten plus 1 one." 1 ten plus 1 one.

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:11.460
Sometimes it's taught that 5 plus 6 is 11,

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:14.620
carry the 1 but really what you're doing is you're saying,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.200
"5 plus 6 is 1 ten plus 1 one."

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.420
And, in fact, an 11, the number 11 right over here.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.274
So if I were to write the number 11, the number 11

00:03:26.274 --> 00:03:27.818
has a 1 in the tens place and a 1

00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:31.930
in the ones place so it's 1 ten plus 1 one.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.310
So you're just saying that 5 plus 6 is 11

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.270
which is the same thing as 1 ten and 1 one

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.709
and then you add your tens together—

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.375
1 ten plus another 3 tens is going to be 4 tens.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:45.673
But I really want you to appreciate what's going on.

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:49.354
You're not just blindly saying, "Oh, 5 plus 6 is 11

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.815
so I'm going to write 1 of the ones here

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.533
and write the 1 in the tens place here."

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.518
You're doing it because you're regrouping.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.793
You're regrouping that group of ten.

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:01.334
You're saying, "Hey I could take 10 of these ones

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:04.270
and I can turn them into a new group of ten

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.674
and that would just leave me 1 in the ones place.

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:09.320
1 in the ones place and I've just turned

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.242
all the other ones into a new group of ten.
