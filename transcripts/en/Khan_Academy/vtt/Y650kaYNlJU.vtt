00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Instructor] A veterinarian
is studying a certain disease

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.020
that seems to be affecting male
cats more than female cats.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.290
They obtain a random sample
of records from 500 cats.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.290
They find 24 of the 259
male cats have the disease

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.685
while 14 of 241 female
cats have the disease.

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.180
The veterinarian uses these results

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.779
to test their null hypothesis

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.950
that the true proportion is
the same amongst the male

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.120
and female cats

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.671
versus the alternative hypothesis

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.010
that the proportion of
males who get the disease

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.820
is actually higher than
the proportion of females.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.320
The test statistic was z is equal to 1.46

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.090
and the P-value was approximately 0.07.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.923
That's useful.

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.240
They've done a lot of work for us.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.435
Assume that all conditions
for inference were met.

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:56.435
At the alpha equals 0.10
level of significance,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.561
is there sufficient evidence to conclude

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:03.030
that a larger proportion of
male cats have the disease?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.593
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.940
All right, so remember what we
do with a significance test.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.940
We assume our null hypothesis,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.710
and then given,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350
and then with that assumption,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.040
we look at our data

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.140
and we calculate a P-value.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.973
We say, hey,

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:25.880
what is the probability of
getting the data that we did

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.290
assuming our null hypothesis is true?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.250
And if that is lower than
our significance level,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.630
then we reject the null hypothesis.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.463
We say, hey,

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:36.350
assuming the null hypothesis,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.580
we got a pretty unlikely event.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.550
We reject it.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.200
Which would suggest the alternative.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.210
And so here our P-value is 0.07,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.430
which is indeed less than our alpha,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.640
which is less than our significance level.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.040
This thing right over here is 0.10.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.590
And so because of that,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.930
we would reject the null hypothesis.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.880
Reject null hypothesis.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.470
Which would, which is,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.070
we could say there is
sufficient evidence to conclude

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.120
that a larger proportion of
male cats have the disease.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.120
We could say suggests the
alternative hypothesis.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.260
And so on Econ Academy

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.200
there's some multiple
choice questions like this,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.370
and so the choice that you would pick

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.720
might be something like,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.960
because our P-value is less
than our significance level,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.910
we would reject the null hypothesis,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.873
and that would suggest the alternative.
