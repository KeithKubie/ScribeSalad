Speaker 1:          00:01          And I appreciate you have me on her to do it and I, and I know I don't have a talking point, I don't have a PR firm. You know, we even taught before went on air about what am I gonna you know, I mean Alex, what do you want to say today so you can help me get it out. I don't know. I'm alive. I want to say a bunch of things. I'm only learning how this works, being in the process of it and it's given me a much bigger view than a new 23 years ago when I first got on here because I've experienced what other people have said, bad things. I did experience. I did it from a good heart. I believe questioning was okay, I was covering other people questioning, but then there's a weird sick irony in the media that says that I'm the one that pregenerated sandy hook didn't happen when I wasn't too then in my name popularize it to a level of like they've put out more [inaudible] gets me.

Speaker 1:          00:48          This is key. Then before you invade a major country. I mean this has been going on for years. Every day the news, the print, no one died at sandy hook. Alex Jones says, Alex Jones says, go to their houses and hurt them. What the hell is it for? It goes on and on and on and on. Well, you're thinking this because it's about you, so because it's about you, it becomes a primary point of focus because it's affecting your life and it's something that you're concentrating on, but the volume is massive. It is. Volume is massive because it's something that generates interest. This is part of the problem with the way we do news today. Anything that generates interest, I mean if the it, honestly, if the media really cared, they probably would have never talked about it. They'd probably would have never brought it up. We had real terror attacks in the sixties and seventies that weren't staged a, if you go back and look at him like the weatherman and all that stuff, then that and the government and the media didn't cover it.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Well, this is a long time ago, but they didn't cover because it gives, if you cover terrorists, they do it more. Right. That's true. I was agreeing with you. Yeah. Okay. That's true. That's like in other countries, they don't print the name of mass shooters in the newspaper because they don't want people to get attention for that. I mean, some different cultures. I genuinely, I've known you 20 years or so. It's like 1998 99 I genuinely really, I'm trying to find the truth and I realized that once I saw a bunch of declassified stage defense, like Northwoods or like Gladio or locked off the Tonkin Gulf of Tonkin.
