MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hello!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.230
Are you enjoying Google I/O?

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.490
Whoa, that's great!

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.080
Let's hear it again,
because I'm going

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930
to involve you in this session.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.770
Are you enjoying Google I/O?

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.110
Fantastic.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.030
I'm enjoying Google I/O a lot.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.367
This morning, when I woke
up it felt like Christmas.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:28.200
But then I thought, I'm
going to work today,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.408
so it's not really Christmas.

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.140
But I don't work Christmas.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.130
And then I thought I wonder what
Santa Claus' staff is feeling

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.280
on Christmas when
they are working?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.730
That was a really weird
thought, so I stopped that.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.100
We're going to talk today
about Google Play services.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.690
And probably many of you in here
know what Google Play services

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.570
is, but I will do a
mandatory recap for you.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930
Because there may be
some people in here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.510
that don't know what
Google Play services is.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.550
Google Play services is a set of
APIs that we develop in Google

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.639
and deploy on Android
devices running Gingerbread

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.300
or later that has
Google Play installed.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.030
And that's a lot of
devices out there.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.125
There's just a small
percentage or two or so

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.970
of devices that runs
Google Play that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.840
is not included in this set.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
So it's a vast majority of
the Google Play devices.

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.320
It's unfortunate that you can
terminate the presentation

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.740
with the clicker, right?

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.500
And the good thing with
Google Play services

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.630
is it that we release it
many times every year.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.630
So there are multiple
releases being

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.650
pushed to all of these
devices per year.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.610
Now, if you're still
thinking, so what's

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.920
the big deal about that, then I
will tell you it's a huge deal.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.830
It has monumental value, right?

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.450
Because this allows
Google to get the,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.440
latest and coolest,
and most shiny

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.630
stuff that we develop
in mobile technology,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.640
to get that out to
developers quickly.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.290
Are you developers?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.550
Yeah!

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.180
That's great.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.080
And that stuff that you
develop on Google Play services

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.010
API can be used on almost
all the Google Play devices

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.590
out there.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.810
That's great, isn't it?

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.860
If we look historically, we've
been releasing 12 Google Play

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.570
services versions since
we started with this back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.470
in September 2012.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.690
And I'm happy to announce
that right as we speak here,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.360
we have 5.0 being
pushed out to the world,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.850
and you will actually get a
sneak preview of this version

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.390
as well.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.495
So more information on
that is coming later.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:41.870
But it's going to
be great stuff.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.020
Some of that stuff I
will present here today,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.230
so stay tuned.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920
I love Google Play
services because of this.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.510
Because it has all of
these capabilities that you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.580
can build into
applications, right?

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910
You have location with GPS.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.470
You've got the maps,
the Wallet API.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.780
You've got play game
services, mobile

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.600
adds, social with
Google Plus, ChromeCast

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.860
the Google Cast SDK,
Drive, and Cloud.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.890
It's absolutely amazing.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.280
You can build so many
cool applications

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.030
with all of these APIs.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.635
COMPUTER: Tell them that
Google Play services rocks.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:18.510
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes,
that's exactly what I'm

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.820
going to tell you now.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.370
Google Play services rocks.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.000
It really, really rocks, right?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.350
And we're going to do
a little exercise here.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.780
I brought the t-shirt
launcher with me.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.800
It looks like this, right?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.540
And this is probably
what's going to happen.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.310
At various locations
of this presentation,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.310
I will go crazy, and
put my arms in the air.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.510
And I will say Google
Play services--

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.260
and then I expect from you--

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.610
AUDIENCE: Rocks.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.010
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah, exactly!

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.640
Exactly.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.260
Let's try that out once.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.580
So, OK, Google Play services--

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.910
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.300
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa!

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.250
Great stuff.

00:04:11.295 --> 00:04:13.220
A little reloading there.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.620
I can just see this later.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.519
Weird guy at Google I/O
launches t-shirts at audience.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.420
Asks for rocks in return.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.920
All right, let's get
started, shall we?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's introduce a new API

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.720
to Google Play services, namely
the Android Wear Data API.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.220
With a round of applause.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.470
Here we go.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.760
You've seen Android
Wearables being

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.240
launched at the keynote today.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.870
And this is big stuff, right?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.240
It's the first time
I'm wearing something

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.280
around my wrist for
the past 15 years.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.634
I've been taking my phone
up and down this pocket.

00:04:57.634 --> 00:04:59.050
I think in the
keynote today there

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.140
was a note that 100
billion times this

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.580
happens every day in the world.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.870
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.870
I have tear marks
on my left pocket

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.360
here, because I'm reaching
for the phone so often.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.170
Well those tear
marks I will not need

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.070
to have anymore, because I got
all of that information right

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.410
here on my wrist.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.220
It's absolutely amazing.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.290
And Google Play
services obviously

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.130
has an API to integrate
with these variable devices.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.270
Because you need to transfer
things between these devices

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.020
and communicate across them.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.420
And there are three APIs
that we are launching

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.970
as part of Google Play services
in the Android Wear data API.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.800
The first part is
the message API.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.600
The message API allows you to
send uni-directional messages

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.970
between the wearable and
the phone, or tablet.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.490
Or the phone tablet
to the wearable.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.080
These can be control signals.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.290
For example, you can
tell the wearable

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.030
to change the media track that
is playing on your Android

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.930
phone.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.000
Or you can have your Android
phone instruct the wearable

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.060
to launch an intent that
gets visible to the user.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.560
So that's a great API
to share information

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.560
between the device you
have in the pocket,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.770
and the wearable device.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.360
The second API is the asset API.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.640
The asset API is
used to transfer

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.370
binary blobs--
images, for example,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.640
or other kinds of binary
data-- between the wearable

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.130
and the other device.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.100
So this can, for
example, be an image.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.010
One use case would be
your phone downloads

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.680
an image to the phone, right?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.520
It resizes it to
match the resolution

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.790
of the wearable device.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.860
And it then sends it over to
the wearable device as an asset.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.210
That's a perfect example of data
being transferred as an asset.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.360
Then we have DataItem.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.570
DataItem is a message
exchange in this API

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.010
that allows you
to have data which

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.910
is in sync on both
the wearable device

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.140
as well as the other
device, such as the phone.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.890
That means if it
changes on one side,

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.270
it would be automatically
synced on the other side.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.130
So that's also a great API.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.570
So this is really
fabulous, right?

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.530
What applications will we see
here in a couple of weeks?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.740
I'm really, really
excited about this.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.010
And as I said, the 5.0 release
of Google Play services,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.330
we're giving you a
sneak preview of that.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.820
So you'll have a
running or flying

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.630
start when you start
to check this out.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.260
It's really, really great stuff.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.860
So I think that
this demonstrates

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.010
that Google Play services--

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.640
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.550
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes!

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.050
Ooh.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.590
It rocks, right?

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.121
It rocks.

00:07:45.121 --> 00:07:45.620
Oh.

00:07:48.617 --> 00:07:51.551
Wow.

00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:54.760
OK, let's move on.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.170
For wearables, we have a number
of different I/O sessions

00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.890
here, right?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.030
So this is a list of them.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.020
You should definitely
go and check them out.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.750
There are so many
resources that you

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.110
can consult during
these two days regarding

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.370
wearable technology.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.510
Let's talk about the
buying experience, right?

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.290
I love to buy things.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.210
Buying on mobile is not
very simple, or hasn't been,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.970
at least.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.135
Got three components that
makes it quite complex.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.080
The identity component,
the payment component,

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.630
and the data entry.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.060
Now, we worked on the
identity and payment

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.590
for a long time with
Google Plus, right?

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.039
And Wallet has been
around for a while, too.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.320
So you have Google
Wallet to pay for things.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.330
But the problem has been
also the data entry.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.230
I mean, when you're
a mobile device,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.772
it kind of looks
like this, right?

00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:47.240
Big fingers on small keys.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.150
How am I supposed to enter
my address using these keys?

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.660
That's impossible, right?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.220
I can barely remember
my address, right?

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.870
Let alone enter it on
these types of keys.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.090
I've seen people do it.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.923
I mean, you've seen
teenagers they're like--

00:09:01.923 --> 00:09:04.050
[FRANTIC GESTURE].

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.300
Two hands.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.370
Multiple things being
used simultaneously.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.670
Both hands, right?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.700
Completely impossible.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.890
I can't do it.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.670
Lately, I have started to using
this kind of swiping moment,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.410
you know?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.201
Where you can swipe
the characters and they

00:09:18.201 --> 00:09:18.880
form a word.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.650
It's really cool.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.740
I feel cool when I do it, also.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:30.570
I will be home at 6:00 PM.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.760
It's really, really cool.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.700
I love it.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.440
Well, the problem
is that it's not

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.630
easy to enter an address with
this kind of method either.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.150
So we're happy that
we've released an address

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.850
API recently in
Google Play services.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.530
Ladies and gentlemen,
you can now

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.140
sit in the comfort of
your best keyboard,

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.140
enter as many addresses
as you want, right?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.340
And they get recorded
with the address API.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.900
And applications can
they say, where do you

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.130
want to ship this thing?

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.540
It can then ask the address API.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.770
The address API will ask
you to give permission

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.650
to the application
to have the address.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.840
And voila!

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.570
The application will
get the address.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.770
Not a single press
on any key, right?

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.970
It's just a user interface
to select which entry of that

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.690
list that you want to have.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.620
Isn't that great?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.920
I think this is fantastic.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.860
This is a perfect
feature for me.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.710
Another feature that
we're adding in 5.0

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.420
is the OCR scanning
of credit cards.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:34.690
So as you can see here, you can
now press on the camera button

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.560
when you want your
credit card to scan,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.660
you can just align your
card with this frame here.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.180
And the card number will
be automatically provided

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.700
to this registration
of the new card.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.290
That's also cool, right?

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.840
Because how many remember
their credit card numbers?

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.210
You're sitting there like, ugh.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.950
Doesn't work.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.280
So that's a great
addition, as well.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.840
Wallet fragments.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.860
It is now super easy to add
the Buy with Google button

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.010
to your application.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.240
We reduced this to be a very,
very small, a minimum amount

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.430
of code that you need to use in
order to add this kind of stuff

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.550
to your application.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.240
So we hope to see lots more
developers to embrace this

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.000
as well.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.140
And we did a little
demo here that I

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.320
prerecorded for safety reasons.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.640
And what we're going to see
here is me going into a site.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.870
I have never been
to this site before.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.340
Me going into this site
for the first time,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.400
registering, logging
on to the site,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.560
buying a bike, getting it
shipped, to my home address,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.440
and all of that will happen
in less than 10 seconds.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.330
So here we go.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.560
So I log in with the
sign-in by Google button.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.600
I select my account
that I want to use.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.530
I come in, I select
the adjustable bike

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.071
that I want to buy
because it's cool.

00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.189
I'm buying it with Google,
I confirmed the order

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:52.230
and the shipping address.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.870
Voila!

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.170
10 seconds, and we've
just bought the bike.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.120
Isn't that amazing?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.620
Yeah.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.020
I think that's great.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.120
All right.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.170
We're at that point, my gosh.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.420
Because we need to do this.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.600
I think that demonstrates
that Google Play services--

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.630
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.600
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.100
Whoa!

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.700
Do you want to have another one?

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.630
Yeah, I've got plenty of these.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.800
Over there.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.300
Whoa.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.230
Great.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.640
Let's move over to the
selling experience, right?

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.911
Because you can't have a buyer
unless you have a seller,

00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:40.410
right?

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.580
So they're kind of
mutual dependent.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.860
Even though it doesn't sound
as good to be selling things

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.770
for some reason, I don't know.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.970
This is a picture of my wallet.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.180
This is a very
important topic for me.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.320
I want to try to keep my wallet
as small as I possibly can.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.260
I'm down to below an
inch, something like that.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:04.460
If I was to accept every single
loyalty program, or coupon,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.980
or whatever I am offered
in my stores that I visit,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.200
this wallet would probably
be 10 inches thick, right?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.390
It would be like that.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.830
If I was to sit down
with that kind of wallet,

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.810
I would kind of be tilting
to the side, right?

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.680
Because I would have this
wallet built up on one side.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.600
I would have to do
a customized pocket

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.960
to be able to get that
wallet into my pants.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.690
Well that, ladies and gentlemen,
is not needed anymore.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.980
Because now we're
introducing to Wallet

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.755
the Save to Google button.

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.870
So let's welcome the
Save to Google button

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.250
with a round of applause.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.280
That's right, let's
get back to work.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.910
The Save Card to
Google allows you

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.680
to store loyalty cards--
but not only loyalty cards,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.210
also coupons and
discounts and bonuses

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.260
and all other kinds
of stuff-- allows

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.580
you to store that
stuff in Google Wallet.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.150
And then through applications
that you can create,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.110
you can add this button
to your application,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.180
so merchants that
you're interacting with

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.370
can store their stuff
to Google Wallet.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.300
That's great, right?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.880
It requires no more physical
space, all of these things.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.460
And if we tie that together
with context and location.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.000
For example, if I'm
walking into a store,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.840
then that store can offer me
things based on what my loyalty

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.430
program is, my status is.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.290
And also, it can utilize the
coupons that I've collected.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.110
Because how many
are carrying around

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.670
all the different
coupons that you

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.230
are being offered in stores.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.000
It doesn't happen.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.490
This needs to happen if we're
going to have a pleasant buying

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.970
experience in the future.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.280
Not to mention the
selling experience, right?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.930
And this was actually one
of our partners, Belly,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.270
that did an early
integration of this.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.060
So we're very happy for that.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.840
This functionality will keep
the merchants happy, of course.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.006
They can offer the things.

00:15:08.006 --> 00:15:10.130
They don't have to stand
there with a customer that

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.200
refuses to take a
card because they

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.710
don't have space in the wallet.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.440
It will keep the
customers happy,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.220
because they will get better
offers and better rewards.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.020
And it will keep you
developers happy,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.890
because you're connecting
the dots between the selling

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.120
endpoint and the buying endpoint
in this particular case.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.530
It's a win-win-win.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.860
It's the best value proposition
that you can create.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.580
Perfect alignment between
all the parties, right?

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.600
It's amazing.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.520
Another piece that we've had
added to Google Play service

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.200
system to make the
selling experience better

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.730
is Google Analytics.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.610
Now, this was added
in March, 2014,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.060
but it existed as a standalone
library before that.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.030
Google Analytics
allows you to measure--

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.520
this is going to sound
terrible, but this is actually

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.080
true I think--
allows you to measure

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.920
what is most important to you.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.070
And what does that mean?

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.450
It means that you can put
things in your application that

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.080
will get reported as
statistical information.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.920
And later on, you can see how
your application behaves--

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.380
how your users are
interacting with it;

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.910
how they are discovering it,
downloading it, installing it;

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.620
when, under which conditions
they're upgrading to a paid

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.500
version, as opposed
to a free one;

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.220
when they're doing in-app
purchase, et cetera.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.120
There's tons of material
here in Google Analytics

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.780
that you can use in order to
improve your app experience.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.660
And that's pretty
good, because it

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.780
will make your
users happy, right?

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.460
You will provide an application
that makes sense to them.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.230
And it can be good
for you, because you

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.140
can drive more revenue
through your app, as well.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.630
So that's great stuff.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.700
Google Analytics.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.490
As part of 5.0, we've
added enhanced ecommerce

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.950
to Google Analytics.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.620
And this provides even more
detailed level of reporting.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.530
So now you can dice
and slice your data

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.980
that you get, all the way
down to the product level.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.470
So you can see during the
purchasing process when

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.150
a user is going through
adding the card, et cetera,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.099
and checking out.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.300
You can see what they're
doing with that product

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.859
before they're
deciding to buy it.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.339
For example, how
many users wants

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.048
to do the detailed product
page before they're

00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:21.839
buying the product?

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.890
Is that relevant
for my product to be

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.910
sold, that there is a
product detail page or not?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.020
So lots of stuff that
can be done here.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.970
And ecommerce, as
you know, is an area

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.030
that's exploding
in terms of growth.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.245
Tremendous amount of growth.

00:17:34.245 --> 00:17:38.550
So this is a great addition
to Google Analytics.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.040
Let's move over to mobile ads.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.040
What we did previously
in Google Play services,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.860
just recently, was we
added in-app purchase ads.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.580
This allows users
to, in the device,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.500
directly purchase virtual
goods that are advertised.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.670
And it also allows the ads to
be targeted to different user

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.450
segments.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.020
So depending on who you are,
you may get different ads.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.150
And in 5.0, we also
made this extremely

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.800
easy by providing
APIs that allows

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.290
you to configure
this in a good way.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.710
That's great stuff.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.780
Don't you think that
this demonstrates

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:22.390
that Google Play services--

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.155
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:24.030
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.203
I hope it works.

00:18:25.203 --> 00:18:25.703
Whoa!

00:18:31.284 --> 00:18:31.783
Sorry.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.331
That's better.

00:18:40.331 --> 00:18:40.830
All right.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.754
There is an I/O
session on Wallet

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.170
as well that you
should check out.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.600
The Instant Buy Everywhere
is taking place.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.290
Really great stuff on Waller.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.510
Play Game Services.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.540
Who likes to play games?

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.510
One or two.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.720
I love games, right?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.210
Especially I like zombie
games, for some reason

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.670
I haven't figured out.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.240
OK, in games we've done a lot
of different stuff, right?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.450
We've added
multiplayer recently.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.700
Achievements is
now part of games.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.470
And leaderboards.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.840
You can see, if you see the
evolution of requirements,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.360
things that we've
added to games,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.280
that we're really creating a
great platform to build games

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.879
upon.

00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:25.420
All the things that
you want to have,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.630
that you had to build
yourself before is pretty much

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.660
becoming part of this platform.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.390
And one thing we
have just recently

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.220
is Game Gifts API, which allows
a user to request a gift.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.630
A wish.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.410
To send a wish request.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.330
To request a gift, right?

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.490
So this could be a
virtual life or something,

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.930
where you run out of life.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.070
And another player can
send a gift request

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.110
to give something
to the other player.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.200
And that, of course, will make
the first player very, very

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.450
happy.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.550
Now happy players are
great, and if they're

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.350
collaborating to become
happy, that's even better.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.810
Because that increases
the social engagement

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.270
between the players in games.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.680
Pretty perfect, I think.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.940
In 5.0, if we look
at 5.0 specifically,

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.860
we added gamer profile.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.010
There's now a
centralized profile

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.760
for all your gaming activity.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.740
Isn't that fantastic, right?

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.260
Yeah?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.240
Is that fantastic or not?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.960
Yeah, that's great.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.090
So you have a
Living Game Profile,

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.570
and there you can store
experience points,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.740
progresses in games,
leaderboard, achievements,

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.880
titles, and levels.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.040
All of that stuff.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.190
So that's good.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.580
We also added saved games.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.280
This allows you to
persist game progress.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.420
If you want to pause
the game, for example.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.630
And you can also add an image
to where the game was paused.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.920
And you can resume
playing that game

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.020
from that position on any
other device that you have.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.690
So that's pretty
great stuff as well.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:58.050
A big enhancement in Play
games services for 5.0

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.249
is the introduction
of events and quests.

00:21:01.249 --> 00:21:02.290
So what are these things?

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.600
Let's start with events.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.830
Events are lightweight
counters in your game.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.230
So it could be, for example,
a player has opened a treasury

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:17.145
chest in the magical room of
floor two in the weird castle.

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:18.480
Stuff like that.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.740
And this allows you to
look at these events

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.430
and how users are
interacting with your game.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.075
So you can see which parts of
your games are used frequently

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:31.900
and which parts are
not used so frequently.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.370
And that brings
us over to quests.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.340
Because these
events, you can then

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.300
create quests based on those.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:47.540
So one example would be kill
5,000 zombies using a spoon

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.260
before Sunday 8:00 PM.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.980
Hey guys, we got to
cancel that hiking trip.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.320
Yeah, it's the zombies again.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.260
No, it's with a spoon this time.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.270
OK, great, right?

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.250
So that's perfect.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.320
You can now have quests
built right in there for you,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.670
and available.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.960
And I think that
that demonstrates

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.076
that Google Play services--

00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:14.924
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:22:14.924 --> 00:22:15.840
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Whoa!

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.766
One more.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.570
Usually when I squeeze to me
like that they go really far.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.780
There we go.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.840
That was a good shot.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:36.910
All right.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.730
There are I/O sessions,
multiple I/O sessions

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.810
on Play Games services.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.720
You should definitely
check them out.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.600
I don't think that mobile
gaming will reduce,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.610
it will rather increase in
terms of usage over the years.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.080
So there will be a lot of
stuff that we can do in this.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.166
Activity recognition.

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:03.790
This is one of my favorite areas
because we're getting physical

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.040
here.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.420
Previously, in
activity recognition,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.070
you could detect the following
different activities--

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.280
if you were on a bike, if
you're on a vehicle, if you were

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.350
still, or tilting, or on foot.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.230
But we decided that
that was not enough.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.150
So we added--

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.610
COMPUTER: Walking and running.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.860
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.790
We added walking and
running to activities.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.240
And now, we would have
a live demonstration

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.580
from Adam Metcalf,
my colleague who

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.480
is working as a software
engineer in the core Google

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.520
Play services team.

00:23:45.422 --> 00:23:46.880
ADAM METCALF: Hi,
I'm Adam Metcalf.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.070
I'm a software engineer on
the Google Play services team.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.560
I thought I'd come up here and
share a demo with you that I

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.521
wrote that will be included in
the samples section of Google

00:23:54.521 --> 00:23:55.270
Play services SDK.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.810
The demo is essentially
activity recognition, including

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:05.610
Play Games for a leaderboard and
dumping some files onto Drive

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.770
later so you can
recap how it went.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.300
I will start it now.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.010
COMPUTER: Game
started, get ready.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:12.550
ADAM METCALF: It
gives you enough time

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.680
to put in your
pocket, because we're

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.330
going to do activity
recognition.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.224
COMPUTER: Stop.

00:24:16.224 --> 00:24:18.140
ADAM METCALF: So stop
meaning be really still.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.000
COMPUTER: You're doing it.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.860
ADAM METCALF: Yay.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.740
This game is very much like
red light, green light.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.500
COMPUTER: Start walking.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.360
ADAM METCALF: So it told
me to start walking,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.276
so I'll start walking.

00:24:24.276 --> 00:24:27.690
And takes about 10 seconds or
so for the activity recognition

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:33.350
to kick in because it wants to
be very sure that you're not

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.280
just shaking the phone.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.690
Walking on a stage is not
the greatest place for this.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.230
COMPUTER: Keep it up.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.980
ADAM METCALF: Yay.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.030
There we go.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.080
COMPUTER: Stop.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.680
Almost.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.040
ADAM METCALF: Aw.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.007
I was moving too much.

00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:44.840
I'm shaking up here.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.820
COMPUTER: Yes.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.950
All right.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:48.890
Start walking.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.973
ADAM METCALF: OK, let's
do this a little bit more.

00:24:54.007 --> 00:24:55.090
COMPUTER: You're doing it.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.637
ADAM METCALF: All right.

00:24:57.637 --> 00:24:58.220
COMPUTER: Yes.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.820
All right.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:03.890
Start running.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.270
ADAM METCALF: OK, let's see
how this works on stage.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.978
COMPUTER: Almost.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:08.890
Oh no.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.518
ADAM METCALF: Aw, c'mon.

00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:14.117
COMPUTER: Keep trying.

00:25:14.117 --> 00:25:15.200
ADAM METCALF: I can do it.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.116
COMPUTER: Keep trying.

00:25:18.294 --> 00:25:20.140
Stop.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.410
ADAM METCALF: And that's
going to conclude the game.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.470
COMPUTER: Keep it up.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.100
Game over.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.689
Your score was 775.

00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:27.689
ADAM METCALF: All right.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.066
So we get that up on the
screen, when it comes up.

00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:38.440
So when the game
concludes, it'll

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.910
submit a score to the Google
Play Games leaderboard.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.470
And because the Wi-Fi in this
place is not the greatest,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.860
it'll do it offline and
eventually send it up

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.800
when I next get connected.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.550
You can see that it
has a tracking of when

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.770
I hit all the
activity recognitions.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.150
And you can even
open up a leaderboard

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.544
and see how I'm doing.

00:25:57.544 --> 00:25:59.960
I did not beat my high score,
so I'll have to keep trying.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:02.920
All right.

00:26:06.807 --> 00:26:08.640
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Round
of applause for Adam.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:20.320
So that was an example of a
game that used the location API,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.550
that used the leaderboards
in Play Games services,

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.180
and it used the Drive
API to store a file

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.354
with the progress of the game.

00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:29.520
We have this slide, as well.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.110
This shows you how these
different clients within Google

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.590
Play services was connected
to the Google API client.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:37.920
Something you've probably seen.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.430
It's a new connectivity
methodology

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.320
in the core parts of
Google Play services.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.940
It makes these
things, connecting

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.940
different clients,
really, really easy.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.520
So it's a very,
very good feature.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.400
So now we have
walking and running.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.590
That's exciting, right?

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.340
We have a lot of stuff here now.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.040
It feels like you
can build a lot

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.640
of physical,
interactive games if you

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.070
combine all of these APIs.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.410
I'd like to see more of that
coming out to Google Play.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:09.050
And I think this demonstrates
that Google Play services--

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:09.970
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.750
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: That's right!

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.040
OK, there we go.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:22.570
All right, let's move
over to Google Cast SDK.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:27.280
The Google Cast SDK was
released in February 2014.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.750
This is amazing, right?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.490
Suddenly your mobile
device, your Android device,

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:37.436
becomes a remote control for any
Chromecast-enabled TV screen.

00:27:37.436 --> 00:27:38.810
It's quite amazing,
I think, what

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.100
you can do with it from an
application perspective.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.780
Together with that API,
there's another API

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.550
you can use which is a Cast
Companion Library, which

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.420
makes certain operations in the
Google Cast SDK easier to do.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.520
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.950
There's also an I/O session
on Google Cast, or ChromeCast,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.250
Casting to the Future,
that you should take up

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:05.930
if you're interested in
looking more into Chromecast.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:11.140
Now, Google Drive Android API
was released in January 2014.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.340
This is a native
API that allows you

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.770
to interact with Drive
content of any user that

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.590
has given their consent,
of course, for this.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.520
So this is a great
way, also, to access

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.860
the hard drives for
different users.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.300
And this is a feature which
is due in 5.0, which is great,

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:32.870
I think.

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.810
It's the App Indexing API.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.810
This API allows you, through
Google Play services,

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.840
to report things in your
app, deep within your app,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.930
content deep within your
app that gets picked up

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.830
and becomes available
to Google Search.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.080
And obviously, that can
drive more user interaction

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.300
with your app because you can
actually now expose the stuff

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.245
that you do deep within your
app to the general internet.

00:28:59.245 --> 00:29:01.070
So it drives user engagement.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.630
Great feature as well.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.400
Google Fit.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.900
You should definitely
go up to level three

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.120
to check out the
Google Fit station.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.120
This station will show you how
to manage your fitness data.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.620
That's a perfect place.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.600
And then dynamic
security providers,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.950
an area that I'd like
to touch upon, as well.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:27.120
Dynamic Security provider is a
feature in Google Play services

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.160
that will allow you to pick
up a security provider.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.550
Now, if vulnerabilities
is detected, for example,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.060
in SSL protocol, or whatever,
these vulnerabilities

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.760
will be fixed as part of the
push of Google Play services.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.150
That means that your apps
that you're developing

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.560
do not need to embed
this kind of logic,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.920
and they don't need
to be updated to cater

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.350
for these different problems.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:51.970
All the security
things are being

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.200
dealt with with the
Google Play services push.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.180
All right.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.060
Moving to the Google
Maps Android API.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.990
The Google Maps
Android API has been

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.960
part of Google Play services
for a long time now,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.980
since Android version 2.0.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.510
The version 2.0 has been
part of Google Play services

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.910
since December 2012.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.090
But just recently, we're
happy to introduce, yes,

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.540
this is a major
feature, I think.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.993
It is the Street View
capability of Google Maps.

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:31.850
Let's introduce it with a
round of applause, please.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.880
Get back to work, yeah.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.540
All right.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:42.560
This capability will
allow your users

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.120
to explore the world using
panoramic 360 degrees

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.720
views, right?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.640
And they can work with
the Street View camera

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.116
to zoom in and also control
the camera location.

00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.990
And, of course, all the
movements that you do

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.240
will be animated.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.590
These are now
capabilities that you

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.970
can get natively into your app.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.900
So it's a major extension.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.360
It's absolutely amazing.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.730
If you look at some of the
things we just added to this,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.750
it's the Tubbataha coral
reefs in Philippines.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.995
You can actually swim
around in this reef,

00:31:20.995 --> 00:31:23.520
and check it out,
using Street View.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.070
And another one, that
you may have seen before,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.260
is that you can actually
explore different base

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.890
camps of Mount Everest.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.260
There's tremendous
stuff in Street View

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.000
that you can explore using
this type of feature.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.320
And I thought, now when
we have Street View,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.060
it's actually possible to
create a dual time space, right?

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.210
So given that we
have location, where

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:48.920
I can register my
current location,

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.320
right, I can have Street View
display my current location.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.650
So I could be walking
down the street, right?

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.940
I challenge for somebody
to develop this app.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.550
I could be walking
down the street,

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.680
experiencing the real
world with my body,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:08.570
but have the world that was
recorded when the Street View

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:09.760
camera passed by.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.100
I can get that experience
at the same time.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.320
So kind of two time
dimensions at the same time.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.280
And if somebody would
come up to me to say,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.252
you're crazy, what
are you doing?

00:32:19.252 --> 00:32:20.460
COMPUTER: Magnus is not here.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.860
He is traveling in time.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.787
Can I leave a message?

00:32:22.787 --> 00:32:24.870
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Then I
could have that triggered.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.360
Absolutely amazing.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.270
We can build a time machine,
a kind of a time machine,

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.410
by using these capabilities.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.600
And I think that
this demonstrates

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.324
that Google Play services--

00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:37.990
AUDIENCE: Rocks!

00:32:41.857 --> 00:32:43.023
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Are you OK?

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.460
That's great.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.010
There are also a
couple of sessions

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.690
on Maps during this I/O,
so go and check them out.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:59.670
There is also a Dev
I/O Byte available

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.060
that you can check
out on the internet.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.250
Great, so Google Play
services rocks, right?

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.730
You can get the latest stuff we
develop here at Google, latest

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.110
and most shiny stuff that we
develop in mobile technology.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.480
And that can be
available to all of you

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.840
mobile developers out
there in the world,

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.650
to create great apps that
are available in almost all

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.670
of the Google Play
devices out there.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:25.700
It's quite amazing.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.220
So we have social, we have
activity, we have games,

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.400
we have commerce,
Cast, Location, Drive,

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.030
Cloud, and Maps.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.960
I'm happy I caught my
breath between those,

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.126
otherwise I wouldn't have
been able to read that out

00:33:39.126 --> 00:33:40.180
in a single sentence.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.390
It is a fantastic
framework for you

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.050
to go out and create
fantastic apps.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.170
In fact, it's your
turn to go out

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.120
there and create great apps.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.080
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.625
Thank you so much for
having us in this session.

00:33:55.625 --> 00:33:57.460
It was great talking to you.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.420
Adam, come up.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.890
So we have time for a couple
of questions, I think.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.390
Yeah?

00:34:08.964 --> 00:34:09.505
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:11.980
So I was curious
about-- it's great

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.170
that services are
pulled out, and you

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.889
get the advantage of them
being updated automatically

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.179
without the user having
to update your app.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.600
But in general, like with the
Nokia X or the Amazon Fire,

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.159
you can't get some
of these services

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.960
without the Play Store.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.830
So are you guys
thinking about offering

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:31.239
an alternative, either a library
or some other way of getting

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.920
at these services
without the Play Store?

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.120
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.880
They're tightly
integrated, the Google

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.380
Play Store and
Google Play services.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.530
It forms the same concept.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:44.010
In fact, Google Play
services is an APK

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.949
within the Play Store itself.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:51.030
AUDIENCE: But certain things
like GCM, or Ads, or even

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.730
Analytics, I wouldn't
say necessarily--

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.340
like Wallet absolutely should
be part of the Play Services.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.965
But there are certain
services that you

00:34:57.965 --> 00:35:01.600
can make a case that would
be beneficial to both Google

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.240
and the developers that
wouldn't be tightly integrated

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.310
in Play services.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.740
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: OK, all right.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.390
Now, I think that
the strategy is

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.690
to have them together, bundled.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.540
OK, next question,
over to the left.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.990
I would like to know if the
credit card scan feature,

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.540
it's available without
using Google Wallet.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.547
For example, with
another payment method.

00:35:23.547 --> 00:35:24.630
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: The what?

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.050
Which feature?

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.834
AUDIENCE: Credit card scan.

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:29.250
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
As far as I know,

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.280
that is an integral
part of Google Wallet.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.580
So it works together with
the Google Wallet account.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.630
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.755
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Thank you.

00:35:36.755 --> 00:35:37.339
Next question.

00:35:37.339 --> 00:35:39.879
AUDIENCE: So it's awesome to
see that Google Play services is

00:35:39.879 --> 00:35:40.860
constantly evolving.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.590
But some key APIs have
been deprecated or removed,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.350
I think, recently, like
Wallet Client and Plus Client.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.976
And it's not really always clear
on the Google Play services

00:35:48.976 --> 00:35:50.600
page, what's deprecated
and what's not,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.530
unless I go to the
individual pages.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.400
So what's the best way
for me as a developer

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.780
to plan ahead for these,
so I can make time

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.100
to make these changes.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.322
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
That's a good question.

00:35:59.322 --> 00:36:01.820
You'll find out when
you get the next SDK

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.810
and just get the warning
messages in the compiler,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:05.670
I guess.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:06.570
It's a good question.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.694
I don't have a good answer.

00:36:07.694 --> 00:36:09.560
But we have been
looking at trying

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.540
to get more information
out preemptively about what

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.130
has changed API-wise, also.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.860
Not only on the high level, new
APIs that are being launched.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.090
So I'll take that as
something to think about.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.320
Next question.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.760
AUDIENCE: As Google
Play services continues

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.930
to get larger and
larger, are you

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.310
thinking about breaking it
up into modules optionally?

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.850
So developers don't have
to include such a giant JAR

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.432
in their project files.

00:36:37.432 --> 00:36:39.140
ADAM METCALF: We've
been looking into it.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.960
Nothing to confirm or deny yet.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.150
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: All
right, next question.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.983
AUDIENCE: I actually
have the same question,

00:36:47.983 --> 00:36:51.120
although-- I've heard a
lot of developers running

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.157
into this issue, especially
with actually running to the DEX

00:36:54.157 --> 00:36:56.820
limit with more recent
versions of Play services.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.420
So it's becoming more
and more of a pain point.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.840
Since you answered
his question, I

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.695
have another question,
which is what is tilting?

00:37:05.695 --> 00:37:07.320
ADAM METCALF: I think
it's when there's

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.500
been a significant motion.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.580
Not significant motion, but
it's like the user has picked up

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.930
the device, and there's
been some amount

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.642
of tilting to let you know that
it was sitting down on a table

00:37:17.642 --> 00:37:19.225
or something, and
you've picked it up.

00:37:19.225 --> 00:37:21.224
AUDIENCE: So it's not
like some weird phenomenon

00:37:21.224 --> 00:37:22.289
people are doing?

00:37:22.289 --> 00:37:23.955
ADAM METCALF: No,
it's not like tilting.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.440
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: All
right, next question.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.800
AUDIENCE: I'm working on an
app that saves information

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.089
as files in a file system.

00:37:36.089 --> 00:37:37.880
I would like to be able
to synchronize that

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.000
across several devices, so I
was looking at the Dropbox API.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.880
It looks like Google Drive
might serve my purposes.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.920
So would it serve my purposes?

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.110
Would it be able to
present the information

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.210
as if it were a file system?

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.010
One of the problems
with the Dropbox

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:06.140
is it requires the inclusion
of a lot of shared libraries.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.190
So I need to include
a large shared

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.510
library for every
different processor.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.730
And there's no shared
libraries or anything.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.060
This is just a web service.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.210
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So the
Drive API is a native API.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.710
It's statically compiled
to get rid of the binary.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.520
So there's not a
web services API.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.580
And it allows you to do offline
syncing with the device,

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.130
as well.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.570
And you can create
offline folders and stuff.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.570
So it's a perfect
API to access files

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.440
such as in a hard drive
with different users.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.220
It sounds like it's something
you should check out.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.261
AUDIENCE: Sounds like from
the last two questions

00:38:45.261 --> 00:38:47.067
I might have the
same space problem.

00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:49.400
Because one of the problems
I had with the Dropbox is it

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.530
required these two
large shared libraries.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.666
OK.

00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:54.790
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Thank you.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.245
Two more questions, I think.

00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:57.170
Do we have time?

00:39:00.316 --> 00:39:02.100
Are we OK with time?

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.881
One question, one minute?

00:39:04.881 --> 00:39:06.310
One more question.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.560
AUDIENCE: This one shouldn't
count towards your limit.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.280
Will you shoot me
with your t-shirt gun?

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.792
ADAM METCALF: You
don't want that.

00:39:12.792 --> 00:39:14.500
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: You
want me to shoot it?

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.220
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
shot anybody with it?

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:16.950
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No, no, no.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.050
Well, no, I haven't.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.070
But here, I'll shoot
it one final time.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.470
Are you ready?

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.435
OK.

00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:25.960
Ooh, that's really far,
it's way back there.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.480
That was a good final shot.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.540
Thank you so much for
coming to this session.
