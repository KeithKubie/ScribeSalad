00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.040
- In today's first round of
competition

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.460
we won't be doing
any signature styles.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.380
Instead, we'll be making one of
J. Neilson's favorite weapons,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.670
the European dagger.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.670
I have actually
never made a dagger.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.540
It's not something I
really wanted to do.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.460
But I guess I'm doing it now.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.880
WIL WILLIS:
Gentlemen your blades

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.580
must fall within the
following parameters.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.710
The length of the blade must
fall between 10 and 12 inches.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.000
The width of the blade at its
widest point must be at least 1

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.710
and 1/4 inches.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
And you must have a double edged
blade with a ricasso that is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.750
at least 3/4 of an inch long.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.000
Your three hours starts now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.580
[music playing]

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.830
OK, so we've got 52
100 ball bearings.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.170
We get chain saw, springs,
powdered steel, you name it,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.710
everything out there can
be turned into a knife.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.750
J. NEILSON: You could do it with
canister, upright, canoe, cube.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.580
You could do a
laminate, layer it up,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.250
do multiple different patterns.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580
There is the
possibility of thousands

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.380
of patterns and designs right
there on that one table.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.620
DREW: I'm picking layered steel.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.420
Because it's not
really tough to weld.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.120
It's really easy to draw out.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.710
And there's less of a
chance of it failing.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.250
And I immediately start
to clean off the steel.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.790
Because they've got
iron oxide on them.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.290
It's really bad for a weld.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.790
It's just evil for bladesmiths.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.380
J. NEILSON: He's taking
that few extra minutes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.120
to clean up that steel
is just a smart move.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.580
[machinery running]

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460
- Oh my God.
- What's up?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.080
Can I get a Band-Aid?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.620
I ran my thumb
across 36 grit belt.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.920
And it ripped the
tip of my thumb

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.960
off and left it
flapping in the wind.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.120
I'm off to a wonderful start.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.040
Less than three minutes,
one of our contestants

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.460
is already bleeding
on the floor.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.420
Yeah, that's a record.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.120
That hurt.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.420
David Baker, I feel
like I look like him today

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120
with the vest and the tie.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.330
Is Drew under
dressed for this?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.920
No, no, I think Drew
styled it in actually.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.330
DREW: I've got to
make this unique.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.790
First thing is ladder pattern.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.000
This won't do anything to the
functionality of the blade.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.250
But it'll make my
blade look different.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.580
J. NEILSON: Hey Drew.
- Hey.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.670
Talk to me about what you're
doing with your patterning

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.830
here.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.170
I don't think
it's deep enough.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.460
That's my concern.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.170
You've got a large
billet there still.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.000
You didn't grind in very deep.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.120
So if you go to try
and pattern that out,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000
your pattern is probably
not going to show up.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.580
Yeah.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.830
I might fold it over again
and get some more layers.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.330
- That would be nice to see.
- And then--

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.790
You don't want to put
the work into that pattern

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.290
and have it disappear
once you forge it out.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.040
I'm not a fool.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.670
I've seen people lose
because they don't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.210
take advice from the judges.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.000
And I'm going to take
every single bit I can get.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.880
[music playing]

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.170
I think it'll do.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.290
J. NEILSON: We just had
Drew quench his blade.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.540
DAVID BAKER: Quench early.
J. NEILSON: Yep.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.790
DOUG MARCAIDA: Yep.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.830
DAVID BAKER: Doesn't
hurt the blade.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.380
You can grind a quenched blade.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380
Yep.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.960
DREW: Grinding the
blade, especially

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.880
for a European dagger,
it's very important.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.380
Because you've got to
get everything straight.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.040
[grinder running]

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.500
I'm spending a ton
of time on this.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.000
And I think it's time
well worth spent.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.380
WIL WILLIS: All
right bladesmiths,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.920
over the last three
hours, you've worked

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.250
on your European daggers.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.670
Let's see if your
blades are up the specs.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.580
Jason, you're up first.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.580
DAVID BAKER: Well, first off,
your steel looks really good.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.000
It's nice and clean.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.540
Love to see a lot of
that material taken out,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.080
maybe just a taper
put into this.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.250
The ricasso is good.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.920
Nicely done.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.330
Thank you.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.750
All right, Drew,
please present

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.420
your work to the judges.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.920
J. NEILSON: You
know, Drew, watching

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.830
somebody work as well as
you did at half of my age

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.170
really impresses me.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.580
Your steel looks good and tight.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.170
But you do have quite a warp.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.580
There's a few
different ways that you

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.080
can go ahead and fix that.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.750
But overall a very nice job.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.080
Thank you.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.790
All right so, Drew,
first off, if you're

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.750
going to grind in a vest,
make sure it's a 100% cotton.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.080
That thing could
go up in flames.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.790
I really like the shape of this.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.420
The fact that your
ricasso sets in.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.920
You just have enough
ricasso there.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.460
The lines are really clean.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.460
I like the fact that that spine
goes all the way to the tip.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.460
Nicely done.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.120
I'm impressed by your work.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.290
All right, Larry, you're up.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.040
[music playing]

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.460
J. NEILSON: Well, Larry,
your steel looks pretty nice.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.460
But we got a few
different issues here.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.710
You're really thin down
here and thicker up here.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.460
And you've got quite a
wave in your blade as well.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.380
Big thing, where
is your ricasso?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.710
I got behind the eight
ball, ran out of time.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.920
All right, well,
that's a problem.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.830
Yeah.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.250
WIL WILLIS: Larry, your blade
was required to have a ricasso.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.830
It doesn't.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.500
That's grounds for immediate
dismissal from this forge.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.670
The reason I have to
ask you to please leave.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.670
