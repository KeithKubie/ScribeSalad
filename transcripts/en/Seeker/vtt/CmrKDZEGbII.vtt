00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.420
When it comes to sex, how long is too long?

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.190
Hello everyone and welcome to DNews, I’m
Dr. Crystal Dilworth here to discuss Intravaginal

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.969
Ejactulatory Latency Time.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.830
Otherwise known as the time it takes a heterosexual
couples to have sex.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.430
So how long “should” you be having sex
for anyway?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.350
And are you…”normal”?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.890
Well in attempting to answer these questions,
I discovered that “normal” has actually

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.680
changed with societal expectations, and the
average length of intercourse has varied over

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
time.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.829
So it’s not just biology that we are dealing
with here.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.329
How long we *think* we should be having sex
is an influence too.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.350
In the late 1940s at the time of the famous
Kinsey Report, 75% of males surveyed reported

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.879
intercourse lasting approximately 2 minutes.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.280
A number that seems objectionably short to
me personally and could warrant a premature

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.359
ejaculation diagnosis in these modern times.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.889
For the record, the diagnosis of PE is heavily
weighted towards self and partner reported

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.809
satisfaction but one to two minutes is commonly
considered premature.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.850
Researchers are finding that since the late
60’s, since the start of the feminist movement,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.689
and sexual revolution, intercourse has been
taking us slightly longer.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:12.689
How long?

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.170
Well survey data from studies done at the
University of New Brunswick show that duration

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.831
of vaginal intercourse is now reported to
fall within a range of 5 - 10 minutes, with

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:26.650
durations in excess of 20 minutes being undesirable
to most study participants.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.649
So that average sweet spot is really, as one
scientist put it: “approximately the duration

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.759
of one Marvin Gaye song”.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.070
Sadly, sex research is notoriously penis-centric
and historically hetero-centric, so these

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.979
averages only apply to the time it takes for
male ejaculation with a female partner and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.289
only the more recent studies investigate qualitative
measures like sexual satisfaction.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.100
In a 2004 study, participants were asked to
report how long they wanted sex to last as

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060
well as the actual duration of their intercourse.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
Female study participants indicated they desired
an average of 7 min longer intercourse then

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.620
what was standard with their current partners,
and men reported wanting another 11 min.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.670
The funny thing about this survey, is that
when asked about duration of foreplay both

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.569
men and women also reported desiring an average
of 5 or 10 min longer respectively.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.810
So, take a look at your partner.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.810
Are they smiling?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.970
If not, it might be time for a conversation
about sexual expectations and needs.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.519
Because, ultimately, it doesn’t matter what
study group survey subjects think, or what

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.099
your friends, neighbors, or professionals
on your computer screens are doing, what matters

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.610
is self and partner satisfaction.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.220
Something to keep in mind as you check out
this video where Julia asks the question “How

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.739
much sex should you be having?”

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.010
So, are you sexually normal?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.750
