00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.710
Applications, especially
enterprise-focused ones,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.710
often have functionality
that is best configured

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.420
by IT admins rather
than the end user.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.190
Think of server URLs, domain
names, whitelists, blacklists,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.720
enabling encryption, even
usernames and passwords

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.179
for new users.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.720
I'm Rich Hyndman,
and this is Part II

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.460
of my Android for
Work series where

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.580
I'll cover App Configurations,
Testing, and Launchers.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.040
If you haven't seen Part I
yet, you can find it here.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.030
We included new APIs in
Lollipop for our per application

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.680
policies.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160
They allow you to specify
features of your app

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.050
that are remotely
configurable by IT admins.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.890
You specify the restrictions in
your Android project in an XML

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.890
file, and they're
made available to IT

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.430
admins in their mobile
device management console.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.390
You can retrieve the
current values at run time

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.640
by getting an instance of
the restrictions manager

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.432
and calling get_application
restrictions.

00:00:49.432 --> 00:00:51.265
Of course, if you do
that on initial launch,

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:54.220
you will find any existing
restrictions set by the admin,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.860
but they can be
updated at any time.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.700
So you should also register
for the relevant broadcast

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.160
so you're notified if an
admin updates the policy,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.874
and then you can
load the new values.

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:07.040
Fortunately, you don't need
to remember any of that.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.289
It's all detailed in the
Implementing App Restrictions

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.930
page, and there are sample
implementations available

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.630
as well.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.300
Just head to
developer.android.com/work

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.690
for all the resources.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.090
Testing your production
code is always tricky.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.600
And regardless of whether
you're using app configurations

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.360
or not, it is good practice
to test your app in a managed

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.000
profile environment.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
Android Work has put
together some useful tools

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.160
to help you out.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.430
Firstly, you will need to
set up a managed profile

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.050
on your device or emulator.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.020
You can do that with the basic
manage profile sample app.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.180
Just click on Import
an Android Code Sample

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.530
in the Android
Studio launch screen.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.250
It demonstrates how
to configure which

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.960
apps are available in
the managed profile

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.470
and which intents can cross
from one profile to the other.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.920
Next, of course, you'll need
to install your application.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.810
And once you have a managed
profile on your device,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.476
any apps that you
sideload are installed

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:56.900
into both the profiles.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.800
So then you need to
choose which profile

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.660
you're running the
application as,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.060
and you do that with the User
Parameter on the ADB shell

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.110
commands.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.840
To find the user
ID of each profile,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.600
there's a List Users command.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.370
The first number on each
line returned is the user ID.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.170
If your app relies on the camera
or any of the default apps,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.720
then it's worth disabling
them and testing.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.450
Finally, a quick note for
developers of launchers.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.177
Launchers replace the
default home screen

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:23.760
on an Android device,
and they provide

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.350
for awesome customizations.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.840
And as you can
imagine, displaying

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.950
a view of two profiles
merged together

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.856
requires some minor updates.

00:02:30.856 --> 00:02:32.730
As shown in the first
episode, corporate apps

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.810
now have a special badging.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.490
Android 5 introduces
the launcher apps class,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.460
which you can use to
find all the activities

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.380
available for the current user.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.840
Just call
launchyourapps.getactivitylist

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.880
with a null package name.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.980
And as managed profiles can be
added and removed at any time,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.250
you'll also want to register for
the Profile Added and Profile

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.009
Removed callbacks to
keep the UI up to date.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.550
Then, there are
methods for obtaining

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.340
badged versions of icons and
also especially badged text

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.260
for the content
descriptions to ensure

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.360
your launcher also
functions correctly

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.694
with the accessibility tools.

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:08.110
If your launcher
supports widgets,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.720
there are also a
couple of new methods

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.053
in the app widget manager for
dealing with multiple user

00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:13.360
profiles.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200
That's all.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.892
Thanks for watching, and
let's get back to work.
