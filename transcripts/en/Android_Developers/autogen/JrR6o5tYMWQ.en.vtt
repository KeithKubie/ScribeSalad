00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.266
 Mayotte: After developing a wonderful application, 

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.733
 Testing and subtraction, 

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.200
 The next biggest challenge 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
 How to increase a valuable audience of interested users. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.766
 Hi, I'm Frederic from the Google Play team. 

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.533
 Using the new tools in the Google Play Developer Console, 

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.800
 We facilitate the understanding of performance 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.366
 User acquisition channels, 

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.933
 We help build new users 

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.733
 Across Google networks. 

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.800
 Imagine that you have developed a racing game called "RPM". 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.733
 And impressed the experimental testers, 

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.733
 So I decided to put them on the public on Google Play. 

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.033
 Once users have started downloading your app, 

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:38.100
 You started asking yourself important questions. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.600
 "Where did the users come from? 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.833
 "How did they hear about the game? 

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:44.900
 "What prompted them to install? 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.033
 "And which of these users will be conducted 

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.633
 An in-app purchase most likely? " 

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.966
 You can now find answers to these questions 

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.166
 In the User Acquisition Performance report 

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.133
 In the Google Play Developer Console. 

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.966
 Summarizes the new user acquisition performance report 

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.433
 How users discover your app and how to spend their money. 

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.833
 You can see how many users have visited your store listing page, 

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:07.933
 And established the application, 

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.600
 They made one or more purchases at the end. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.066
 After seeing this information about the user's purchase, 

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.800
 You can choose some aspects to improve them 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.566
 Or planning the store data list experiments 

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.366
 To explore different options. 

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.133
 For free discovery channels, 

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.466
 We show the number of visits coming from the Play Store 

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.966
 Outside, 

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:29.800
 Such as visits from users who have discovered your app via Google Search. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.133
 For visits from paid sources, 

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.900
 We identify individual Google AdWords campaigns 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.966
 That are created directly from the Play Developer Console 

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.533
 Any other channels are tracked 

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:42.033
 Sending traffic to the store listing page. 

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.466
 By knowing which channels drive users to make purchases, 

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.233
 You can determine how to customize your marketing budget 

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.633
 So that the best return is achieved. 

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:54.600
 If marketers use Urchin traffic control tags on links, 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.766
 The performance report will also track these marks 

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.433
 It will tell you specifically 

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:01.766
 Perform each channel of your channels. 

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.366
 Now that you know where users come from, 

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.866
 You want to start acquiring new users, 

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.033
 This is vital to your success. 

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.633
 There are several ways to acquire new users. 

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:16.900
 A common method is to pay for app install ads. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.166
 Where new global app campaigns are being used in that way. 

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.100
 It's the easiest way to promote your Android app 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.533
 For interested users across Google Play, 

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:30.066
 Google Search, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. 

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.700
 You can do this now and directly from the Developer Console. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.733
 It takes a few clicks to start a campaign 

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.166
 Within your budget. 

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.966
 Let us see how this is done in practice. 

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.033
 When you open the Developer Console, 

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:48.066
 Go to your game and select the Acquisition tab. 

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:51.366
 From there, choose Create a new campaign. 

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:53.600
 The application creation form is already populated 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.266
 Using existing Play Store listing assets, 

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.033
 Such as application code and short description 

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:00.900
 And the promotional video. 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.200
 You can edit promotions a little if you want. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 Only the maximum budget is left 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.900
 And how much you want to pay for installing the app. 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.133
 If you publish your game globally, 

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:18.200
 You will know that the investment in each market is different. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.733
 For example, the cost per installation may vary 

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:24.100
 Between the United States and Spain. 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.533
 We recommend exploring 

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.166
 Logical cost per install 

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.966
 In each country you target on Google Play 

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:33.000
 You must also think about how much you will gain 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.266
 Of the average user in each country. 

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.900
 It is important to experience the cost per install 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.166
 To see how it affects the number of conversions 

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.266
 That are generated through your campaign. 

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.666
 After completing the form, you have completed everything. 

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:50.200
 The first RPM application promotion campaign is ready to launch. 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.900
 Google Play will launch a fully automated campaign 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.866
 Across Google networks. 

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:57.766
 Which includes web search from Google.com, 

00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.333
 And AdMob on banner ads and mobile apps in the Google Display Network, 

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.633
 YouTube video ad placements, 

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:06.866
 And even search ads in the Play Store itself. 

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:08.766
 We do a hard job of knowing 

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:11.100
 The most appropriate ad placement for your app 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.533
 And users who should be targeted. 

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.366
 Instant optimization is right for you. 

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:19.600
 That's why we call these campaigns 'global app campaigns'. 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.833
 It's the fastest way 

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.633
 To start advertising your app with Google. 

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:26.166
 Using the performance report, 

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:29.000
 Understand and improve your acquisition channels, 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.366
 Whether free or paid. 

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:33.700
 Using global application campaigns, 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.966
 You'll be able to find users interested in your app 

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:38.400
 in no time. 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.533
 Then, you should see the video we offer 

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:42.600
 About the Store Data Store Experiments. 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.233
 You will learn how to perform the A / B test 

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.400
 On the Play Store data list and increase your installs. 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.366
 This can compound the effect 

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:52.700
 All efforts are gained by users. 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.466
 Thank you very much for watching. 

00:04:54.466 --> 00:05:00.533
 [Happy music]
