00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.600
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone. I'm Sumit Chandel, and
I will talk to you guys about Ad Parameters

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:30.789
in v2009. It should be a pretty short undertaking.
I just want to introduce you guys [INDISTINCT]

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.070
in case if you're not aware of it yet. So,
this [INDISTINCT] we'll go through explaining

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.360
what they are and why they're useful, looking
at an example, looking at some codes, some

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.660
pretty--pretty simple to use and you'll see,
and then go to Q&amp;A to see whether [INDISTINCT].

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.950
And, of course, throughout, I'm going to [INDISTINCT]
you know. All right. So Ad Parameters, what

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.329
they are? It let's you change numerical values
in your AdWords, okay? So, that has some advantages;

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.590
one is--if you had an ad that's performing
really well, and let's say, you--you could

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.870
change the values from--for example, you're
selling skis for $200, your ad hasn't [INDISTINCT]

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.250
and it's really doing well and [INDISTINCT],
let's say you're a businessman [INDISTINCT]

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.730
and says, "Hey [INDISTINCT] we're going to
get good luck [INDISTINCT]." So you could

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.640
do that and [INDISTINCT] but you have to have
to create a new ad to modify the existing

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.220
one, and the disadvantage of that is you lose
the history of its existence on the ad and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.220
how it is performing. All right, so those
kind things when they'll [INDISTINCT] ask

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.220
in why we're introducing Ad Parameters. So,
with Ad Parameters, you can change those numeric

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:11.869
values without having to change the rest of
the ad and you can keep all the history and

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:21.350
the steps. And for the other advantage, it
let's you keep your [INDISTINCT] targeted

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:31.759
to your customers [INDISTINCT] specific information
about [INDISTINCT]. Okay, so let's [INDISTINCT],

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.759
so here's an ad, [INDISTINCT] would give us
amazing deals on brand new skis, let's say,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.010
this gets to [INDISTINCT]. All right, so it's
not too bad, it is the right season for the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.990
ad, so that's a plus. But there is a problem
with this ad, and the problem should not be

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.979
asked because that sucks, right? Well, why
does it suck? So same [INDISTINCT] but which

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.439
brand exactly, okay? Say--say it how much
am I going to save? What's the percentage?

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.329
What's the [INDISTINCT]? So as a user, if
I saw it, I would much less likely [INDISTINCT]

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.170
buy it, compared to an ad that had all the
information there. So, I know exactly what

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.230
I'm getting once I put it on. So, here's another
ad and [INDISTINCT] over that. So there's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.819
no [INDISTINCT] brand names, so let's [INDISTINCT],
I know that. And save 20% on the [INDISTINCT]

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.250
prices, so this one is a bit better, all right.
You still have to [INDISTINCT] and that is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.750
the fact that, if these are team, this ad
once you [INDISTINCT] change it, if they want

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.620
they want to change a certain percentages
for whatnot, that would be a new ad [INDISTINCT].

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.760
So here is an ad with Ad Parameters and this
is most [INDISTINCT]. And so I just here [INDISTINCT]

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.709
save Param1 big time. So Param1 [INDISTINCT]
that's the Ad Parameter, that's the only one

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:57.989
you can insert various values, various numeric
values with all that changes, and that would

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.400
change the rest of the. The thing of [INDISTINCT]
in mix with Param1, that's the default text.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.629
So [INDISTINCT] you don't have a map [INDISTINCT]
on it, then it will jus show that type of

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.129
setting. So, that's where you can put default
text feature, like I was aiming for [INDISTINCT]

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:14.860
and numerical values only. So, default text
can be [INDISTINCT]. The table below that

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.207
shows on which keyword for setting the AdWord,
so that's an important point about how Ad

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:24.060
Parameters work, they need to be set on the
keywords. So, they're not set on the ad but

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.050
it's the keyword that triggers it. So if I
would say that this Ad Parameter on the keyword

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.569
[INDISTINCT], that 20% will be placed under
[INDISTINCT]. So, numerical values and [INDISTINCT]

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.260
values are supported, percentage values actually
aren't [INDISTINCT]. As I was designing this

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.480
example [INDISTINCT], it seemed natural to
me to put a percentage in that, and I was

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.180
told later that it's not actually not supported
and [INDISTINCT] heard of that, and of course,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.830
that's [INDISTINCT] that someone ask this
question about what about percentages, we

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.770
consider it [INDISTINCT] reason why we shouldn't
have this. So this will probably make a [INDISTINCT]

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:12.800
2009 sometimes because it makes sense [INDISTINCT].
Okay, great. So, as I was saying, this is

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:21.489
a much better Ad [INDISTINCT] parameters right
there. So, let's see this in code just to

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.300
see if it works. So, it's really, really simple
to do this, this is just like in the Java

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.940
[INDISTINCT] and yet a very [INDISTINCT] example.
So just create AdWord's user [INDISTINCT]

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:39.530
Ad Parameter's service interface [INDISTINCT]
used to. Here you just pass the--I'll point

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.920
out [INDISTINCT] the AdGroup and the [INDISTINCT].
Then, finally, here the Ad Parameter. So,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.770
you said the [INDISTINCT] around the new search
and text. One of the [INDISTINCT] here is

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.310
the Param index is one. So Ad Parameters are
one index rather zero index. I'm not sure

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.360
why exactly [INDISTINCT]. It's just something
to note. You set the operator, another important

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.639
point here. The operator is always set as
opposed to add, even if this is a new Ad Parameter.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.920
So that's just the way Ad Parameters work,
you never use ad for a new one or an updated

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.580
[INDISTINCT], you will never use it. And then
here, you just click the Ad Param1 operation

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.990
[INDISTINCT] here and [INDISTINCT], get the
results--get the result back, the Ad Params

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.430
are in, and then basically just check it out
as [INDISTINCT]. Do you have questions about

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.450
that? Okay, so back right now, so, you know,
this is much better, right? But it's still

00:05:36.450 --> 00:06:00.630
not perfect. There can be more improvements
for this. So as I was saying the Ad Params

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:08.419
are set at the [INDISTINCT] level, so if you
want to [INDISTINCT] is the most effective

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.240
way possible. You should try then to [INDISTINCT]
keywords [INDISTINCT]. So in this case, I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.319
know I have another parameter that I have
in there [INDISTINCT] starting at param1 at

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.311
low prices [INDISTINCT]. So, those are the
info that I have in there and in the bottom

00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:27.311
[INDISTINCT] if someone pick up this ad [INDISTINCT].
So that's what makes it more powerful and,

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:46.540
of course, it [INDISTINCT] I can keep the
specifics, change its [INDISTINCT]. Okay,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.060
so Ad Parameters, just some good things to
know when you're using them. A few things

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:55.180
have already been mentioned; the first is
that they're set on keywords and not on ads.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:05.039
So, again, that might [INDISTINCT] but once
you'll get used to it [INDISTINCT]. The whole

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:11.210
numerical values [INDISTINCT] values except
for the default text, the one [INDISTINCT]

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:22.901
and that's because if you look at the [INDISTINCT]
it wouldn't actually makes sense how you changed

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.560
the Ad Parameter value of that, so [INDISTINCT]
and it's just the way it's design [INDISTINCT].

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.610
And [INDISTINCT] that will go hand in hand.
