00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:04.186
&gt;&gt;Alison: I can discuss whether or not
confederate monuments should be removed

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.376
by listening to my peers,
and using evidence.

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:12.426
&gt;&gt;Linda: By talking and expressing
oneself, we learn more deeply.

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:18.606
&gt;&gt;One thing we know from
the science of learning is

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:23.736
that complex instruction needs to
be scaffolded, that students need

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:28.646
to be enabled to take each step
along the path and in this classroom,

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:35.526
we see a very sophisticated conversation
being scaffolded to help them learn how

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:39.606
to talk to each other about
this very difficult concept

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:42.716
in a very respectful and thoughtful way.

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.296
&gt;&gt;Alison: We've just finished a
six week unit on the Civil War.

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:51.346
They needed a safe space to talk about
racial issues and justice issues.

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:56.706
I decided a discussion would be the best
way for them to learn about the issue,

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.536
bring in evidence, and
have their voices be heard.

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:05.216
&gt;&gt;I sourced about fifteen
different articles to meet kids

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:08.456
where they were at, in
terms of length of texts

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:11.146
or level of complexity of texts.

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:13.356
&gt;&gt;Linda: Part of the
scaffolding in this classroom is

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:17.836
that this teacher has found fifteen
different texts for students to read,

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:21.986
to prepare for the discussion, so
that they can speak with evidence,

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.326
and so that their evidence
is accessible to them.

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.086
&gt;&gt;Alison: What's important
to understand,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.646
that even though somebody says
something you might disagree with,

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:33.306
everybody's contributing
to this shared dialog

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:37.666
in this safe space. Somebody
start us off.

00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:40.506
&gt;&gt;Student: I think confederate
monuments should be removed,

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:42.036
based on the Atlantic.

00:01:42.036 --> 00:01:44.916
It said, "Establishing monuments
to confederate war heroes

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:47.836
in turn celebrates men
who committed treason."

00:01:48.236 --> 00:01:50.736
&gt;&gt;Alison: I was very pleased
with a lot of students

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:52.536
who really came out of their shell.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:56.406
&gt;&gt;Student: I want to disagree with a
lot of you, saying that they're bad.

00:01:56.676 --> 00:01:59.566
&gt;&gt;Alison: I loved that
there was healthy debate.

00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:01.286
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't know
about the rest of you,

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:04.316
but I don't them in this country.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.716
&gt;&gt;Student: We need to find a
way for each side to be able

00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:11.886
to see the opposing side's
points, instead of just argue them.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:14.336
&gt;&gt;Alison: They were polite,
they were encouraging,

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:19.576
and I think it helps them understand
that deeper understanding of history.

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:21.346
&gt;&gt;Student: It's all in perspective.

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:26.196
If you know it's wrong, then
you can use it to create change.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.726
&gt;&gt;Alison: So we're actually
going to stop there.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:33.106
There were a couple people in the room
tracking things from the conversation.

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:34.396
&gt;&gt;Linda: She's thought about the fact

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:37.016
that some students may be
more comfortable participating

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:41.536
by tracking the conversation, and
then reporting out what they've found.

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:46.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Athen used evidence in
a cool way. He brought up how--

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:49.516
&gt;&gt;Linda: So there are many ways for
students to get their brains engaged

00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:52.656
and to be participating
in this discussion.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:57.706
The deep conversation they've just
had is actually extended by the fact

00:02:57.706 --> 00:03:00.096
that they get to reflect
at the end, in writing.

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:03.716
&gt;&gt;Alison: Tell me how your thinking is
now changed after this conversation.

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.986
It's okay if it didn't change,
but you need to tell me why.

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:10.156
&gt;&gt;Linda: That reflection,
which is metacognitive,

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:13.836
really helps the students
carry more learning

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.256
out of the experience they've just had.
