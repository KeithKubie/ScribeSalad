so my friend was talking about this

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
so my friend was talking about this
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.039
so my friend was talking about this
notion that ontological design implies

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
notion that ontological design implies
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959

but again it's not just our genetics

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
but again it's not just our genetics
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.580
but again it's not just our genetics
that determine who we are it's the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
that determine who we are it's the
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.009
that determine who we are it's the
feedback loops between self and world

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
feedback loops between self and world
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.990
feedback loops between self and world
and and this is the notion of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
and and this is the notion of
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.550
and and this is the notion of
ontological design and I think the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
ontological design and I think the
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.229
ontological design and I think the
takeaway being is that by harnessing

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239
takeaway being is that by harnessing
 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.979
takeaway being is that by harnessing
those feedback loops we can build better

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
those feedback loops we can build better
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.920
those feedback loops we can build better
mind where we can build systems we can

mind where we can build systems we can
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.949
mind where we can build systems we can
build cities cityscapes dwelling spaces

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959
build cities cityscapes dwelling spaces
 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.350

even the words we use to map our reality
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.020
even the words we use to map our reality
can be improved recursively because

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.910
can be improved recursively because
it'll feedback and then improve we are

it'll feedback and then improve we are
 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.650

better tools those little tools then

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
better tools those little tools then
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.810
better tools those little tools then
interface with us and create better

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
interface with us and create better
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.640
interface with us and create better
ideas and then we use those tools to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
ideas and then we use those tools to
 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.080
ideas and then we use those tools to
build new tools and then those new tools

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
build new tools and then those new tools
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.270
