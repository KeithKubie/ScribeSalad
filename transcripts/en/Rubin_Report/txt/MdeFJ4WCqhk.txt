Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:05          joining me today is the Milbank family centers senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, a senior fellow at the Center for European studies at Harvard where he also served as a professor of history for 12 years as well as the author of 14 books. Neil Ferguson. Welcome to the Rubin report. It's exciting to be here. How'd I do on the intro there? I mean I was looking through your bio 14 books. There were 87 other things I could have credited you for. We've already done an interview here in just the 15 minutes we've been sitting here. How was that all right. I mean I could've just made it quicker. The better is my feeling about introductions just to set. He is Neil. All right, here's Neil. All right. There's a ton we got to cover here and I, we've already done half of it I think without the cameras. So let's just dive in immediately to the culture war stuff cause I can tell you've been traveling a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Half jet lags, half wide awake, but I can see that's really where your head's at at the moment. So let's talk some culture war stuff. What do you feel is happening sort of in the gestalt of the universe at the moment? We'll look assaulted. The university might be where we should begin since I've spent a lot of my life in universities. You mentioned a couple of them that Stanford and Harvard. I was at Oxford before that and I'm, much of my life has been, I think witnessing the gradual homogenization of academic life, especially in the field like history. When I became a historian back in the 1980s in Oxford and then in Cambridge, it was generally accepted that that could be conservative historians and liberal historians and socialist historians and then some oxys and towards, it was really quite a heterogeneous community, Oxbridge in those days.

Speaker 2:          01:47          And if you, uh, as I was attracted to the Conservatives because they were more fun and it was a, I think I can say more right? But on more fun. The Fun was the initially attractive thing. When I first got to Oxford in the early eighties, it was clearly at the funniest people where the facture rights, uh, the young Andrew Sullivan who was a year ahead of me at Moreland. So this was all great fun and it led to intellectual, uh, insight because they turned out all sorts of B writes, the historians take Bob Conquest, who was then at the Hoover institution, one of the few historians who got the Soviet Union right at the time, who wrote about Stalin's crimes not long after they were perpetrated. I mean, those were the heroes, uh, of my early years. But in the course of my career, what has happened has been that one history department after another has moved steadily and relentlessly to the monochrome left.

Speaker 2:          02:50          And it has become steadily harder to, to be seen as a conservative. I say seen us, cause I, I've never really felt that I'm a conservative, but I've often been as one to be seen as a conservative historian has become steadily harder and harder. And as a result, the culture war to use your phrase in the universities has been won by the left. There will really be soon a handful left of conservatives at institutions like Harvard and Stanford and Harvey Mansfield will probably be the last one at Harvard. Uh, and, and that's to me deeply depressing, deeply troubling. Do you remember a moment when you saw that shift occurring, because you're saying in the, in the 80s, mid eighties, it was pretty diverse in terms of ideas. Do you remember seeing something or did you see markers that started that you can start putting together the map of where this thing was going to go?

Speaker 2:          03:45          I think the definition of defeat in the culture war is that it's imperceptible that you're, you're aware of it a little bit each year because in a typical department each year somebody retires or dies. Uh, but they're always replaced with somebody working on that. Say for the sake of argument, gender history. So you, your colleague was, uh, was lecturing on the history of the Soviet Union. Richard Pipes, who was at Harvard and uh, and just lately died, one of the great historians of the Bolshevik revolution. You don't ever see someone like that replaced with somebody like him. There'll always be replaced by somebody working on gender history, native American history, that, that process whereby there was no replacement of conservative historians, was a more or less annual events. I got accustomed to being in a real minority, a minority of conservative, uh, historians. I got accustomed to losing pretty much every vote.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Being in the minority on every committee. It became a kind of, you've got to climatize to it, and then one day suddenly hit you that you were practically the last one left. Uh, and you know, when I moved to Stanford, the revelation was quite startling. I was invited to come to the Hoover institution. Many Hoover fellows serve associations, uh, joint appointments with Stanford departments. I had been pretty successful as a teacher at Harvard. My classes had been very large. Uh, the students gave me very powerful evaluations. Uh, I kind of assumed that I would come to Stanford and have some relationship with the history department. And then I was told, oh, no, no, none at all, not even a courtesy appointment. And it was clear that that moment that I had become in the eyes of the Stanford History Department, a pariah, somebody who, who simply couldn't be allowed in the building because of my, my conservative leanings.

Speaker 2:          05:56          Can you explain little bit more about how the universities work like that, that, that could even happen? They're going to, they're going to bring you in. You're, you're a fellow there and that you're just going to be ignored by the department that you're an expert in. It's quite insulting, especially as you've mentioned. Uh, as I've published all there are lots of boutiques. Yeah. Find rather more than, than most of the department put together. And I think, uh, a department with falling enrollments might have been expected to, to want to have a me playing apart. But what happened is, and it's happened in most departments and most universities inexorably the left to Kovar and an implicit rule, a tacit rule was, uh, impose that one does not hire right leaning, uh, historians, nor does one hire. They're graduate students so that they too, people who have been my graduate students have found it difficult, uh, to get hired.

Speaker 2:          07:00          So it's essentially a straightforward, a process whereby the institution has taken over one committee at a time and the left has been good at that for the better part of a century. They've all, how do you think they saw that? How did they have the foresight to go, all right, we've got to take over the university's first. I think that on the right, uh, the previous generation of historians, and this was also true of philosophers and people working in other fields, did not fight very hard, uh, or effectively to promote their successes in academic life. You need to be mindful of the succession. The left was better at ensuring that it's Pratap. Jay's got the appointments. Ultimately, academia is a committee's game. It's all about getting to be the chair of the department to be in charge of the committees. If you control the process, you control the selection, you control the recruitment.

Speaker 2:          08:00          And I suppose I'm, I'm such a naive person. I kind of in my youth assumed we were an abroadly meritocratic world in which if you were smart and hardworking, then then good things would would happen and it took me off for your, yeah, I was completely naive. It took me a while to cottoned onto the fact that in in reality, in academic life as another walks of life patronages everything and you can be as talented as you like if you're not in the right patronage network, then you're done. And I suppose it's been thinking about these issues, how do networks capture institutions that that led me to write the most recent book, the square and the tower, which is actually book number 15 to try to think about how networks operate. We tend to talk casually about networks, but I came to realize that in academic life has another areas you need to understand quite exactly quite precisely how networks operate to see how power is truly wielded.

Speaker 2:          09:06          We can all see the hierarchical institutions that are where power is located. I mean, universities are clearly not as powerful as as governments, but the critical point is to understand the disease. Often networks that capture institutions, the capture, the hierarchies, and that's what happened in academic life. And now I think pretty soon they're just won't be conservatives in university departments. More importantly than that, nobody will be teaching subjects like the history of the Soviet Union. So no students will be taught about the crimes of Lenin and Stalin and students. Like the students I taught yesterday will not hear from anybody that there was a religious motivation to the nine 11 attacks. I had a class at Stanford yesterday and was allowed to sit in and teach somebody else's class as a guest professor. And it happened to be a discussion about nine 11. Uh, and it became clear to me that the students had never considered the possibility that there was a religious motivation, uh, to the nine 11 attacks. Uh, and more or less accepted the idea that they were retaliation for the misdeeds of US foreign policy in the Middle East, what are called the Howard Zinn theory. And since Howard Zinn's books are more widely read in the United States than anybody else's history books, we therefore arrive at a situation in which there will be nobody in any measure university saying, actually Howard Zinn is completely wrong and this is not what nine 11 was about. So that's what I find depressing when I say that the culture was kind of over in the universities. That's really what I mean.

Speaker 3:          10:52          Yeah. So let's circle back because it does bring us to your 15th work. I stand corrected. Um, this I this idea of networks, because we were talking right before we started that there is something happening here with this loose association of people that has been coined the intellectual dark web. And I said to you when you walked in, are you part of the intellectual dark web as if you were going to give me a secret handshake or a special card or when I was, I denied all knowledge. Yeah. The assumption that it was secret and then it turned out to be all over the New York Times. Yeah, but are you weren't, you weren't photographed in the bushes like the rest of us, but I suspect that you secretly are in the intellectual dark web. Well, I couldn't possibly reveal that because it's secret. But when you said something interesting about, because of your level of academic sort of academic credit that you thought perhaps that took you out of it. But then Christina Hoff Summers said something interesting. I don't know who goes in there, what

Speaker 2:          11:49          Barry was emailed me on, my wife Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who's been on your show is much more interesting than me is the greatest. And I mean, we, she must be tough for you because, you know, it's like the millions of people love your work and everything else, but it's like ion is like transcended. She's wonderful. It's tough. It's the most enormous, wonderful blessing in my life to be married to somebody who's just way more interesting than me. At best they're looking to. So that, so we were both asked by Barry, uh, why supplant the intellectual dark web? And I said, look, how can I really claim to be part of that? When I taught for 12 years at Harvard, left of my own volition and here at Stanford can write newspaper columns and have them published more or less where I want it would, it would be a little disingenuous to claim kinship with people like Bret Weinstein who've been persecuted by the academic left.

Speaker 2:          12:43          Now I've been attacked. I've been criticized, but I haven't really been driven underground, at least not at this point. But Christina's summers said to me, uh, just the other night. No, it's not about whether you've been denied a platform or not. Clearly, almost all the people in the article that Barry wrote have plenty of opportunities to make their views known. It's about whether you are seen to speak for people who feel that they have been silenced, who feel that their voices aren't heard night. That's quite a good definition of what this is about, but you're also right to see that it's a network. As I was reading the article, I was thinking how funny I know all these people. I'm the sole exception of Jordan Peterson who I've never met. Um, I sent that's coming. Well, yeah, I hope so. I look forward to it. Um, but I, I, I think it's a network of the most, uh, ideal sought.

Speaker 2:          13:39          It is a truly informal network of people from right across the political spectrum because nobody could call Bret Weinstein are conservatives who have come together spontaneously, informally. Nobody called it into being and said, I'm forming the intellectual dark web, turn up on Monday at 5:00 PM and I does it change? Does it change the second it's name? Generally a network. So if this is the right type of network, right, it's cool kind of diverse group of people who had all sorts of different motivations and everything else. Once it's sort of named, does that change the way a network has to operate? Cause I sent, that's what the discussion is about right now, although not, not. I think fundamentally that the critical thing is when something ceases to be secret. I tell the story of the Illuminati, a network in the late 18th century in Germany that sought to advance a radical version of the enlightenment but covertly as a secret organization.

Speaker 2:          14:37          Uh, the intellectual dark web, um, I semi seriously said was secrets until Barry wrote that and now that it's out in the, in the open, what will happen is that it will grow because people are Andrew Sullivan. I was discussing with him to a said, hmm, why am I [inaudible]? And of course the answer is, but you should be ready. I mean, anybody who, who is engaged in critical thinking about the whole range of ideas, uh, in our society ranging from the political to the social and cultural, anybody who is in the debate and is antagonistic to the dogmas of the left, uh, the political correctness, the identity politics, the spurious pursuit of so called social justice. If you are skeptical, if you are thinking critically about the dogmas of the left, then you belong in the intellectual dark web because you're the kind of person who at some point will be no platformed, who at some point will be taken down.

Speaker 2:          15:39          Who at some point will be the target of a hit piece in the New York Times. One of the characteristic features of the intellectual dark whereby think is that most members at one time or another have fallen foul of the leftist thought police. And as soon as you've had that experience, it's happened to me a number of times. That is quite transformative. Yeah, I mean it literally changed my life. It's the only reason you're sitting here right now. I was once one of them and, and I suspect that your experience was like mine. You're kind of taken aback to be on the receiving end of a social media mob. You're kind of taken aback to be attacked, not for the substance of anything that you've argued or written or said. You're attacked for your reputation, you're attacked for your alleged bad faith. And each time this has happened to me, I've, I've been a little stunned.

Speaker 2:          16:36          I was naive. Not only was I a believer in meritocracy, I was also a believer that we were engaged in irrational debate about the past. That's what historians do. Uh, and that one made ones case presented the evidence. And then the other side did the same. But I wrote a book, a book about the British Empire. Now what, 15 or so years ago, an argument, their argument of that book was that not everything about the British empire was bad than there are benefits as well as costs to imperialism. And I never had a debate about that argument. I only ever was attacked by the left for being an apologist of empire, a neocolonialist, et cetera. Uh, and so in that curious debate that that is central to the cultural war, you never really are engaged with on the ideas or the evidence. It is always about whether you have bad faith or not, whether you are covertly racist and Islamophobe, uh, our homophobe that there's a long list of things that you can be accused of.

Speaker 2:          17:48          But those are the most popular ones. Ones never really discussing the arguments of the books. One's always discussing the personality of the author. Yeah. So this is just sort of simply put the ideas verse people conversation. Right. So in a, in a case of a violin, I mean, to live through the things that she has lived through between FTM and her and her and her friend being murdered and the whole thing, uh, to be called the things that she's called. I mean, it flips you're very personhood on its head, which is, I mean, it's, it's so deeply twisted. The episode for me brought it into bold relief was the Brandeis, uh, honorary degree fiasco when ion was invited by the president of Brandeis. And this was in 2014. Yeah. Except an honorary degree in speak at commencement. And then, uh, was very publicly and humiliatingly disinvited under pressure from an unholy alliance as far as I could see of leftists and Islamists who set out online to smear her reputation with the usual confection of selective quotation and, and misrepresentation.

Speaker 2:          19:00          And as often happens in these situations, the university authorities capitulate without a fight, uh, to the left and, and they do it publicly. And that that for me was, uh, that was a moment when I learned a lot about what was going wrong in American academic life and realize that it's, it's the combination of, of aggressive activists on the left, um, and useful idiots in, in university bureaucracies [inaudible] fold. Is it that they're useful idiots or is it just, is it just sort of blanket cowardice by, I'm part of some of the academics, but really the, the administrators and the upper brass at all the schools and the fact that the donors, although this is changing right now and as we're taping this today, I know it's going to be out in a couple of days. Um, evergreen is now firing a whole bunch of professors, which is exactly whatever what all of us predicted, basically because the donors have just had enough.

Speaker 2:          19:57          It's fascinating. So it's hard to figure out where does it come? Just cowardice. Cowardice is the most powerful force in human history, no doubt. And I'm constantly amazed at just how much cowardice is out there. Uh, my wife's experience has shown me that the, the, the, the difficulty of getting people publicly to support her work against Islamic extremism is all about cowardice, fear of being in any way drawn into, into the, the real war, the Jihad, uh, facing the death threats that she has repeatedly had to face. But it's not just cowardice. Uh, there is a good deal of complicity. Many university administrators are themselves ideologically on the left and feel that they have a mission to empower, uh, the, the leftists in the student body. Uh, and this, I think a different thing from, from Canada. So yeah, I think, I think this is a fascinating moment in time because donors, alumni look at what is going on, uh, on university campuses, as do people who have not had the privilege of university education, who see it all as complete madness and ask the question, what the hell is going on here?

Speaker 2:          21:12          And I think the more that question gets asked, the better. But we should not underestimate the massive inertia in the system. It is extremely hard. Even if you're a university president, you say, right, I'm going to clean house. It's really hard to do because they're all tenured. I mean, the faculty is tenured, it's everywhere. You know what I mean? Like we don't find, oh well, you know, in the northeast it's a little bit better than, you know, just even geographically, we just don't even see that. Yes, there are bastions of freedom. I've heard University of Chicago or you know, like a couple of places are a little bit better, but how do you think it actually spread that way? That it wasn't just here and there and there's a theory that universities are always left wing, but that's not true of, for example, if you had been in Germany in the 1920s, uh, the universities were bastions of conservatism, uh, an extreme and indeed extreme right wing nationalism, which is one reason that universities very quickly went over to the Nazi regime when Hitler came to power.

Speaker 2:          22:08          So there's no golden rule that says universities have to be left wing Oxford and Cambridge, ah, in the 18th century works extraordinary reactionary, uh, fundamentally religious institutions and deeply Tory with a few exceptions in there in the politics. So there's no rule rule here. Uh, I think the best explanation I can offer you is a process of generational capture of education institutions dating from the 1960s universities in let's take the elite universities, the Ivy League universities in the 1950s. We're already seen as being liberal. Um, and if you were a kind of McCarthy leaning Republican, you already knew that Harvard was likely full of fellow travelers, um, and a covert commies. But the real shift I think came later. I think it came with the antiwar protests of the late sixties and early seventies. The more radical baby boomers who were protesting in the campuses and 68 s into the early seventies, uh, grew up to become professors nested around.

Speaker 2:          23:18          Uh, and I think that generation, which was essentially formed at the time of the antiwar protests, successfully replicated itself. They were very, very good at replicating themselves by creating graduate students in their own image and then making sure that those graduates, students got jobs and the right was nowhere. So you are, you are out there writing books, doing research and figuring, well, all right, they're doing that. And maybe in the long run on my heroes at Oxford and Cambridge who, who wrote great books and we're also politically active people like Norman stone or Roger Scruton who did much of the thinking that uh, that accompanied that tourism in the 1980s. What they did not do well was academic politics. They were poor at that. Uh, they were poor at succession planning. And that is, I think the best explanation I can offer for the fact that in nearly all universities in North America and in Europe, 90% plus of faculty members are Liberals or progressives if not outright Marxists.

Speaker 2:          24:26          All right. So with some of the historical context of how this all happened, I know you are enthused about this new network idea and because it's come around the right way, do you think there's a gatekeeping responsibility for whoever is involved in this? This seems to be one of the hot button issues with this thing are who can be in this whatever it is. What are the ideas that cannot be on the inside? Uh, I see it coming much more than that. We have to watch out for ideas on the right than on the left. That seems to be the way it's being framed, at least from where I sit. Um, how would you do that in a, in a proper network monitoring out two kinds of, of of networks, open access networks. Let's take the example of Facebook where you can just join up and open a Facebook account.

Speaker 2:          25:12          You can even do it as a fake human being. Um, and then there are the restricted access networks, uh, extreme cases. The secret societies of, uh, of the 18th and 19th century don't really have many analogs today cause it's hard to do anything secret in secrecy, barely exists any, any more in the age of, of wikileaks. So you have to I think decide whether to be an open or closed or restricted access network and the minute you are restricted access network, somebody is making the decisions about who joins that then ends up being the, the membership committee and then you were just a club. Really. I don't think that's an option in, in our time. I think an open access networks, the only real way to go, um, and you must accept that if the, uh, if the intellectual dot Webb is, is real, that it's an open access network that won't necessarily connect you to everybody that you want to be connected to and may connect you to people that you positively don't want to be connected to.

Speaker 2:          26:15          This has been a central problem I think of, uh, being on the political right for a long time. I can remember in the 1980s when people said to me, well, Neil, you're a conservative. And I would say, well, I'm actually not a member of the Conservative Party. I think of myself as a classical liberal. They would say, oh, but nevertheless, when I look at all the things you say, you're a conservative. And then I would think, what does that mean? That I have to have dinner with the likes of, I would think of various egregious conservative members of parliament. Um, and it was as if you would be associated with those people even if you never had dinner with them. And it's the same problem now except that it's, it's, it's worse now because the way in which the left seeks to discredit it, uh, you and Jordan Peterson and probably me as well at another number,

Speaker 3:          27:06          your show is to say scared man. I mean 15 blinds say, look at the People Paul,

Speaker 2:          27:12          who are connected to these people who quote these people or who read their books, um, that there they are over there, but terrible alt right. And you know, when you say, all right, the, the audience is supposed to start booing and hissing and you know, Steve Bannon is supposed to appear in a black robe with the Saife, you know, I am deaf. So I think that the problem is I think in escapable there will be a constant effort on the left to say that uh, the intellectual dark web is just some kind of a facade in front of an, a hideous outright, which is composed of remember racists Islamophobes homophobes. Um, and that will be the culture wars next. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          27:58          I mean that was straight works. We have a strange amount of gay people and Muslim people and yeah, absolutely. But there you go. Otherwise Brown people in every other type of thing is self, the self hating phenomenon. The left is low, long

Speaker 2:          28:11          known. How to say that it is absolutely typical of the wicked, right? That they should have lewd into that to the side, uh, self hating and then you just fill in the blank. Self hating Muslims, self hating gays. That's how this works. You remember they lost all the arguments. All they've got left is reputational smearing man. We've got to fight in front of us. Huh. You know, I, I have lost sleep about this. Not only because people threatened my wife's life. That's the real war that the war against the Islamic extremists is no, is no mere culture wards and actual war. I've also lost sleep about the Maya culture war at the prospect of, of the reputational attacks. It's, it's never pleasant to be attacked as I was recently, uh, in effect for being a, I guess a sexist, racist or a racist sexist, because I'd organize a conference at which all the speakers, uh, where white men, because the women I invited couldn't come.

Speaker 2:          29:24          And, uh, that was a private conference, wasn't supposed to. It wasn't even as a kind of informal discussion about how we could take the idea of applied history and make history more relevant to some of the debates that go on. I think a lot of what has done in academic history these days is not really relevant to anything terribly much, but this event was a rather crudely exposed in the New York Times and the Washington Post, uh, the pictures of the speakers were published as if the mugshots as it appeared in the New York Times. And the implication was that I must be a terrible racist, sexist, or sexist racist for having organized such a conference. I did lose sleep about that. Uh, and I, I think that part of the culture war is really, is really odious because it is, it is calculated to discredit the targeted individuals. And it is, it's bad faith on the part of the people who launched those attacks.

Speaker 3:          30:33          So what, in my view, what's happening with some of those gated institutions when the newspapers that used to be objective, you know, look, Barry wrote this piece in the New York Times that I think was a pretty fair piece. It was even somewhat critical of me, and I'm not above criticism, so I'm certainly okay with that. But then just a week later, we see this awful piece about Jordan and enforced monogamy and it's just nonsense. I mean, it's just nonsense. And you know, I'm on tour with him right now and he keeps explaining why that's course he doesn't want anyone to be forced to do anything and all that. He's talking about marriage in effect. Um, and, and Eric Weinstein, our friend found two other references in the history of the New York Times where they talked about enforcement argument and they were both positive relative to progressive ideals. So it's like they flip everything on its head. But what do you think happened there? I mean, you're giving me a pretty good layout of what's happened at the academic side, but on the media side and those, those gates, what is going on?

Speaker 2:          31:27          I spent a lot of my life doing journalism because, um, I didn't have, uh, any, uh, inherited money. And being an academic in Britain in the 1980s and nineties wasn't terribly lucrative. So I kept body and soul together. Even from my graduate years writing for newspapers and newspapers have had their own transformation in the course of my adult life. Uh, and part of that sister economics, as we all know, the business model, which essentially revolved around advertising has been an isolated by the combination of Google and Facebook. And these institutions are in some measure in in desperation trying to reinvent themselves for the Internet age and everybody's in pursuit of clickbait, even the gray lady, even the most illustrious of, of newspapers. And I think that's one explanation. The other explanation is that an institution like the New York Times has its own university, like character behaves a little bit like university, but the most self important newspapers if you go to them are rather like colleges.

Speaker 2:          32:36          And it's also true of the Financial Times, which is that like a kind of Cambridge college that sort of ended up by mistake in London. And so they have some of the same dynamics as, as universities. And I think that's especially true of the New York Times is also true of the BBC incidentally. So institutions like the times and the BBC, uh, think of themselves as being liberal bastions. But for them, liberalism is truth. Uh, it's the same problem at Harvard has, if you've, if your motto is Veritas, but you translate that into liberalism, then by definition conservatives and must be untruth. And so I think there's a tendency and it's there and in the New York Times periodically to lash out against anyone like Jordan Peterson who dissents from liberal orthodoxy. Remember, part of what we're dealing here with is a kind of quasar religious phenomenon. The dogmas of the left have become more and more religious in their quality as they have been unmuted from that fundamental economic rationality, which was at the heart of Marxism, when that all went down in flames in 1989, the left decamped to the realm of culture.

Speaker 2:          33:49          And as it did that increasingly to con the form of a cult. And let me illustrate what I mean. Cults define themselves partly by a belief in a lot of things that are slightly weird. In order to be in a cult, you have to have some weird beliefs. And one good example of a weird belief is that sexuality is entirely constructed socially and is not biologically rooted and you can actually have any gender you like and there are actually multiple genders. Now that's absurd, but to believe it has become a kind of tests of your orthodoxy and on one sees this at meetings are in academia in which people introduce themselves by name and by their preferred pronouns. Now, when this first happened to me, my immediate reaction was introduced myself and say that my preferred pronouns were it. I restrain myself because I realized that my sense of humor forged as it was in Scotland in the 1970s is now almost entirely politically incorrect.

Speaker 2:          34:51          And anything that I consider funny, we'll get me into trouble. But that has gone on in the media too. And the other thing that's happened is that the polarization which characterizes a network society is now very visibly there in the realm of newspapers and and cable television. One thing that we all got wrong about the internet because we hadn't really thought much about network science was that we just assumed that if everybody was connected, everything would be awesome. And that was the kind of mantra of Silicon Valley for about 20 years. But no network science tells you that if you build a social network, even quite a small one, there will be something called homophily because birds of a feather flock together on bet you already that the intellectual dark web has two clusters that are somewhat separate from one another. I sent it happening right now immediately and that's what happened in the media. So as society became more polarized politically, so too did the media, I think that's an, that is one of the defining characteristics of our age that the polarization or if you like self segregation that we see online is translated into almost every realm of life. Can there be any positives out of that, out of that self selection

Speaker 3:          36:07          into finding groups that you're more in common with that for at least for a certain period of time? There's some goodness there because you can really sort of get into your ideas enough to maybe leave the group then and take those ideas out.

Speaker 2:          36:20          I think if you are in what ever you want to call it, the echo chamber or the filter bubble, if you are in a cluster that cuts you off from a contrary ideas you're lost. Yeah. What was fun about being in a network of right leaning undergraduates in early 1980s Oxford was we're in constant combat with the left-leaning Marxist. There was still real Marxist is then and we were far from cutoff, constantly engaging with them and the soggies Social Democrats in in the middle and that was what made it interesting. What I see happening in the networked age is that people can retreat into a realm of confirmation bias where they hear only things that are similar to the things they liked yesterday and the algorithms are the key here where you are, whether it's youtube or on Facebook or on Twitter, you are essentially going to be fed more of what you already liked.

Speaker 2:          37:20          That's deeply intellectually unhealthy. Just as a university cannot be a university. If everybody agrees about first ideological principles because how can you have critical thinking in that environment? So it's unhealthy for any intellectual network to be Autarkic. So the one thing the intellectual dark web must not do is cut itself off from other networks, including the ones that hate us. I mean, we have to be in an argument and we have to have our minds constantly open to the possibility that we're wrong about some things. And that's what I see more or less disappearing from public life. I recognize this at one time, uh, when I was in, in, in mortal combat with Paul Krugman, the economist, uh, turn journalists and realize that Koopman could never admit that he'd ever been wrong. And even when it was obvious that he had been, because he is part of this rezone, Dettra was always being right about everything. Did you have

Speaker 3:          38:17          to see the day that the article came out, the original intellectual dark web article by Barry? The day that that came out that Paul Krugman tweeted it and he tweeted this thing about how we're also oppressed, you know, just mocking everybody basically. And then a bunch of us responded to them and I of course, retweeted it and invited him on the show. I said, I'd be happy to discuss this, you, and it gets a couple of thousand retweets, but of course, no response. Right. And that you're right. That's what we have to make sure we don't become. But I think there's a, uh, there's a human trait that would sort of make you want to retreat because it's exhausting it having your motives attack than your humanity attacked and lies and smears and all the things that I don't see anyone on this side doing. I don't, and that's an so it's an exhausting fight because we're fading to different battles. Yes. I'm supposedly the same point. And they're symmetrical war. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          39:08          The moment in the sense that we haven't recognized that in the culture war. The only thing that works is reputational destruction. I think we, we are guaranteed sleepless nights. Remember, there's also the phenomenon of guilty until proven innocent, which is insidious and means that if the reputational hit is bad enough, uh, there may be no, uh, there may be no recovery from it. I was very struck by the speed with which reputations were destroyed. Uh, in the, the me two movements, uh, most, uh, very indolent phase. Uh, and a characteristic feature of the process seemed to be that that men were essentially guilty until proven innocent and crimes were conflated with, uh, quite clearly non criminal behavior in ways that were deeply troubling. Uh, to my eyes, the false accusation is of course the, the ultimate nightmare of anybody in this world at this time.

Speaker 2:          40:12          Because if you're falsely accused, uh, well, your reputation can be gone in 24 hours and that that has entered, introduced into our lives something that hasn't really existed since medieval times. Uh, the feeling that we are at the mercy of a wheel of fortune that can arbitrarily turn against us and dashes are over Turner's. I think this makes the culture war, uh, uh, deeply troubling thing to be a part of. And Mo, most sensible, normal people say, God, I want a quiet life. Get me out of here. Uh, and never involve me in any of this. Get me off Twitter. Get me off Facebook. Never let my name appear in the New York Times. Never let me appear on a, on a show like this because it's just too dangerous. Uh, I own need to say one thing that can be taken out of context and represented as heresy or hate speech as heresy is now called, cause that's what we now call heresy. And I will be subjected to potentially a weeks of vilification and maybe worse, maybe the vilification will actually lead me to lose my job at people are right to be fearful of that.
