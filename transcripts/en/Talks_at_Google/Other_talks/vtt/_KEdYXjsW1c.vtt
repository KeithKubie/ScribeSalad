00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:03.890
MALE SPEAKER: So thank
you all for coming,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.150
especially given that we're
on the far ends of campus

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.414
and that it kind of
pretended to rain today.

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.830
I'm here to introduce
Kevin Blake.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.520
I'll talk for 10 seconds.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.600
I first saw Kevin
perform in San Francisco

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.244
and was absolutely
blown away and thought

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:19.410
he needed to come to Google.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.530
So, without anything
more, Kevin Blake.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:25.205
KEVIN BLAKE: Hello, everyone.

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:27.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.019
As he said, my name
is Kevin Blake.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.560
My real name is
Kevin Blake Ferguson,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.270
but my stage name is Kevin
Blake, so do not mess it up.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.650
Call me Kevin Ferguson
off the stage.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.520
When I go out there
we can chat later.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.811
You can call me Kevin Ferguson.

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.270
Now it's Kevin Blake.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.343
And as he said, I do
magic up in San Francisco.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:47.040
My stage show, I perform
once or twice a month.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.360
You guys should
all come as well.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.350
But I'm a magician.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.554
I'm also a storyteller
and a performer.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.720
When people ask what I do,
I usually refer to myself

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.540
as a performer, which
is admittedly almost as

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.690
vapid in use as a
descriptor as consultant

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.890
is in the business world.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.209
But it still seems
better than "magician."

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.310
Now I don't like "magician"
for two reasons--

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.140
although you can still call
me it-- for two reasons.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.200
One, I don't consider
myself to be very creepy;

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.930
and two, I don't do
the types of magic

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.280
that you probably think of
when you think of a magician.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.020
For example, I don't
do bunnies out of hats.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.020
And at no point during
the next 45 minutes

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679
or so will any cards
or women be vanished,

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.970
produced, transformed,
restored, teleported, levitated,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.553
or penetrated.

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:27.350
It's very important; there
will be no penetration on stage

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.250
today.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.986
I promise you.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:33.130
I am a magician, but
I want to show you

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.620
guys some-- I want to talk
to you guys about some very

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.420
interesting things that
I like about magic today.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.440
Now, the topic of
today's talk is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.732
"Creating Magical Experiences."

00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:45.106
I don't know if
there's something

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:46.340
different on the email list.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.060
But don't concern
yourself with that.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.050
How many people in the
audience tonight are engineers?

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.550
Engineers?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.180
Yeah?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.360
We have-- designers?

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.431
Any designers?

00:01:58.431 --> 00:01:58.930
Yeah?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.380
One, two.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.070
Marketers?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.070
Yeah?

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.040
You guys are all people who
create experiences for others.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.789
And this is the same thing
that I do as a performer.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580
And I'd like to talk
to you guys about what

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.500
I've learned over the
past year of becoming

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.360
a professional
magician, about how

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.520
to create not just experiences,
but create magical experiences,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670
something that I think
you guys-- probably

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.680
very relevant to
you guys at Google.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.419
Now before I get into the
magical experiences part,

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.460
I want to talk to you guys
a little bit about-- I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.610
want to answer the
question of how--

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.180
probably the second question
I get asked most often,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.700
not how do you do it, but how
did you become a magician?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.250
Now every magician you ask
will have a different story.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.560
And mine begins with
me, nine years old,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.340
laying on my family's
living room floor,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.230
watching "Star
Wars" with my dad.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.415
Now everyone here, I'm sure,
hopefully everyone here

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.040
has seen "Star Wars"--
fantastic movie.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.860
And at nine years old, this was
the best movie I had ever seen.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.059
Immediately, for the next
weeks after I thought

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.850
to myself, how can I
not become a magician,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.490
but how do I become a Jedi?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.980
I'm sure many of you guys
can empathize with that.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.420
How do I become a Jedi?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.300
It affected me so
strongly that I believed

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.160
that the force was
real after this.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.310
I knew that it was obviously
exaggerated in "Star Wars"--

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.890
like I knew you
couldn't actually

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.530
lift a sinking x
wing out of a swamp.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.850
But I knew that
there were people

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.890
on this earth who had the
ability to bend matter,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.060
to manipulate matter with
their mind-- mind over matter.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.000
And so after that, I decided
I had to do this myself.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.490
I started thinking-- I imagined,
like, ancient Indian shamans

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.980
across the world who would
spend all their concentration

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.030
busking on street
corners, focusing

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.780
all their concentration
on lifting a penny

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.382
off a table, just
like a couple inches.

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:55.840
I knew that this
was possible and I

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.617
had to figure out how it
was done at nine years old.

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:01.450
I even went so far as
to go into the library

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.230
and find some books on
telekinesis, which is obviously

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.335
the ability to bend
matter with your mind.

00:04:07.335 --> 00:04:09.100
I was a little bit
of an odd child.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.534
And ultimately, I failed.

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:14.700
I failed, which was a shame.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.709
But I didn't stop believing.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.649
A few months later,
my parents brought me

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.740
and my sisters to Disneyland
for magical adventures.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.190
And I don't know
if you guys know,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.400
but you walk into Disneyland
and right on the right

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.667
there is the magic shop.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.500
People have been to
this magic shop, I hope?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.930
I've been to the magic shop.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.490
And that day when we went
to Disneyland, my parents

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.600
brought us in, and you would
not believe the magic trick

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.650
that they showed us.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.440
No, they did not
levitate a penny.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.950
But they levitated--
this magician

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.380
in here levitated something
even better-- 100 times better,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.690
in fact-- my dad's dollar bill.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.300
The magician asked my father
to borrow a dollar bill.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.270
My dad graciously lent
him a dollar bill.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.160
And amazingly, the magician
took the dollar bill

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.300
and folded it right in half,
right in front of my eyes,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.950
like this.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.820
He just folded it right
in half, like that.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.667
And then he just placed it
into the air, like that.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:16.250
I was shocked.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.990
He asked me to grab it.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.939
So I snatched it out of
the air, opened it up.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:19.980
There was nothing inside.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.230
There was nothing in the
guy's hand and I was shocked.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.010
I was, like, what?

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.360
Immediately, my mind went
back-- my nine-year-old mind

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.722
went back to "Star
Wars," the force, Jedis,

00:05:28.722 --> 00:05:30.430
the Indian shamans on
the street corners.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.710
And I thought, here, right
in front of me, here's

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.480
a man who has learned this
most impossible mental feat

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.410
of concentration and will.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.530
And not only that, but
he was willing to sell it

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.350
to me for $14.99.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.290
I had to have it.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.050
So over the next two
days at Disneyland,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.530
I convinced my parents
to buy me this secret.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.090
And we went back at the end
of the trip to Disneyland.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.400
And I handed the man the $15.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.900
And he went back
behind the counter

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.980
to get what I imagined to be an
ancient, dusty manuscript with,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.010
like, scribbled incantations,
like secret meditative scripts

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.090
on how you can control
matter with your mind.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.750
And I was little
disappointed, to be honest,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.800
to find a small,
folded piece of paper,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.120
a little pamphlet
with staples in it

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.010
and a little plastic baggie
with a small amount of very

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.950
fine black thread.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.760
My heart sank.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.785
But it taught me a
very important lesson,

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:35.400
an important lesson
about secrets

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.280
and how the secret will never be
as valuable as the experience.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.110
With that, I want
to give you guys

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.520
a magical experience
better than the dollar.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.306
It's not really my forte.

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.430
But I'd like to give you
guys a magical experience.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.450
Are we ready?

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.950
Yes?

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.450
OK.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.220
So now, I asked earlier if-- I
was wondering just on myself,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.454
by myself, like is it illegal to
have an iPhone on this campus?

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:03.870
I see people with
Apple computers.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.260
Is it against the rules?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.130
Because-- oh wow, OK.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.760
Can we just-- just
for my curiosity,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.330
how people are Android users?

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.190
Wow.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.810
That is amazing.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.860
How many people
are iPhone users?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.050
Wow, OK.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.670
Windows 7?

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:22.380
No?

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.880
No?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.280
Me either.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.170
Now I'm doing--
yeah, back there?

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.370
We have one Windows 7 user.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.140
I don't believe it.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.230
So my performance
is based strongly

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.480
on audience participation.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.280
And I want to begin right
now with an exercise

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.390
in non-randomness, an
exercise in non-randomness.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.130
So would you mind-- wait,
was it you who had--

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.975
can I borrow your iPhone?

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.100
Oh, you who had the iPhone?

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.010
Sure.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.130
Let's see here.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.975
So I'm not going to
guess your passcode.

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:51.850
What's your passcode?

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.585
AUDIENCE: 1200.

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:55.792
KEVIN BLAKE: OK.

00:07:55.792 --> 00:07:57.250
Easy as that, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.140
Easy as that.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.620
Now I'm going to get
to the calculator app.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.370
My favorite thing about
the calculator app

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.169
is that you can still use
it to write boobs with.

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:10.710
I don't know.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.000
That doesn't hit
often because, like--

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.510
or it hits in different crowds.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.495
We got a spattering of
laughter on that one.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.620
I don't know if you, like,
some of the older people

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.720
used slide rules or something
in their math class.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.511
I'm not quite sure.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.730
Let's see here.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.780
Boobs.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.500
OK?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.364
Nice.

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:31.530
Now I'm going to clear that.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.970
So let's see here.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.690
I want to talk to you guys
about-- so first of all,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.169
I want you guys all
to get in your mind

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.010
a specific two
digits-- any two digits

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.861
that are somewhere in your life.

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:47.360
All right?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.440
So that could be inside
of your passcode,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.692
1200, or somewhere in your phone
number, your social security

00:08:54.692 --> 00:08:56.150
number, your parents'
phone number.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.200
So I want all of you guys to go
ahead and think of that right

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.680
now.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.580
Go ahead and think
of that right now.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.570
Just take a moment.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.590
Sure.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.510
All right.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.400
So we'll go ahead
and clear that.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.430
Now let's see.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:17.080
So what are-- let's see
here-- your two digits?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.650
9 7.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.190
OK, cool.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.070
Now you have two digits?

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.570
I don't want you
to tell me them.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.694
All I want you to do is
type in Multiply, and then

00:09:30.694 --> 00:09:31.360
your two digits.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.776
So go ahead and
do that right now.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.430
Don't press Equal.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.980
OK, now I want you
to do the same thing.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.000
Don't say anything.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.910
Just type in Multiply, and then
your two digits and nothing

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.410
after.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.375
Cool.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.240
So that's three.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.870
We're going to do two more.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.850
Let's get back here.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.870
So hit Multiply then
hit your two digits.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.370
Awesome.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.547
One more.

00:09:59.547 --> 00:10:01.130
And so we have five
two-digit numbers.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.879
I don't know who here
is like a math whiz.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:07.200
But this should be somewhere
in the millions, hopefully.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.370
Let's go, how about you.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.970
So what I want you to do is
grab it, hit Multiply, your two

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.450
digits, and then
just press Equal.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.440
And what do we have?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.004
Got a big number?

00:10:17.004 --> 00:10:19.170
I want you to go ahead and
read that out loud to me.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.730
And I'm going to
write that down here.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.490
AUDIENCE: 318 million.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.150
KEVIN BLAKE: Hold on a second.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.810
what is it?

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.674
AUDIENCE: 318 million--

00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:31.651
KEVIN BLAKE: 318 million--

00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:35.088
AUDIENCE: 8,000-- 816.

00:10:35.088 --> 00:10:36.630
KEVIN BLAKE: 8,000?

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.540
So 0--

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.720
AUDIENCE: 008, and then 816.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.090
KEVIN BLAKE: 816.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.640
Great handwriting, I know.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.067
So this is-- can you just
confirm that's the number, yes?

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:54.650
Can you go ahead and
do a screen shot?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.190
You know how to do
that on the iPhone?

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.290
Did it work?

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.230
Cool.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.230
Now I'm just going to
leave that right now.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:02.920
Can I grab this back from you?

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.670
And you can go ahead
and hold onto that.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.690
Thanks so much for
helping me out with that.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.000
Now before I go
any further, I just

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.890
want to give this to someone.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.970
This is today's prediction.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.432
Inside this, before the
show, I wrote down something

00:11:17.432 --> 00:11:18.890
that I hope's going
to happen today

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.350
we're going to
see-- I don't know,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.339
but we're going to
see-- based on decisions

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:23.130
that you guys make.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.310
So would you go ahead and do
me a favor and just take this

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.790
and hold on to it, make
sure no one messes with it?

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.750
You're trustworthy?

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.260
We've never met before.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.810
I didn't tell you, like, switch
it with the other envelope?

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.310
No.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.180
OK.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.090
Now right now, I promised
you guys no card tricks

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.830
at the beginning.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.250
But what I want to do
right now is do something

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:49.340
even better-- a coin trick.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.140
Are we ready?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.640
Ta-da!

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.560
No.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.040
So I want to tell
you guys a story

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.710
about a coin, a man,
and a game of choices.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.110
All right, so I'm just going
to place this right here.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.595
So let's see here.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.870
Hmm, a man.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.370
You, sir.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.285
What's your name?

00:12:13.285 --> 00:12:14.221
RYAN: Ryan.

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:14.970
KEVIN BLAKE: Ryan.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.000
OK.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.590
Ryan.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.670
This is a story about Ryan.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.450
Yeah.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.606
Ryan was a man much like
every other man he knew,

00:12:25.606 --> 00:12:27.730
although he considered
himself far more interesting

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.090
and intelligent and
charming and witty

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.840
and attractive than
the other men he knew.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.890
But this fact was not the
point d continues not to be.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.450
Much like every other man he
knew-- how old are you, Ryan?

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.590
RYAN: 31.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.280
KEVIN BLAKE: Ryan was
concerned-- concerned

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.680
about a lot of things.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.810
Concerned about the
work he was going

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.750
to push off until next
week as a Google employee,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.048
as a-- what do you do?

00:12:50.048 --> 00:12:50.900
RYAN: Engineering.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.934
KEVIN BLAKE: As an engineering.

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:55.600
You have a specific
type of engineering?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.500
RYAN: Infrastructure.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.560
KEVIN BLAKE: Infrastructure.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.851
Do you work on secret projects?

00:12:58.851 --> 00:13:00.265
RYAN: Not that secret.

00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:02.510
KEVIN BLAKE: OK.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.705
As an infrastructure
engineer, he

00:13:05.705 --> 00:13:08.000
was concerned by his
troubling spending habits--

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.739
boozing three or
four nights a week,

00:13:09.739 --> 00:13:11.780
eating out constantly,
spending money frivolously

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.120
on things like
driverless vehicles,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.050
or whatever you guys spend
your money on over here.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.864
Most concern of all,
however, to Ryan

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.280
was the fact he
was having a story

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.300
told about him at this very
moment to a group of Googlers,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.890
and soon to be streamed
live over the internet.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.130
At this moment,
Ryan was concerned.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.360
He said, why did I not just tune
into the live stream, he said.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.795
RYAN: Why did I not just
tune into the live stream?

00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:44.630
KEVIN BLAKE: Did he have
to pick me, he went on.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.410
RYAN: Did he have to pick me?

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.785
KEVIN BLAKE: I
love wheelbarrows.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.440
RYAN: I love wheelbarrows.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.975
KEVIN BLAKE: Asparagus.

00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:54.205
RYAN: Asparagus.

00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:55.860
KEVIN BLAKE: Ryan
was an odd fellow.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.331
Give Ryan a big
round of applause

00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:58.455
as he joins me up on stage.

00:13:58.455 --> 00:14:02.452
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:05.160
KEVIN BLAKE: No, no, we're fine.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.736
So as Ryan went up onto the
stage and took his place,

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:11.610
he noticed something
peculiar in front of him

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.330
on the ground, a
glimmer of silver,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.320
a coin on the ground
a few feet away.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.200
He bent over and picked it up.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.530
He examined it.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.350
A half dollar.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.850
He gave it a flip
and listened to it

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.270
sing as it spun through the air.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.380
He brought it up to
his ear and shook it.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.570
What it was he was expecting
to hear, I cannot know.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.152
Ryan, I'd like to play a game
with you-- a game of choices.

00:14:33.152 --> 00:14:35.235
Do you think that you're
a fairly predictable type

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:37.041
of person?

00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:38.540
Fairly predictable
type personality?

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:38.890
RYAN: Yeah, sure.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.230
KEVIN BLAKE: Yeah?

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.440
Yeah?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:39.940
Good.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.000
You are aware, of
course, that as humans we

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.799
are pattern-seeking
creatures with brains

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.340
that have evolved
in order to analyze

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.780
our environments
for these patterns,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.320
in order to sift through
the incredible barrage

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.810
of information hitting our
senses every second we live.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.075
You know this?

00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:54.027
RYAN: I do that, yes.

00:14:54.027 --> 00:14:55.110
KEVIN BLAKE: Yes, exactly.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.730
So you know that as
humans, we are predictable.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.385
So you agree, you
are predictable.

00:14:59.385 --> 00:14:59.980
RYAN: I'm very predictable.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.730
KEVIN BLAKE: I'd like
to give you a chance

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.996
to prove yourself
right or wrong,

00:15:03.996 --> 00:15:05.370
depending on what
you want to do.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.060
So what I'm going
to do right now,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.210
what we're going to play
right here is a game.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.502
Can you step back a little bit?

00:15:09.502 --> 00:15:11.585
We're going to play a game
involving your choices.

00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:14.080
What I want you to do is place
the coin behind your back.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.650
Don't place it into either hand.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.310
Just hold it between
the two hands.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.575
In a moment, I'm going
to ask you to place it

00:15:18.575 --> 00:15:19.210
into one of your two hands.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.840
And I'm going to try and guess
which hand you place it in.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.750
If I do not correctly
guess five times in a row,

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.130
then you can win the dollar
bill that I floated earlier.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.940
So just saying, this we
got a lot running on this.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.240
So Ryan, right now I want
you to place the coin

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.500
into either of your two hands.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.764
Now you can place it
in your left hand.

00:15:43.764 --> 00:15:44.930
Audience, that's your right.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.460
Or the hand that's
left, your right hand.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.210
You following?

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:49.710
Great.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.256
Now Ryan, go ahead
and just place-- no.

00:15:52.256 --> 00:15:52.755
Face me.

00:15:52.755 --> 00:15:54.921
Place the two-- place it
into one of your two hands.

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:56.840
Bring them out.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.685
Excellent.

00:15:57.685 --> 00:15:58.880
Bring them out like this.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.610
Awesome.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.037
Now what I want you to do--
face the audience, actually.

00:16:02.037 --> 00:16:03.620
Now Ryan, I want you
to focus on which

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.949
hand you've placed the coin in.

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:05.990
Don't give anything away.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.948
But if you did exactly
what I wanted you to do,

00:16:07.948 --> 00:16:10.290
I think you would place
it in your right hand.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.430
Please open your hand
and show everyone

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.360
that's it's in your right hand.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.040
It is in your right hand.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.540
Excellent.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.980
So that's one out of one.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.450
Not very impressive.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.219
50-50 try.

00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:19.260
One more time I want you
to go ahead and place it

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:19.968
behind your back.

00:16:19.968 --> 00:16:21.580
And this time,
obviously, the question

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.480
is whether he should keep
in the same hand or switch.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.980
Right?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.870
If he keeps in the
same-- he knows

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.060
that only a fool would keep it
in the same losing hand twice.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:31.560
Of course.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.040
So obviously, the only thing
he can do is switch hands.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.526
But he knows that I know that
only a fool would keep it

00:16:35.526 --> 00:16:36.520
in the same hand twice.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.290
And so he should switch hands.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.290
So he knows that the only
thing he can do really

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.844
is to keep it in the same losing
hand a second time, right?

00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:43.260
But of course you
know that I know

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.230
that he knows that I know
that-- you follow, right?

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.130
So you've made your choice.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.630
Good.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.460
So bring your two
hands back around.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.222
Excellent.

00:16:52.222 --> 00:16:53.430
Spread them out a little bit.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.359
Now what I think
here is-- actually

00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:56.650
go ahead and face the audience.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.300
Audience, I want to
see if you guys can

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.910
tell the difference here.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.490
A little closer together.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.819
Now we have two--
go in the middle.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:08.092
So the question is
whether he keeps it

00:17:08.092 --> 00:17:10.260
in the same hand
or switches, right?

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.980
First one he kept it
in the right hand.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.200
So if he thinks that
he should switch it,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.229
you'd keep in your
left hand, right?

00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:17.770
I think that you
would have placed it

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:28.336
in your-- in your-- left hand.

00:17:28.336 --> 00:17:28.836
RYAN: Yep.

00:17:28.836 --> 00:17:29.790
KEVIN BLAKE: OK.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.220
So Two out of two.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.111
Not very impressive.

00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:33.277
That's only one out of four.

00:17:33.277 --> 00:17:34.651
But you can try
it one more time.

00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:35.693
We have three more tries.

00:17:35.693 --> 00:17:37.151
So this time, I'm
going to tell you

00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:38.580
exactly what I'm going to do.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.130
I'm going to tell you--
I'm telling you right now--

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:45.330
that next time I'm going
to choose your left hand.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.689
So just choose whatever
you want, left or right.

00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:48.730
It doesn't really matter.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:49.813
Just choose left to right.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.260
Can you come a little closer?

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.322
Are you ready?

00:17:57.322 --> 00:17:58.360
You've made your choice?

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.730
RYAN: I've made my choice.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.396
KEVIN BLAKE: OK.

00:18:00.396 --> 00:18:01.940
Bring them back around.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.900
Bring them to my face.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.400
Right there.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.235
You remember what I said, right?

00:18:09.235 --> 00:18:10.150
RYAN: Barely.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.512 --> 00:18:14.220
KEVIN BLAKE: I said
I was going to choose

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.390
your left hand, right?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.240
So now the question is,
what kind of person is Ryan?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.165
Is he the kind of person
who just goes along

00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:23.290
with the motion, just kind
of does what people say?

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.260
And we can kind of think
that he is, in fact,

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.676
that kind of person
considering he

00:18:26.676 --> 00:18:29.250
was so animated earlier
with saying "asparagus."

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.602
And yeah, I think you
would probably believe me

00:18:33.602 --> 00:18:35.060
that I would choose
your left hand.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.887
And, of course,
I'm not going to.

00:18:35.887 --> 00:18:36.640
I'm going to choose
your right hand.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640
So go ahead and open it.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.930
And that's three out of three.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.430
OK.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.870
So we have two more tries.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.960
Two more tries.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.060
So I'm not going to
say anything this time.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.979
Just choose whichever
hand you want.

00:18:46.979 --> 00:18:49.020
Audience, this is going
to be your responsibility

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.520
on this one.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.384
So I'm kind of getting
out of the picture.

00:18:51.384 --> 00:18:54.050
I'm hoping that you guys have an
intuitive understanding of what

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.030
he will choose.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.660
So try and get in sync
with Ryan real fast.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.010
So go ahead and choose.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.560
You've chosen?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.590
Bring your hands back around.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.310
Now audience, a
round of applause.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.700
Actually, let's just do this.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.210
Everyone on the count of
three, just shout out-- all

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.630
hopefully the same-- which
hand you think it is.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.257
So, one, two, three--

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:18.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.220
KEVIN BLAKE: Ooh, OK.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.130
So much stronger on left, right?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.790
So they think it's
in this hand, right?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.447
The question is, is it in
this hand or this hand?

00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:28.030
Let's do a little
bit different thing.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.570
Let's go, round of applause for.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.800
OK, so round of
applause for left hand.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.750
KEVIN BLAKE: Now, round of
applause for the right hand.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.061
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:43.061 --> 00:19:45.320
KEVIN BLAKE: That
sounded fairly equal.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.612
Yeah, I think so.

00:19:46.612 --> 00:19:48.820
That's more applause than
I've gotten all day so far,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.445
so that's good.

00:19:49.445 --> 00:19:50.170
Well done.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.400
And now I think, audience,
you got a split decision.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.090
So I'm just going to
be the vote on this.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.265
I think he chose his right hand.

00:19:58.265 --> 00:19:59.302
So go ahead and open it.

00:19:59.302 --> 00:20:00.510
And right hand one more time.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.280
So that's four in a row.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.247
Don't applaud.

00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:04.830
Don't applaud.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.800
Not impressive.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.680
One more.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.250
Thank you.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.502
Excellent.

00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:09.210
Boo is necessary.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.470
So one more try.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.550
This time, I won't
say anything again,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.880
just other than whichever one
you want-- right or left, left

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.420
or right.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.530
You can choose right
hand or the wrong hand.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.607
Whatever you want to do.

00:20:19.607 --> 00:20:23.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.810
You've made your choice.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.810
You've made your choice?

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.440
RYAN: Yes.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.300
KEVIN BLAKE: So once
again, bring them out.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.990
I'm trying to see through
his hands at this point.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.592
I think-- let's see.

00:20:36.592 --> 00:20:38.300
So what was the pattern
we've had so far?

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.350
We had right, left, left,
right, right, right, left, left.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.196
I don't-- wait.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.160
So I think you chose-- I think
I know what hand you chose.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.340
If I get it right, please
just hand me the coin

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.990
and re-take your seat
to thunderous applause,

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.520
all for you.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.770
And I'm just going to go
ahead and just take this back.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.500
I'm this confident.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.360
So I think it is in your--
once again, in your right hand.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.690
So go ahead and place it.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.870
And that's it, right hand.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.286
And give him a big round of
applause as he takes his seat.

00:21:14.286 --> 00:21:18.966
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:20.110
KEVIN BLAKE: OK.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.140
Thank you so much, Ryan,
for dealing with that.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.140
I appreciate that a lot.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.700
And thank you guys all so much
for enjoying that with me.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.570
So I love magic.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.940
Who here loves magic?

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.380
Who here loves magicians?

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.160
No?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.610
Yeah, me either.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.620
So magic recently has gotten a
lot more popular in the past 10

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.100
years or so, based off of
all these shows, TV specials,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.630
movies, and that kind of thing.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:58.695
But it's still a sad truth that
magic in general is filled with

00:21:58.695 --> 00:22:02.830
bad illusions, socially
awkward, look-at-what-I-can-do

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.790
performers, and
witless presentations.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.330
Magic in general
is a fantastic art,

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.102
but there are a lot
of problems in it.

00:22:14.102 --> 00:22:16.200
And I want to talk to
you about a few of those,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.660
but I also want
to talk about how

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.840
to create magical experiences.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.750
Now I don't blame people
for feeling somewhat

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.930
negative toward the art
of magic in general.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.760
Because often, it seems like
a lot of magical presentations

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.747
that people see do
one of two things.

00:22:30.747 --> 00:22:32.705
Either they're not
challenging intellectually--

00:22:32.705 --> 00:22:34.980
they insult you and
your intelligence

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.300
by pretending that you
don't know that there's

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.910
a string floating the
dollar, or the magician

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.039
gives you the impression
that he expects

00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:47.580
you to believe that
he actually holds

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.300
the powers that his
illusions are replicating.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.790
This kind of insults
your intellect,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.670
like you know that
he's not a wizard.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.870
This is clear.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.330
He's an illusionist.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.950
Either that, or
magic is presented

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.577
as a puzzle that pits the
audience against the magician

00:23:03.577 --> 00:23:05.160
in some sort of
twisted battle of wits

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.790
where if the magician
fools you, you lose.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:12.590
If he doesn't, then the
magic is ruined, right?

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.410
None of these are ideal.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.190
Now that being said,
I do believe strongly

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.870
that magic has the
potential to be

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:24.064
a very intellectual
and serious art form.

00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:25.730
And that's because
what magic ultimately

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.900
deals with is something
very, very powerful, and that

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.780
is the nature of
truth-- what is reality.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.560
What is our reality?

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.080
At any moment, at
any given time,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.530
the most important
basic belief you form

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.147
is what is real--
what is my reality.

00:23:44.147 --> 00:23:46.480
And it's from this belief
that we form all of our others

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.521
and if we make errors in
this judgment, obviously

00:23:48.521 --> 00:23:50.910
can have very dire consequences.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.767
When I'm walking into
Google across the street,

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.600
if I make an error in
my judgment of reality

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.970
and I don't see the car
coming, obviously bad things.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.020
If I err consistently in less
physically perilous ways,

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.192
mental ways, psychological
ways, I'm a schizophrenic.

00:24:08.192 --> 00:24:10.270
This "what is real"
is one of our most

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.050
central and
foundational beliefs.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.630
And it's always
humming along right

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.840
under our level of
conscious awareness.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.630
And I think it can be with
magic, a very profound thing.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.465
Profound, but not the point.

00:24:23.465 --> 00:24:25.090
The key to creating
magical experiences

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.350
is not to convince your audience
that they may or may not

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.430
be sane.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.980
The key to creating magical
experiences, I think, is this.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.620
So number one, we must
understand the assumptions

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.680
and expectations
of our audience.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.020
Pencils, please?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:46.220
Number two, we must break these
expectations and assumptions.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.720
And number three,
we must break them

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.330
in a way that brings people
joy and also makes them

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.680
question just what
is possible to have

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.690
happen in an experience.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.780
Now as much as we all
like to think of ourselves

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.090
as logical and rational
beings, we only

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:06.480
have to look so far as our
news headlines, even ourselves,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.400
when in anger or in love or
drunk or whatever, to realize

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.570
how wrong of an
assumption this is.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:17.940
No matter how much we like
to praise our rational side,

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.610
there's no arguing that we
are ruled by our emotions.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.190
We are ruled by our emotions.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.030
And it's important to--
well, and sometimes this

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.580
can be a very bad thing,
because sometimes we

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.900
find ourselves acting in ways
that we don't want to act,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.740
or not being able to do the
things that we want to do.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.480
For example, we all know
that it's important to floss

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.110
twice a day, that we
should eat healthy

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.590
and that we should exercise
and we should save money.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.810
And yet, how many of us
actually do these things?

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.522
I don't.

00:25:48.522 --> 00:25:49.480
I don't know about you.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.600
Maybe you guys are better
individuals than I.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.730
As we all are, as people who
create experiences for others,

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.430
it's vital to know
and understand

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.550
this gap between the logic
and the emotional side

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.720
and what is the
most strong pull?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.800
Obviously, emotion.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.730
Now also of course,
what's the best way

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.110
to engage with someone's
emotional side?

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.610
Now I, if you remember,
break expectations.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.360
Number two, right?

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.620
I think surprising people by
breaking their expectations is

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.430
the most powerful way to engage
with their emotional side.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:31.100
And this makes sense,
surprising is it breaks you out

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.580
of your day-to-day assumptions.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.220
Now of course,
surprise is powerful.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.370
But surprise in general is
not necessarily a good thing.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.080
If I ask, who likes
to be surprised,

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.130
it's like, very few
people like surprises.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.090
But that's because most the
time when you guys engage

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.930
with surprises it's
a negative thing.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.950
If my friend expects me to
pick him up from the airport

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.290
and I surprise him by not
picking him up at the airport,

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.550
this is not an
enjoyable experience.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.704
But if I, say, surprise him
by bringing him a sandwich

00:27:05.704 --> 00:27:07.370
because he'll be
hungry from his flight,

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.260
or bringing two of
his best friends

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.600
along to surprise-- like,
these are good experiences.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.630
So that being said,
obviously the surprises

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.910
that we embed in the experiences
we create need to be positive.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:23.280
Google Doodles is a
great example of this.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.550
Search is a very
neutral experience.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.800
You're trying to find someone.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.800
It's a road to where
you actually want to be.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.920
And yet you-- someone
in this campus, maybe

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.540
not you specifically--
has decided

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.170
that it would be a great
idea to inject a little joy

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.395
bomb in this experience.

00:27:39.395 --> 00:27:41.510
And it's wonderful.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.680
Now unfortunately,
people expect the doodle,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.000
so it's not so much
of a surprise anymore.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.330
But still, it is a great
example of something

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.270
that you can embed.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:57.150
Now as a magician whose
illusions depend on the choices

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.160
that people make, of course
I have to be aware of

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.910
and anticipate the
expectations and assumptions

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.740
that my audiences
will have when they

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.640
go into an experience
with myself.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.425
But that doesn't mean-- it's
no less important for anyone

00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:13.690
who creates
experiences to do this.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.960
You guys should all
actually probably be

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.142
much more aware of these
expectations and assumptions

00:28:19.142 --> 00:28:21.100
that your audiences will
have in the experience

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.870
that you create,
because the experiences

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.640
that you deliver-- mine start
when you walk into the theater

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.100
and when you walk out.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.160
Yours-- Google,
social media, Gmail,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.340
Maps-- all these things
are embedded in our lives

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.660
to the point where they
are part of who we are.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.760
Our phone buzzes, people are
getting phantom vibrations.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.945
Our phones are so
connected to us.

00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:44.320
So it's even more
important to be

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.840
aware of these expectations,
embed surprises, and embed joy,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.500
but not only that,
make you feel as

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.420
if you're living in the future.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.010
And i think this is one of the
things that Google is best at,

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.600
and other companies
in the tech world

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.390
are very good at, best at.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.620
For example, I can open
my phone, press a button,

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.245
and watch a car come pick me up
and know exactly how much it's

00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:06.786
going to cost and
how long it's going

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:08.560
to take to get to
my friend's house.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.530
This is, to the taxi hailing
era, a magical experience.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:18.670
I'd like to leave you guys with
just one of my favorite quotes

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.510
that I think is extremely
relevant for you guys.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.590
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.040
is indistinguishable
from magic."

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.620
This is Arthur C. Clarke--
"2001: A Space Odyssey" guy.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.390
And I think it's a great
pithy statement of what

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.510
it is that you guys
should be trying to do

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.740
and I think that
you guys are doing.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.420
So with that, thank you guys so
much for watching and enjoying

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.700
this with me.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.550
Yes, the envelope.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.140
Right.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.550
So in a moment, we're going
to get to the envelope.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.633
Thank you guys so much for
listening to that part.

00:29:48.633 --> 00:29:51.570
This is back to a little bit--
one final magical experience,

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.072
I hope.

00:29:52.072 --> 00:29:53.530
So in a moment I'm
going to ask you

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.460
to just go ahead
and have this mike.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.310
is this on?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.810
We'll see.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.030
So in a moment, I just want
you to stand up, please.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.400
Open it, and read out
what it is inside.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.840
And I'm hoping that it will
correspond with-- so just right

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.230
when I-- just go ahead and open
it and just read what's inside.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.119
I'm hoping that this is good.

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:20.910
I think it will be.

00:30:34.491 --> 00:30:34.990
Oh, boy.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.060
That's this fine.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.330
So thank you so much for coming.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.120
And I hope you guys
have a wonderful rest

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.779
of your Thursday.

00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:58.070
No, actually, hold on a second.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.885
I think we do.

00:30:58.885 --> 00:31:01.430
We can salvage this.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.180
So we have the numbers, right?

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.360
318,008,816?

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.390
So I wanted to
deliver to you guys

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.540
one last magical
experience and it's this.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.581
I'm going to transform
your experience right now.

00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:17.710
So this is the prediction.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.580
Today, Google.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.680
Who sees it?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.130
So that's 918-- Google.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.320
That's today and right now.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.080
So thank you guys
so much for coming.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.265
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:34.070
Thank you.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.870
You can go ahead
and sit back down.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.750
Thanks very much.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.121
So we are going to have a
Q&amp;A, if anyone has questions.

00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:42.120
We're going to have a
Q&amp;A. So feel free to stay.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.020
If you don't want to stay,
if you're sick of it,

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.519
you don't have any questions
and you don't want any answers,

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:48.170
get the hell out of here.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.060
But if not, please yeah.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.702
I should point out
quickly that this is not

00:31:53.702 --> 00:31:55.160
going to be a
traditional Q&amp;A. This

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.873
is not going to be
Q&amp;A. This is going

00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:59.970
to be Q&amp;AA, which is questions
and attempted answers.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.750
So I promise you, I'm not--
I'm going to try my best

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.660
but I won't reveal
any secrets to you.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.430
And I may not know any answers.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.300
So yeah, go ahead.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.140
AUDIENCE: This is a very simple
question, not a profound one.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.074
And I think you will have an A--

00:32:12.074 --> 00:32:13.770
KEVIN BLAKE: I hope so.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.170
AUDIENCE: --which
is, how old are you?

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.030
Why are you not very old?

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:22.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:24.550
KEVIN BLAKE: How old am I?

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.155
I'm 24.

00:32:25.155 --> 00:32:26.920
AUDIENCE: That's it?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.680
Then why don't you
have long hair,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.076
like magicians are
supposed to have long hair?

00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:33.450
KEVIN BLAKE:
Because I'm breaking

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:35.992
expectations and assumptions.

00:32:35.992 --> 00:32:37.700
Are magicians supposed
to have long hair?

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.280
AUDIENCE: And the cape too.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.310
KEVIN BLAKE: Oh, yes.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.220
So these are the
expectations and assumptions

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.510
I was talking about, right?

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.040
One of the reasons I don't
like to call myself a magician

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.456
is because people assume that
I'm going to have long hair,

00:32:48.456 --> 00:32:50.660
wear a cape, have a cane,
and a pet bunny rabbit,

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.652
which I'm working on.

00:32:52.652 --> 00:32:54.360
Is that your-- you
have another question?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.620
AUDIENCE: The follow-up
question is, how did you

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.880
get into this, what fascinates
you, and what keeps you here?

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.530
KEVIN BLAKE: Well,
what fascinates me

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.250
about-- I mean, I
hope to have answered

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.125
a few of those questions
in the presentation.

00:33:05.125 --> 00:33:10.020
But I suppose what fascinates
me about magic in large part

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.060
is the experience of what
is possible versus what

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:13.670
is impossible.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.380
I think it's a
really powerful thing

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.580
to be able to break
people's expectations

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.370
and to show them something and
have them jarred really quickly

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.667
out of their just kind
of neutral baseline

00:33:24.667 --> 00:33:25.500
level of experience.

00:33:28.015 --> 00:33:29.890
Another thing that
fascinates me about magic,

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.420
one of my favorite
parts about it,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.390
is how it makes people fools.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.370
I love more than anything else
being deceived by something

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.550
because it shows
me my ignorance.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.460
I think magic is
one of the best ways

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.890
to learn what it is about your
perceptions and your level

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.530
of attention that
are completely false.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.080
People can be fooled-- everyone.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.040
And that has implications
on so many spectrums,

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.469
from the skepticism spectrum
of God doesn't exist

00:34:00.469 --> 00:34:02.010
and religion and
alternative medicine

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.870
and stuff all the way to
just day-to-day things,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.689
not being aware of the
intentions of people

00:34:06.689 --> 00:34:08.730
you're hanging out with,
like that kind of stuff.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.380
So I think it does
have a lot of meaning

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.866
behind it and importance.

00:34:13.866 --> 00:34:15.949
AUDIENCE: I think one of
the points you brought up

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:21.810
was about the expectations
or the cool sign stuff.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.230
One of the kids' class I was
there and said, hey magic,

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.889
look.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.810
There's a device here which
I can press a few buttons,

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.340
talk to and see somebody
around the world.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.130
And people are like, "So what?"

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.400
The kids, basically,
they have-- they

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.000
don't think that I do magic.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.250
So that's a very
good point, like this

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.317
could have been actually the
grand magic 100 years ago

00:34:43.317 --> 00:34:44.400
if you had shown somebody.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.730
KEVIN BLAKE: Oh yeah.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.920
I mean, all the technology
that we live in right

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.469
now is completely
impossible, or just comes

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.179
so out of the realm
of imagination

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.260
of a human of 100 years ago.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.900
It is just mind
boggling what we can do.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.660
AUDIENCE: So what I find
fascinating is the small tricks

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.490
you do still fascinates people
versus they are completely

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:09.210
oblivious to the fact which
is, you are living under magic

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.330
which was not possible 100 years
ago or something like this--

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.460
fly around the world
and go somewhere and--

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.750
KEVIN BLAKE: I think one of
the challenges of magic right

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:23.340
now is trying to continue to
evolve alongside technology.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.480
Because a lot of
things-- and that's

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.710
one of the problems with
the magician assuming-- what

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.250
I said earlier-- like a
magician assuming that you know

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.860
or expecting you to believe
that he has magical powers.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.430
Like, it's insulting to watch a
magician perform and then feel

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.530
as though he wants you to
believe that he can levitate

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.770
something or to stick
a spike through a woman

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:48.312
or to have-- at this
age of technology

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:50.270
and advanced technology
and that kind of stuff,

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:52.430
we have a very large
understanding of what

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.580
is impossible and
what's possible.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.430
Now we all know you cannot
levitate something with

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.160
your mind.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.270
You can't do that.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.910
And so I think one
of the challenges is,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.520
and one of the
challenges that magic

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.080
a struggling with in large
part, in a lot of areas,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.050
is these magicians who
continue to perform

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.180
these rudimentary and
old-style-- impressive

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.680
when we didn't have such
an understanding of what

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.030
the world is like, but
not impressive anymore.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.020
Floating a little
ball on a handkerchief

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.040
like you know that
that can't work.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.870
So it doesn't impress anymore.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what
are the magicians

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.250
that you particularly admire
and aspire to be as good as?

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.590
KEVIN BLAKE: So one
magician I admire and aspire

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:41.080
to be as good as,
hopefully, is right here.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.144
David Gerard-- everyone,
David Gerard right here.

00:36:43.144 --> 00:36:44.435
Google magician extraordinaire.

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:47.286
DAVID GERARD: I have a badge.

00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:49.260
KEVIN BLAKE: David's
a fantastic magician.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.777
I saw him a few weeks
ago at the Magic Castle

00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:53.860
when he was performing
there with a friend of his.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.270
And he has a wonderful,
wonderful performance.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.120
So I recommend you
all go see his.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.110
In terms of famous
magicians, there's one--

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.040
In terms of famous
magicians, of course

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.300
we have very few that you
guys probably would know.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.200
A man who is a huge
inspiration to me

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.954
is a man named Darren Brown.

00:37:15.954 --> 00:37:18.370
Does anyone here know who
Darren Brown is, except for him?

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:18.660
Yeah?

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.400
We got a few?

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.750
Two?

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.700
So you'll know he's
amazing, is he not?

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.080
He is a Englishman,
a British guy

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.140
who does similar psychological
hypnotism, all sorts

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.950
of incredible presentations
that involve magic but are not

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:35.580
just magic.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.497
They go way beyond it.

00:37:36.497 --> 00:37:38.163
So I highly recommend
you check him out.

00:37:38.163 --> 00:37:38.830
He is awesome.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.150
And he definitely inspired me
and almost every other magician

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.816
that you'll run into these days.

00:37:45.816 --> 00:37:46.840
AUDIENCE: So sorry.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.810
I missed the first part.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:53.484
How early in your life
you started doing this?

00:37:53.484 --> 00:37:55.900
KEVIN BLAKE: I got into magic,
as I said, when I was nine.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.070
But I didn't actually
start doing magic

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.310
until I was maybe, like, 12.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:03.250
And then that my first
actual public performance

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.610
was in high school.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.100
My first full theater
show was in college.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.150
And so I am very new at
this in terms of stage time.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:17.370
I've only put on about, maybe,
30 shows, 30 full shows.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.192
And I hope to continue to
improve and to perform more.

00:38:21.192 --> 00:38:23.150
AUDIENCE: Talking about
manipulating audiences,

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.280
what is the most surprising
thing an audience has

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.125
done to you?

00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:30.810
KEVIN BLAKE:
Interesting question.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:36.970
Surprising thing an audience
has done to me-- well,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.110
I think probably
about two years ago, I

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.330
was performing a routine
that maybe some of you guys

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.913
have seen on, like, "America's
Got Talent" or something, where

00:38:44.913 --> 00:38:48.020
someone has a bunch
of-- a big spike

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.270
under either in paper bags
or like under styrofoam cups.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.060
And I was performing
this routine

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.540
and you smash the ones that
it's not in, obviously,

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.790
and with the one that
it's in unsmashed.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.060
So I was doing this
with a woman on stage

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.110
who was helping me out.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.160
And there's a safety
mechanism built

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.750
into the trick where hopefully
if it's about to go wrong,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.310
she will stop me.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:17.240
And the audience also will
hopefully scream and stuff.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.240
This didn't happen.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.530
There was no safety mechanism,
and I stabbed myself

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.529
in the hand with a nail.

00:39:22.529 --> 00:39:25.257
So that was-- but
continued the show.

00:39:25.257 --> 00:39:26.090
The show must go on.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.140
And what was worse is
that I had asked someone

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.400
in the audience who was
medically trained to help me

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:33.900
out.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.110
I had it first aid kit.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.509
I still got it right in
here, a first aid kit.

00:39:37.509 --> 00:39:39.300
I said, do you know
how to bandage someone?

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.800
Good.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.390
It's supposed to all be for
show, build the tension.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.200
No.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.110
She didn't know
how to bandage me.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.480
She lied about being
first aid trained,

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.860
and I was just like, help
me out with the bandage.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.821
And she says, I don't
know how to do it.

00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.320
And I was like, OK
I'll do it myself

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.278
and then continued the
show and kicked her out.

00:39:58.278 --> 00:40:03.120
So that was the show.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.880
Yeah, questions?

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.110
MALE SPEAKER: You
told that story

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.860
when I saw you and I
thought it was a joke

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.920
and I thought it was
part of the show.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.050
KEVIN BLAKE: It's very serious.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.610
Very serious.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:12.900
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
the one we did with the coin,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.810
if you've ever had
anyone while they

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:16.310
have their hands
behind their back--

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.630
KEVIN BLAKE: Win a dollar?

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.588
Put it in their pocket.

00:40:17.588 --> 00:40:19.336
AUDIENCE: Put it
in their pocket?

00:40:19.336 --> 00:40:20.086
KEVIN BLAKE: Yeah.

00:40:20.086 --> 00:40:22.400
Read your mind.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.140
Yes, this has happened.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.290
And hopefully, by
the way that they act

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.640
and the little smirk on
their face, you can guess.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.240
Often when I'm doing
this, I'll say,

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:33.700
you didn't put it in
your pocket did you?

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.800
And they'll say, oh, I did.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.716
And it's a win, right?

00:40:35.716 --> 00:40:37.480
But I didn't do that
this time because I

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.657
was so confident with you, Ryan.

00:40:40.657 --> 00:40:42.240
So yes, this is
something does happen.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.665
But there are ways
to get around that.

00:40:45.665 --> 00:40:49.680
AUDIENCE: So do you watch for
facial expressions and Paul

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.430
Ekman and "Lie To Me"
and all that stuff?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.450
KEVIN BLAKE: I don't watch
the show "Lie To Me."

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.820
But a part of the
stuff that I've

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.530
tried to learn as a
magician, because I

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.962
think it very much makes
your performance better,

00:41:02.962 --> 00:41:04.420
is to be able to
read your audience

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.744
and read your participant.

00:41:06.744 --> 00:41:08.160
So the people who
come on a stage,

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.080
it's vitally important to watch
what they're doing, how they're

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.180
acting, and then use
that to your advantage,

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.990
whether calling out
different things, like I'm

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:20.782
sure all of you guys saw when
I said, left or I said right.

00:41:20.782 --> 00:41:21.740
I don't remember which.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.300
But you gave a huge
little half smirk.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.830
Huge little-- sorry about that.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:31.540
You gave a very obvious
little twitch of your mouth.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.870
Did we see this?

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.400
I saw it.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.316
I don't know how obvious
this is to audiences.

00:41:35.316 --> 00:41:38.560
But this kind of thing
is very, very good

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.370
to call out during
a show or to seem

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.634
as though you're
using that to predict.

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.050
So yeah, it's part
of the training

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.508
but it's definitely
not everything.

00:41:46.508 --> 00:41:49.340
MALE SPEAKER: Also is
there any plug I can give?

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.090
mindofkevin.com And if
there are any shows--

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.906
KEVIN BLAKE: Yeah, you can
find tickets and show dates

00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:58.780
for the show that I
perform in San Francisco.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.200
Sorry, not around here
for those of you guys

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.350
who live around here.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.300
Shows in San Francisco, next
one's I think in November.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.750
But I do them relatively often,
like once or twice a month.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.535
You can find this stuff on
my website, mindofkevin.com.

00:42:11.535 --> 00:42:12.540
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.040
KEVIN BLAKE: Thank
you guys so much.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.623
Appreciate it.

00:42:14.623 --> 00:42:18.590
[APPLAUSE]
