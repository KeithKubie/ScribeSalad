00:00:01.864 --> 00:00:04.030
PROFESSOR: We just saw some
random variables come up

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.426
in the bigger number game.

00:00:05.426 --> 00:00:07.800
And we're going to be talking
now about random variables,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.180
just formally what they
are and their definition

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.990
of independence for
random variables.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.100
But let's begin by looking
at the informal idea.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.010
Again, a random variable
is a number that's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.280
produced by a random process.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.650
So a typical example
that comes up

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.480
where you get a random
variable is you've

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.420
got some system
that you're watching

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.510
and you're going to time it to
see when the next crash comes,

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.750
if it crashes.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.000
So assuming that
this is unpredictable

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.850
that it happens in
some random way,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.430
then the number of hours from
the present until the next time

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.090
the system crashes
is a number that's

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.150
produced by this
random process of

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.000
whether the system works or not.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Number of faulty
pixels in a monitor.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.190
When you're building
the monitors

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.160
and delivering them to the
actual computer manufacturers,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.410
there's a certain
probability that some

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.570
of the millions of pixels in the
monitor are going to be faulty.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.489
And you could think of
that number of pixels

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.680
is also produced from an
unpredictable randomness

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.370
in the manufacturing process.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.864
One that really is modeled
in physics as random

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.280
is when you have
a Geiger counter,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
you're measuring
alpha particles.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.250
The number of alpha
particles that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.560
are detected by a given
Geiger counter in a second

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.800
is believed to be
a random number.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.290
There's a distribution
that it has

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.890
but the number of
alpha particles

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.530
is not always the same
from second to second,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.180
and so it's a random variable.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.090
And finally, we'll look at
the standard abstract example

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.330
of flipping coins.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.140
And if I flip coins
then the number

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.130
of heads in a given
number of flips--

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550
let's say I flip a coin n times.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.300
The number of heads
will be another rather

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.590
standard random variable.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.134
OK what is abstractly
a random variable?

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:58.800
Oops, I'm getting
ahead of myself again.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.330
Let's look at that example
of three fair coins.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.740
So each coin has a probability
of being heads that's a half

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.100
and tails being a half.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
I'm going to flip
the three of them.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.808
And I'm going to assume that
they're distinguishable.

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:15.690
So there's a first coin, a
second coin, and a third coin.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.800
Or alternatively you could think
of flipping the same coin three

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.380
times.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.362
So the number of
heads is a number

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:27.820
that comes out of this random
process of flipping the three

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.610
coins.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.320
So it's a number that's
either from 0 to 3.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.240
There could be no
heads or all heads.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.070
So it is a basic example
of a random variable

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.040
where you're producing
this integer based

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.680
on how the coins flip.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.210
Another one is simply a
[? 0-1 ?] valued random

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.470
variable where it signals 1 if
all 3 coins match in what they

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.260
come up with, and 0
if they don't match.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.830
Now once I have these
random variables defined,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.060
one of the things
that's a convenient use

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.940
of random variables is
to use them to define

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.530
various kinds of events.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.420
So the event that
C equals 1, that's

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.900
an event that-- it's
a set of outcomes

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.980
where the count is 1 and it
has a certain probability.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.330
This is the event
of exactly 1 head.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.990
There are 3 possible outcomes
among the 8 outcomes of heads

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.640
and tails with 3 coins.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.760
So it has probability 3/8.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.510
I could also just
talk about the outcome

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.790
that C is greater
than or equal to 1.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.870
Well C is greater
than or equal to 1

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.001
when there is at least 1 head.

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.500
Or put another way, the only
time that C is not greater than

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.300
or equal to 1 is when
you have all tails.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.350
So there's a 7/8 chance,
7 out of 8 outcomes

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.934
involve 1 or more heads.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.100
So the probability that C
greater than or equal to 1

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.930
is 7/8.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.510
Here's a weirder one.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.700
I can use the two variables
C and M to define an event.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.440
What's the probability that
C times M is greater than 0?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.880
Well since C and M
are both non-negative

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.760
variables, the probability
that their product is greater

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.250
than 0 is equal to the
probability that each of them

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.410
is greater than 0.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.490
OK, what does it mean
that M is greater

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.089
than 0 and C is greater than 0?

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.040
Well it says there's at
least 1 head-- that's

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.680
what C greater than 0 means.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.200
And M greater than 0
means all the coins match.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.000
This is an obscure way of
describing the event all heads,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.850
and it has a course
probability 1/8.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.640
Now we come to the
formal definition.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.970
So formally, a random
variable is simply

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.950
a function that maps outcomes
in the sample space to numbers.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.180
We think of the outcomes
in the sample space

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.560
as the results of a
random experiment.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.080
They are an outcome and
they have a probability.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.410
And when the outcome is
translated into a real number

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.000
that you think of
as being produced

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160
as a result of that
outcome, that's

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.840
what the random variable does.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.760
So formally, a random
variable is not a variable.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.450
Or it's a function
that maps the sample

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.099
space to the real numbers.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.640
And it's got to be
total, by the way.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.040
It's a total function.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.220
Usually this would be a
real valued random variable.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.710
Usually it's the real numbers.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.270
Might be a subset of the real
numbers like the integer valued

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.250
random variables.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.100
Occasionally we'll use complex
valued random variables.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.390
Actually, that happens
in physics a good deal

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.040
in quantum mechanics,
but not for our purposes.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.010
We're just going to mean
real value from now on when

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.490
we talk about random variables.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.610
So abstractly or intuitively
what the random variable

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.220
is doing really is it
just packaging together

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.720
in one object R,
the random variable,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.710
a whole bunch of events that
are defined by the value

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.710
that R takes.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.120
So for every possible real
number, if I look at the event

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.370
that R is equal to a,
that's an interesting event.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.110
And it's one of the basic
events that R puts together.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.880
And if you knew the
answer to all of these R

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.730
equals a's, then you
really know a lot about R.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.760
And with this
understanding that R

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.920
is a package of
events of the form R

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.290
is equal to a, then a lot
of the event properties

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.350
carry right over to
random variables directly.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.590
That's why this little topic
of introducing random variables

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.590
is also about independence
because the definition

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.190
of independence
carries right over.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.870
Namely, a bunch of
random variables

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.120
are mutually independent if
the events that they define

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.880
are all mutually independent.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.180
So if and only if the
events that are-- each event

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.540
defined by R1 and R2 and
through Rn, that set of events

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.700
are mutually independent
no matter what

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.480
the values are chosen that we
decide to look at for R1 and R2

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.980
through Rn.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.760
And of course there's
an alternative way

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.540
we could always express
independent events

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:13.960
in terms of products instead
of conditional probabilities.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.370
So we could say-- or
instead of invoking

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.060
the idea of mutual
independence we

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.800
could say explicitly where
it comes from as an equation.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.270
It means that the probability
that R1 is equal to a1 and R2

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.030
is equal to a1 and
Rn is equal to an

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.640
is equal to the product
of the probabilities--

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.040
of the individual
probabilities--

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.760
that R1 is a1 times the
probability of R2 is a2.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.020
And the definition then
of mutual independence

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.360
of the random
variables R1 through n,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.880
Rn holds is that
this equation it

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.120
holds for all possible values,
little a1 through little an.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.220
So let's just practice.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.540
Are the variables C, which
is the count of the number

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.120
of heads when you flip
three coins, and M,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.240
[? the 0-1 ?] valued random
variable that tells you whether

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.150
there's a match, are
they independent?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.520
Well certainly not,
because there's definitely

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.160
a positive probability that
the count will be 1 that you'll

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.810
get at least a head.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.610
And there's a
positive probability

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.794
that they all will match.

00:08:16.794 --> 00:08:18.210
It's the probability
of a quarter.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.229
So the product of
those 2 is positive,

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:23.520
but of course the probability
that you match and you'll

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.720
have exactly 1 head is 0 because
if you have exactly 1 head

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.980
you must have 2 tails
and there's no match.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.520
So without thinking
very hard about what

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.669
the probabilities are
we can immediately

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.440
see that the product is not
equal to the probability

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.680
of the conjunction or the
and, and therefore they're

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.330
not independent.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.032
Well here's one that's a
little bit more interesting.

00:08:50.032 --> 00:08:51.740
In order to explain
it I've got to set up

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.400
the idea of an indicator
variable, which itself

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.590
is a very important concept.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.830
So if I have an event
A, I can package A

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.410
into a random variable.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.240
Just like the match random
variable was really packaging

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.660
the event that the coins
matched into a [? 0-1 ?] valued

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.940
variable, I'm going to define
the indicator variable for any

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.620
event A to be 1 if A occurs
and 0 if A does not occur.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.750
So now I'm able to
capture everything

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.020
that matters about event A
by the random variable IA.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.540
If I have IA I know what
A is, and if I have A I

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.260
know what IA is.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.800
And it means that
really I can think

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.500
of events as special
cases of random variables.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.020
Now when you do this
you need a sanity check.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.640
Because remember we've
defined independence

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.730
of random variables one way.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.070
I mean it's a concept
of independence that

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.630
holds for random variables.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.480
We have another
concept of independence

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.500
that holds for events.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.710
Now the definition
for random variable

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.110
was motivated by the
definition for events

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.890
but it's a different
definition of independence

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.500
of different kinds of objects.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.100
Now if this correspondence
between events and indicator

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.590
variables is going to make
sense and not confuse us

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:07.010
it should be the case that
two events are independent if

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.570
and only if their indicator
variables are independent.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.960
That is, IA and IB are
independent if and only

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.430
if the events A and
B are independent.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.220
And this is a lovely
little exercise.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.880
It's like a three-line
proof for you to verify.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.440
I'm not going bother
to do it on the slide

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.940
because it's good practice.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.860
So this would be a
moment to stop and verify

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.040
that using the two
definitions of independence,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.760
the definition of what
it means for IA and IB

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.970
to be independent
as random variables

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.880
and comparing that to
the definition of what

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.080
it means for A and B to
be independent as events,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.755
they match.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.560
If we look at the event
of an odd number of heads

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.690
we can ask now
whether the event M,

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.970
which is the indicator
variable for a match--

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.610
the random variable M-- and
the indicator variable IO

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.960
are dependent or not.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.570
Now both of these depend
on all the three coins.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.060
IO is looking at
all 3 coins to see

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.560
if there are an odd
number of heads,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.890
M is looking at all 3
coins to see if they're

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.220
all heads or all tails.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.970
And it's not clear with all
that common basis for returning

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.260
what value they have.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.530
It's not immediately obvious
that they're independent,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.340
but as a matter
of fact they are.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.447
And again this is
absolutely something

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:28.530
that you should check out.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.720
If you don't stop the
video now to work it out,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.070
you should definitely
do it afterward.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.530
It's an important
little exercise

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.488
and it's easy to check.

00:11:35.488 --> 00:11:40.460
All you have to do is check
that the probabilities

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:45.250
of the event of odd number of
heads in the event all match

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.680
are independent as events.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.700
Or you could use the
random variable definition

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.890
and check that these two
random variables were

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.600
independent by
checking 4 equations

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.250
because this can
have values 0 and 1.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.720
And this can have value 0 and 1.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.050
Remember with independent
events we had the idea

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.100
that if A was independent
of B it really

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.350
meant that A was independent
of everything about B.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.800
In particular it was independent
of the complement of B as well.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.620
And a similar property
holds for random variables.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.240
So intuitively if R
is independent of S

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.840
then R is really independent
of any information

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.960
at all that you have
about S. And that

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.840
can be made more
precise that R is

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.210
independent of any
information about S

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.270
by saying pick an arbitrary
function that maps R to R,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.410
total function.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.690
So what I can do is
think of f as giving me

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.600
some information
about the value of S.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.930
So if R is independent
of S then in fact R

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.510
is independent of f of S,
any transformation of S

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.360
by a fixed non-random function.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.930
And of course the notion
of k-way independence

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.810
carries right over
from the event case.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.270
If I have k random-- if I have
a bunch of random variables,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.940
a large number much
more than k, they're

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.340
k-way independent if
every set of k of them

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.210
are mutually independent.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.160
And of course as with
events we use the 2-way case

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.200
to call them
pairwise independent.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.660
Again, we saw an example of
this in terms of events already

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.600
but we can rephrase it now in
terms of indicator variables.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.730
If we let Hi be the
indicator variable for a head

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:36.310
on a flip i-- of the
i flip of a coin--

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:42.110
where i ranges from 1
through k, if we have k coins

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.150
and Hi is the indicator
variable for how coin

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.880
I came out, whether
or not there's a head,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.190
now O can be nicely expressed.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.540
The notion that there's an
odd number of heads is simply

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.800
the mod 2 sum of the Hi's.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.380
And this by the way, is a trick
that we'll be using regularly

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.800
that events now can be
defined rather nicely

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.850
in terms of doing
operations on the arithmetic

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.630
values of indicator variables.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.610
So O is nothing
but the mod 2 sum

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.790
of the values of the indicator
variables Hi from 1 to k.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.710
And what we saw when we were
working with their event

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:25.035
version is that any k of
these events are independent.

00:14:25.035 --> 00:14:26.180
I've got k plus 1.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.610
There's k Hi's and
there's O, which

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.320
makes the k plus
1-- k plus first.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:44.047
[AUDIO OUT] And the reason why
any k of them were independent

00:14:44.047 --> 00:14:46.380
was discussed in the previous
slide when we were looking

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.260
at the events of there
being an odd number of heads

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.920
and a head coming
up on the i flip.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.490
The reason why pairwise
independence gets singled out

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.880
is that we'll see that for a
bunch of major applications

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.910
this pairwise
independence is sufficient

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.702
and rather than verifying
mutual independence.

00:15:08.702 --> 00:15:10.410
It's harder to check
mutual independence.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.530
You've got a lot more
equations to check.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.130
And in fact it often doesn't
hold in circumstances where

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.660
pairwise does hold.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.860
So this is good to know.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.520
We'll be making use of
it in an application

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:29.640
later when we look at sampling
and the law of large numbers.
