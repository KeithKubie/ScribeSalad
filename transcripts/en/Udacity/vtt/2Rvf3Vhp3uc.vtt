00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When we have 2 different ways to refer to the same object,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that's called aliasing.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Aliasing in programs is similar to the way we think about aliasing in Spycraft.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You might not be able to tell from my drawing,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but this is James Bond.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we can refer to James Bond

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
either by his name, James Bond,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or by his spy name, 007.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Both of those are ways to refer to the same person.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If something happens that changes the state of James Bond,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so instead of pleasantly enjoying a martini, like he is now,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the bad guys are after him, and he grabs his gun

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and is no longer so happy, well, that affects the state

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of both James Bond and 007.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Both names refer to the same person,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so whatever state that person has is true for both names.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Aliasing for variable names

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
has the same property, so if we have 2 variable names

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that refer to the same object, any change we make to the object p refers to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
also affects the value that q refers to.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If we did an assignment using p to change the value

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in the second position on p,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that also changes the value the name q refers to.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
If we do an assignment like this where instead of changing the value

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of one of the cells that's part of the p object,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we assign p to a new value, well, this assignment

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we create a new object, a list containing 3 elements,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the numbers 007.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And it will change what the variable p refers to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to point to that new object.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The value of q is the same as it was before.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It still points to the same object, which we haven't modified.
