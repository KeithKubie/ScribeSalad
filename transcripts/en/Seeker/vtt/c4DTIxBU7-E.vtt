00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.460
Guys, why in the world did they make the word
“lisp” so difficult to pronounce for people

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.090
with a lisp?

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.280
Hey, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.839
The scientific term for a lisp is sigmatism,
which is the mispronunciation of sibilant

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.319
sounds: Sounds like s's, z's, sh's, and so
on.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:25.029
When people have trouble pronouncing one or
more of these sounds, they are said to have

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.029
a lisp.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.059
And, about 10 percent of people in the U.S.
have a functional speech disorder, which includes

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.059
lisps.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.460
A common misconception is that people of certain
groups or that speak certain languages have

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.870
a lisp, but lisps actually have to do with
difficulty in saying certain words correctly.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.970
As we all come in different shapes and sizes,
we all have variations in how our teeth are

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.360
positioned, how long our tongue is, and how
long our lingual frenulum is (that’s the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.860
creepy looking tissue that connects our tongue
to the bottom of our mouth).

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.790
Lisps can occur when the configuration of
your mouth, teeth, and tongue are less than

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.440
ideal to produce certain sounds required by
speech -- although they can also form out

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440
of habit.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.700
The trickiest sounds for people with lisps
to pronounce tend be the s, z, r, l, and th

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
sounds.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.299
These are typically the result of one or more
of the four most common types of lisps.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.939
The interdental lisp, when the s or z sounds
end up sounding like “th” happens when

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.020
your tongue sticks out between your front
teeth.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.930
If you had these teeth knocked out as a kid
you may have developed this lisp temporarily!

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.369
Instead of sea shells you might say “thee
thells”

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.780
A dentalized lisp is similar to the interdental
lisp, but instead of having your tongue protrude

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.069
through the teeth, it just presses against
the front teeth, which can make certain sounds

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.069
seem muffled.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.459
A lateral lisp occurs when sound escapes through
the sides of your tongue making a wet or slushy

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.459
sound.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.770
Sort of like this - sea shells
The palatal lisp occurs when people try to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.649
make sounds like /s/ but their tongue touches
their soft palate and they instead end up

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.009
making a “hy” sound.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.009
Hyhells

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.579
Some studies suggests that frequent childhood
ear infections or hearing problems may also

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.719
influence lisps; but, just because you have
a lisp at one point, doesn’t mean you’ll

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.149
have a lisp forever!

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.450
Some people learn to overcome these on their
own and a lot lisps go away as we age and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.040
our mouths and tongues grow and change…

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.720
like when we grow back our front teeth.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.540
But, if a lisp persists past 4-and-a-half
years of age, experts suggest that therapy

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.530
should be considered, especially if the lisp
is interfering with social interactions, work,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.780
or academics.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.750
But some people choose not to undergo treatment.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
Because the fact is, that while most lisps
result in difficulty in the pronunciation

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
of specific words… it’s not like you’re
not going to understand the overall message.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.220
Most of us can easily pick up what the person
is saying from context.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.480
The bigger issue might stem from reports that
show people with lisps can be unfairly perceived

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.660
as less intelligent and are often ridiculed
or humiliated.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.150
Lisps exist because of the physical structure
of our mouths, and how we learned to speak;

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.600
it's just like how we learned to walk.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.480
It doesn't reflect who a person is.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.290
In fact, according to the DSM-Five, the diagnosis
of a Speech Sound Disorder requires that the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.520
person feels it is inhibiting them.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.660
If they don’t think it’s a problem, medically
it isn’t.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.920
Another way people speak that has become popular
is vocal fry, and it gets a bad wrap.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:30.460
What is the vocal fry and why are some people
getting flack for using it -- find out here.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.620
Do you have trouble pronouncing certain sounds?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.620
