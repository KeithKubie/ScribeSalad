00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.040
“No one man should have all that power.”

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.050
Literally, no one person in the world should
have too much power.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.800
Power is quantified in our societies in different
ways; political power, systemic power,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.000
financial power, turtle power.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.519
All of it is tied to a hierarchical escalator
in which we rise up through decisions and actions.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.980
But once we have power, how does it affect
our brain and behavior?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.860
After the theme song.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.760
(off screen)
There's still, uh, still no theme song.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.060
OK!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
Let’s define power because it’s more of
a sociological concept, but anything sociological

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.900
will have some degree of psychological effect.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.980
The definition I’ll use is “possession
of control, authority, or influence over others.”

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.150
Having power over others, or controlling resources
that they want, need or fear – has profound

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.490
effects on the mind and brain, as does being
in a less powerful position.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.850
There are countless super light, not traumatizing
studies looking at human behavior in positions

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.310
of power like the super chill, completely
ethical 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment where

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.130
a professor by the name of Dr. Zimbardo assigned
either guard or prisoner to subjects and basically

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.830
let human nature have creative control, and
the guards abused all of the power.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.500
Like all of it. They left no power un-abused.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.600
Or the wildly ethical, completely not
wack Milgram experiment, where Dr. Millgram

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.100
studied how far people would go in obeying
an instruction

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.700
if it involved harming another person. And...

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.820
"But he might be dead in there!"

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.500
...people took it to a pretty horrifying
extreme, claiming that they were “following orders."

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.760
So, you know, just some light Nazi-ing.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.880
Clearly power corrupts, but what effect does
it actually have?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.501
Well, it increases hypocrisy, egocentrism,
and lack of empathy which doesn’t sound

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:31.770
like anyone, right?

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.000
Right.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.440
If it corrupts us, what is it actually doing
to our brains?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.820
Well, the answer may lie in dopamine.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.940
Dopamine is that reward neurotransmitter among
a whole score of other functions.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.960
It’s behind some of our feel good feelings and
power makes us feel...good.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.820
Power increases testosterone levels,
but that in turn activates dopamine activity.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.200
An EEG study from 2012 saw increased dopaminergic
activity in the left prefrontal cortex in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.950
individuals primed to think about a situation
where they had power over another person,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.180
so if power is linked to reward, that might
explain why it's so hard to give up.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.900
Releases of dopamine in your brain is reward-
oriented, and when you get dopamine, you want

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.720
more and more. It’s a large focus of addiction
research.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.380
People want that high whether it's a drug,
a feeling, or both like a Wolf of Wall Street

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.100
type high, all the money and power, 
and then all the cocaina.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.940
This is where the neurochemistry of power
comes into play.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.420
More power often comes with more resources,
which could be more money, more subordinates,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.400
etc etc.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.200
That same dopamine can enhance cognitive function,
but also may make people more impulsive,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.100
less risk-averse, and less empathetic.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.400
Sound familiar?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.020
It should.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.720
Philosopher and neuroscientist
Nayef Al-Rodhan suggests that in a power paradigm,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.379
high levels of dopamine are associated with
a sense of personal destiny, risk-taking,

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.310
preoccupation with the cosmic or religious,
and emotional detachment that can lead to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.769
becoming more callous and singularly focused
on achieving goals.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.620
There’s nothing wrong with ambition; we
should all want to do stuff, stuff is always

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.260
good, but there’s truth to the phrase that “power
corrupts,” and it doesn’t take a Dr. Zimbardo

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.680
to expose that.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.299
Having a degree of power causes people to
detach from humanity in a way, lowering the

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.040
ability to comprehend how other people see,
think, and feel, also known as another idiom,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.790
“walking in another person’s shoes.”

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.469
Further research out of Canada put people
with and without power in a transcranial magnetic

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.189
resonance machine and found that power impaired
a specific neural process that we’ll call

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.560
'mirroring,' which people think is key in
having and expressing empathy.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.780
Empathy is a key part of being a 
human being, yes, but it's also

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.780
important in campaigning for office; knowing what

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.239
your constituents see, think, and feel and
running on those issues and platforms.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.090
But it seems that as power increases, this
sort of empathic response deteriorates and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.360
when subjects with power are asked to act
empathically, they are often really, really bad at it.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.820
Why? Well, some theorize that an increase in power
lessens the need for an understanding of people

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.940
with less power, because it gives them access
to resources that they didn't previously have,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.580
like that friend acting differently
when they found that higher class of friends

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.520
with more social status or started acting
different when they finally got some bread.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520
Or lettuce.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.120
Or cheese.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.500
Why is everything about money also about sandwiches?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
The science behind it suggests that powerful people may be hooked on power,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.240
losing the ability to have genuine empathy, and becoming myopically focused.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.960
And that's not just politicians.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.520
Need a key to staying grounded?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.420
Research says have a tether, reminding 
you not to believe your own hype.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.820
Mine’s my mom and my friends, Karen and Rhonda.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.740
This episode is brought to you by 
your hype: don't believe it.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.540
Rainbow.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.080
Ok, so you're in a powerful position, 
and you're making people under you feel

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.300
like they're not as powerful. Well, 
watch this video about rehumanization

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
so you don't see them as objects.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.780
Come on, man. You can do better.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.780
Just watch the video.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.180
Thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe, dude.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.920
I'm asking nicely.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.240
You won't like me when I'm angry.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.720
I just get softer.
