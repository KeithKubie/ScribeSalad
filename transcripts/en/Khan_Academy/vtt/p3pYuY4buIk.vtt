00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:02.016
- [Instructor] Talk about in other videos,

00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:05.763
the Middle Ages refers to
that roughly 1,000 year period

00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:09.619
of time in Europe from the end
of the Western Roman empire

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.038
in 476 until we get to
about 1,000 years later

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:14.753
with the emergence of the Renaissance

00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:16.418
and the Age of Exploration.

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:19.339
And we associate it with
knights in shining armor

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.834
and their code of chivalry,

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.877
with kings and castles
surrounded by moats.

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:27.850
And we also associate it
with the feudal system,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.962
which is how most of Europe was governed

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:32.879
during the Middle Ages.

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:36.355
Now many of you are
probably familiar with some

00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:39.295
of the key actors within
the feudal system.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:42.128
At the top, you would have a king.

00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:46.885
Now, the king would rule over a kingdom.

00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.845
Now this is not so easy to govern,

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:52.334
especially during the Middle Ages,

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.463
and the king might owe many people things,

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:57.783
especially people who helped
the king come to power,

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:01.476
helped him depose the previous
king or to conquer this land.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.456
And so, in exchange for
that, and to help govern,

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:08.786
he might grant land or
fiefs to other people.

00:01:08.786 --> 00:01:11.731
And the key currency in the Middle Ages

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.278
under the feudal system is land

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:18.360
and land in exchange
for loyalty and service.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.317
So, this whole thing is a kingdom.

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:22.947
Now, right over here, this is a duchy

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:25.672
and a duchy will be controlled by a duke.

00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:27.043
I guess they didn't call it ducky

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.235
because that just
doesn't sound as serious.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:31.985
So, the king might grant a duchy,

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.406
a duchy, to a duke,

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:40.734
and in exchange, the duke
would provide loyalty,

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.264
pledge their fealty.

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:44.776
If the kingdom is threatened,
the duke will fight

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:48.042
alongside the king, would
provide their own troops.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:50.895
If the king wants to go
conquer other territories,

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:54.482
same thing, and also
provide the king with taxes,

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.054
which might be in the form of coinage,

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.821
depending on what time and
region we are in the Middle Ages

00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.135
or it might be in the form of a percentage

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:05.387
of the agricultural
production from this duchy.

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:07.618
Now the terminology here is that the duke

00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:10.389
would be one of the king's vassals

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.619
or would be vassal to the king.

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.849
Now a duchy tends to be a fairly
large amount of territory.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.653
In medieval England, a duke was

00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:19.138
the highest title of nobility.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.690
There was variations on duke.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.350
Now the duke might have his own manor

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.774
or might even have multiple
manors that he rules

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:28.772
directly over that has his own serfs

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.259
or free peasants working
that land, providing output,

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.438
which helps generate
some of the tax revenue

00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:36.508
that goes to the king or provides some

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:39.417
of the necessities for
the duke's own household.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:42.612
But the rest of the duchy,
they might subdivide further

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.478
and they would be lord
over their own vassals.

00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:49.409
So, for example, this piece
of land right over here,

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.601
this duke might provide
it to someone else,

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:56.204
let's say a count, in which
case this would be called

00:02:56.204 --> 00:02:59.983
a county, and that is where we
get our modern term, county.

00:02:59.983 --> 00:03:02.866
And this count would be vassal to the duke

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.880
and the duke would be
the lord of the count.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.500
And then the count can then be the lord

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.471
of someone else, of their vassals.

00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:11.114
And this goes on and on and on,

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:13.751
all the way until you get
down to the level of the serfs

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:17.456
and the peasants, who are
actually doing the work.

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:21.902
But the main idea here is
that in exchange for land,

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.819
the king gave his duke a duchy,
or maybe the king's father

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.411
gave this duke's father this duchy,

00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:30.612
and so this grant of land,
this is called a fief,

00:03:30.612 --> 00:03:33.063
a critical term in the feudal system.

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:36.013
This county here, this is a fief.

00:03:36.013 --> 00:03:40.645
In exchange for that,
the vassal gives the lord

00:03:40.645 --> 00:03:43.145
resources, taxes, and loyalty.

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:47.186
Now the way I drew it here,
it seems quite organized

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:50.800
and clean, but the reality
of it, it isn't that clean.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.145
Sometimes, a kingdom might directly,

00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:56.182
some parts of it might be
subdivided into duchies,

00:03:56.182 --> 00:03:59.593
some of it might be divided into a county

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:02.057
that is independent of any duchy.

00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:04.206
You might have another
duchy right over here

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:06.811
that is not subdivided into counties.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.455
You might have one count
that is more powerful

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:11.866
than another count, or one
count that might even be

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:15.188
more powerful than a duke someplace else.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.518
So it can actually be quite chaotic

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:19.090
and hard to keep track of.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.569
And this isn't all of the players.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.906
I mentioned some of
the titles of nobility,

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.569
like duke and count,

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.162
and then below count
you might have a baron.

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:31.857
In England, the equivalent
of count was an earl,

00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:34.882
who still presided over a county

00:04:34.882 --> 00:04:37.491
and their wife was a countess.

00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:38.742
And when I say preside,

00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:41.313
they had almost full control over it.

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:44.443
They would even give
justice over the people

00:04:44.443 --> 00:04:47.548
who happen to be within their fiefdom.

00:04:47.548 --> 00:04:49.985
Now, I started this
video showing a picture

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:52.961
of a knight on horseback
and knights are probably

00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.127
one of the strongest
association with medieval times,

00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:58.372
so many of you are probably thinking,

00:04:58.372 --> 00:05:01.055
where do knights fit into this?

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:03.383
The knight refers to
slightly different things,

00:05:03.383 --> 00:05:05.330
depending on what region you are in

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.749
or what time period
within the Middle Ages,

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.849
but it generally refers
to a mounted soldier,

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.266
someone skilled in fighting,

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.149
someone who might have knight's armor.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.667
But over time, it became
a prestigious title

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:21.000
that was given by a monarch or by a lord

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.232
in exchange for service,
oftentimes military service.

00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:30.115
You might have a knight
who is granted a fief from,

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:32.625
say, this count right over here,

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:36.636
and say, they might be
lord of their own manor.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:40.450
They might have their own
serfs who are not quite slaves,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.034
but they're bonded
laborers who cannot leave

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:45.717
and don't have a lot of
rights, working the field.

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:50.370
You might have other
knights who got the title

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.240
but did not get the land.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.988
And to complicate things further,

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:57.490
any of these characters
can have multiple titles.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.323
For example, this duke
might also be knighted.

00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:08.005
Now, it's worth noting that
these titles of nobility,

00:06:08.005 --> 00:06:12.172
duke, count, baron, earl,
these tended to be hereditary.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.966
You would pass it down from
one generation to the next,

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:22.390
as long as the next generation
pledged fealty to their lord.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.504
The title knight, however,
was given for service

00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:27.528
and did not tend to be passed down

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:30.650
from generation to generation.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.144
And to be clear, these still
aren't all the actors here.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:37.266
You also have the church,
which during medieval times,

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:39.806
was a very powerful institution.

00:06:39.806 --> 00:06:43.233
At the top of the church,
you had the bishop of Rome,

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:47.316
also known as the pope,
and you had their bishops

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:50.843
in significant regions.

00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.575
You also had monastic orders,

00:06:55.424 --> 00:06:57.834
where you might have an abbot,

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.710
who is the head of a monastery,
where you have monks,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.545
who, as part of that
monastery, are praying.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:08.281
They might be farming, they
might be copying texts.

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.696
And there's also power
dynamics between these.

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.952
And as we're about to
see, you can even have

00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:15.147
these non-religious figures pledging

00:07:15.147 --> 00:07:17.914
fealty to religious figures.

00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:19.220
So just to get a sense of what

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.520
these pledges of fealty were like.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.020
You have a vassal.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.746
In this homage ceremony, homage,

00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:32.606
or sometimes said homage,

00:07:32.606 --> 00:07:35.621
it really comes from
the French word, homme,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.051
which refers to man.

00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:40.902
So he is pledging to be his lord's man.

00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:43.524
So this would be the lord right over here.

00:07:43.524 --> 00:07:47.222
And this is an actual pledge
given by Bernard Atton,

00:07:47.222 --> 00:07:52.066
Viscount of Carcassonne,
in the year 1110 in France.

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.545
"In the name of the
Lord, I, Bernard Atton,"

00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:56.726
and I apologize for my pronunciation,

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.333
"Viscount of Carcassonne,
in the presence of my sons,"

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.852
and he goes on to list his sons.

00:08:01.852 --> 00:08:04.054
"Nobles, and of many other honorable men,

00:08:04.054 --> 00:08:07.619
"who have come to the monastery
of St. Mary of Grasse,"

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:12.056
or Grasse, "since lord Leo ,
abbot of the said monastery,

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:15.719
"has asked me, in the presence
of all those above mentioned,

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:20.542
"to acknowledge to him the
fealty and homage" or homage

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:24.285
"for the castles, manors,
and places which the patrons,

00:08:24.285 --> 00:08:27.471
"my ancestors, held from
him and his predecessors

00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.996
"and from the said monastery as a fief,

00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:34.761
"and which I ought to hold as they held,

00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.086
"I have made to the lord abbot Leo

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:40.393
"acknowledgement and
homage as I ought to do."

00:08:40.393 --> 00:08:43.622
So, in this case, the lord is an abbot,

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:46.691
is a religious figure, is
the head of a monastery

00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:49.242
and the vassal is a viscount.

00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:51.482
You can kinda view them as vice count.

00:08:51.482 --> 00:08:55.052
And notice, he's pledging
fealty to the abbot.

00:08:55.052 --> 00:08:59.366
And in this case, it looks
like Bernard Atton's ancestors

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:02.515
were already vassals to the abbot

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:05.528
and so this is really renewing
it and so that the viscount

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:07.893
could essentially keep his fief.

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:12.238
Now to appreciate how
complicated this could get,

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:16.699
here on the timeline you see
when Henry the Second lived,

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:20.032
and as you can see, he had many titles.

00:09:20.032 --> 00:09:22.112
He was eventually King of England.

00:09:22.112 --> 00:09:24.473
You can see southern England up here.

00:09:24.473 --> 00:09:28.157
He was Duke of Normandy,
Duke of Aquitaine,

00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:29.164
which was interesting.

00:09:29.164 --> 00:09:32.780
He got that as a dowery
when he marries Eleanor,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.947
whose previous husband was King
Louis the Seventh of France.

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:41.101
He is Count of Maine, Anjou, Touraine.

00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:44.744
And this is really interesting.

00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:47.950
He's a king of one kingdom,
the Kingdom of England,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.418
but he is also a duke and a
count within another kingdom,

00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:53.916
the kingdom of France.

00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:55.829
But this gives you a
sense of, to some degree,

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.661
how chaotic the Middle Ages were.

00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:00.275
It wasn't well organized
like under the Roman empire

00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:04.586
or under ancient Persia or
even most nation states today.

00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:07.223
It was many different kingdoms organized

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:10.147
into many different duchies and counties.

00:10:10.147 --> 00:10:12.998
There wasn't a very clear rhyme and reason

00:10:12.998 --> 00:10:15.816
and positions and power
constantly shifted,

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:19.983
depending on loyalty, wars,
marriages, and inheritance.
