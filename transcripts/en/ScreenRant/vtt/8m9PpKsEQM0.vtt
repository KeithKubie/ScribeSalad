00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
There are some who might say a movie’s entire
message is sent by how it begins, and how

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.670
it ends.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.300
But rarely do directors actually treat their
first and final shots with so much importance.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.410
Unforgettable views, moments of triumph, or
witty dialogue can all make a cut-to-black

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.440
and end credits seem perfectly timed, but
some directors go the extra mile, crafting

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.620
a start and finish that add an extra level
of storytelling for viewers paying close attention.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.559
Here are Screen Rant’s Hidden Clues In First
And Final Movie Scenes.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.940
Avatar

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.250
James Cameron's 3D blockbuster smash may have
taken audiences to an alien world, but it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.630
begins at home, in a futuristic Earth.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.899
Actually, Avatar begins in a dream sequence,
with the movie’s hero Jake Sully explaining

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.780
that his sleep has become filled with visions
of flying ever since he was wounded in combat,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.510
opening his eyes every morning to find that
he is still confined to a wheelchair.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.239
His adventure on the planet Pandora piloting
an artificially-grown human/Na-vi hybrid allows

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.240
him to do more than fly, successfully defending
the planet from his own side’s forces.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.380
The final shots of the movie mirror the beginning
directly, showing Jake once again opening

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.990
his eyes – this time, to a new body, a new
people, and a new purpose.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
To take things further, the end credits are
run over the exact same shots of flying as

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.969
Jake's first dream.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.270
12 Monkeys

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.539
Director Terry Gilliam is known for his offbeat
visions of the future, with 12 Monkeys focused

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.719
on a single prisoner, sent into the past to
help scientists cure a worldwide plague that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.359
killed billions.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.200
The film opens with the hero dreaming of his
younger self, watching an unknown man gunned

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.079
down in a crowded airport.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.999
Unsure if the memory is real or imagined,
he goes on to learn that the virus was spread

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.799
on purpose by a single person, and sets out
to stop it from ever happening.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.270
He fails when airport security shoots him
dead in front of his younger self.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.039
The boy watches as the plane takes off, setting
into motion billions of deaths, and closing

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.740
the endless time loop the way it began.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.490
Cast Away

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.649
Although most of the film is set on a remote
tropical island, Cast Away begins in the heart

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.300
of Texas, introducing an unknown woman sending
a FedEx package.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.870
The choice makes sense when the camera follows
a FedEx package from there all the way to

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.420
Russia, where the film’s hero Chuck Noland
is introduced.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.010
When Chuck finally makes it back to civilization,
little of his old life remains, and he decides

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.060
to start over from scratch – but first,
he has to return a package that washed ashore

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.160
on his desert island along with him.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.350
That brings him to the exact same intersection
the movie opened on, where Chuck finally encounters

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.500
the woman who he says saved his life.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.920
After considering which direction to head,
Chuck turns to the woman’s disappearing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.790
truck with a smile, and the film’s final
shot gives another look down the deserted

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.840
road it opened on – plus Chuck.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.970
Gone Girl

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.410
David Fincher had an incredible challenge
adapting the novel “Gone Girl” to film,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.650
and the opening shot is a hard one to forget.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.470
Showing what should be a loving scene between
a husband and wife, star Rosamund Pike’s

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.960
sudden stare into the camera and Ben Affleck’s
narration put audiences on edge, warning them

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.610
that the story about to unfold was anything
but simple.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.870
A kidnapping, lies, and murder all led the
estranged couple back to eachother, forced

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.960
to decide just how willing they were to keep
lying for the sake of a marriage – and public

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960
perception.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.800
Having the couple end up right back where
they started from may have been a hard pill

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.160
for viewers to swallow, but Fincher makes
the message loud and clear, ending the movie

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.860
with the exact same shot he opened on – but
the audience’s opinion of the woman in frame

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.890
has completely changed.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.890
Total Recall

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.090
It’s a simple enough story: an everyday
Earthling in the not-too-distant future, Douglas

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.330
Quaid, dreams of a passionate affair with
a beautiful woman on the surface of Mars.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.150
So when a business offers to implant false
memories for a price, Quaid decides to make

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.390
his dream a reality – at least as far as
his mind is concerned.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.600
The procedure goes awry, and Quaid’s false
memories disappear, revealing that he really

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.840
WAS a secret agent working on Mars, and the
woman from his dreams wasn’t imaginary.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.280
At least, that’s what he thinks.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.170
The movie never states whether Quaid’s return
to Mars really happened, and whether he succeeded

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.750
in releasing air into its atmosphere, and
saving its poor population.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.990
But taking a quick glance at just how closely
the film’s final scene resembles Quaid’s

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.620
dream, those suspecting it was simply a fantasy
have even more evidence to back up their claim.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.539
Cape Fear

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.840
Director Martin Scorsese wasn’t exactly
subtle with the tension and terror of Cape

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.099
Fear, the story of a convicted criminal who
seeks revenge on the lawyer who put him there,

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.380
terrorizing him and his family, particularly
his teenage daughter.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.949
Beginning the movie with chilling music and
a blood red close-up on the daughter’s eyes

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.919
warns audiences that the story she’s about
to recount is a violent and truly unsettling

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.279
one, due in large part to Robert De Niro’s
acclaimed performance as the film’s villain.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.090
The family survives in the end, with the lawyer
successfully killing his former client - but

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.610
the damage has been done.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.180
To remind viewers that Cape Fear is as much
about the loss of innocence as it is about

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.110
revenge or protecting your family, the film
returns to the “spared” daughter, this

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.639
time fading from innocent white to red – and
keeping audiences from feeling too good about

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.169
its happy ending.

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.550
