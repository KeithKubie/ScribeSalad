Fans sharing video reactions to movies, TV, and trailers.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.760
And be sure to stay tuned until the end of the video to see how you can be on next week's Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.040
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's talk about the first Super Mario Bros. movie.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.440
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.880
Believe it or not, there was a Super Mario Bros. movie before that one.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.560
And believe it or not, it starred actual brothers, a dragon, took place in the Mushroom Kingdom, and looked exactly like the game.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.060
Audience: BOOOOO!

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.880
NC: I know, I know. I think it's weird for an adaptation to be faithful, too.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.200
But this one is still interesting, to say the least.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.600
In 1986, Japan released an animated movie called Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.860
Phht, silly Japanese, we Americans know it's Princess Toadstool.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.140
It wasn't given a release in America because, you know, we were working on our own superior version,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.420
but it has started to gain attention as being technically the first movie based on a video game.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.900
Unless you count Apocalypse Now as an adaptation of Pong.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.780
Most don't.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.100
To make things a little easier to follow, I'm gonna look at the English dub on the YouTube channel Chad Kyer.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.560
Mostly because it's the only one I could find and it does manage to get a laugh out of me.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.120
Is the movie worth checking out?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.200
Or, at least, more checking out than:

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.180
King Koopa: Monkey!

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.960
NC: Well, let's take a look and see.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.160
Spoilers, it is.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.780
This is Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Save Princess Peach.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.840
So it opens with Mario...

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.780
playing a video game.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.020
Isn't that kinda like a sunflower painting van Gogh?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.280
His brother Luigi, living presumably a Bert and Ernie lifestyle of sin,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.860
tries to get him to quit, but he's just too addicted.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.740
However, something strange starts to happen as the game starts to show a princess literally fighting off baddies with a stick.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.700
The Royal Swingstick.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.720
Hey, it's less sexist than a frying pan and her butt.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.120
She magically comes out of the TV along with a bunch of dust smoke creating minions,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.300
and...

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.620
they vanish.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.960
Apparently, they're allergic to blue living rooms.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.600
Hey, you laugh, but I'm prepared for the Koopapocalypse!

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.000
The princess wakes up and reveals herself as Peach.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
Peach: Thanks for protecting me. My name is Princess Peach.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.440
Mario: Princess Peach?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.660
Peach: I believe you're Mario, the brave knight.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.580
NC: As foretold in the scripture of the instruction book.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.000
She tells him about King Koopa as well, who seems to follow her from the game.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm just gonna take a guess and say this runs on Space Jam logic.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.140
That is to say none.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.300
Peach: Beat him up, Mario! Make him pay for what he did!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.160
NC: But I'm always the worst player!

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.720
Luigi can jump high, Toad can run fast, you can even fly!

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.560
He proves to be exactly that useless as he's easily defeated and Koopa takes Peach.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.820
Luigi laughs at his story in his Italian Southern accent...

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.420
Luigi: What are you talking about? Princess asked you for help?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.860
NC: C'mon, don't act like that's not a thing.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.540
And they get to their job the following day as plumb-

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680
Grocery store clerks.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.640
Is there an unwritten rule that in every Mario movie, at least one obvious thing has to be wrong?!

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.760
Luigi sees the necklace Peach left behind and crams a lot of game exposition in only a few seconds.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.960
Luigi: This gem has been passed on by the Kinopi people! It's worth fortunes!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.880
Mario: Kinopi people?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.580
Luigi: Yeah! See? Look right there!

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.720
This gem originates from the lost Mushroom Kingdom.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.000
Borat: Is nice!

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.240
Luigi: Amazing!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.040
Mario: Yeah!

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.060
Luigi: Let's go!

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.720
Mario: Yeah!

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.480
Luigi: Where's it at?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.760
Mario: I don't know!

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.880
Hey, let's call our friend to find out.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.440
Hello?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.000
NC: Wow, I thought the flower shop scene from The Room was rushed and awkward.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.960
But a strange caterpillar dog walks in and steals the necklace.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.000
Mario: Hey, wait!

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.560
Hey, you, get back here!

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.340
NC: By the way, where is this again?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.160
Do the Japanese think America is just one giant Road Runner background?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.240
Because it's NOT!

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.660
It's mainly these 2 things.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.260
They come across a series of pipes, but once they go down one, the rest of them disappear because you're high.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.620
Mario and Luigi: Whooooooooa!

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.420
Oof!

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.660
NC: They arrive in the Mushroom Kingdom, as Gandalf's shower-drained pubic hair tells them.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.060
Kinoko: Welcome, Mario Bros. The one that summoned you to the Mushroom Kingdom was none other than me.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.080
NC: I'm as excited as Batman's Batcave announcer.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.520
Batcave Announcer: Attention, attention! Family thinks high toy price is a joke!

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.280
NC: No, maybe not that excited.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.200
He tells them how Peach turned down Koopa's wedding proposal, causing him to attack their fair Smurf village.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.360
Kinoko: The evil King Koopa casted a spell on the Mushroom Kingdom, turning the citizens into blocks and stones.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.600
NC: Wow, so Mario's kinda been committing mass genocide.
