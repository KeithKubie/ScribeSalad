00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.130
We have discussed that for two parties
to communicate securely, they typically

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.230
need to use a security protocol that
performs mutual authentication and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.450
key exchange for two end hosts or

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.000
two gateways to use IPsec for
secure communications over the Internet.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.510
The security protocol is
the internet key exchange protocol.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.140
This protocol allows the two parties
to decide the security policies for

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.800
the traffic between them.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.910
This protocol also allows the two
parties to agree on a set of security

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.838
parameters, for example,
which algorithms to use for

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.450
encryption or hashing.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.060
We will discuss shortly
how security associations

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.610
encapsulate these parameters.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.820
The protocol also establishes shared
keys between the two parties.
