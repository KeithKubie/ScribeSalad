00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
I'm sorry about that, Andy, I'm sorry about that, viewers at home. But now I'm

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
back, I'm good and now we're ready for one of my favorite senses, hearing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's alright Lauren, I really had no idea that a smell could bring back such an

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.266
emotional response.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyways the event we're about to do now is all about the sensation and

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
perception of sound.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Really, Andy. And now, I think myself included, that our viewers would like to

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
know what exactly is sound?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, sound is a wave.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now what do you mean by wave?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, let's take a look at sound with our patented UdaciTablet system. So, sound

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.133
is just a pressure wave through the air, and air is just a bunch of molecules

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
spread out like this. And here, each little black dot is just an air molecule.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And when something like a speaker, which I've drawn here, makes a sound, it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
does so by vibrating this part back and forth. So, it would go forward and

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
backwards, and forwards, and backwards, and so on. And this actually causes all

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of the air molecules to bunch up in some places, like this. And you can see

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.866
regions where there are a high density of air molecules. And region where

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
there's a low density. And this, in turn, creates region of high pressure, and

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
regions of low pressure.
