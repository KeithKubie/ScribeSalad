00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt;Well, I've been asked to make a statement
here in Davos, which is a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.900
very interesting place, where you meet all
kinds of different

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.890
personalities and people.
And even though I'm in politics, I was thinking

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.100
I might say a few words
about innovation and how I see it concerning,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.330
particularly, technology,
but I also see that as a political dimension.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.619
We are facing in the world so many major challenges.
I would say that the younger generation today

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.739
is facing the biggest
challenges humankind has ever faced in the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.880
past in its history.
And in order to deal with this, we need to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.129
work together.
We need to pool our forces, whether it's climate

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.819
change, financial
crisis, on poverty and inequality, whether

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.949
it's on issues of migration
and multicultural societies we're living in,

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.739
but we also need to find
innovative solutions.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.460
Innovation from technical solutions, innovations
in politics itself, in

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.009
how we deliberate, how we work, how we use
issues, platforms like web

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.920
tools to have interactive democratic, participative
types of solutions.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.890
But, um, how we create environment of innovation,
an environment of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.340
innovation is not simply chaos.
It is creating the necessary platforms.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.500
I'll take the example, which I think most
people know, is the iPhone

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.049
where you see there is a specific platform.
However, this huge innovation with all the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.679
apps that have been
developed over the last year or two.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.689
So you have a surge of innovation but you
also have a very secure

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.620
environment.
So if you transfer that to politics, that

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.680
would mean creating societies
with a secure environment where people can

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.649
feel secure, secure enough
to take risks to be innovative, to take initiatives.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.170
And that means that we politicians have to
create that environment of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.709
security, of -- of quality, if you like, of
good education, good health

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:19.510
services, and also freedom to take initiative.
I would say, of course, that looking at what's

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.060
going on, what is
fascinating for me is how we bring innovation

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.730
to an area which we don't
too much innovation, which is education.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.239
And now with these new gadgets, new books,
the Kindles, the iPad, and

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.709
so on, I believe we're moving to an area where
the book will become

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.640
much more electronic, much more interactive.
Where you could have a virtual school, cyber-school

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.700
if you like, and
people could all have the information that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
they want through the 'net,
through the Internet.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.640
But also be very interactive.
And the classroom changing from a sort of

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.000
hierarchal structure to much
more of a gathering, where you share the experiences

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.099
and your projects
you've already developed and the communications

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.760
you've had on the 'net
with -- in a live way, in a live group -- much

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.420
more, I would say
democratic, much more collective, much more

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.959
human.
So in fact technology can bring a much more

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.030
humane type of school and
schooling and much more particibility for

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.970
all and much more
personalized development of information and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.469
education processes from
the richer countries to the more -- to the

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.099
poorer countries and
developing countries.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.469
Give access to this common wealth, if you
like, which is, we are

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.129
creating more and more, which is this common
knowledge of humanity

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.180
which has to be accessible to all.
