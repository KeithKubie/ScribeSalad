00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.770
That ends the robot vision
part of particle filtering.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.740
Now if you remember,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.660
we introduced all of these stuff in
order to be able to do tracking.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.650
Okay, we started with common filter
tracking, then we did particle filter.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.590
So, in our next lesson,
what we're going to do is,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.560
we're going to go back
to doing tracking.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.070
And we'll use some simple
particle filter technique for

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.270
doing some visual tracking.
