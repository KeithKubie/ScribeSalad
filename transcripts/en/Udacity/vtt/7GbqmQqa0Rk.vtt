Welcome to Lesson 6. We're at Android Land here at Google. Why are we

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.460
at Android Land? Since this course is

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.570
about building server applications. Well, since we use

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.290
Cloud Endpoints when we built Conference Central,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.645
we now build clients for any kind of

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:20.180
device, Androids, IOS tablet's, whatever. And we

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.600
don't have to change our server application. Hey,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.890
this is Confer Central running on my Android

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.970
device. I can browse conferences. I can register

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.360
to attend them. That's super cool. This is

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.570
exactly what we will cover in this lesson.
