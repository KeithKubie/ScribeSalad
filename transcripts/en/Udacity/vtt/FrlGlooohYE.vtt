00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.370
An algebraic inequality looks
like an algebraic equation but

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.880
it will have an inequality
sign instead of an equal sign.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.910
These are the four inequality signs.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.890
This inequality sign means less than.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.730
This one means less than or equal to.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.670
This one means greater than.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.130
This one means greater than or equal to.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.923
So for example,
if I were to write x is less then 3,

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:27.413
that's what it would look like.

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:32.689
And in words, it's x is less than 3.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.861
If I write this, it means that
x is less than or equal to 3.

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:46.093
If I write this it means
that x is greater than 3.

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:52.330
And if I write this it means that
x is greater than or equal to 3.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.700
Instead of having just one
solution like an equation.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.060
The solution of an inequality
is a range of numbers.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.770
Sometimes, an infinitely large range

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.910
make sure you have these
written down in your notebook.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.280
Now let's focus on x is
less than 3 which means

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.210
x is any number that is less than 3.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.510
Since there are infinitely
many values for x.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.229
You will need to represent
the solution set for

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.261
this inequality on a number line.

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.406
We will begin by putting
an open circle on 3.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:25.532
We are using an open circle to
indicate that 3 is an end point, but

00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:29.050
not part of the solution set for
the inequality.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.900
It's not part of the solution set
because 3 is not less than 3.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.280
It's equal to 3.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.160
The next step is to draw an arrow
over the part of the number line that

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.020
contains the numbers that
satisfy this inequality.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.392
So that means we draw
the arrow to the left.

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:47.939
