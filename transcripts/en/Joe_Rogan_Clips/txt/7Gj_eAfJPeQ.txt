Speaker 1:          00:00          But you, but even if you train, you put it on your back. Let's say, let's say if you put a lama in a backpack, say you got like a fucking Cafaro backpack, good luck stuff. The alarm in there, you had the whole Lauw zipped it in, had it, okay, go over that fence. He'd be like, well, my buddy who's a guide in Alaska, my buddy Chad, he said that they were climbing up this mountain. It was a fucking nightmare. Like they like just slogging up this steep mountain just like, and they were like looking up and they're like, God damn, this is a nightmare. You know, you're making like inches. Just like, ugh. Oh, and you got a backpack. And it just like, when is this going to be over? And don't try not to think about digging. Let's take a break, you know? And they just hear this and they just see this grizzly with an elk in its mouth and it just bounds up the mountain.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It just goes Shagun Shagun right by them with, uh, with, uh, with, uh, and just goes up over the mountain and over the ridge. Just no problem in 12 seconds. And they were like, well that's a grizzly. That's how strong a fucking girls face. And this is me, Jesus Christ, I don't want to get that's I'm so terrified of, I'm terrified. I don't want to fuck get fucked up by a chimpanzee or sheep bones. He will eat my face and my balls. So I don't want that. And I definitely don't want to get attacked by a grizzly because they'll start eating you when you're still alive. And that's a problem. Most of the time grizzlies eat people though or most of the time of grizzlies kill people. They're not killing someone because they want to eat them or killing someone because you startled them and they're with their female, the females with their cubs.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Oh that's most of what happens when, what are you supposed to do when a grizzly just pray? Well if it's a female grizzly, you are literally better off letting her fuck you up, right? It just curl up in a ball. You're supposed to put your hand behind your neck, lay in a fetal position and don't let her get access to your organs. Cause she wants to chew your Oregon's apart. Jesus. Yeah. It's one of the reasons why it's really important to have a strong backpack. He was strong. Backpacks will fuck up that backpack while you're on on your, you know, underneath, curl up in a fetal position. But that's assuming you can survive that she's probably gonna break your arms. She's probably going to snap your legs bite into you in ways you can't imagine the kind of force and power she can generate. I mean she's trying to immobilize you.

Speaker 1:          02:13          She wants to mobilize you as a threat to our children. But a male, if a male is trying to kill you, it's usually because he's starving to death. They don't recognize people as a food source. They rarely people. So that mail PR, it probably has never eaten a person. It's one of the reasons why it's safer to be in a place where they hunt. Grizzlies cause in a place where they hunt Grizzlies Grizzlies, he's a person, he goes, fuck this, they'll smell you and get the fuck out of there. But like Yellowstone, they haven't hunt grizzlies there in forever, so people still get jacked. They're stupid. They get jack there every couple of years now it gets killed. We have a gun with me. You should, but you might not be able to get to it and you also have to be able to prepare to pull it out and shoot quickly. You can't think that just because you have a gun you're going to be okay. No, cause you don't hear him coming up on you come up. So they move so fast. They run, they run fast as a dog and they're huge. Is that true? Yes. There they run fast as fuck man. And they're huge. It's a giant animal man. 800 pounds. Think about that.

Speaker 2:          03:11          I just stumbled across a story about, this is happening about bear spray didn't work and it was attacking the guide and the the, the client went to grab the glock out of a pack and it didn't fire and then the bear came after him. So he tried to throw the gun to the other guy and then it didn't a deck I just ran into. I guess I'll just have to follow this guy who died. It doesn't, I don't, I didn't find, no, I mean it happens all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:38          That story is Rinella. Story, uh, Rinella and Remy Warren and Yannis Portallis and uh, our friends, they, uh, they got attacked while they were in a fog neck island in Alaska. Jesus. Yeah. Blog now. Yes. Like two years ago. And Remy came on here and told the story and it's fucking terrible. God, what happened? Well, they killed an elk and um, they had hung it in a tree and they had taken some of the meat back. Cause you know, you have to hike out of fog. NAC is particularly dense. It's very, very dense. Vich Mitch, like, remember when we were on Prince of Wales Island? We went on that intense dense. Yeah. Well it's like that, but even worse. Chrisleys everywhere. Yes. Grizzlies everywhere with this huge problem with that. When we were on an island, that island had black bears. Yeah. Which weirdly enough, they're not as dangerous, but they are more predatory towards people. I want to try and spike Telmate and spiked collar and I want my guns like close clothes, iron man suit. That's right. I want to be able to correct shoot rockets out of my hands. That's right. And I want to be able to electrify it when the, when the thing bites, yes, kill it, and then immediately cut its head off and put it on a steak. So all the other grizzly bears, no, not to fuck. That's exactly right. Okay. There you go. We're on like a man.
