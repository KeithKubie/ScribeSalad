00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.380
Easter eggs and references to other movies
have long been prominent in Hollywood, with

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.049
movies across every genre seemingly squeezing
in as many fun nods and connective inclusions

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.560
as they possibly can.Disney are famous for
it - pretty much every Disney movie ever made

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.529
has a "Hidden Mickey" in it, for example - but
that's not where such Easter eggs and references

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.300
stop.Sometimes, however subtle, Disney movies
can include things that connect them to other

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.290
specific Disney offerings and, in this video,
we're going to take a look at just a few examples

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.290
of that.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.780
Here are ten amazing Disney movies that are
secretly connected to each other.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.879
Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.890
Mid and post-credits scenes are extremely
prevalent in movies at the moment, and they

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.360
have been for quite some time now, so it's
always a good idea to stick around in the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.340
theatre after the credits start to roll.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
A prime example of why that's the case came
in the credits of 2003's Finding Nemo.Just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.879
after the "special thanks" section started
scrolling on to the screen, none other than

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.520
Mike from Monsters, Inc. makes an appearance,
swimming across the screen and giving a look

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.780
towards the camera whilst wearing a diving
mask and snorkel.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.000
Apparently, the marine life in the world Nemo
inhabits live in the same world as the monsters

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.579
from Monsters, Inc.!

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.329
Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life
Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life share something

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.630
of a tedious connection in the form of a trailer
caravan that can be seen in both movies - meaning

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.780
the two movies must take place in the same
world.The trailers are definitely one and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.700
the same, as they look identical to each other,
except the one in A Bugâ€™s Life is noticeably

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.770
older and more decrepit, and is surrounded
by noticeably dryer vegetation, while the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.990
one in Monsters, Inc., where Randall is sent
from the factory via a door, has humans in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.070
it, is in far better condition, and is surrounded
by taller, lush grass and has a tree hanging

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.480
overhead.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.540
Tarzan and Beauty and the Beast
In the 1999 Tarzan movie, in the scene that

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.149
Tarzan's friend Terk - the gorilla voiced
by Rosie O'Donnell - makes a mess in the camp,

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.950
there's a tea set shown on screen that looks
very familiar.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.729
It's none other than Mrs. Potts and her son
Chip from Beauty and the Beast!And if you're

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.180
wondering how a tea set from a French castle
ended up in the jungle, consider this theory:

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.730
Jane is Belle's great, great, great granddaughter!

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.980
Look at their similar dress sense, their taste
in animalistic men, and their crazy white-moustached

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.980
dads!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.870
It's so obvious!

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.450
Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast
In Aladdin, there is a scene in which Jasmine's

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.900
father - the Sultan - can be seen stacking
a menagerie of animal figurines that links

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.550
the movie to another Disney offering and,
potentially, to two other Disney movies as

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.620
well.Amongst the collection of figurines,
you can definitely see Beast from Beauty and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
the Beast, but it could also be argued that
two of the other figurines on the pile are

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.110
Shere Khan from The Jungle Book and the crocodile
from Peter Pan.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.760
We'll leave those last two for you to decide.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.350
The Jungle Book and Aladdin
In 2016's live action reimagining of Rudyard

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.019
Kipling's The Jungle Book, the ruler of the
Bandar-log, King Louie - voiced by the inimitable

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.230
Christopher Walken - was presented as an ape
version of a mafia boss, and he had all the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.970
necessary riches to show for it.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.299
In fact, he was something of a hoarder, housing
a large collection of treasures in his temple.One

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.190
of those many treasures that he had in his
possession happened to be the Genie's lamp

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.440
from Aladdin, another Disney movie, suggesting
that the two movies took place in the same

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.720
universe.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.920
Zootopia and Big Hero 6
2016's brilliant Zootopia is a... well...

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.409
a utopia of Easter eggs - yeah, we really
did say that - with one very subtle reference

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.709
being made to Disney's 2014 superhero movie
Big Hero 6.It's hidden in plain sight inside

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.870
the office of Idris Elba's short-tempered
buffalo character, Chief Bogo.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.269
Hanging on the wall in said office, there's
a calendar bearing a photograph of the cityscape

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.830
of San Fransokyo, which was the fictional
high-tech metropolis that was the home of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.121
the titular superheroes in the aformentioned
movie, suggesting that it is in the same world

00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:55.760
as Zootopia.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.110
Finding Dory and WALL-E
So, apparently there's something about calendar

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.959
Easter eggs in Disney movies, because another
of 2016's offerings links to another Disney

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.220
movie via a calendar.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.659
It's in the Finding Dory scene when Hank has
Dory suspended over a massive aquarium in

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.810
a plastic cup.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.299
There's a work station in the background that's
lit just enough for viewers to make out a

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.310
Wall-E calendar.This probably doesn't suggest
that Wall-E takes place in the same world

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.000
as Finding Dory - given that Wall-E is set
in 2805 - but more suggests that Wall-E is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.030
a movie that exists in the same world as it,
which is an interesting twist.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.190
The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King,
Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.240
In The Hunchback of Notre Dame, there's a
single scene that manages to link to the movie

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.230
to no less than three other Disney movies
in one foul swoop.While Quasimodo is singing

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.650
the song "Out There", the scene pans out to
focus on the street he's in.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.320
On that street, you can see Belle from The
Beauty and the Beast wandering around reading

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.400
a book, you can see Pumbaa from The Lion King
being carried around on a pole, and you can

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.750
see The Magic Carpet from Aladdin being shaken
out by a street merchant, meaning all four

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.720
of these movies are interconnected!

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.670
The Little Mermaid, Tangled and Frozen
Okay, this one's a little more complex and

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.220
is more of a theory than a confirmed connection
- but that just makes it more interesting.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.110
The gist of the theory is this:Elsa and Anna's
parents died during a storm at sea three years

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.720
prior to the events of Frozen.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.360
Tangled came out three years before Frozen.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.830
Could it be that they were sailing to the
wedding of Flynn Ryder and Rapunzel?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.251
Geographically, it works - Tangled is set
in Germany and Frozen is set in Norway, which

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:27.130
requires a journey across the sea.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.443
Moreover, it is theorised that their shipwreck
is the one that Ariel explored in The Little

00:05:31.443 --> 00:05:32.443
Mermaid.

00:05:32.443 --> 00:05:35.740
Given that the journey from Norway to Germany
would involve sailing past Denmark - where

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.220
The Little Mermaid is set - that makes sense
too!

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.500
Cool, huh?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.830
Toy Story and Every Other Disney Pixar Movie
There's one thing that links pretty much every

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.990
single Disney Pixar movie - and that's the
famous Pizza Planet truck, which made its

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.350
first appearance on screen in the 1995 classic,
Toy Story.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.460
Since it first appeared alongside Woody and
Buzz Lightyear more than twenty years ago,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.050
it has literally appeared in every single
subsequent Pixar release to date, apart from

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.550
The Incredibles - although it did make an
appearance in the video game for that movie.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.900
It can be seen in Wall-E when Eve scans it
for plant life, in Ratatouille on a bridge

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.590
in the background of the document chase scene,
and even as an asteroid in The Good Dinosaur,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.320
just for a few examples.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.140
