00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.423
- [Instructor] We're already familiar

00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:03.060
with the chi-squared statistic.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.640
If you're not, I encourage you to review

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.880
the videos on that.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.040
And we've already done
some hypothesis testing

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.980
with the chi-squared statistic,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.166
and we've even done
some hypothesis testing

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.580
based on two-way tables.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.960
And now we're going to extend that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.915
by thinking about a chi-squared test

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.915
for association between two variables.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.030
So let's say that we suspect
that someone's foot length

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.100
is related to their hand length.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.220
That these things are not independent.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.840
Well, what we can do is
set up a hypothesis test.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.793
And remember, the null hypothesis

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:41.860
in a hypothesis test, is
to always assume no news.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.560
So what we could say is here is

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.520
that there is no association.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.543
No association between,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
between foot and hand length.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.640
Another way to think about it
is that they are independent.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.330
And oftentimes what
we're doing is called a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.930
chi-squared test for independence.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.280
And then our alternative
hypothesis would be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.610
our suspicion there is an association.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840
There is an association.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.920
So, foot and hand length
are not independent.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.920
So what we can then do
is go to a population,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.990
and we can randomly sample it.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.930
And so let's say we
randomly sample 100 folks.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.900
And for all of those 100 folks,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.000
we figure out whether
their right hand is longer,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.380
their left hand is longer,
or both hands are the same.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.820
And we also do that for the feet,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.790
and we tabulate all of the data.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230
And this is the data that we actually get.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.090
Now it's worth thinking
about this for a second

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.810
on how what we just did is different

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.910
from a chi-squared test for homogeneity.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.290
And a chi-squared test for homogeneity,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370
we sample from two different populations

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.248
where we look at two different groups,

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.400
and we see whether the distribution

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.780
of a certain variable amongst those

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660
two different groups is the same.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.610
Here we are just sampling from one group,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.360
but we're thinking about
two different variables

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.090
for that one group.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.080
We're thinking about feet length,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.030
and we're thinking about hand length.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.850
And so you can see here,
that 11 folks had both their

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.630
right hand longer and
their right foot longer.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.430
Three folks had their right hand longer,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.500
but their left foot was longer.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.900
And then eight folks had
their right hand longer,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.780
but both feet were the same.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.660
Likewise, we had nine
people where their left foot

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.020
and hand was longer,
but you had two people

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.350
where the left hand was longer,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.760
but the right foot was longer.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.750
And we can go through all of these.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.510
But to do our chi-squared test,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.470
we would've said, what
would be the expected value

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.520
of each of these data points if we assumed

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.560
that the null hypothesis was true?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.440
That there was no association
between foot and hand length.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100
So to help us do that,
I'm going to make a total

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.960
of our columns here, and also
a total of our rows here.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.000
Let me draw a line here,
so we know what's going on.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.310
And so, what are the
total number of people

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.490
who had a longer right hand?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.010
Well, it's going to be
11 plus three plus eight,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.800
which is 22.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.420
The total number of people
who had a longer left hand

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.920
is two plus nine plus 14, which is 25.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.550
And then the total number
of people whose hands had

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.023
the same length, 12 plus 13 plus 28,

00:03:36.973 --> 00:03:40.600
25 plus 28, that is 53.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.950
And then if I were to total this column,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.950
22 plus 25 is 47, plus 53,
we get 100, right over here.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.440
And then if we total the number of people

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.090
who had a longer right
foot, 11 plus two plus 12,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.300
is 13 plus 12, that is 25.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.970
Longer left foot, three plus nine plus 13,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.820
that's also 25.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.720
And then we can either add these up,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.770
and we would get 50, or we could say,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.690
hey 25 plus 25 plus what is 100?

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.150
Well, that is going to be equal to 50.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.450
Now to figure out these expected values,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.810
remember, we're going to
figure out the expected values

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.840
assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.660
Assuming that these
distributions are independent.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.660
That feet length and hand length
are independent variables.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.770
Well, if they are independent,
which we are assuming,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.770
then our best estimate is that
22% have a longer right hand,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.680
and our best estimate is that
25% have a longer right foot.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.620
And so out of 100, you would expect

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
0.22 times 0.25 times 100 to have a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.640
longer right hand and foot.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.180
I'm just multiplying the probabilities,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.850
which you would do if these
were independent variables.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.020
And so 0.22 times 0.25, let's see,

00:05:00.378 --> 00:05:03.970
one fourth of 22 is 5 1/2,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.970
so this is going to be equal to 5.5.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.110
Now what number would you expect to have a

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.050
longer right hand, but a longer left foot?

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.050
So that would be 0.22
times 0.25 times 100.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.910
Well, we already calculated
what that would be.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.060
That would be 5.5.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.670
And then to figure out the expected number

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.010
that would have a longer right hand,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.500
but both feet would be the same length,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.180
we could multiply 22 out
of 100 times 50 out of 100

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.470
times 100, which is
going to be half of 22,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.560
which is equal to 11.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.030
And we can keep going.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.740
This value right over here would be

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.740
0.25 times 0.25 times
100, 25 times 25 is 625,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.160
so that would be 6.25.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.950
This value right over here
would be 0.25 times 0.25

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.573
times 100, which is again, 6.25.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.570
And then this value right over here,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.250
a couple of ways we can get it.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.250
We can multiply 0.25 times 50 times 100,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.940
which would get us to 12.5,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.920
or we could have said
this plus this plus this

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.881
has to equal 25, so this would be 12.5.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.170
And on this expected
value, we can figure out

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.170
because 5.5 plus 6.25 plus
this is going to equal 25.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.360
So let's see, 5.5 plus 6.25 is 11.75.

00:06:34.524 --> 00:06:39.524
11.75 plus 13.25 is equal to 25.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.460
Same thing over here.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.030
This would be 13.25, 'cause this is 11.75

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.610
plus 13.25 is equal to 25.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.200
If we add these two together, we get 26.5.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.220
26.5 plus what is equal to 53?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.000
Well, it'd be equal to another 26.5.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.130
Now once you figure out all
of your expected values,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.890
that's a good time to
test your conditions.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.020
The first condition is that
you took a random sample.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.970
So let's assume we had done that.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.930
The second condition is
that your expected value

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.510
for any of the data points has
to be at least equal to five.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.840
And we can see that all
of our expected values are

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.310
at least equal to five.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.700
The actual data points we got

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.080
do not have to be equal to five.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.960
So it's okay that we got a two here,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.440
because the expected value
here is five or larger.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.800
And then the last condition
is the independence condition.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.750
That either we are
sampling with replacement

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.680
or that we have to feel comfortable

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.920
that our sample size is no more
than 10% of the population.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.040
So let's assume that
that happened as well.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.100
So assuming we met all
of those conditions,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.170
we are ready to calculate
our chi-squared statistic.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.530
And so what we're going to do,

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.430
is for every data point,
we're going to find the

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.370
difference between the data point,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.320
11 minus the expected, minus 5.5,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.900
squared over the expected,
so I did that one.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.230
Now I'll do this one.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.230
So plus three minus 5.5 squared over 5.5

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.590
plus, now I'll do this one,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.440
eight minus 11 squared over 11,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.440
then I'll do this one, two
minus 6.25 squared over 6.25.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:27.910
And I'll keep doing it.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.890
I'm going to do it for all
nine of these data points.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.830
And I actually calculated
this ahead of time

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.460
to save some time.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.070
And so if you do this for
all nine of the data points,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.070
you're going to get a
chi-squared statistic of 11.942.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.140
Now before we calculate the P-value,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:44.973
we're going to have to think about

00:08:44.973 --> 00:08:47.300
what are our degrees of freedom?

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.120
Now we have a three-by-three table here,

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.700
so one way to think about it,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.290
it's the number of rows minus one,

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.710
times the number of columns minus one,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.050
and this is two times two,
which is equal to four.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.700
Another way to think
about it is if you know

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.350
four of these data points
and you know the totals,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.670
then you can figure out
the other five data points.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.420
And so now we are ready
to calculate a P-value.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.050
And you can do that using a calculator,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.730
and you can do that using
a chi-squared table,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.220
but let's say we did
it using a calculator,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.873
and we get a P-value of 0.018

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.450
And just to remind ourselves what this is,

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.810
this is the probability of getting a

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.810
chi-squared statistic at
least this large or larger.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.810
And so next, we do what we always do

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.170
with hypothesis testing.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.540
We compare this to our significance level.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.500
And we actually should have
set our significance level

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.333
from the beginning.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.430
So let's just assume that when we set up

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.110
our hypotheses here, we also said

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.290
that we want a significance level of 0.05.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.270
You really should do this before
you calculate all of this.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.550
But then you compare your P-value

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.680
to your significance level, and we see

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.830
that this P-value is a good bit less

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.320
than our significance level.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.060
And so one way to think about it is,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.370
we got all these expected values assuming

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.660
that the null hypothesis was true.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.450
But the probability of getting a result

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.850
this extreme or more
extreme is less than 2%,

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.020
which is lower than
our significance level.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.020
And so this will lead us to
reject our null hypothesis

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.640
and it suggests to us that
there is an association

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.153
between hand length and foot length.
