00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA........ (You ok?)

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.820
I'm gonna pass out and give me some time

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.340
Whooo!

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.340
Whats up guys welcome back. I'm Grant Thompson the King of Random Lance Stewart here and today (cool)

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.980
And today we're down on Hollywood and Vine trying to experiment with Bunch O Balloons and helium

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.470
It's gonna be great. It's gonna be lit. No it already was lit. All right

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.060
So you guys pretty much know that you can fill up a hundred water balloons in 60 seconds.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.840
Now what would happen if we actually got these water balloons and filled it all with helium instead of water?What would happen? What would happen?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.020
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA...Batman

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.140
So the problem, I'm seeing is trying to connect the balloons to the helium

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.960
You can see it's obviously not meant to be

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.759
So wondering if we cut the ends of a balloon like snipped it here and snipped it there

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.829
maybe we can make some kind of a

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.468
almost like a shrink wrap idea and then use some electrical tape to connect it that may be enough to get the job done.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.200
Ok so cool we got our little system

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.140
Jerry Rigged the question is is this going to blow it like a balloon first, or these going to blow up first? You gonna try?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.260
Yeah lets try it out.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.760
Alright.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.780
Now, the way this helium tank works is all we have to do is push this little nozzle up, and it'll start releasing the gas.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.060
So this is the moment of truth... is this little balloon connection going to blow up or the balloon's gonna blow up. let's find out...

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
Okay, here. We go. Sorry. I'm excited to see it. So you hold them up at this angle

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.160
3.. 2.. 1..

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.280
ooh!

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.440
That one definitely blew up. yeah, let's put some pressure on that okay, so you can see how..

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.140
When we add the helium here it actually blows up the connection, so we're gonna have to add

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.570
Add some more tape and maybe add some pressure on it with your hand that might help

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.960
Yeah

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
So there's a couple ways we can either hold it, with a hand here which might work or we could put more electrical or duck tape on it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.989
to kind of form like a sleeve so I'm going to hold it first and see if we can just fist it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.620
there we go, oh wow! there we go

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.480
(Laughing)

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
that almost blew out my eardrum

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.989
They're not going off on their own, but look at this we can actually

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.009
Look at that will they all go floating everywhere.. what if we just, What if we just get the whole bunch and push them

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.100
They're everywhere! you know that idea half works. Yeah, which I get these, why are these not filling up

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.600
There we go..

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.920
it's because all these tubes, oh yeah, you gotta get them all going at once I think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
So if there's a way that we could like stop. How about you get all the straws and bend them down? These straws?Yeah

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.160
here we go..

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.420
Oh That's cool.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.920
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.400
OOOH!!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.720
There we go

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.780
There we go

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.700
It actually works that is awesome

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.048
Whoo instant Helium party that's kind of cool and the coolest thing is we got a couple more bunches

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.809
So we can we can add some color yeah lets do it. guys it worked

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.180
I wasn't really expecting that I was hoping it would but it was like an instant helium party just,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.060
phsssh.. phoo!

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.580
there we go the ceiling is covered with little balloons, now this one just fell down

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.019
All right, so cool. We got a viable idea. Let's snip this one

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.590
Orange or green let's go with the green.. green it is. now I'm wondering like since we're just holding on to it anyway

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.190
I do you think we could just?

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.220
Make a try that actually hold it on yeah, okay. I'll tell you when

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.900
HA HA HA HA

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.380
i'm trying

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.380
whoo all right

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.358
how did it on the ceiling? did you see that it popped on the ceiling oh my God

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.130
What was crazy about that last bunch? Is there was you see that balloon closest to you?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.819
Just got like three times as big as the other ones. and it was like hanging right by your face

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.560
and I could feel you flinching. Yeah. I was like. ahh its gonna pop right in my face again

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020
WOOOOH! There they go those ones got really big look at this one up above your head. It looks like a pear wow

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.890
There they go for some reason that one worked out pretty well. That was like one of the best ones we've had

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:59.649
Okay, I can't reach it now too short yeah, so if we hold it out a little bit and then you hear that sound

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.519
Here we go

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.489
And away they go, you're all free go back to your home now. I have a party house. You know it's cool now

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.559
We've got this set up we can just literally pull this off

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.659
Perfect and put the next one on that works perfectly. I think we got it figured out

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.079
I got I got another bunch of balloons here. this one just fell I guess it's losing air

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.479
That's one thing. I was wondering is once the helium's in them is the helium Gonna escape

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.719
Yeah, I mean it seems to be that they're escaping in the only reason

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.429
I think they are because they're not actually tied there is just this little

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.419
Rubber band around it So it's definitely escaping a little bit

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.989
I feel like water doesn't escape from this, but air is definitely getting out of it

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.359
So what we're finding if we have this thing jammed up tight the helium is only going into certain straws

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.270
But if we can pull it away a little bit even it though and hold it in place

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.560
We can even out and if we add the gas slowly enough, we get a relatively even pressure

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.460
Yeah, we're going with our third batch here. This is the orange third tries a charm. here We go

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.620
All right, go ahead and push them off

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.580
You're free run away fly away

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.960
(laughing)

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.500
What i'm finding is very consistent here is only about half of the balloons blow up

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.219
And then we have to go and weed through and collect all these straws and pull em out of the way

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.520
Bend them over and then we can fill the rest them up, not sure exactly why that would be the case, but I mean

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.430
We have to cut the circulation off cause if not all the air is gonna escape through these

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.829
And it doesn't go through the other one grab them in the base there and let's just see what that does we go. Oh

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.039
There we go.. that looks cool

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.130
Like a flower that's right very pretty should i release yeah, add more take them off

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.050
Whoo they just went everywhere. I love how it's just like a fistful of balloons

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.729
They all go everywhere can we talk about how this balloons popped, but it's still stuck to the ceiling like that

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.598
Yeah, that green one right there. Go ahead and explain that to me. I have no idea how but it tends to have happened

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.699
you're right. It looks like it's sitting on the floor, but it's upside down. now your house is getting colorful

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.520
Look over here in the corner. They're all hiding out over here at a party house now start raving

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:12.049
So guys as you can see Bunch O Balloons and helium's was a sucess one stuck to my hair.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.920
(Laughing) It's stuck to your forehead

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.680
Let it go up these things like you man things like you huge success guys Bunch O Baloons and helium was a a ton of fun

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.989
Big thanks to lance Stewart for letting us hang out with him today to crash his hat

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.479
We made a huge mess that means we're having a great time

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.449
I'll put a link down the description below so you can go check him out earlier today

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.499
We were letting him on fire

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:32.539
and you can go see that on his vlog. that was pretty crazy

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.399
And we deepend in my voice and almost sounds demonic just off of a balloon it sounds amazing

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.249
it's one of those transitional periods in life where your voice changes, but on a

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.830
tremendous scale

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.490
What were your impressions about the experiment today? It was insane. It was great

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.939
I mean, I definitely thought that this was probably gonna end up popping here

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.659
But we figured it out, and we closed that up and then they all went all over the place now

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.099
we have a party house the other thing we weren't sure about is if these little o-rings that actually hold the balloons closed for the

00:06:58.099 --> 00:06:59.629
Most part they do although

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.869
It does seem that over time they loose and the balloons start dropping down from the ceiling as well

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:08.299
But it's a good short-term solution great party trick should definitely give it a try. Thanks for joining us for this experiment guys

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.300
We'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.960
(popping balloons)

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.280
ha ha. i can't reach it..

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:36.360
(Outro)
