00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.420
Two functions, f and
g, are described below.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.260
Which of these statements
about f and g is true?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.720
So they defined
function f as kind

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.560
of a traditional linear
equation right over here.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.070
And this right over here is g.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.150
So this right over
here is g of x.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.530
And that also looks
like a linear function.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.080
We see it's a kind of a
downward sloping line.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.390
So let's look at our choices
and see which of these are true.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.299
f and g are both increasing, and
f is increasing faster than g.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.960
Well, when I look at g--
Well, first of all, g

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.390
is definitely decreasing.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970
So we already know
that that's false.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.660
And f is also decreasing.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.920
We see here it has
a negative slope.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.620
Every time we move forward
3 in the x direction,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.180
we're going to move down 7
in the vertical direction.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.730
So neither of these
are increasing

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.080
so that's definitely not right.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.400
f and g are both increasing.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.640
Well, that's
definitely not right.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.550
So we know that both f
and g are decreasing.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.390
So this first choice says
they're both decreasing, and g

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.400
is decreasing faster than f.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.160
So let's see what
the slope on g is.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.380
So the slope on g is every time
we move 1 in the x direction,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.510
positive 1 in the
x direction, we

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.460
move down 2 in the y direction.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.990
So for g of x, if we were
to write our change in y

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.750
over our change in x-- which
is our slope-- our change in y

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.030
over change in x, when we
move one in the x direction,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060
positive 1 in the
x direction, we

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.120
move down 2 in the y direction.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.960
So our change in y over
change in x is negative 2.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.420
So g has a slope of negative 2.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.300
f has a slope of negative 7/3.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.120
Negative 7/3 is the same
thing as negative 2 and 1/3.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.870
So f's slope is more negative.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.070
So it is decreasing faster.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.520
So g is not decreasing faster
than f. f is decreasing faster

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.020
than g.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.750
So this is not right.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.440
And then we have this choice--
f and g are both decreasing,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.010
and f is decreasing
faster than g.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.960
This is right, right over here.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.870
We have this last choice-- g is
increasing but f is decreasing.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.670
We know that's not true.
g is actually decreasing.
