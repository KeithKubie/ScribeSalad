00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.100
Trauma occurs in many forms

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.280
ranging from verbal to physical and our sexual

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.940
Whether you've personally experienced abuse or have witnessed it

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.820
We want you to know that it's not your fault nor are you alone

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.720
Not only is it hard to talk about

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.140
But it follows you even after it's over

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.180
We hope wherever you are today that you're in a safer place

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.080

Here are 7 ways childhood trauma follows you into adulthood

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.560
1. you can't seem to remember much of your younger years at all

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.000
Do your high school years feel like a blur?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.040
You might find yourself drawing a blank when someone brings up a childhood memory

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.820
And you can't recall the same one

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.380
People with childhood trauma may experience

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.720
"Flashbulb" memories

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.580
In which they remember vivid moments, but not the full event

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.280
When you look back on the past

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.220
It's made up of more black holes than fully written chapters

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.140
You might even feel like someone or something has stolen your childhood

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.520
Depending on the severity of the events

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.220
2. You find yourself in toxic relationships

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.500
If you've ever watched or read the 
"Perks of Being a Wallflower"

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.300
You'd be familiar with the quote

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.800
"We accept the love. We think we deserve"

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.460
When you grow up in a household devoid of love and emotional support

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.380
Healthy relationships are a foreign concept to you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.260
In fact

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.640
Many people who face childhood trauma often adopt the fearful avoidant attachment style

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.460
Where they want emotionally close relationships

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020
But find it hard to trust or depend on others completely

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.960
Consequently without knowing it you might seek destructive relationships

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.940
Mistaking the mistreatment and uncertainty for excitement

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.320
3. Or you feel like you don't deserve love at all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320
People who experienced abuse in their childhoods

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.220
Might avoid romantic relationships altogether

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.740
Believing they can't be loved by others

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.940
This is known as the anxious preoccupied attachment

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.160
Where the individual wants to establish emotional intimacy with others

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
But often fears rejection

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.320
As a result

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.520
Vulnerability is usually avoided

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.760
When they've only been hurt by people they once trusted

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.440
This kind of trauma doesn't just ache

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.180
It ruins you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.700
4. You develop Passive-agressiveness

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
Did you grow up in a household with anger all the time?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.740
It can be so scarring that you might even grow fearful of this emotion

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.800
You learned at a young age that none of your emotional needs were important

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.120
So you've only resorted to burying or suppressing them

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.780
As you reach adulthood

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.140
You'll continue to exercise passive aggressive behavior

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.160
Because straightforward communication was avoided when you were a child

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620
5. Negative self-talk is amplified

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.000
Childhood trauma gets into victims heads

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.960
And makes them believe they won't ever be good enough

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.400
It's not something they can just snap out of or fix with positivity

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.460
It's scary

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.240
And real how convincing their parents might have been

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.960
When their words and actions cut them deep

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.920
6. You ride an emotional roller coaster

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.800
You might either feel too much or not enough at

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.480
All trauma can cause a disruption in your emotional well-being

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.200
Signs include trouble making decisions

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.900
Impulsive behavior

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.460
And random outbursts of anger or frustration

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.420
7. You don't know who you are

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.200
Identity is difficult

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.140
But it seems more impossible to grasp or pin down when you face childhood trauma

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.880
It's slippery like a fish

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.800
And the more you try to see yourself

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.920
The less you begin to recognize who you thought you were

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.780
