00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:11.583
I'm 16 years old, and my name is Shahruz Ghaemi.

00:00:11.583 --> 00:00:15.547
My father came from Iran,

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.118
and my mother came from China.

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:19.112
I speak some Chinese,

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:22.126
I understand some Farsi,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.801
and, recently, I've started to study Spanish.

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.276
I attend one of the most competitive schools in the city,

00:00:30.276 --> 00:00:31.756
if not the country.

00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.106
The educational system is validly criticized

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:40.608
as being broken and dysfunctional.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.478
The primary goal should be,

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.010
like the internet,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.750
as a great leveler.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.815
It ought to be able to provide everybody

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.401
in America with opportunity,

00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.511
but an administrative culture that focuses on

00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:01.062
standardized testing does us no good at all

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:02.209
because there is a difference

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:04.559
between knowledge and understanding.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:10.333
My jazz piano teacher has really shown me

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.863
new ways of thinking about learning.

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:15.230
Jazz really required me

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.066
to use a different set of skills

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.202
than I'd been using for classical piano

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:24.317
because I had to infuse music with my own touches.

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:29.439
It's one thing to regurgitate

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.448
a fancy maneuver you've learned,

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:37.419
but it's another thing to be able to improvise

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:42.354
a harmonically stable piece by yourself.

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.727
And, if you truly understand something,

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:47.029
it's far more important to you,

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.999
it's more likely to be retained,

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.221
it's far more likely to have some sort of meaning to you.
