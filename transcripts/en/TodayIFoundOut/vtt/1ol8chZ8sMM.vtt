00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.340
The Rockstar with a PhD... and 8 other Facinating
Facts

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
1.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.240
A mentally ill man, William Chester Minor,
while a patient at the Broadmoor Asylum for

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
the Criminally Insane in Britain, became the
largest contributor to the first edition of

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.040
the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.779
He later cut off his penis and was sent back
to the United States…

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.779
(QF 647)

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:20.779
2.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.790
During mating, the force of the honeybee male’s
ejaculation is so strong, the resulting process,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.550
including the rupture of the drone’s penis,
is sometimes audible making a “pop” noise.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680
The price of the drone’s 1 to 5 second sexual
escapade is his life, as his reproductive

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.000
bits are ripped from his body after climax…
what a buzz kill.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(QF 610)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
3.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.910
It wouldn’t be until 15 years after basketball
was invented before someone got the bright

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.360
idea of putting a hole in the bottom of the
basket to allow the ball to pass through so

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.510
it wouldn’t have to be manually retrieved
every time someone made a shot.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.510
(QF 576)

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.510
4.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.200
Stanfordrejects.com redirects to Berkeley.edu…

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.820
(QF 638)

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.820
5.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.510
Since February of 2012, Rialto, California
has required all police officers to wear a

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.759
camera to monitor all interactions with the
public.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.260
After this practice was instituted, the number
of complaints to the department dropped by

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.260
88%.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.600
Further, the number of instances of the police
using “force” on people dropped 60%.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.210
As the chief of police there said, “When
you put a camera on a police officer, they

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.930
tend to behave a little better, follow the
rules a little better…”

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.679
One imagines that knowing that footage is
available also cuts down on made up complaints.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:30.700
(QF 639)

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
6.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.729
In the original The Little Mermaid story,
the Little Mermaid endures excruciating pain

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.719
“like walking on sharp swords” as a price
for getting legs.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.270
Also, the Prince falls in love with someone
else and marries them instead.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.780
The Little Mermaid is given the chance to
become a mermaid again, if she kills the prince

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.750
and drips is blood on her feet, but she chooses
not to and throws her body into the sea where

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.100
it disintegrates and she turns into a “daughter
of the air” spirit.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
(QF 633)

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100
7.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.509
In 1955, the largest solid gold statue in
existence (Phra Phuttha Maha Suwan Patimakon)

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.259
was accidentally discovered when a 13th or
14th century statue of Buddha that was covered

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.190
in plaster was being moved.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.830
Being significantly heavier than anticipated,
the ropes used to move the statue snapped

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.350
and the statue fell, breaking off some of
the plaster.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.360
Underneath, they found the statue of solid
gold estimated to be worth about a quarter

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.120
of a billion dollars just from the raw value
of the gold today.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.240
(QF 625)

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
8.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.140
The hit Carpenters song “We’ve Only Just
Begun”, ranked as the 405th best song of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.060
all time by Rolling Stone magazine, was originally
written for a wedding themed Crocker National

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.060
Bank commercial.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.060
(QF 586)

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.060
9.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.860
The lead guitarist in one of the greatest
rock bands of all time, Queen, has a PhD in

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.860
Physics.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.720
He began the program before he joined up with
Queen, but then dropped out, finally going

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.890
back and completing his PhD in 2007.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.930
(QF 577)
