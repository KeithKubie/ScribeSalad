and I felt at some stage that I want to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
and I felt at some stage that I want to
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919
and I felt at some stage that I want to
go to university but it was mainly for

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
go to university but it was mainly for
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.650

clear pattern of what it will be it's I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210
clear pattern of what it will be it's I
 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.360

read books I read about mercury another

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
read books I read about mercury another
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.410

but there was no connection so after the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
but there was no connection so after the
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.590
but there was no connection so after the
army when I was accepted to the Technion

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
army when I was accepted to the Technion
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.270
army when I was accepted to the Technion
I met a friend in the Technion yard and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
I met a friend in the Technion yard and
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.029
I met a friend in the Technion yard and
asked him what direction I should take

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039
asked him what direction I should take
 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.029
asked him what direction I should take
and he says that I have a good eyesight

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039
and he says that I have a good eyesight
 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.680
and he says that I have a good eyesight
and therefore I should go to chemistry

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
and therefore I should go to chemistry
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.630
and therefore I should go to chemistry
and it really for me it was really

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640
and it really for me it was really
 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.950
and it really for me it was really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
studying and getting the highest grades
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980
studying and getting the highest grades
but I felt that eventually I would

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
but I felt that eventually I would
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170
but I felt that eventually I would
figure out which direction to go so it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
figure out which direction to go so it's
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.600
figure out which direction to go so it's
not that I dreamt on solving some

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
not that I dreamt on solving some
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060
