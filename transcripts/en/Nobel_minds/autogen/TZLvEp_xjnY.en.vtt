00:08:28.169 --> 00:08:31.909
on July go let me now talk about sources
of gravitational waves 1978 we had a

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919
of gravitational waves 1978 we had a
 

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:33.829
of gravitational waves 1978 we had a
workshop on sources of gravitational

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839
workshop on sources of gravitational
 

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:36.019
workshop on sources of gravitational
waves gathered together essentially all

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:36.029
waves gathered together essentially all
 

00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:44.380
waves gathered together essentially all
of the theorists and experimentalists

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:44.390
 
 

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.300
 
not here because he hasn't joined into

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.310
not here because he hasn't joined into
 

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.490
not here because he hasn't joined into
this field yet although he did play a

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500
this field yet although he did play a
 

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.350
this field yet although he did play a
crucial role and get helping us get

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360
crucial role and get helping us get
 

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.840
crucial role and get helping us get
Caltech into the field behind the scenes

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:53.850
Caltech into the field behind the scenes
 

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.920
Caltech into the field behind the scenes
on a committee that

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:54.930
on a committee that
 

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.360
on a committee that
commanded that we move forward in the

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.370
commanded that we move forward in the
 

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.900
commanded that we move forward in the
field and at that workshop at the end

00:08:59.900 --> 00:08:59.910
field and at that workshop at the end
 

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.940
field and at that workshop at the end
there was a discussion of strengths of

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:01.950
there was a discussion of strengths of
 

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.430
there was a discussion of strengths of
sources and this comes from the paper

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440
sources and this comes from the paper
 

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.880

to the minus twenty-one this is

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720
to the minus twenty-one this is
 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.290
to the minus twenty-one this is
frequency this is the strain that we've

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300
frequency this is the strain that we've
 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.260
frequency this is the strain that we've
been talking about compact binary

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.270
been talking about compact binary
 

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.990
been talking about compact binary
mergers that's black hole binary to

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000
mergers that's black hole binary to
 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.150

black holes two neutron stars a black

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160
black holes two neutron stars a black
 

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.460

hole neutron star estimated to be in
 

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.900
hole neutron star estimated to be in
this region and so it seemed clear to us

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:29.910
this region and so it seemed clear to us
 

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.570
this region and so it seemed clear to us
that the taught goal had to be to reach

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580
that the taught goal had to be to reach
 

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.970
that the taught goal had to be to reach
a sensitivity of strain sensitivity of

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:34.980
a sensitivity of strain sensitivity of
 

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.760
a sensitivity of strain sensitivity of
ten to the minus twenty one and so we

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:37.770
ten to the minus twenty one and so we
 

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.889
ten to the minus twenty one and so we
even had t-shirts made up that said ten

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:39.899
even had t-shirts made up that said ten
 

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:44.680
even had t-shirts made up that said ten
to the minus twenty one or bust

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:44.690
 
 

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.240
 
there is the signal it came in the first

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.250
there is the signal it came in the first
 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.490
there is the signal it came in the first
thing that was seen one times ten to the

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500
thing that was seen one times ten to the
 

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.070
thing that was seen one times ten to the
minus twenty one that's obviously

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080
minus twenty one that's obviously
 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.829
minus twenty one that's obviously
largely luck that we were right on the

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839
largely luck that we were right on the
 

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:57.500
largely luck that we were right on the
money but that was our gold beginning in

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.510
money but that was our gold beginning in
 

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.300
money but that was our gold beginning in
nineteen seventy eight and that's where

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
nineteen seventy eight and that's where
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.840
nineteen seventy eight and that's where
the first thing that came in 1983 when

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:02.850
the first thing that came in 1983 when
 

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.120
the first thing that came in 1983 when
we were planning legal it seemed pretty

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.130
we were planning legal it seemed pretty
 

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.730
we were planning legal it seemed pretty
clear to me the likely first detection

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740
clear to me the likely first detection
 

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.920
clear to me the likely first detection
was binary black holes and this is

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:09.930
was binary black holes and this is
 

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.710
was binary black holes and this is
basically what I argued from then on

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720
basically what I argued from then on
 

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.750
basically what I argued from then on
though I think most of the community was

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760
though I think most of the community was
 

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.820
though I think most of the community was
expecting it to be two neutron stars but

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:16.830
expecting it to be two neutron stars but
 

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.000
expecting it to be two neutron stars but
it seemed to me already then that the

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.010
it seemed to me already then that the
 

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.610
it seemed to me already then that the
following would outweigh the neutron

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:22.620
following would outweigh the neutron
 

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.190
following would outweigh the neutron
stars were versa for the black holes in

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200
stars were versa for the black holes in
 

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.690
stars were versa for the black holes in
favor of new truck black holes instead

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700
favor of new truck black holes instead
 

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.699
favor of new truck black holes instead
of neutron stars the distance to which

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:28.709
of neutron stars the distance to which
 

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:31.370
of neutron stars the distance to which
you could see a signal for two objects

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380
you could see a signal for two objects
 

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.900
you could see a signal for two objects
going around each other they're

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:32.910
going around each other they're
 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.670
going around each other they're
approximately proportional to the masses

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680
approximately proportional to the masses
 

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.160
approximately proportional to the masses
of the objects we were thinking of the

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.170
of the objects we were thinking of the
 

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.290
of the objects we were thinking of the
time the black holes we would be dealing

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300
time the black holes we would be dealing
 

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.090
time the black holes we would be dealing
with for maybe ten times heavier than

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100
with for maybe ten times heavier than
 

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.850
with for maybe ten times heavier than
neutron stars so you would see a volume

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860
neutron stars so you would see a volume
 

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.470
neutron stars so you would see a volume
of the universe there would be a

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480
of the universe there would be a
 

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.360
of the universe there would be a
thousand times greater than four neutron

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:47.370
thousand times greater than four neutron
 

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.340
thousand times greater than four neutron
stars and that seemed to me that would

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:49.350
stars and that seemed to me that would
 

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.460
stars and that seemed to me that would
outweigh the lower absolute numbers of

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.470
outweigh the lower absolute numbers of
 

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.930
outweigh the lower absolute numbers of
black holes there are in the universe

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940
black holes there are in the universe
 

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.610
black holes there are in the universe
compared to neutron stars and that's how

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620
compared to neutron stars and that's how
 

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.639
compared to neutron stars and that's how
it did turn out to be but we were very

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:58.649
it did turn out to be but we were very
 

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:01.190
it did turn out to be but we were very
uncertain as to how strong these waves

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200
uncertain as to how strong these waves
 

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.380
uncertain as to how strong these waves
were but we knew it was somewhere in the

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:03.390
were but we knew it was somewhere in the
 

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.300
were but we knew it was somewhere in the
vicinity of that ten to the minus twenty

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.310
vicinity of that ten to the minus twenty
 

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.930

we're going to be needed it seemed very

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320
we're going to be needed it seemed very
 

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.180
we're going to be needed it seemed very
clear to me in that era in order to be

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.190
clear to me in that era in order to be
 

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.420
clear to me in that era in order to be
able to extract the information from the

so we had to do it by numerical

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440
so we had to do it by numerical

sort do this you had to do it
numerically so you'd be had to begin to
