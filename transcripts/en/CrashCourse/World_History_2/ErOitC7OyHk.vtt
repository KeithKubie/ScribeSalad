00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.969
Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course World
History, and today we're going to talk about

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.230
the end of civilization.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.799
Mr Green, Mr Green! Everybody knows civilization is
going to end with Y2K. We can't survive the year 2000.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.349
Now, Me From the Past, turns out we get through
that one all right. And we're not talking about

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.320
monopolies among cable providers, or net neutrality.
In fact, we're not talking about the end of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.990
*our* civilization, which everyone knows will
be brought about giant, transforming robots

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.590
that can become cars. If you want to learn
about the end of our civilization in video

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.470
form, might I recommend the major American
film, Transformers: Dark of the Moon.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.090
Instead today we are going to talk about the
end of a civilization in the ancient Near

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790
East at the end of the Bronze Age

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.140
So in our first world history series, we talked
about river valley civilizations, like the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.750
Indus Valley, and Egypt, and Mesopotamia,
mainly because most textbooks split them up

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.239
into separate civilizations. You know, teachers
like textbooks, and we want teachers to like

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.059
Crash Course, so... yeah.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.420
But the thing is we're used to imagining the
world as divided up into nation states, and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.970
so small and geographically-bounded civilizations
fit nicely into the way we think of the world.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.010
But that isn't the way the world was always
imagined.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.900
So there's an argument to be made that all
of these communities in the eastern Mediterranean

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.640
-- what historians sometimes call the Levant
or the Ancient Near East, because it is closer

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.840
to Britain than it is the Far East -- these
days we often call it the Mid East. It's almost

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.110
as though there is no actual "East" and "West"
on the globe.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.920
Anyway, you can make the argument that back
in the Bronze Age, all of that was actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.780
a unified coherent system. It was one civilization,
kinda.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.260
Egypt, Mesopotamia, the states that grew up
in the Levant, and the empires of Anatolia,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.390
all of them have quite a lot in common.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.299
Let's begin with our old friend, Trade. So
archaeologists have found goods manufactured

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.830
in Crete in Egypt, and the names of Pharaohs
written in hieroglyphics in the Cretan palace

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.680
at Knossos. But even cooler discoveries have
been made by underwater archaeologists.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760
Wait a second, Stan - are there really underwater
archaeologists?

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.980
There are? Where were those people on Career
Day? Ah, they were probably underwater.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.360
Underwater archaeologists excavate shipwrecks
and one ship at Uluburun in Turkey from the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.540
thirteenth century BCE had products on it
from at least seven different states. There

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.670
was stuff like Egyptian jewelry, and copper
and tin (which are the raw materials for bronze,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.420
you know it was the Bronze Age after all).
And although the Egyptians were the central

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.880
power in this Bronze Age trade network, the
Hittites were no slouches. I mean, they ruled

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.650
an empire that began in Anatolia and spread
out to include much of Mesopotamia. In fact,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.099
they may have even gone to war with the Mycenaean
Greeks in a pre-Homeric Trojan War. How do

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.639
we know this? Well again, Archaeologists.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.180
And this brings up another feature of the
ancient Near East in the late Bronze Age:

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.200
Warfare. There is a fair amount of it between
Egyptian and Hittites and Assyrians and many

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.470
other empires which rose and fell over many
hundreds of years. Wars were pretty common

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.360
in the period of 1500 to 1200 BCE. You know,
rulers wanted to extended their power and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.010
prestige through military success and conquest.
And also that military success and conquest

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.470
was one of the main drivers of economic growth.
"Eh, we could increase agricultural yields,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.700
we could come up with more efficient mechanization,
or we could go to war." They always went to war.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.739
But there wasn't just war. There was also
quite a bit of diplomacy. And when diplomats

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.540
from these rival communities would talk to
each other, they would often call each other

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.690
by family names or imagine family relationships,
even though they weren't actually family.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.190
But that sense that they felt like family.
You know, families do sometimes have wars,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.110
indicates that it wasn't necessarily different
civilizations. And sometimes the wars ended

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.599
with diplomatic marriages, so rather than
just pretending that they were family, rulers

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.330
of the late Bronze Age states would actually
become family. And then they could stop fighting

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.250
and start trading, at least for a little while.
By the way, this is also the history of Post-Roman

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.190
Empire Europe. So we have a trade network,
we have a lot of interconnected familial relationships

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.200
(both real and imagined), but do we have a
civilization? Well, I would argue "yes," even

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.140
though it didn't have a single ruler, or one
form of political structure, or even one language.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.299
But neither does "Western" civilization and
lots of people think that's a thing.

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.080
When you think about it, what people often
mean when we talk about civilizations today

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.989
are systems. Like when we talk about Western
civilization, we're not actually talking about

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.499
Greece or Rome or England or France or the
United States, we're talking about a set of

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.469
structures, and religious and cultural traditions
that are closely related enough that we see

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.109
them as forming a coherent whole. And the
same thing is true when we talk about Islamic

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:33.599
civilization, which spans from like Sufi mystics
in Turkey to Indonesia, the country with more

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.409
Muslims than any other on earth. So at least
according to that definition, the ancient

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.589
Near East was a civilization. But this is
an episode about the collapse of that civilization,

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:43.589
so what happened to it?

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:47.549
Well there we have one of the great historical
mysteries. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:52.560
Archaeologists have discovered that some time
around 1200 BCE, a number of the cities in

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.080
the region suffered upheaval, disruption,
and in many cases destruction. Among those

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.759
cultures that bit the dust were the Mycenaeans,
the Minoans of Crete, and our not particularly

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.999
friendly friends the Hittites. Egypt didn't disappear
but the political system there was rocked

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:11.509
enough that Egyptologists say that this period
marked the end of the new kingdom, so called

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.419
because it was very old. Until recently the
cause of this collapse was blamed on an invasion,

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.569
or perhaps a wave of invasions by the mysterious
sea peoples. This idea comes from the Egyptian

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.279
description from 1177 BCE that describes a
confederation of invaders.

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.899
"...They were coming forward toward Egypt,
while the flame was prepared before them.

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:37.189
Their confederation was the Peleset, Tjekker,
Shekelesh, Danuana, and Weshesh, lands united."

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:38.889
By the way, mispronouncing things is my thing.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.499
"They laid their hands upon the lands as far
as the circuit of the earth, their hearts

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:44.930
confident and trusting"

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.719
The sea peoples, possibly because they were
busy destroying cities or perhaps trying to

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:52.360
come up with a better name for themselves,
didn't leave any inscriptions of their own,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.860
so the idea of their invasion is kind of suspect,
but we do know that cities were destroyed,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.389
mainly between 1210 and 1130 BCE, we just
don't know by whom. The story of the sea peoples

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.319
probably stuck around for so long because,
you know, it's a good story, and one that

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.039
provides a tidy explanation, but what if it's
wrong?

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.379
Thanks, Thought Bubble. The other thing I
wanna note here is that we like to imagine

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.270
that history is the result of like, humans
doing things. You know, humans are big fans

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.699
of human agency, we like to be in control
of things. Historians have traditionally also

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.249
been just a smidge obsessed with war, so if
we're imagining why a civilization ended,

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.539
we're gonna imagine that it probably involved
humans and y'know, likely involved war. So

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.449
what happened? Well, it could have been the
sea people. Like, there's a letter from a

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:41.679
town in northern Syria, which was burned sometime
between 1190 and 1185 BCE, the town was burned,

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:44.059
not the letter, obviously, that's how we found
it.

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:49.169
It read, in part: "My father, now the ships
of the enemy have come, they have been setting

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.759
fire to my cities and have done harm to the
land." Now, that fits with what we know about

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.770
the sea people: come from the sea, burn the
land, but the dating of the letter is uncertain.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.719
And there's a different, very compelling,
non-human possibility: earthquakes.

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:06.889
Now, I'm not an archaeologist, but archaeologists
tell me that when an earthquake destroys a

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.599
city, its walls fall down in a particular
way, and you often find people crushed beneath

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:16.309
them. When a city is sacked, the architectural
remnants look very different: there are arrowheads

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:20.770
stuck in walls or in the bones of skeletons.
And we know there were earthquakes, thanks

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.559
to archeo-seismologists, who are in competition
with underwater archaeologists to have the

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:33.139
best job ever. They've determined that between
about 1225 BCE and 1175 BCE, the eastern Mediterranean

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.740
experienced "an earthquake storm." Wait, did
I just say earthquake storms? Must be time

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.899
for the open letter. But first, let's see
what's in the globe today. Oh, that's a nice

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.800
little village. Wait, why did you do that,
Thought Bubble, that's very sad!

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.659
An Open Letter to Earthquake Storms:

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:47.839
Dear Earthquake Storms,

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:53.069
What a fantastic term. I would say that you're
an example of historians naming something

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:57.199
brilliantly for once, but in fact, you were,
of course, named by an archeoseismologist.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:02.739
The idea here, originally proposed by a guy
named Amos Nur is that one large earthquake

00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:07.879
can actually lead to a series of extremely
large earthquakes. They just kind of go down

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:12.879
the same plate boundary, going baa-b'baa-b'baa-b'baa.
That's the technical term for what earthquakes

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:16.989
do. And earthquake storms, in addition to
having an awesome name, you are terrible.

00:08:16.989 --> 00:08:22.629
You just keep happening down the fault line,
like, for decades, it's not cool, earthquake

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:23.919
storms, stop it!

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.559
Best wishes, John Green

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:30.779
As you can imagine, this earthquake storm,
pretty destabilizing to the region both physically

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:34.529
and politically. You know, if I lose like,
four hands of blackjack in a row, I start

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:39.190
railing against the fates. An earthquake storm
would really challenge my, like, political

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.629
and religious world views.

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:44.870
And then there's the non-earthquake environmental
calamity possibility. Again, contemporary

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.910
science paints an interesting portrait here.
So, fossilized pollen has demonstrated that

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:56.480
the period between 1200 and 850 BCE was notably
drier than earlier periods. And we also have

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.660
records of famines from what I'll just call
the Near East Civilization. Actually, I should

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.300
think of a better name for it. The Lovely
Levant, the Bronze Age Brouhaha. You know,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.120
this is harder than it seems, actually. Anyway,
as we've seen in other episodes, drought and

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.839
famine are consistently devastating, but they
don't usually lead to full-on meltdowns of

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:20.559
a social order. And interestingly, that's especially true
of the region that we're talking about today.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.579
Then there's the theory that the region experienced
peasant uprisings. And there's another that

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:28.129
trade disruptions caused the economic system
to collapse. And then there's a theory that

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:32.279
emerged in the 1990s that shows us a lot about
how present thinking can influence the way

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.589
we imagine the past. This theory goes that
the rise of private entrepreneurial traders

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:41.269
undermined the palace based trading system
and created a disruption, similar to the ones

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:45.370
that Silicon Valley likes to create. This
has become a very popular way of talking about

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.389
the late Bronze Age, but it's also a bit problematic.
For one thing, kings were not replaced by

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:54.230
entrepreneurs. They were replaced, you know,
by less powerful kings, this is the way the

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.090
civilization ends, not with a bang, but with
a whimper.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.019
All right, so you might be saying, this was
a really long time ago, and the people involved

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:05.339
didn't even leave pyramids for us to enjoy.
And we don't even really know what happened.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:09.649
And that's not history, is it, and also, can
anything that brought down a civilization

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:15.709
3000 years ago really be a threat to my way
of life? Yes. The interconnected trade and

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:21.279
diplomacy based systemic civilization of the
ancient Near East is at least somewhat similar

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:26.410
to the interconnected trade and diplomacy
based systemic civilization that we live in

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.860
today. It's just that, for us, that system
extends around the entire planet. And some

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.949
argue that it was, in fact, the very interconnected-ness
of the late Bronze Age civilization that made

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:41.720
it unstable. Sometimes, in extremely complex
systems, the failure of one segment can disrupt

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.279
the whole thing. Like, according to historian
Eric Cline, "If Late Bronze Age civilizations

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:50.939
were truly globalized and dependent upon each
other for goods and services, even just to

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:55.779
a certain extent, then change to any one of
the relevant kingdoms such as the Mycenaeans

00:10:55.779 --> 00:11:01.259
or the Hittites would potentially affect and
destabilize them all." 3000 years later, a

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:06.449
credit crisis in the United States leads to
30% unemployment in Spain. An outbreak of

00:11:06.449 --> 00:11:11.860
bird flu in China dramatically increases the
price of chicken in Canada. And in 1914, the

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.050
assassination of an archduke leads to war
in Japan.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.930
In the end, whether you take meaningful lessons
away from the story of the collapse of this

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.629
particular civilization depends on how much
you see it as an analogy to our own world.

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:27.720
If you believe that the Mediterranean world
between 1500 and 1200 was, as one historian

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.579
put it, "A cosmopolitan and globalized system
such as has only rarely been seen before the

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:37.620
current day", then understanding what happened
3000 years ago can be pretty helpful. That

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.459
said, it could have been global interdependence
or entrepreneurial disruption, it also could

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:45.610
have been sea people. It's certainly important
for us to imagine the present in the context

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.050
of the past. But insofar as possible, we don't
want too much to imagine the past through

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.810
the lens of the present. And that's why I
think, in general, it's a good idea to be

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.709
suspicious of any single cause imagining of
why historical events happened. Could the

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:03.040
sea people, whoever they were, really have
been powerful enough to destroy this civilization?

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.009
It's no coincidence that around the world,
people are always talking about some version

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:12.589
of barbarian invasions, and that is rarely
the true straightforward explanation of what

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:15.420
happened -- I mean, unless you're talking
about the Mongols.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.820
It's true, though, the Mongols were the only
barbarian invasion that showed the ability

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:26.589
to like, single-hoardedly collapse a civilization.
Anyway, thanks for watching, I'll see you next week.
