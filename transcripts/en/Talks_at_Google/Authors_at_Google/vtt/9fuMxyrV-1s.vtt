FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, guys.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.010
Thanks so much for being here
for our awesome yoga girl

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.100
Rachel Brathen today.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.190
We're going to be having one
of her really dear friends

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.270
moderating this interview today.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.079
Her name is Krista Lettko.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.280
Her boat is currently docked
in the San Francisco Bay.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
She runs a marketing
and production company

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.990
and she teaches yoga.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.610
She met Rachel on
Rachel's US tour in 2013

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.810
and they did some traveling
together in Aruba.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.300
So please welcome Krista.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.300
KRISTA LETTKO: Hi.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.040
How is everyone?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.010
So, yoga phenomenon,
Rachel Brathen,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.360
better known as
"yoga girl" has won

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.280
the hearts of more than one
million Instagram followers

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.100
around the world.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.510
She shares pictures
of spectacular yoga

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.470
poses on beautiful Aruba beaches
alongside stories about life's

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.129
triumphs and heartbreaks.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.570
Now she's bringing together
her signature wisdom

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.900
and personal journey in her
first highly anticipated book,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.050
"Yoga Girl."

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.700
In addition to calling
Rachel my favorite yoga

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.310
instructor of all time,
I have the privilege

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.100
of calling her a dear friend.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.800
I'm thrilled to have
her family in California

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.470
and I'm so, so grateful to be
part of the Happiness Tour.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.740
So please welcome New York
Times' newest bestselling

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.910
author, Rachel Brathen.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.370
RACHEL BRATHEN: Hey!

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.640
Hi!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.140
Hi.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.630
KRISTA LETTKO: Hi.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.546
RACHEL BRATHEN: Thank
you everyone for coming.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:44.730
It's like a puppy party in here.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.260
Everybody is
attracted to Ringo, I

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.830
feel, more than anything else.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.640
KRISTA LETTKO: So I was asked
to set up a Q&amp;A for Rachel,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.190
and when I read the book, I
realized a lot of the answers

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.850
are actually in the book.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.080
Which I think is great
because so many times I

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.890
know it's a struggle
for you to connect

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.500
with every single
person that reaches out.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.110
So we went through
your Instagram

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.789
and found the most common--
the most popular questions,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.865
and we thought we'd
have you answer them.

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:14.090
RACHEL BRATHEN: That's great.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.830
I like that.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.871
KRISTA LETTKO: All right.

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:17.920
So question number one, Rachel.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.270
When did you first start
to incorporate yoga

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.460
into your everyday life?

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.350
So when did you decide
to actually make it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.400
something that you practiced
occasionally to being serious

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.630
every day?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.450
RACHEL BRATHEN: It wasn't an
active choice that I made.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.270
Yoga kind of crept
up on me sneakily.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.670
I meet so many people that have
that "aha" moment in yoga class

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.260
where-- I took one class
and it changed my life,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.110
and then you're a
devoted yogee forever.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.870
For me, it was not
like that at all.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.210
I took my first yoga class.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.642
I couldn't touch my toes.

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:50.600
I couldn't do anything.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.683
I thought I was the worst
person in the classroom.

00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:55.010
Everybody else knew exactly
what they were doing.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.400
And it was really a long process
of sticking with a practice

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.660
because they had a feeling
that it was helping me,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.650
and with lots of patience
and lots of falling over

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.590
and lots of learning, it
became a part of my daily life.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.090
KRISTA LETTKO: And
at what point did

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.050
you decide to try
Instagram, and at what

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.315
point did you say I'm going to
try out the social media thing?

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:17.929
I might be good at it.

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.970
RACHEL BRATHEN: I was
really obsessed with my dog

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.210
at the time.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.180
Kind of still very
obsessed with all my dogs.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.750
I started Instagram--
the first I ever shared

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.860
was a picture of my dog.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.100
It wasn't a yoga-oriented thing.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.970
I didn't have this big plan
to create a big social media

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.690
account that was going
to become a huge thing.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.470
It was really a
personal space for me,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.710
and I started sharing
a little bit more yoga.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.274
And it grew slowly from there
and it became came all of this.

00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:47.315
KRISTA LETTKO: So why do
you think your lifestyle

00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:50.680
and philosophy on
Instagram and now

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.890
all over the world has
resonated with so many people?

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.130
What do you think about
the philosophy sticks?

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.690
RACHEL BRATHEN: The
philosophy sticks.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.480
I try really hard to not do the
regular, general social media

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.980
thing.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.350
Which I feel is-- it's very
much showing only our best

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.810
side of ourselves.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.029
You can go to any person's
Instagram account,

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.230
and if it's a celebrity, or a
regular person, and everybody

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.120
is so good at everything.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.810
And every day is
the best day ever.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.520
Everybody is a professional
photographer and a super yogee

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.180
and a professional
chef, and you only

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.060
share these very angled and
filtered moments of your day.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.445
No one ever shares,
you know, I'm

00:04:35.445 --> 00:04:36.769
having the worst moment ever.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:38.310
Look how boring my
life is right now.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.851
I'm going to share
that on Instagram.

00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.880
No one does that.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.690
And it creates a very
unrealistic view of your life.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.731
And I found the more
I get away from that

00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:50.230
or the more I go a
little bit deeper

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.750
into the things that are real
and genuine and human, which

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.750
isn't always rainbows
and butterflies,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.815
even though that's
very inspiring too.

00:04:56.815 --> 00:04:59.545
But the more human
I can be online,

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:00.920
the more it
resonates with people

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.080
on a level that's
deeper even though it's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.301
social media, which can be
a very superficial place.

00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:09.550
KRISTA LETTKO: It's definitely
what resonated with me.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.120
When I first met you,
you were in San Francisco

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.300
and you woke up that
day to teach that class

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.530
and couldn't move your back.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.370
And she was teaching a
handstand class that night.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.900
And it was so cool.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.730
It was the most loving--
sweaty, but-- I don't know.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.510
It was just the coolest
class and it was so real.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.850
Everyone was expecting,
and you showed up in socks,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.810
and it was just so real.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.850
It resonated.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.920
I know, but it was like,
oh, this is the real deal.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.907
So that's awesome.

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:40.740
RACHEL BRATHEN: Yes.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.360
Sometimes you have
to that, you know.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.690
I wanted to teach this
advanced, inverted class.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.630
Everybody's ready with
their Lululemon pants.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.330
And here's this yoga girl.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.830
Let's do it.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.180
And I woke up in the morning
after just months of months

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.170
of stress and working
too hard, and something

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.120
snapped in my neck and
I could barely walk.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.750
So I feel allowing that to
be there if that's the case.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.945
It resonates way more than
handstands and all of that.

00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:06.570
KRISTA LETTKO: So
these days most of us

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.500
have pretty busy
schedules, and I've

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.430
heard you say a couple things.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.200
But I wanted you
to say three things

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.130
that you think
during the day people

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.310
can do to live a
more balanced, maybe

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.480
more mindful life in the midst
of the chaos that we live in.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.214
RACHEL BRATHEN: I
very recently shared--

00:06:27.214 --> 00:06:28.630
because I get this
question a lot,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.980
especially from people that
are living a stressful life

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.275
or you're sitting by your
computer the whole day.

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:34.150
You don't move a lot.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.630
So I actually recently shared
a big blog on office yoga,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.090
and I had no idea it was
going to be so requested.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.870
And everybody wants
to know, can I

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.669
do something while
sitting in my chair

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.210
while wearing the
clothes that I wear

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.040
to work to relieve the
tension that hold in my body?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.660
And taking a moment in the
day, if it's five minutes just

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.650
to kind of turnaround and
away from your computer.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.814
Turn your phone off and
just breathe and feel.

00:06:56.814 --> 00:06:58.480
You know, what does
it feel like to sit?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.165
Am I sitting like this the
whole day with my neck like this

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:02.290
and my shoulders like this?

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.440
Can I do something
with my posture.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.210
Can I invite a little bit more
body awareness into the moment

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.980
and maybe change subtle
things to make me feel better.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.940
So five minutes in
the day, you can

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.190
do a little bit of stretching.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.970
Maybe just a twist
in your chair.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.636
Like how are you guys
feeling right now?

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.450
Are you comfortable
on your mats?

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.600
Want to do a little
twist to kind of wake up?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.610
KRISTA LETTKO: I
think we should.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.800
RACHEL BRATHEN: OK.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.830
So just sit up tall.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.020
Whatever you're doing with
your legs is totally OK.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.780
And just take a little twist
over towards the right.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.238
So you bring one
hand on your knee,

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:31.850
the other one on the ground
behind the lower back.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.710
You can do this in
your office chair

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.059
as well just holding on
to the edge of the chair.

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:38.600
And then lifting up to the crown
of the head and just lightly

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.280
gaze over the shoulder.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.860
Welcome.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.610
Then we take a deep breath
in and a deep breath out.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.490
And then gently come
back to center and just

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.720
to the exact same thing
on the other side.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.060
So one hand behind you,
the other one underneath.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.420
Take a breath in to
lengthen and lift up

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.360
as if you're growing taller.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.430
And as you exhale,
twisting over to the left.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:12.325
And a big breath
in and breath out.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.170
Good, and then come
back to center.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.510
How do we feel?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.030
A little bit of energy.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.250
KRISTA LETTKO: There's
a difference though.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.180
RACHEL BRATHEN: There
is a difference.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.900
It can be very
subtle, but when we

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.180
sit all day or stand
all day, that energy

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.722
tends to get very
stuck in the spine.

00:08:25.722 --> 00:08:28.055
So just something as simple
as a twist in your chair can

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:29.900
really-- it's like a
little shot of espresso

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.980
without the caffeine.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.980
And you wanted two
more things, you said?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.990
KRISTA LETTKO: Yes.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.539
Three things throughout the day.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.690
RACHEL BRATHEN: Someone
asked me this recently

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.570
and I was like in
my office, which

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.388
is at home and not at Google.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.179
I don't know if they
would ever allow this,

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.510
but I like to make my work
space very appealing to me.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.727
And for me, that always involves
lighting a little candle.

00:08:50.727 --> 00:08:52.560
And someone was
interviewing me, and they're

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.790
like I don't think we can have
open fire in our office space.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.390
I was like, oh, well.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.839
Maybe a little vase of flowers
or a photo of someone you love.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:03.130
Or bring your dog to work if
you're allowed to do that.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.500
Something that creates
a smile on your face.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.940
And deep breaths
all day, everyday,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.650
would be my number three.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.140
KRISTA LETTKO: OK,
so next question

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.620
is I know when different
phases bring you

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.350
up and down through
your yoga practice.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.430
Sometimes you're more gentle.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.510
Other times it's really sweaty.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.010
What's your yoga
practice like right

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.250
now, especially
with the traveling?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.510
How's that going?

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.230
RACHEL BRATHEN: It's going
better than last year.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.570
I really made an effort-- I'm
on the road for two months,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.660
and I realize if I don't
actually schedule time

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.320
for the yoga practice or to
meditate or even schedule time

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.710
to take my dog to the
park, these things

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.027
become de-prioritized by
meetings and more important

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.610
things that happened
in your work day.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.660
So it's working out pretty well.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.130
I have actually reached out to
teachers in different cities

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.884
where we go and I have-- some
days it's just me and my mat.

00:09:58.884 --> 00:10:01.050
Some days we'll have a
teacher come to my hotel room

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.160
in this tiny little corner.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.705
You kind of take
what you can get.

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.330
KRISTA LETTKO: OK,
so the next question

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.590
is what it is one of the
most unusual places you've

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.445
had the opportunity
to teach recently?

00:10:16.247 --> 00:10:17.830
RACHEL BRATHEN: The
most unusual plays

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.116
that I teach these days
is at home where I live.

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:24.470
Which it's always
exciting to be home.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.200
It happens very
rarely, but I find

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.270
it's more about that
the people that I meet

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.645
or the people that
come to class.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.487
We were in Brielle, New
Jersey, which I had never

00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:37.320
heard of in my life.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.510
We were in Connecticut and
these small little places,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.979
and the love and the wisdom
and just authenticity

00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:46.020
that came from these people
in these small towns.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.830
It's not exotic.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.600
It's not like Brazil or Costa
Rica or Aruba where I live,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.212
but it was just really an exotic
experience going to that town

00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:55.920
and seeing these
people-- in a small town

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.770
and these people that
practice yoga every day.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.450
They're not the
people that we maybe

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.810
follow on Instagram or
the people that we see.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.107
It was really a
nice change for me.

00:11:07.107 --> 00:11:09.190
It was really-- I'm really
excited about this tour

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.140
and meeting people in
more unusual places.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.860
KRISTA LETTKO: So speaking
of the tour, congratulations.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.440
We got some good news
yesterday about the book.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.380
RACHEL BRATHEN: Yay!

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.240
KRISTA LETTKO: Very exciting.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.640
How's the tour going?

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.627
How's it been going?

00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:24.460
This is a whirlwind.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.915
How long are you traveling for?

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.040
RACHEL BRATHEN: Two months.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.123
KRISTA LETTKO: Two months.

00:11:28.123 --> 00:11:30.320
And is it just the
US, or what's--

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.953
RACHEL BRATHEN: It's all across
the US, and we have Vancouver.

00:11:33.953 --> 00:11:37.324
So kind of Canada a little bit.

00:11:37.324 --> 00:11:38.740
But it's going
really well so far.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.656
It's been really busy.

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:43.140
I'm so happy to be in San
Francisco or the West Coast

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.076
where there is sunshine.

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.950
It was snowing in New
York when we were there

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.830
two days ago, which is not
a happy place for me at all.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.992
But so far, it's
really, really nice.

00:11:53.992 --> 00:11:55.700
KRISTA LETTKO: So
what's been the biggest

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.440
surprise in this whole process
so far writing your first book?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.680
Now going out on
your first tour?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.590
What's the biggest-- I
guess the most unexpected--

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.050
the biggest thing
that's happened so far?

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.587
Maybe aside from--

00:12:09.587 --> 00:12:11.920
RACHEL BRATHEN: Aside from
the New York Times bestseller

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.420
thing.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.580
I found throughout
this tour-- this

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.300
is the first time since I
have this the social media

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.030
following and everyday people
reaching out and writing

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.790
and commenting and emailing.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.980
And I always-- when I
travel, I only teach classes.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.810
So it's just come take a yoga
class, come to a workshop,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.330
bring your yoga mat.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.174
And I realize now that I'm
doing more book signings

00:12:36.174 --> 00:12:37.340
or other events and meetups.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.150
How many people that are
in this community that are

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.930
so terrified of yoga practice?

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.400
So they wanted to come
and they want to connect,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.255
but they're not ready to
step on the mat just yet.

00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:49.380
KRISTA LETTKO: Interesting.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.260
RACHEL BRATHEN: It's
really interesting,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.485
and I used to think
that, oh, "yoga girl."

00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:54.820
It's like a yoga
specific community.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.530
It's not.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.795
It's really a heart
specific community.

00:12:57.795 --> 00:12:59.420
And it's people that,
you know, they're

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.045
not ready for their
first down dog yet.

00:13:01.045 --> 00:13:01.817
They're intrigued.

00:13:01.817 --> 00:13:02.900
They want to buy the book.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.620
They want to say hi.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.328
They want to hug.

00:13:04.328 --> 00:13:06.670
They want to meet my
dog and my husband,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.510
but it's not about
the yoga as much

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.820
as I originally have thought.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.290
It's really to me more
about sparking something

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.592
in people that inspires them
with whatever they have.

00:13:14.592 --> 00:13:16.300
It doesn't have to be
the other practice.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.020
It could be whatever is their
passions or their dreams.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.990
KRISTA LETTKO: Wow,
that's so great.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.330
I didn't think that was going
to be-- that's really great.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.390
So this is your first book.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.150
Hopefully not your last.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.904
What was the biggest
challenge in writing the book

00:13:32.904 --> 00:13:33.570
in this process?

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.600
What was the hardest part?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.480
RACHEL BRATHEN: The
hardest part-- well,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.810
when I start writing, I
have a hard time stopping.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.110
For this book, I wanted it to
be almost like my Instagram

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.310
account, but in a book form.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.620
It's very lively and
full of pretty pictures,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.700
and there's recipes in
there and yoga sequences.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.170
And then my own story
has the depth of that.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.520
But I have another book
in me that is maybe not

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.680
as sparkly and
shiny as this book,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.339
and when I start going
into personal experiences,

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:07.130
sometimes I go really,
really, really deep.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.670
And even when I brought
this book to the-- because

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.230
I wrote it in Sweden first
and brought it to the States.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.640
And I had to have things cleared
with lawyers at the publishing

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.140
house.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.931
Like are you allowed
to write these things?

00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:17.840
Is that OK?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.690
Can they sue you?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.994
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:14:19.994 --> 00:14:21.410
In Sweden, we don't
sue each other

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.770
for writing about what
happened in your life.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:31.080
So it's been a balance of
sharing the true me-- a deeper

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.320
version of my life, and
keeping it very accessible

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.869
and motivating.

00:14:36.869 --> 00:14:38.160
KRISTA LETTKO: That's so funny.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.720
Did you write it in
Swedish and English first?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.720
RACHEL BRATHEN: English.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.840
But for a Swedish
publisher, and I

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.549
had to translate my
own book into Swedish

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:46.923
because I write
better in English

00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:48.030
than I do in Swedish now.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.030
And then for the
American version,

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.160
we actually extended it.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.070
I wrote a lot more, so then
I had to rewrite again.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.870
So I kind of wrote three
books this past year.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.160
It's been a big process.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.240
Making a book is
not just writing it

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.410
and handing something
in and then you're done.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.780
It would be nice if that
was the case, but it's not.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.140
KRISTA LETTKO: So you told
me the biggest challenge now.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.348
I'd like to know-- this is
actually my last question,

00:15:12.348 --> 00:15:13.320
then we'll open it up.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.522
It's what was your
favorite part to write?

00:15:16.522 --> 00:15:18.480
What's your favorite part
of the book, or maybe

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.350
your favorite page
or quote or picture?

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.780
What's your favorite
thing about the book?

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.410
RACHEL BRATHEN: I really
love the last chapter.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.530
Every chapter
corresponds or correlates

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.730
to a part of yoga practice.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.270
I have a chapter on back bends.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.740
I have a chapter on arm balances
and inversions and all of that.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.780
And the last chapter is about
meditation and finding silence.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.495
Which I find that is
the most important part

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:43.370
of the yoga practice.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.825
Which people-- it's harder
to get to because it's

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:48.010
a little bit more daunting.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.370
Sitting down with yourself in
silence with no distractions

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.810
can be a terrifying thing.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.640
But it's also what I
find creates the most

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.740
change in a person's life.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.724
More than sweating
on the yoga mat

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:00.640
or doing a handstand or
a downward facing dog,

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.590
and I really love that.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.740
I love to inspire that
part of the practice team.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.130
Being with yourself and finding
those moments of silence

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.154
in your life.

00:16:10.154 --> 00:16:11.570
KRISTA LETTKO:
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.070
Cool.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:12.737
I love the book.

00:16:12.737 --> 00:16:13.819
RACHEL BRATHEN: Thank you.

00:16:13.819 --> 00:16:15.636
KRISTA LETTKO: I read
it in one sitting.

00:16:15.636 --> 00:16:17.470
It's so good.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.369
So thank you so much.

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:19.410
Thank you for being here.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.377
Congratulations.

00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:21.460
RACHEL BRATHEN: Thank you.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.360
KRISTA LETTKO: And
I'd like to open it up

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.080
if there's anybody that had
some questions that they

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.742
want ask Rachel directly.

00:16:28.742 --> 00:16:31.090
Catherine's walking
around with a mic.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.132
Don't be shy, we're all--

00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:34.215
RACHEL BRATHEN: It could
be a dog related question

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:34.782
if you want.

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:36.270
It doesn't have to be yoga.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.169
It could be anything.

00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:38.710
AUDIENCE: I have a
question actually.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:45.950
OK, if you were to pick three
poses to do in the morning,

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.180
like quickly before work.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.770
That's my biggest struggle
is I want to get to work,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.110
but I really want to open up
and not-- when you wake up,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.046
you're like all stiff.

00:16:56.046 --> 00:16:57.420
So what are three
poses you would

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.900
say after waking up in the
morning to just kind of flow

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.770
through?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.645
RACHEL BRATHEN: Yeah.

00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:04.575
You can even do-- just
the moment you wake up,

00:17:04.575 --> 00:17:08.329
I like to stay in bed and kind
of use the surface you're on.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.120
Just to create some
movement for the spine.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.589
So the spine moves
in so many ways.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.838
Well, we just did now a twist.

00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:14.969
You can do that same thing
lying down on your back.

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:16.760
Kind of wish I was in
yoga pants right now.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.766
I'm not.

00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:18.890
Do you want to demonstrate?

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:19.723
KRISTA LETTKO: Sure.

00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:21.050
Yes, I knew that was coming.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.150
RACHEL BRATHEN: Of course.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.024
So lying on your back, bringing
one knee into your chest.

00:17:25.024 --> 00:17:27.149
And then just gently drawing
that towards one side,

00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:28.200
so just taking that
over to the left.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.740
KRISTA LETTKO: My
mic is on my back.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.700
RACHEL BRATHEN: That's OK.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.625
So something as simple as this.

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.750
And then come back to center
and do the other side.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.302
You can do that on any surface.

00:17:37.302 --> 00:17:39.010
You're creating some
movement, and again,

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.450
that energy that gets lodged in
the spine helps to wake us up.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.254
And then for me--
it's not for everyone.

00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:46.920
Back of the legs tend
to get very tight.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.724
You can bring one
leg up to the sky

00:17:48.724 --> 00:17:50.140
and bring it closer
into the body.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.530
Just lying in your
bed or your yoga mat

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.420
in your kitchen wherever
you are, and just do

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.730
both legs like that.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.820
Creating some
space for the back.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.485
And then come sitting up.

00:18:00.485 --> 00:18:02.227
And I'll do this along with you.

00:18:02.227 --> 00:18:03.810
So just bringing
your hands behind you

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.660
with the wrist pointing
towards your sits bones.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.090
It's taking a moment
to open the chest.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.680
Just like this.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.550
Just lifting through the heart.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.720
You guys can all do
this with me right now.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.950
KRISTA LETTKO: Wrists
facing towards me?

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.199
RACHEL BRATHEN: No, your
wrists facing the sits bones,

00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:15.842
and then lifting your heart,
shoulders back, drop your head.

00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:17.800
Just start to open and
expand through the heart

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.440
and the chest.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.850
So it's not an intense pose.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.050
Just a little bit
of spaciousness.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.112
And then coming back up.

00:18:25.112 --> 00:18:28.574
Slight little yoga moment.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:29.990
Yeah, so anything
that feels good.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.400
We all have our homework
when it comes to our bodies.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.221
For me it's-- my shoulders
are always my number one tight

00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:35.720
spot.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.050
If you have your hips or the
back of your legs or your neck,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.680
finding a pose that alleviates
that that you can do every day.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.910
That's what you need to work
on in your own practice.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.092
AUDIENCE: I'd loved to hear your
experience or thoughts coming

00:18:48.092 --> 00:18:49.550
to a place like
Google, and I don't

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.430
know if you've been to other
places in Silicon Valley.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.540
But I kind of find that we're in
a little bit of a bubble here.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.100
Like it's such a different
world than-- I'm sure

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.719
Aruba or anywhere else
in the United States.

00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:02.385
So I'm just curious
what your experience

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:06.320
is coming in to these
buildings and these offices.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.060
RACHEL BRATHEN: This
place is amazing.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.760
I just had lunch
in the cafeteria,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.760
and I was just blown away.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.150
I wish I get to eat
this every single day.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.500
I feel this is a special place.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.800
But just coming into
any work environment

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.560
where people are working this
closely together all the time

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.770
and you're really, really
busy throughout your day.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.200
I feel like there's so much
potential and opportunity

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.910
to create more of
that connection

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.470
beyond just the working
together and doing your tasks

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.770
and everything you need
to do with its-- I mean,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.652
having yoga sessions or
moments of mindfulness classes.

00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:42.830
I find all of that just
helps to improve how well we

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.150
perform in our work days.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.700
It's not so much about grinding
our way through everything

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.990
we have to do in the
day, but actually

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.110
stepping away sometimes
and setting some time

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.060
for you will make you
feel better at work too.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.970
And it's fun, and
it can actually

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.934
expand into the rest of
the areas of your life.

00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:01.350
AUDIENCE: What do
you think-- kind

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.290
of a familiar question
like the three--

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.970
it doesn't have to be three,
but kind of your biggest lessons

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.700
learned from turning into
this social media celebrity.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.404
It seems kind of unplanned.

00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:15.570
That's what I'm thinking of.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.740
I know when your best
friend passed away

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.420
and you were being really real.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.220
And I saw some posting
like, hey, this is me.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.271
I'm not going to be doing--
I'm not perfect every day.

00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:27.270
I'm not happy every day.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.010
I'm actually going to be
posting some sad stuff.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.096
If you're not OK with it,
you don't have to follow me.

00:20:34.096 --> 00:20:34.970
But I'm just curious.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.678
Like what kind of
things have you learned

00:20:36.678 --> 00:20:38.900
about the world or
people in general

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.290
and how to interact
based on your experience?

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.090
RACHEL BRATHEN: I learned
a lot and it keeps coming.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.320
Those crazy social
media lessons.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.520
I feel social media can be an
absolutely terrifying place.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.170
Like any platform can be
a narcissistic place where

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.120
your ego gets this space to
be look at me, look at me,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.550
like me, follow me, and
it's so easy just to tell.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.050
You can have that feeling of
checking out someone's account

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.490
and feeling like, oh, is this
either inspiring and motivating

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.440
or does it inspire jealousy or
inspired me to feel inadequate

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.050
or like I need to
change who I am?

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.410
So I feel what you give out
is what you get in return.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.350
And there's so many-- I
sometimes go to other people,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.879
like celebrities or people
that have a big, big platforms

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:23.670
and just scroll through
the comments feeds.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.580
And it's scary sometimes
what people write and tell

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.120
each other.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.280
Things they would never
in a million years

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.800
say to someone's face ever.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.300
That's like hiding
behind your phone

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.610
creates this monster of blurting
out the most obnoxious things.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.509
But it also comes from
what you share, and I

00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:41.800
find every single time that
I reach a little bit deeper

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.150
and I share something
that maybe isn't easy.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.800
I mean, it's not something
beautiful or a beautiful meal

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.060
I cooked or a yoga pose.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.100
It's like something real that
took effort for me to share.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.140
I get all of that
love in return.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.370
Like all of it.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.340
There's a whole
gazillion amounts

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.960
of people out there with wisdom
would love that positivity that

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.550
connect and care.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.470
And that can also be brought
out through social media.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:10.501
You just have to decide
to take that road.

00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:12.500
And I can really tell--
so it's really everyday.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.910
Whatever I share I can really
guide it really easily.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.780
Do I want the following
to take this turn today?

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.575
It's so easy to create drama
if that's what you want.

00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:24.820
But I feel we get so much
drama thrown at us every day.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.010
We don't need to
create more of it.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.182
And it's also a nice lesson.

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.390
I like to-- when my friend
passed away, for instance,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.160
so many people started sharing
their own moments of grief.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.180
They never before--
someone passed away

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.440
or they lost someone, and
you put on this big smile

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.940
afterwards.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.990
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.940
And you're not.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.010
So every time you're
genuine to who you are

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.121
and you share that, it allows
other people to be true to what

00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:50.120
they're feeling as well.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.100
It's like a little
ripple effect of truth

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.950
as opposed to a ripple
effect of oh, my God,

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.414
what did Justin Bieber
drink last night?

00:22:58.414 --> 00:23:00.580
All these crazy things that
happened in social media

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.460
that in the big scheme of
things don't mean a whole lot.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.060
AUDIENCE: So as
you've gotten older

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.790
and moved through
different life phases,

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.600
how have you seen
your practice evolve

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.540
and how do you see
it evolving as you

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.036
move into other life phases?

00:23:16.036 --> 00:23:19.530
RACHEL BRATHEN: I really find
that the yoga practice does

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.590
change as your life changes,
and it really moves as a tide.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.220
It peaks, and it
goes down, and it's

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.560
learning how to adapt to
that flow really helps.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.810
I used to have this idea
that my yoga practice has

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.760
to be 90 minutes in a class.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.532
And yes, I'm doing
Chaturanga, sweating,

00:23:36.532 --> 00:23:37.990
or it didn't really
feel like yoga.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.781
That was at the beginning
of my first year,

00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:41.877
so I was really getting
into the practice.

00:23:41.877 --> 00:23:44.210
And then my life started
changing and I'm travelling all

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.550
the time.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.560
I don't have time anymore.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.780
I'm not in the studio space.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.250
I'm not teaching
classes everyday.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.400
I have hotel rooms and airports.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.660
There's not a lot of space for
90 minutes of vinyasa, then.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.740
And then, what I need
is a gentler practice.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.340
When everything is
spinning really quickly,

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.330
then that needs to be
a place of silence.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.200
Of restorative yoga
slowing down and yin.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.160
Some days my practice
is five minutes

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.220
of me putting my legs up
the wall, and that's great.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.170
It won't be like that every day,
but just allowing the practice

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.400
to move as your life
moves is really valuable.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.160
And I know it will go back up
again, and then go back down

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.925
and then go back up.

00:24:21.925 --> 00:24:23.550
AUDIENCE: So I do
some of the practices

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.919
that you posted online,
like the Gaiam ones,

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:27.210
and I really, really love them.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.190
And my favourite quote that
you say is something like,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.770
I think we're in pigeon, and
you say if you want to release

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.410
a little bit more, now
is always a good time.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:40.450
And I find that idea is kind
of so inspirational to me

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.566
that I could just-- now is the
time to make changes in my life

00:24:44.566 --> 00:24:45.440
and things like that.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.900
But I also find that
there's a part of me that's

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.254
like you have to be
realistic about having a job

00:24:51.254 --> 00:24:52.920
and having a house
and all these things.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.730
So how do you kind
of balance the

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.700
want to make big
changes with the need

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.197
to be realistic about
what's happening?

00:25:02.197 --> 00:25:03.780
KRISTA LETTKO: That's
a good question.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.446
RACHEL BRATHEN: That's
a great question.

00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:07.730
I mean, now is always
a really good time.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.610
And if you're constantly
waiting for your life

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.020
to be perfect, to
invite change--

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.750
if that's what you want--
it's never going to happen.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.334
I mean, it's really easy
to say, OK, on January 1,

00:25:18.334 --> 00:25:19.500
I'm going to change my life.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.010
New beginning.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:21.190
Or next Monday I'm
going to start,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.450
or when I'm not this busy.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.060
Or only when my kids grow older.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.620
Or when this and this and this
and this and that happens.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.050
And then in the end,
time passes and we end up

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.810
being stuck in the
same place we wanted

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.110
to get out of years earlier.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:39.000
I really believe in this
change that we want to create.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.360
It needs to come from a really
genuine place of lovingly

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.689
wanting to change something.

00:25:44.689 --> 00:25:46.230
And I find it's such
a big difference

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.920
of-- people ask me a lot.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.950
OK, can I-- I want
to lose weight.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.900
I need to lose weight.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.160
Can yoga help me lose weight?

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.410
Yoga can help you lose weight.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.160
I mean, there's lots
of things you can do.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.716
But why do you want
to lose weight?

00:25:56.716 --> 00:25:58.590
That's, I think, the
more important question.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.049
You want to lose
weight because you

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:01.631
look at yourself in
the mirror and you

00:26:01.631 --> 00:26:03.112
feel like I'm not good enough.

00:26:03.112 --> 00:26:03.820
This is not good.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.870
What I have right
now is not enough.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.910
I am not good enough.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.230
I need to change.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:13.530
Changing from that place, of not
loving who you are, is so hard.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.795
Which is why there's a gazillion
diets out there and people

00:26:16.795 --> 00:26:18.670
crash diet, and then
you gain the weight back

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.510
AND then you go back down.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.593
And then in the end, even
if you lose that weight,

00:26:21.593 --> 00:26:24.160
you're still going to
want to do something else.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.060
You're not going to find that
place of true contentment.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.802
I lost 10 pounds,
now I love who I am.

00:26:28.802 --> 00:26:30.260
You know, it doesn't
work that way.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.561
We think that's how it is.

00:26:31.561 --> 00:26:33.310
If I'm a supermodel,
I will love who I am.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.330
No.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.650
Either love who you
are or you don't.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.300
And I think finding that
love first and realizing

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.960
how important that is.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.010
And, OK, this is who I am.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.930
This is the body
I am blessed with.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.140
Maybe I have aches and pains.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.598
Maybe I'm big or I'm small,
I'm old or I'm young, whatever.

00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:51.650
But this is me and I can choose
to own and love and accept

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.010
and embrace that these are
the cards I'm dealt with.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.550
And I fucking rock.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.120
And then from there, if I
want to lose weight, OK.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.579
It's way easier
because I know it's

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:01.786
going to make me feel better.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:02.962
I'm going to be healthier.

00:27:02.962 --> 00:27:03.670
I'll live longer.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.570
I can run faster.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:05.890
I can play with my kids more.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.230
I can do this and that.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.730
And that change is so
much easier to access.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.116
And then that moment
of now is going

00:27:12.116 --> 00:27:13.490
to be so much
easier to find too.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.670
No, it's a really good question.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.190
And I feel like the yoga
practicing-- there are so

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.148
many ways to get there.

00:27:23.148 --> 00:27:25.554
But coming back to the
heart over and over again

00:27:25.554 --> 00:27:26.720
is the most important thing.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.820
And if you do that through
meditation or through yoga

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.790
or through running or
through playing with your dog

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.373
or whatever it is
that brings you back

00:27:32.373 --> 00:27:34.740
to a moment of heartfulness.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.990
That's where it's at.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.340
It really is.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.400
KRISTA LETTKO: I think, too,
one of my favorite Rachel--

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.130
I don't know what I call
them-- Rachel lessons that

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.680
relates to making those
pivotal decisions.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.490
As you said to me, you either
choose love or you choose fear.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.340
And if it scares you,
then you have to do it.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.490
But it's going back
to this idea is

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.016
why are you making a decision.

00:28:01.016 --> 00:28:03.390
And if it's scaring you, is
that what's holding you back?

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.120
Or is it what?

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.310
Coming at it with
this loving thing.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.350
And it totally just
shifted every decision

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.350
I've made since then.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.920
And it really-- can I trace it
back to is this something I'm

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.760
doing out of fear?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.430
Like, oh, I'm worried
this isn't going to happen

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.160
or real, genuine,
authentic love.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.826
I love that.

00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:23.700
RACHEL BRATHEN: Cool.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.995
KRISTA LETTKO: Thank you.

00:28:24.995 --> 00:28:25.290
RACHEL BRATHEN: Thank you.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.373
Yeah, there's a whole
chapter on that in the book.

00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.278
KRISTA LETTKO: Yes, there is.

00:28:29.278 --> 00:28:32.060
RACHEL BRATHEN: And
it's not always easy,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.880
but we do our best.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.630
thank you so much.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.713
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
we're going to wrap it up,

00:28:36.713 --> 00:28:40.170
and Rachel's going to be doing a
book signing just right outside

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.090
once I give her her shoes back.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.140
So if you guys just want to
form a line outside and thank

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.370
you so much for being here.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.920
That was awesome.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.120
RACHEL BRATHEN:
Thanks, everyone.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.720
Thank you.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.070
[APPLAUSE]
