This episode of Crash Course is brought to you by SquareSpace.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.440
Hi. I'm Craig and this is Crash Course: Government and Politics.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.680
And today, we're gonna talk about the most powerful person in the U.S.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.040
No, not Chris Hemsworth, although he is powerful, in a physical sense.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
We're talking about the President of the United States, who right now is Barack Obama

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.320
But that's the last we'll mention of him specifically.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.700
Instead, we'll examine the office of the Presidency and what makes whoever holds the office so powerful.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.280
We're also gonna talk about what makes him (and so far the President has always been a him)

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.040
less powerful than you might think.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.580
So you might have noticed a bit of a trend in these episodes that we like to start with what the Constitution

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.380
says about the branches of Government.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.160
That's not just because it's what appears on tests or what strict constructionist Justice Scalia would want us to do.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.320
We start with the Constitution because it gives us a 
formal description of the branch, in this case the executive, upon which we can build.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.839
Right Clone: What do you mean upon which we
can build? That's nonsense. The Constitution

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.640
is a limited document. It lays the framework
and the rules and that's all. All this extra

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
stuff is an unconstitutional power grab.
Center Craig: Oh, Clone from the Right, I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500
was wondering what happened to you clones.
That's a good point you make...

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.909
Left Clone: But really the world is a more
complicated than it was in 1787, and we need

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.770
to have a more flexible government. The Constitution
provides a framework for understanding it,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.610
but it needs to change with the times. Besides,
if the President becomes more powerful than

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
what's suggested in the Constitution, whose
fault is that? Congress! That's who!

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.880
Center Craig: Okay clones, we get the picture.
There's a debate about the role of the Constitution

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.990
in setting up the government and we’re not
gonna solve it today. For now, we’re gonna

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.619
start with the Constitution and what it says
about the President.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.899
Left Clone: You win this round, Clone from
the Right.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.659
Center Craig: All right, let's try to keep
those convos in the clone zone going forward?

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.119
Thank you. Anyway, as with Congress, the Constitution
lays out certain qualifications for the presidency.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.079
If you want to be President of the US, and I know
you do, you must be 35 years old, which in the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.080
1780s was actually pretty old. You were expected to
have moved out of your parents’ house by that point…

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.540
And you must be a citizen of the US who
was born in the United States, or one of its territories.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.930
The President is not elected directly by the
American people. Yeah, your mind is blown.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.250
In the Constitution, as originally written, only
members of the House of Representatives

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.260
were directly elected by qualified citizens.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.980
The President is actually chosen by the Electoral
College, which is complicated and frustrating

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.160
for many Americans, and we’re not gonna
go into it now, except to say that the reason

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.480
it exists is because the Framers didn’t
trust the popular vote all that much, so they

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.519
built in the Electoral College as a safeguard
against the people electing scary demigods

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.720
or the person.. they wanted… elected.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.340
Some people say this is not particularly democratic,
mostly because it's not particularly democratic.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.120
So democratically elected or not, the President
is pretty powerful, but he has different categories of powesr. What are they?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.379
First, he has military powers to send soldiers
and planes and ships to do military things.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.320
He also has judicial powers, in that he appoints
federal judges and Supreme Court judges,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.880
subject to Senate approval, of course.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.319
He’s the nation’s chief diplomat, which
is the source of his foreign policy power.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.679
The president can also propose laws, although
he has to get a Congressmen or Senator to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.420
actually introduce them into Congress. This
is a legislative power.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.970
And since he’s the chief executive, he also has
executive power, which means he's supposed to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.280
to ensure that the laws are carried out. This
is his most far reaching power, probably because

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.660
it’s the least well defined. Executive power is a pretty
big deal, so we’re gonna give that its own episode.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.420
Another way to describe the president’s
powers is as either formal or informal. Formal

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.700
powers are the ones we can find in the Constitution
itself, mainly in Article 2. The informal

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.040
powers come either from Congress or the President
himself, but for now, let’s look at the formal powers,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.519
which like those given to Congress, are also knwon
as expressed powers. Let go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.180
Unfortunately, presidents don’t derive their
powers from the sun, like Superman. Or from

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.340
exposure to radiation like the Fantastic Four
or the Hulk. The powers come from the constitution,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.740
which again, unfortunately doesn’t have
any super natural or mystical power,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.440
although some people like to think it does.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.660
The first power given to the President in
the Constitution is that he is the Commander

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.280
in Chief of the Armed Forces, which at the time was
just the Army and Navy, since there were no airplanes.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.470
There's a reason that this should be the first
power. If there's one thing that almost everyone

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.439
can agree on, it's that the first job of government
is to keep the citizens safe, especially from

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.980
foreign invasion. The US has had a lot of
generals become president: Washington, Jackson,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.400
William Henry Harrison, Taylor, Grant, Eisenhower,
and many others have served in the military,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.159
but only one president has led the US troops
in the field while he was President, and that

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.150
was George Washington. The Whiskey Rebellion.
That's something worth fighting over.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.159
The President has diplomatic powers, although
he doesn't actually do most of the diplomacy.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.430
The President has the power to make treaties,
which are mostly written by the State Department

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.020
officials, but he takes credit. He appoints
ambassadors and those State Department officials

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.080
I just mentioned. His most visible foreign
policy power is to receive ambassadors, which

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.980
not only makes for great photo opportunities
- selfie!- but also is a significant power

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.830
because receiving an ambassador effectively
means recognition of that ambassador's country's

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.260
existence. So the President can actually legitimize
a nation-state. Maybe he does have superpowers.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.890
The Constitution requires that the President
from time to time inform Congress of the state

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.750
of the Union. This takes the form of an annual
State of the Union address. Historically,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.880
presidents did this in writing, although George
Washington made a formal address. We have

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.600
Woodrow Wilson to thank for reviving the practice
of making the State of the Union an actual

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.100
speech, which now appears on television early
each year. This may not seem like much of

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.640
a power, but the State of the Union is a chance
for the President to set a policy agenda for

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.220
the next year, and it can put some pressure on
Congress to make policy. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.560
So the President has a couple of other powers
we've already talked about. The President

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.250
has a form of legislative power to veto laws
passed by Congress. He also has the power

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.000
to convene Congress into special sessions.
The President also has judicial powers. He

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.480
can appoint judges, but only with the consent
of the Senate. He does have the power to grant

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.690
pardons and reprieves, which doesn't sound
like a big deal, unless you're in jail or

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.840
threatened by criminal prosecution, in which
case it's a very big deal.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.040
So there you have it. Those are the formal
constitutional powers of the President of

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.060
the United States. You may have noticed that
there aren't all that many of them. Which

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.700
is kind of the point. The framers of the Constitution
wanted a limited government. One that couldn't

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.680
oppress the people. They were especially afraid
of a strong executive, like a king, in charge

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.570
of a standing army, so they deliberately tried
to curtail his powers by not giving him very

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.590
many. But as we'll see in the next few episodes,
over the course of the last 240 years or so,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.230
the powers of the President have expanded
far beyond what framers probably envisioned.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.530
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.750
Mmm. I can feel my powers expanding.
Is this radioactive coffee?
