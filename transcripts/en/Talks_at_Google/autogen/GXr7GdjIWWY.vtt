[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.020
MITRA NATARAJ: So thank you,
Michelle, for joining us.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.760
I'm Mitra.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.218
For those of you
who don't know me,

00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:16.780
I'm a business
manager in [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.489
Michelle is the CEO of Peanut.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.780
And she she's also the founder.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.390
And it's basically a
Tinder-style dating apps

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.990
for moms to meet other mothers.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.160
The app launched
in Feb this year

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.330
and has had amazing traction.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.790
So it's been picked
up in the press a lot.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.450
So you might have seen
her mentioned there.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.300
And we wanted to take
this opportunity for her

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.430
to come in because I know
a lot of Googlers talk

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.500
about starting their
own thing or starting

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.180
something outside of work.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.910
And sometimes the inertia of
just being in your day job

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.150
can stop that.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.110
So someone who's actually gone
from working for other people

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.150
to working for herself is
quite an interesting journey.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.394
So Michelle also launched
Peanut on Android in October.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:01.310
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Yeah

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.300
MITRA NATARAJ:
Yeah, so finally we

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.992
can claim fame to it as
well, which is amazing.

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:07.450
So I'm going to do
a few questions,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.770
but, really, please come.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.540
Please have your own
questions prepared.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.660
So we'll have loads of time
at the end for your questions

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.720
as well.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.650
So I remember distinctly
when you first

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.840
talked to us about the idea.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.240
So I know Michelle outside
of this particular thing.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.110
We were at a wedding, and
she had her phone and a deck

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.040
on her phone.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
And it was like, this
is my idea for an app

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.199
and what it was
going to be like.

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:38.740
I remember at that
point she was kind

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.290
of passing the phone around
the table, and a lot of people

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.620
were like, this is amazing.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.590
And equally a lot of people were
like, isn't this like Mumsnet

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.650
and really challenging
about the idea.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.500
So can you talk a
little bit about where

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.730
the idea came from, and then how
you got to that first investor

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.330
meeting and the challenges and
people's reactions to that?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.090
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Yeah,
so I started life actually

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.039
as a corporate
lawyer way back when.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.050
That was my starting point.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.780
I used to do a lot
of M&amp;A. And I went

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.210
to work in-house for a
biotech company which

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.170
was, again very, very different
and not very me at all.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.020
And one of the lawyers that
I used to work for called me

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.685
and me, you should
go meet this guy.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.120
He's a new client of mine.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.830
He needs someone to
go and work with him.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.740
I think you'd be great.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.698
I think you'll love it.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:33.010
It's a dating web site.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.310
I was, like, uh-hm, not really.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.590
And this was back in 2010.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.670
And dating was definitely
not what it is now.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.210
And there was definitely a
feeling of like, mm, dating,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.399
not sure--

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.690
maybe something your parents
did when they got divorced

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.470
or it just wasn't
like it is today.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.810
And tech definitely
wasn't the kind of--

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.340
in London, it
definitely didn't have

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.846
the same feel and excitement
and buzz that it does now.

00:02:57.846 --> 00:03:00.400
And I went to meet the founder.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.560
He was a young guy
who was unusual.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.810
And it was interesting.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.899
I'd never really understood
it as a business.

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.440
And what I mostly
couldn't understand

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.830
is that there were 56 million
people using this product I'd

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.491
never heard of called Badoo.

00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:19.400
MITRA NATARAJ: Has
anyone heard of Badoo?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.900
Yeah?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.620
MICHELLE KENNEDY: And I
met a few more people.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.740
It was very exciting.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.480
It was some crazy
rundown office in Soho.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.720
And I decided I would do it.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.950
So I became the lawyer there.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.114
I'm very noisy.

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.280
I asked lots of questions--
under the guise of being

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.170
the lawyer, you're allowed--

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.190
and particularly was fascinated
by it was making money.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.575
I wanted to
understand how people

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:46.450
were using the product,
what the journey was,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.940
why they would pay
for certain things.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.570
And then I was there for the
evolution from web to mobile.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.760
So this was all back, like web.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.040
I think the most adventurous
we had was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.980
And it was kind of
that transition.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.590
And that was exciting,
really understanding

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.180
why people's behavior
was different,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.670
why people were spending
differently, how long they

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.170
spent on web versus mobile--

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.590
all of these different
vantage points

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.692
that I'd never really
seen of a business before.

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:20.696
And it came to the
evolution of Tinder.

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:21.529
And Tinder came out.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.028
And I remember my girlfriends
in the States talking about it

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:26.629
and me being like, what is it?

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:27.670
And it was a gray screen.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.140
And I was desperate to see
and desperate to understand.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.140
And that was really the
starting point of looking more--

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.250
less about legal and more about
being involved in the business.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.210
I started working alongside
Andre as his kind of right hand

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.300
and became deputy CEO at Badoo.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.425
And as part of that
was involved in Bumble,

00:04:49.425 --> 00:04:53.950
which I'm very proud of
and was very exciting.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.580
And I suppose it was
that whole journey.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.650
And that was over the
course of five years--

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.780
wrapped up in 30 seconds--

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.050
that I decided that
I really wanted

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.370
to do something that-- a
product that I would use.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.030
I wasn't dating in
my personal life.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.040
And I really had
had this experience

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.650
when I became a mother
that I didn't really have

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.110
any girlfriends who had babies.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.640
And I really wanted to just
take all of the learnings

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.430
that I had about connectivity
and apply it to women.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.436
I also was really frustrated
by the products that

00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:35.560
were out there for mothers.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.370
Everything changed.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.390
You go from using--

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.830
whether it is Snapchat-- at
the time, which was really,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.760
really buzzing--

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.190
or Insta or Pinterest
or Deliveroo

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.980
or any of these amazing-- or
Uber-- any of these very slick,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.300
cool products.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.880
And then you become a mom,
and it was like, well,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.942
where's my thing?

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:55.900
And everything felt like
it was very much aimed

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.340
at babies and kids and not
aimed at me as a woman.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.850
And so I decided I would do it.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.880
So I left Badoo in
January last year.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.310
And it was absolutely
terrifying.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.935
I loved my job.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:13.893
And I loved what I did.

00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:15.490
And I was very
proud of everything

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.070
that I did with Badoo
and with Bumble.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.775
And so to make that move was--

00:06:20.775 --> 00:06:21.400
well, you know.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.872
I was very scared.

00:06:23.872 --> 00:06:25.080
But I really wanted to do it.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.170
And I believed in it.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.390
And it wasn't just that I
wanted to do a product for me.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.020
It's a huge business
opportunity.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.910
Women are making 85% of
household decisions on spend,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.440
and yet there was
just this huge gap.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.370
And I really wanted
to address it.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.349
So I left, did a
lot of consulting,

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.890
saved a lot of money because I
knew I would have to start the

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.400
build on my own.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.680
And I went to one of
our friends' weddings

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.140
and was talking through it.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.120
And one of our friends,
in particular--

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.640
who is now a very
avid supporter--

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.430
was like, I don't get it.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.240
I don't think moms
really need this.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.740
And I was, like,
how would you know?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.680
You're not a mom.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.517
But also, why?

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:10.350
And he was like, yeah,
but, this is Mumsnet.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.475
I was like, absolutely not.

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:15.020
This is something
very, very different.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.890
And I think at that time,
I had had my term sheet.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.470
So I had just got a
term sheet from NEA.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.980
And getting the term sheet,
it was a real whirlwind

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.530
because I don't think I
really fully appreciated

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.270
what that process was.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.640
So I'd gone from--

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.260
probably through naivete--

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.382
I just was really ballsy and
had me in a deck and that's it.

00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:40.090
MITRA NATARAJ: So
that's all you how had?

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.780
Did you commission someone
to do some research?

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.940
Or did you do your own research?

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.330
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Me.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.500
Yeah.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.710
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.210
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I had done it.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.680
MITRA NATARAJ: OK.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.596
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I'd
just gone and researched

00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.567
the market, had a look
at what had changed.

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.900
What was the size of the market?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.490
What else was out there?

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.230
Doing those weird
competitor analyses,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.560
speaking to women, so
many women everywhere--

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.100
on Facebook groups,
in real life,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.910
everywhere-- asking them what
they did, what was their view.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.742
Lots and lots of that
qualitative research.

00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:08.950
MITRA NATARAJ: And was one
of the overwhelming things

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.741
that came from that
was that there was just

00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:14.720
nothing on the market that
really targeted a woman who

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.210
was a modern person, basically?

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.400
It would seem to
be from the '80s.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.100
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Yeah, I think
that the overwhelming response

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.140
was we were using
products, or women

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.940
were using products
that were there

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.710
because that's what they had.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.700
And there wasn't really anything
that had innovated forward.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.039
And it was that moment
for me, where I was

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.630
like, why can it be me then?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.320
Why can't I be the
one to change it?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.260
And that is not to do down
any of the products that

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.090
were out there.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.800
Mumsnet, BabyCenter,
What to Expect--

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.580
all of these amazing platforms
did something amazing

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.640
15 years ago, which is they gave
women a voice who are mothers.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.140
And we didn't have it before.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.240
So I would never
ever knock that.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.889
It was just I was looking at
doing something different.

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:00.430
MITRA NATARAJ: So
you have this idea.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.230
You have this deck.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.000
How do you-- where
do you go from there?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.190
Who were you shopping
it around to?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.740
And how do you get your
first investors on board?

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.080
And what was that process like?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.000
Especially since there
wasn't anything exactly

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.833
like what you were
describing on the market.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.780
And you're going to
a lot of investors

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.820
who I'm assuming
don't understand

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.094
that particular psyche and
that particular loneliness that

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.010
comes from motherhood.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.470
So how do you go through that
process of convincing them

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.510
that this is something
that there is a market for?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.020
MICHELLE KENNEDY: That
part is challenging.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.700
So in terms of how
do you identify?

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.300
It's very different-- or,
how I did it this time around

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.034
and how I would do
it going forward,

00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:43.450
and if I were doing
it again, it's

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.290
very different to how
I did it completely

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.707
naively and inexperiencedly,
which is I spoke to everyone.

00:09:48.707 --> 00:09:51.164
If someone said, I'll give you
an intro, I was like, great.

00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:52.290
I'll take the intro.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.810
And I was non-discriminatory
in who I spoke to.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.260
And I suppose the upside
of that is I learned a lot.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.350
So I learned when things--

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.910
what conversations
not to have, what

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.910
the difference between a late
stage and early stage fund is,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.090
and, oh, when
someone says to you,

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.490
we're at the end of our fund.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.950
But if you can hold
off until we're

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.980
at the beginning of our next
fund, what does that even mean?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.000
All of basic things that just
were a complete mind field.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.571
And this time I've been
much more targeted,

00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:25.070
and I want to speak
to you because I

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.403
think you understand the
market or whatever it might be.

00:10:27.403 --> 00:10:33.170
But I spoke to everyone,
and that is tough.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.315
I shamelessly asked
for intros to people.

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.940
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah,
well, you have to.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.080
Yeah.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.330
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I'd have to.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.710
And I asked friends, and
friends of friends, ,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:50.930
and met I met NEA through
Whitney at Bumble.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.690
And that was the kind
of starting point.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.870
And from there, anyone I
spoke to, I would always

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.504
say at the end of it, thank
you so much for your time.

00:11:00.504 --> 00:11:02.420
If you can think of
anyone else that you think

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.711
I should be speaking to--
and I always ended like that.

00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:08.130
I don't think that's necessarily
the right way, by the way.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.952
Do your own research,
and you can be--

00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:11.160
MITRA NATARAJ: More targeted.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.100
MICHELLE KENNEDY: More targeted,
because it's important for you,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.600
too.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.766
It's like a marriage, right?

00:11:15.766 --> 00:11:18.260
You're getting into a
relationship with this person.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.825
They're going to
be in your business

00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:21.250
for the next foreseeable.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.000
MITRA NATARAJ: So how did you
approach things differently

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.970
with your second round.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.520
This is your seed funding
round that she just closed.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.441
It was on the front
page of the "Times."

00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:29.899
I don't know if
anyone else saw it.

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:31.502
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Thanks.

00:11:31.502 --> 00:11:32.615
MITRA NATARAJ: So,
yeah, that's fantastic.

00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:33.610
So congratulations on that.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.350
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Thank you.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.070
MITRA NATARAJ: So how did
you approach it differently?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.670
Did you target
funds and say, I'm

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.970
going to go after you for your--

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.250
because I believe that
you'll understand this market

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.182
a little bit better?

00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:45.890
MICHELLE KENNEDY: It
was obviously easier

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.200
because before I
was pre-product.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.090
I was kind of
pre-team, actually.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.380
Greg and I hadn't--

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.757
at the point I was starting
to speak to investors, Greg

00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:55.340
and I hadn't decided
to work together.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.410
He's my co-founder.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.650
And so it was very, very early.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.560
This time, obviously,
our product is out there.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.680
We have metrics.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.900
We have a team.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.140
We can go out, and it's much
easier to speak to people.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.120
And I was much more purposeful
about who I was speaking to

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920
and why.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.436
And so we have two joint
lead investors on this round.

00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:23.060
And they both bring
something different

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.101
I'm really excited about.

00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:28.310
Sweet Capital, who are
the founders of king.com,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.240
so Candy Crush, which
was really exciting--

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.490
MITRA NATARAJ: That's amazing.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.698
MICHELLE KENNEDY: --for me
from a product perspective

00:12:33.698 --> 00:12:35.880
and their insight and their
understanding of women

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.710
spending time on Candy
Crush and all of those.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.360
That was valuable
for me, and I really

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.100
was excited to
have them on board.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.210
And the Female Founders Fund
in New York, obviously exciting

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.026
for me to have a female VC
with that kind of overview

00:12:51.026 --> 00:12:52.650
and understanding of
the female market.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:58.370
So I was very, very specific
about who we spoke to.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.950
I also kept in contact
with people like Greycroft,

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.776
who I'd met first time when
I was doing our pre-seed.

00:13:03.776 --> 00:13:05.900
And so when I was like,
look, we're doing our seed,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.550
obviously, I'd built a
relationship with them

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.190
over a year.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.220
So then it was easy for
them to say yes, we're in.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.820
So I think that's
how it was different.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.460
It was definitely targeted.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.969
I think probably naivete made
me a bit fearless last time.

00:13:20.969 --> 00:13:22.510
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah,
fantastic, yeah.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.280
MICHELLE KENNEDY: But also
you do waste a bit of time

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:25.920
in that way.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.736
And if you're doing it
ever, you can be selfish.

00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:29.860
Your time is precious, too.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.480
And maybe it's not the right
time to take that introduction.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.510
If someone says to you, amazing.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.210
Wait right now.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.060
I'm just going to introduce you
to-- is it OK to say, actually,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.622
can I come back to you when I'm
ready for that introduction?

00:13:40.622 --> 00:13:42.080
Because you don't
want to waste it.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.090
It could be an amazing
intro, but do it

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.160
at a time that suits you.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.970
MITRA NATARAJ: So if I go back
a little bit to when you first

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.350
launched, so you want
to make a big splash,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.750
but I assume you don't want
a bunch of people downloading

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.370
this app and no one
else is on there.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.830
And I was listening to an
interview with a Tinder

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.330
founder.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.970
And he was like, he
basically ran from one room

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.910
to the other in a college
campus, and was like,

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.630
women are there.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.046
And then he ran
to the other room,

00:14:10.046 --> 00:14:12.200
and was like, get on there
because men are there.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.410
And he had to kind of get
those first people online

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.850
before you could actually
get big traction.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.470
So how did you get those--

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.620
that first critical
mass before you

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.597
can make a big
splash in the market?

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:24.680
Or is that how you did it?

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.100
Or how did you intro it?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.600
No?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.500
MICHELLE KENNEDY: The idea
was we would launch in London

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.910
and New York simultaneously.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.640
And we would seed it
with some women who we

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.740
knew had existing communities.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.680
Very small, it was
really proof of concept.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.670
Can you go and test it?

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.320
Seed it to women that you know.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.460
Get their feedback.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.970
Let's see.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.100
So, really, in
that first week, I

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.100
think we thought we'd be
doing really well if we

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.210
had 50 people using it, and we
could see their interaction.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.380
And we did do that.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.390
And then the next day,
it went [EXPLOSION NOISE]

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.284
And the press coverage was--

00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:05.200
MITRA NATARAJ: Insane.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.190
MICHELLE KENNEDY: --insane
and very interested.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.520
And so that amplified.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.150
But I still was very
clear on the fact

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.520
that if you're building
a social product,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.230
you have to feel
exactly what you said.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.130
There are people around you.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.080
You can't open the app and
be like, OK, so the nearest

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.900
woman is in Tennessee.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.830
MITRA NATARAJ: But you
never had that problem.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.400
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Yeah, so--

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.090
MITRA NATARAJ: It's so amazing.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.090
MICHELLE KENNEDY: So we
were very focused on it.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.160
But we then became
very reactive.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.180
So we would see women using
it in Dallas or women using it

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.580
in LA or women
using it in Chicago.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.711
And then we would do a small
event or a dinner or something

00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:42.210
to let other women know in the
area you'll have a great user

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.584
experience if you use Peanut
here because we already have

00:15:44.584 --> 00:15:45.780
thousands of women using it.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.580
But it was very organic
up until that point.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.650
MITRA NATARAJ: Amazing.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.210
So you sort of
talked about that you

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.730
were involved in dating apps.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.245
And Michelle actually
named Bumble.

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:57.880
So you've got a knack
for naming things.

00:16:00.276 --> 00:16:01.650
And we've sort of
seeing this arc

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.040
that you also described
that online dating was

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.510
very weird to begin with.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.837
And now, if you are single and
you do want to meet someone,

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:11.670
it's not a question.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.770
You would be on a dating app.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:18.180
So what is the arc that you
are trying to see with Peanut?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.620
So my observation--
and you can tell me

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.860
if this is right or
wrong-- is that loneliness

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.490
is one of the last taboos
that we talk about.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.820
And not just for moms, it's
if you're married or anything,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.210
you have to have this bravado
about not being lonely.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.680
So where do you see--

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.540
what is your
overarching mission?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.500
And where do you see
Peanut shaping that arc?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.730
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I think
that you're absolutely right.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.990
The evolution from dating going
from something slightly awkward

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.650
to everyone's doing it and
my friends describing it

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.770
as Michelle in dating, too,
Michelle works in dating, too.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.300
I remember it so clearly.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.990
And I think what there
is a lot of discussion

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.369
around is tech and social
media making us more lonely.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.650
And for me, it's all
about how you use it.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.490
If you're using it
in a way that helps

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.089
you have those in
real life connections,

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.339
how could that ever
be a bad thing?

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.060
So we have tools
within Peanut that

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.550
facilitate polling and
scheduling times to meet.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.430
So it's like having
a Doodle effectively

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.750
but within the messaging.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.970
And three clicks, and
it's in your calendar.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.680
And for me, that
was really important

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.140
because it's about
getting that face to face.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.030
But what's more scary?

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.810
Sitting looking at your phone
and watching everyone else's

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.512
life, or then
sending a connection

00:17:38.512 --> 00:17:39.720
to meet someone in real life?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.770
Well, it's more scary just
watching the world pass you.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.860
So I think that
we will see more.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.985
There is a lot more
conversation around loneliness.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.193
And I know that we have a
lot of conversations about,

00:17:51.193 --> 00:17:53.150
are millennials the
loneliest generation ever

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.640
and all of these things?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.050
And I think that it's about
encouraging tech, or using tech

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.870
to help you meet in real life
and to facilitate in real life.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.130
And I think that the last
taboo that we need to break

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.690
is actually being able
to come out and say

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.860
as a 30-something,
yeah, I'm lonely.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.250
Or, yeah, this is tough, and
it's not everything everyone

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.860
told me it would be.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.911
Or, yes, sometimes it's 2 AM.

00:18:19.911 --> 00:18:21.660
And I feel like the
whole world is asleep,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.280
and I'm awake feeding this baby.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.530
And no one else understands
me, or whatever it might be.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.120
And that being able to have
that contact with someone

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.040
and support, a network
is really important.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.020
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah,
do you find that that's

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.500
sort of your biggest
barrier to growth,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.570
is that people download
the app, and then they're

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.230
nervous about actually
contacting other moms?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.312
And do you see a massive
difference between--

00:18:41.312 --> 00:18:43.020
you've launched in
the States, obviously,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.450
and how they've
adopted the product

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.590
very differently from here?

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.030
MICHELLE KENNEDY:
Yeah, so I think

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.310
that there is a difference
between the US and the UK

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.810
behavior.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.600
We're only in the US and the UK.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.740
Culturally, I don't know
how terribly British

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.930
it is to speak to
people we don't know.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.650
I don't think we're madly good
at it versus in the States

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.890
where people are perhaps a
little bit more open to giving

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.450
it a go.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.170
And so I do think
that we can see

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.030
a little bit of a difference.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.200
Again, it kind of depends on
your stage of life as well.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.660
If you used a dating app to
meet your partner, of course,

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.270
this doesn't seem like a hurdle.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.103
Well, of course, it
would be a natural thing

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:25.530
that you're going to use an
app like this to meet friends.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.820
So they're all different.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.220
It's very personal in that way.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:35.700
I think that we do see women
who use the app and watch.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.820
They're watching.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.330
I'm a lurker, too,
so I totally get it--

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.180
so watching before they do it.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.390
And then I sometimes
get messages from women.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.160
What can I say?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.450
I don't know what the
best message to send is,

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.290
or whatever it is.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.970
And for me, I'm just
like, say anything.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.710
Say Hi.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.160
Say what you're
eating, whatever.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.720
It doesn't matter.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.886
But that's much less scary.

00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.260
Sending that
message is much less

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.780
scary than spending
a week on your own

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.310
without a grown-up to talk to.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.643
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:09.440
So I'm going to open it up
to the floor in one question.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.450
So keep them ready.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.940
Before I do that, so
at Google, I mean,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.220
we obviously started out
with two people in a garage.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.540
And one of the principles
that we try to stay true to,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.820
at least, is being very
scrappy and having less

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.890
will force you to be
smarter and do better.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.260
So you're obviously small still.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.050
So how are you thinking?

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.180
You've got ambitious
plans for Peanut.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.640
But you're still a small team.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.090
So how are you prioritizing?

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.000
And how are you thinking about
your next growth stage given

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.750
that constraint so that you
propel yourself in the best

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.626
way possible to grow?

00:20:45.626 --> 00:20:47.416
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I
think it's really hard.

00:20:47.416 --> 00:20:50.540
I do believe that having little
makes you scrappy because you

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.060
have no choice, right?

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.264
And it's do or die.

00:20:53.264 --> 00:20:54.680
I have to go out
there, and I have

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.434
to establish that the
product is, firstly, viable

00:20:57.434 --> 00:20:58.850
and, secondly,
we've got traction.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.520
Otherwise we have no product.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.350
So I do believe in it.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.265
We are a team of six.

00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:06.080
So we're very small.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.440
And every decision I make,
I equate to head count.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.040
So if I'm going to spend
x on a really nice office,

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.670
for example-- and I'm not
currently; I'm squatting.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.130
But if I'm going to
spend x on office space,

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.780
well, that's like
two extra people

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.690
in the team that can
make us go, reach

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.880
that part of our roadmap
three months ahead of plan.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.110
So I always equate it to
headcount and the ability

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.510
to go faster.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.267
I cheekily ask for favors.

00:21:35.267 --> 00:21:37.100
People have asked me
for favors in the past,

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.840
and I've always
helped where I can.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.080
So I don't think anyone should
be shy to ask for favors.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.465
They actually might be really
excited to work with you.

00:21:45.465 --> 00:21:46.340
And what's the worst?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.000
They say no.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.790
OK.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.110
So it's no bother.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.590
So I shamelessly ask people.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.130
And I think what
we now need to do,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.070
we're building a new feature
at the moment which is very

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.650
head-down, product focused.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.850
And then we really have
to go out and amplify it.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.320
And that's quite scary
because I have to go and let

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.700
all of our existing users know.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.780
Fine-- that's no bother.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.980
But now it's really
sharing it more widely.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.740
And we have a limited budget.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.930
And we have a certain
time to establish it in.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.550
And we'll have to
learn as we go.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.190
And probably because
we are a team of six,

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.020
we can be quite
agile and say, OK,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.050
that didn't work, scrap, next.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.790
We do a bit of test and dump.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.995
Test it-- didn't work.

00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:35.510
OK, next.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.240
And I think not being
precious and not

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.490
being too tied to your
idea of this will work,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.830
and being prepared to say,
OK, and on with the next

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.360
is helpful.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.170
But I've made mistakes
along the way.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.380
Of course, we all do.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.750
At the time, it's the most
painful thing in the world.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.749
You're like, oh, my god.

00:22:54.749 --> 00:22:56.290
That was 5,000 pounds.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.727
And then it's 5K that I
will never waste again.

00:22:59.727 --> 00:23:00.810
MITRA NATARAJ: Absolutely.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.540
So I'm going to open
it to the floor.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.620
Anyone with questions?

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.388
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:05.388 --> 00:23:06.620
AUDIENCE: OK, sorry.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.030
Quick question-- two
quick questions for you.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.560
One, co-founders are
really important because

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.410
after your seed funding,
for all other rounds,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.060
that duo is really
important to investors.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.840
So how did you pick
your co-founder?

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.880
And the second
question is, did you

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.840
find what you were
looking for out of Peanut?

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.710
MICHELLE KENNEDY: So Greg
is my perfect opposite.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.876
He is brilliant.

00:23:35.876 --> 00:23:40.590
Not that I'm not
brilliant-- sounds awful.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.250
Confidence, Michelle.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.760
But he's very focused.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.840
And he is a
brilliant technician.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.419
And he is very logical.

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:50.960
And I'm always
thinking of over here,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.710
and he's thinking about how
we're going to get there.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.470
I found Greg purely by accident.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.550
I was speaking to a friend
that we had in common

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.870
and saying that I
really needed to hire,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.340
but I couldn't hire anyone
from Badoo or Bumble.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.900
I was under a
restrictive covenant.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.820
And so my usual pool
was out of bounds.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.890
And she said, oh, you
should speak to Greg.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.900
He's just left Deliveroo.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.490
He'll have an idea
of the market.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.700
And so I was waiting
for the introduction.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.677
I got really impatient.

00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:22.760
It was taking a long time.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.960
So I just e-mailed him.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.126
And I was like, so I'm
waiting for this introduction

00:24:26.126 --> 00:24:28.910
from our friend.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.560
Can I pick your brains about
the market and whatever?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.650
And we started speaking.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.030
And he was like,
actually, I love the idea.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.130
I'm going to do with you.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.450
So it was-- we kind fell
into it in that way.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.470
He has a little girl and
had understood the issues

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.720
surrounding it.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.200
And so I was very
lucky in that way.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.650
And he's definitely probably
the better half of Peanut.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:25:00.080
And in terms of have I go
out of Peanut what I wanted,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.530
it is the best feeling
in the world when

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.100
someone messages you
to say, I've just met

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.060
my ex-best friend on Peanut.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.687
Or, I was having a
really tough time,

00:25:10.687 --> 00:25:12.520
and I can see light at
the end of the tunnel

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.100
because I've got a
drink with a girl

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.330
I've met on Friday, whatever
it might be because that's

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.500
what it's for, right?

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.140
And my favorite thing--
it's like a weird--

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.810
get off a plane wherever I am,
open Peanut, see women around.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.310
Hi.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.120
Speak to them.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.162
[INAUDIBLE] just to
see what they're doing.

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:31.870
And it's amazing.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.030
I can find out
where they go to eat

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.900
or where's a kid-friendly
place, whatever it is.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.610
And it's that kind of
community and hyper community.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.719
It's amazing.

00:25:40.719 --> 00:25:42.010
So, yeah, I'm very proud of it.

00:25:44.172 --> 00:25:45.380
AUDIENCE: My name is Camilla.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.290
And I'm super excited
to have you here.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.640
So the question is,
you're being a lawyer,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.830
I'm assuming you did have some
exposure to technical terms

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.660
and stuff in your
previous careers.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.690
But still, building an
app is very technical.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.640
So, how did you overcome?

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.400
How deep was your knowledge,
did it have to be?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.430
Or you probably had your
co-founder to help with that.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.562
Basically, the fear is,
can you actually learn

00:26:09.562 --> 00:26:10.270
all these things?

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.907
Or do you have to as a founder?

00:26:11.907 --> 00:26:12.865
MITRA NATARAJ: And we--

00:26:12.865 --> 00:26:15.130
I think most of the
people in this building

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.870
are on the business side.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.390
And so when we
talk to engineers,

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.820
there is a little
bit of a disconnect.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.800
So the extension of
that is, how do you

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.500
make your preferences known
so that they interpret it

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.850
into what is now
really a beautiful app?

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.360
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I just
ask questions all the time.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.040
And I don't think I really
have a shame about whether it's

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.100
a stupid question or not because
it would be most stupid if I

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.310
pretended to know and
it turns out wrong

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:53.200
or I haven't been able to
express it in the right way.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.140
I am very fortunate
Greg is patient.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.582
And I do have a brilliant team
who I communicate well with.

00:26:59.582 --> 00:27:00.290
And you're right.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.710
I was working in an industry
where I have an awareness.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.480
But I will ask.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.180
And I will pick and
prod until I understand

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:16.250
why we can't do something or
why it's been done in that way.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.967
And I just think
that you have to be

00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:20.050
fearless in the questions.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.090
Actually, you'll
find in the same way

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.280
that you feel proud about
your work every day,

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.160
the engineers are so
proud of what they do,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.250
if you ask, they're delighted
to share it with you, right?

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.530
Everyone in my team, if
I want to know something,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.890
they're delighted to
tell me why it is.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.980
And I suppose if you
were so interested

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.890
and you both care about
what you're building,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.620
it's natural that you will
ask and they will answer.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.400
And you'll get to that point.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.950
But I don't think
you should ever

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.692
be fearful of what you ask.

00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:52.650
MITRA NATARAJ: I think
there's a question here.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.920
AUDIENCE: Two things.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.756
The first one is, because
in a social network,

00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:03.880
you have that effect that
the more people you have,

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.972
blah, blah, blah.

00:28:04.972 --> 00:28:06.680
I want to ask you
about how you picked up

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.270
the very initial people to seed
it with because it influences

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.320
the trajectory.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.170
The second thing I want
to ask is about funding.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.570
So where did you go
for funding and why?

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.190
Since you have a UK
and a US connection,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.520
I think that there are things
that fly here and don't

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.220
fly over there, and
vice versa, if you

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.445
have an opinion about it.

00:28:27.445 --> 00:28:28.820
MICHELLE KENNEDY:
And so in terms

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.990
of getting those initial
users, in getting

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.670
that initial
traction, that really

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.880
comes down to me just
speaking to a lot of people

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.870
and being cheeky
enough to say, so I've

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.900
got this app coming out.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.170
Can I let you know when it's
like-- will you test it for me?

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.512
And mostly people
want to be involved,

00:28:48.512 --> 00:28:49.970
and they want to
help you, and they

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.355
want to test something new.

00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:54.909
So, again, shamelessly asking
people, will you do that?

00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:57.200
Will you send it-- will you
share it with your friends?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.850
Will you tell your
friends when it's ready?

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:05.174
And using my friends in the
States, in New York, to say,

00:29:05.174 --> 00:29:06.590
hey, can you ask
your girlfriends?

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.350
So it was really that.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:14.450
And I think that the more
you talk about something--

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.520
I've had people
say weird things.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.900
You mustn't tell
anyone your idea.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.370
Don't tell anyone your
idea until it's ready.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.120
I just think it's
bizarre because how will

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.400
you ever know whether your idea
is for you or for everyone?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.600
You'll never know whether your
product has a good fit or not.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.310
So I spoke-- well, [INAUDIBLE]
and I spoke at a wedding--

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.830
I spoke to everyone about it
because I wanted to know more.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.710
And I wanted to know what
people had to say about it.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.369
And I wanted to understand
how they would use it and why

00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:43.910
so that then when
it came to release,

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.760
they were excited
to test it for me.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.602
I tested it.

00:29:47.602 --> 00:29:50.060
I had a group of girlfriends
who I was testing colors with.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.830
Do you like this
color or this color?

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.290
Do you like this
logo or this logo?

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.081
Would you press this
button or this button?

00:29:55.081 --> 00:29:58.290
I mean, it was really like that.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:02.010
So I think if you are
doing something social,

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.935
you have to find that
pool of people who you

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.740
want to test it with and test.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.090
And in today's kind
of environment,

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.100
you can create that
group anywhere.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.510
You can create it
in a Facebook group

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.080
or on Twitter gather people, or
get some people on an Instagram

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.982
handle and get them to
follow you and then--

00:30:19.982 --> 00:30:21.440
there are so many
ways that you can

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.752
test, like get a social
group and test it

00:30:24.752 --> 00:30:26.210
before you have to
get to the stage

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.200
where you're going to build an
app or whatever it might be.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.490
In terms of funding and
getting the right funders,

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.650
as I mentioned before, I have
got the most brilliant funders.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.865
And I'm so super proud
of all of my funders.

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:43.490
And they all bring
something different.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.190
There's all a different angle.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.680
I have some who are US
and some who are UK.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.440
So I don't have
predominantly US or UK.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.660
I have a bit of a split.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.160
I say UK.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.600
I mean Europe, actually.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.800
So I have a bit of a split.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.860
And I think that
when finding funders,

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.170
it's really about finding
the right people who

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.340
understand your business.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.790
And really this time
around, I researched

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.980
so that I knew exactly
what businesses they'd

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.960
invested in before,
whether they were

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.900
analogous to what I was trying
to do or whatever it might be.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.480
So it's pretty dispiriting
thing when you speak to people

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.104
and they're like,
moms don't need that.

00:31:25.104 --> 00:31:27.270
They drink coffee all day.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.850
Or, better not
show my wife that.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.440
She spends enough
time on her phone

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.880
or whatever other
nonsense stuff.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.460
And I've heard it all.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.630
And then you hear--

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.380
you meet someone, and
they're brilliant.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.380
And they say, OK, so what's
the size of the market?

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.249
OK, so why is what
you're doing different?

00:31:42.249 --> 00:31:43.790
OK, so how are you
going to monetize?

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.910
OK, so where do you think
the barrier to entry is?

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.076
And all of those smart
questions because they're not

00:31:48.076 --> 00:31:50.390
seeing it as you, as a woman
who happens to be a mother

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:51.598
and creating a mothering app.

00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:54.500
They're seeing it as a business
and a market potential.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.790
And it's finding those gems.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.220
And they are there.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.540
And I think that at
the moment, there's

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.770
a lot of bad press around
the funding and VCs.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.700
And that's probably deserved
for those who deserve it.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.190
But there are some brilliant,
brilliant minds out there.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.380
And it's just about
finding them and being

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.230
relentless in your search to
find the right partner for you.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.274
AUDIENCE: And you found
funding pre-revenue?

00:32:18.274 --> 00:32:19.190
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Yes.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.475
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:19.475 --> 00:32:19.760
Thanks.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.555
MICHELLE KENNEDY:
Pre-product, actually.

00:32:20.555 --> 00:32:21.471
AUDIENCE: Pre-product?

00:32:21.471 --> 00:32:23.372
OK.

00:32:23.372 --> 00:32:24.830
AUDIENCE: So what's
changed for you

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.350
now that you run your
own business versus being

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.370
CEO of someone else's business?

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.070
MICHELLE KENNEDY:
It's like did you ever

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.570
used have that dream when you
go into school and you're naked,

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.040
and everyone's laughing
and you don't know why,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.706
and then you look
down and you're naked?

00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:42.110
It's like that dream every day.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.790
It was like that at the start.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.050
It's very scary.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.490
There is strength in numbers.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:50.750
And when I was at
Badoo, I really

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.140
felt like I was part
of something huge,

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.940
a small part of something huge.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.040
but there was that safety.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.830
And when you're doing it on
your own, it's all on you.

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.210
And it's really scary.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.877
And it's personal because
I always cared about my job

00:33:05.877 --> 00:33:07.460
and it was a huge
part of my identity,

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.170
but I care so much
about Peanut because I

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.280
don't want to let my team
down, my investors down,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.990
my users down, women down.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.040
There's so many huge
pressures that I just

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.820
don't want to let that fall.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.790
And so there is a huge
burden of responsibility.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:33.710
Similarly, I feel that the
highs are extraordinarily

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.680
high because you know every
single ounce of when you moved

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.840
that tiny, tiny icon 0.2
millimeters to the left,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.410
and you know that there was a
real thought process behind it,

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.180
and all of a sudden your
conversion increases.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.530
And you're like, ah!

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.730
And no one else knows that, but
the high is so high from that

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.640
that it makes it all worthwhile.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.050
But it's extraordinarily
hard work and--

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.020
which it was before, but
it's a different kind

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.269
of work and pressure, I think.

00:34:09.269 --> 00:34:11.540
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.316
I have a few questions.

00:34:13.316 --> 00:34:16.080
So one is how did
you get your roadmap?

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.600
And in terms of company growth,
what do you see in the future?

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:27.060
And how do you realign
that when things change?

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.020
My second question is, I
guess, having a startup

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.820
and being so
passionate about it,

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.650
and having a successful career
that you've had, how do you--

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.638
you almost become consumed
by your idea because--

00:34:41.638 --> 00:34:43.679
and it's good to be because
you're so passionate,

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.659
but how do you
find-- keep yourself

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.610
sane in terms of working hours?

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.580
How do you do that?

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.364
I think that is one
of my main questions.

00:34:51.364 --> 00:34:53.530
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Pause,
otherwise I'll forget them.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.480
What was the first one?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.600
Tell me the first one again.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.040
AUDIENCE: It was about--

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:56.820
MITRA NATARAJ: It was
about the road map.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.605
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Oh,
the road map, yeah.

00:34:58.605 --> 00:35:00.945
So, the road map was--

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.250
I suppose it was like this
very broad vision of Peanut

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.110
has to be like
modern motherhood.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.830
And that's what we
want it to represent.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.640
And here are all the
facets of modern motherhood

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.030
that we could cover.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.980
OK, I don't want that.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.021
We don't need to be that.

00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:19.700
Someone else is doing that.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.230
And really kind of boiling
it down in that way.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.550
And then thinking
very specifically

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:30.600
about where we really felt
like that the opportunity lay

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.930
and how we can kind of unpick
it and get through that.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.800
And I would say that the
road map is ever evolving.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.690
And sometimes we have an idea.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:41.940
And we all love it.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.290
But we know it's not priority.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.760
And it shuffled to the back.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.720
And it's that sad kind
of item [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.280
that will maybe never
come to the forefront.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.310
And we hope it will, but
probably won't until we

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.020
double in size.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.370
And sometimes it is imperative
that we deal with something

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.310
because it's impacting on
the way users are interacting

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.940
with the product.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.870
So I think it's just being
on your toes all the time

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.440
and not being wedded to it so
that you're prepared to change.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.950
And we have an idea for our
subsequent feature the one

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.527
we have.

00:36:15.527 --> 00:36:16.360
But it might change.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.780
We have to wait and see how
users use our next feature

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.534
first before we
can really say, OK,

00:36:20.534 --> 00:36:22.200
is that going to be
the right direction?

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.640
Or maybe we'll discover
something brand new.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.120
So I think a lot of it comes
from watching user behavior

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.250
as well and your
analytics, and really

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.720
being so grateful for
the amazing data where

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.760
you can watch the behaviors.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.940
Balance-- some work-life
balance doesn't exist, just

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.200
in case anyone's interested.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.750
It's a lie.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.420
I think it's a juggle.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.670
And some days you're
amazing at juggling things.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.890
And some days you're
terrible at juggling things.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.200
And some days you're
an amazing partner.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.090
And sometimes you're
a horrible partner.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.770
And sometimes you're
an amazing boss.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.120
And sometimes you're the worst.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.550
And you just have to be
a little bit at peace,

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.500
and you kind juggle it.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.580
But if you're going to do
something that you love,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:11.430
you have to be a bit
obsessed by it, I think.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.820
Literally all of my friends
and family are Peanut-obsessed.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.800
It's all I can talk about.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.850
And I think you have to
be like that because it's

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.220
what makes you get up
and out of bed at 6 AM

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.090
to do some work before my
little boy gets up to get ready.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.910
It's the drive.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.290
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to--

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.432
I guess, there's a problem that
you thought, I can fix this.

00:37:35.432 --> 00:37:37.890
To me, it seems like the big
difference in entrepreneurship

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.280
today compared to, say, 30 years
ago is the need to monetize

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.830
and where that comes in.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.570
So I just wondered
when you started

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.290
thinking about
that and more what

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.620
pressure you got from
funds about how developed

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.910
your thinking had to be.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.130
MICHELLE KENNEDY:
Yeah, there was

00:37:53.130 --> 00:38:01.290
an amazing deck for the
LinkedIn series B raise.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:02.900
I think it's on the
Greylock web site.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.359
Anyway, if you
haven't read it, you

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:06.524
should go and have a look
at it because it's amazing

00:38:06.524 --> 00:38:08.490
because it's actually
a critique by one

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.630
of the co-founders
of his own deck,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.970
as like looking at it from
a VC perspective having

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.650
been the entrepreneur.

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:21.740
And in that, he identifies
three lines of possible revenue.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.992
And his critique is you
shouldn't be talking

00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.200
about three lines of revenue.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.190
You should really only
be talking about one.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.770
But we didn't really know.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.970
So it's really interesting
to see his own critique

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.840
of his own work effectively.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840
And its also--

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.520
I mean, read it,
anyway, because it's

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.664
really fascinating to see what
their predicting growth was,

00:38:41.664 --> 00:38:42.330
where they were.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.770
And you forget--

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:47.940
I think we forget
how-- not how slow,

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:49.470
but it was an
incremental growth.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.350
It wasn't all of a sudden
just bang, LinkedIn.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.490
It took time.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:59.790
So, obviously, I had thoughts
and ideas on monetization.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:06.160
I've come from a world where
Badoo monetizes extremely well.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.940
And so I had ideas.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.990
I think probably my
main stress point--

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.820
and, I think, it's
specific to my market--

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.390
is everyone assumes I
want to do advertising.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.340
It's women an moms advertising.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.640
Is that you're model?

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.900
No.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.600
It's that.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.380
So for me it was
more about, here

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.831
are some other possible streams.

00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:29.830
I don't know which ones
are right because I need

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.070
to see how people are
engaging with the product

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.790
before I can definitively
say, but here are some ideas.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:40.060
I know not all of them
revolve around an app model.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:45.110
But I think having
some smart thought

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.570
around how you could
see it progressing,

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.410
even if it doesn't
end up going that way,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:54.350
but to show that you've given it
consideration, is a good idea.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.020
But LinkedIn started with
three streams on their deck.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.574
It was good enough for them.

00:40:00.574 --> 00:40:02.990
MITRA NATARAJ: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.420
Yeah?

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:03.970
OK.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.650
Go.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.982
So by the time you launched,
[INAUDIBLE] just launched,

00:40:07.982 --> 00:40:10.190
I was wondering how you
handled that in your investor

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:12.170
presentations, and if
that was a pushback

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:13.710
from potential investors at all.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.990
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I think that
anyone who is doing something

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:24.530
in the same space as you
or the same market as you,

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:28.760
it is confidence that
there is a market.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.840
And all it does--

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.360
there isn't just one dating app.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.010
There isn't just one
type of cola drink.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.384
There is probably just
one search engine.

00:40:39.384 --> 00:40:41.720
MITRA NATARAJ: No.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.330
MICHELLE KENNEDY: But
I think all of those,

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:49.320
having the ability to have
someone else in the market,

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.820
just establishes a proof and
a validity in the market.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.270
And I think that's important.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.960
I think that what will be
your differentiators, how

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.400
you execute, how you see the
market evolving, how you see

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.200
your product devolving, how
do you see differentiators,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:14.300
and for me, there are just
lots of different ways

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.570
to solve the same problem.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.860
And it's all about how
you're answering that problem

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.660
and why you're with
the right person

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.260
to solve the problem in
the way that you see it

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.020
because everyone will
take a different approach.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:34.754
So in terms of how I responded
to it didn't really--

00:41:34.754 --> 00:41:35.670
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.753
MICHELLE KENNEDY: I was
very single-minded in what

00:41:37.753 --> 00:41:38.490
we were doing.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.430
MITRA NATARAJ: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.390
I think we've run out of time.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.820
So I'm going to thank Michelle--

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.150
MICHELLE KENNEDY: Thank you.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.190
MITRA NATARAJ: --for joining us.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.847
It was amazing.

00:41:45.847 --> 00:41:47.180
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.920
And let's give her
a round of applause.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.370
[APPLAUSE]
