00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.550
I'm in Colombo, the largest and capital city
of the island of Sri Lanka.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.380
It's a vibrant and colorful city of about
6 million inhabitants.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.910
Today, we're going to cruise around and check
out a few of the fun things to do around Colombo!

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.240
The first stop is Pettah, Colombo's largest
and most chaotic market.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:43.990
So, I am at the Pettah market right now, which
is in the center of Colombo city and I'm about

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.990
to go check out this hectic market.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.680
Ok, guys, I am in the back of a tuk tuk rickshaw
in Colombo, Sri Lanka and I'm going on a little

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.640
tour around some of the famous sites in Colombo.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.220
Gangamaraya Temple is not only one of the
most important Buddhist temples in Colombo,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.270
but it's also a museum that is full of religious
relics.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:35.300
On the street just outside the Viharamahadevi
Park there are a couple of snake charmers.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.650
I'm at Independence Monument in Colombo, it's
dedicated to the first Prime Minister of Sri

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.723
Lanka - and it's a pretty cool site.

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:48.950
I happened to be in Colombo during the Hindu
Diwali festival, so it was interesting to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:03:09.920
catch a live ceremony at the Sri Kailasanathar
Swami Devasthanam Hindu Temple.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.800
On our way to the next stop, we got into a
little rickshaw face-off - luckily we came

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.010
through in first place!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.720
After a long hot day of cruising around Colombo,
I'm extremely hungry and I'm ready to chow

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.940
down.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.620
Galle Face on the beach is one of the best
places for street food in town.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.290
I'm about to chow down at Nana fast food - I'm
excited, I just ordered up a bunch of different

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.290
dishes including some fish curry.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.290
Let me grab a piece of that and dip it into
this fish curry - that's really good man!

00:03:38.290 --> 00:04:05.001
It's a little bit sweet, spicy, it's nice
tasting.

00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:18.232
And then the Kottu - it's like fried rice
made with root.

00:04:18.232 --> 00:04:19.232
It's wonderful.

00:04:19.232 --> 00:04:28.419
I can taste the friedness on it, mixed with
the vegetables, it's fantastic.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.850
Stuffed from a delicious Sri Lankan feast,
it's time to jump on a wild Sri Lankan bus

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.909
and call it a successful day in Colombo!
