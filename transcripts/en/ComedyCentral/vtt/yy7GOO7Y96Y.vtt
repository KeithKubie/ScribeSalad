WE ALL KNOW NASA MADE THE BIG
ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY, THEY

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:05.638 line:85%
DISCOVERED LIQUID WATER ON MARS.

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:10.543 align:start position:0% line:91%
I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS
MYSELF BUT I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:11.777 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0% line:91%
BILL NYE, I'LL ASK YOU FIRST,
SHOULD WE GIVE A ( BLEEP ) ABOUT

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.547 align:start position:0% line:85%
WATER ON MARS.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.314 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH!

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.084 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THERE WAS
WATER.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.053 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE IS EVERY YEAR, EVERY
MARTIAN YEAR.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.154 align:start position:0% line:85%
SUPER SALTY WATER.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.057 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEREVER WE FIND WATER ON EARTH,
WE FIND LIVING THINGS.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.594 line:91%
IF WE WERE TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
LIVE ON MARS, SOME MARS MICROBE,

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:32.198 align:start position:0% line:91%
A MARS CROBE, IT WOULD CHANGE
THE WORLD.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.199 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WOULD.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.202 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYBODY WILL --
&gt;&gt; IT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.371 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AB-SO-FREAKING-LUTELY.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.939 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYBODY WOULD THINK
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO BE A LIVING THING IN THE
COSMOS.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.746 line:91%
IF YOU WENT TO MARS AND LOOKED
AT THESE MICROBES, DO THEY HAVE

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:47.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
D.N.A.?

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:48.047 size:84% position:42% line:85%
DO YOU WANT TO GET FREAKED?

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.615 line:85%
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET FREAKED?

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:51.451 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH THIS.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.056 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THREE BILLION YEARS AGO MARS
GET HITS WITH AN IMPACTOR, A

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.791 align:start position:0% line:91%
ROCK --
&gt;&gt; I LOVE IMPACTORS.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.059 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHO DOESN'T?

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:04.297 line:91%
THERE ARE A LOT OF JOKES WE'LL
LEAVE ALONE NOW, LATER MAYBE.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON THE WEB VERSION.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:10.937 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE THING --
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start position:0% line:85%
SAID.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.006 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; A JOKE LIKE, "THAT'S WHAT SHE
SAID."

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:21.714 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GOT YOU, GOT YOU.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:22.949 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO ABOUT THE IMPACTOR.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:32.458 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN GET MARS ROCKS, THEY
FALL ON THE EARTH--

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:37.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, I JUST GOT IT,
I'M SORRY. I'M SO STUPID

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.898 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:40.700 line:85%
SO WE FIND MARS ROCKS ON EARTH.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.635 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES!

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:46.305 line:91%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN
ORBITS, HOME IN ORBITS, EXCEPT

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.740 line:85%
IN OUTER SPACE THERE'S NO SOUND.

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY LAND ON EARTH.

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:54.747 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IT IS NOT CRAZY TO SUGGEST--
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY, BUT NOT

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.717 line:91%
CRAZY-- TO SUGGEST THAT LIFE
STARTED ON MARS THREE BILLION

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.652 line:85%
YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS VERY WET.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU AND I, EVERYBODY, OAK TREES,
SEA JELLIES, EVERYBODY IS

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.359 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DESCENDED FROM MARTIANS.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.493 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT IS WILD.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:12.832 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SO THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS
THAT EVERYBODY ASKS.

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:14.467 line:85%
ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, PERHAPS,
WHERE DID WE ALL COME FROM?

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:21.941 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, SO NOW I ASK
YOU, DO YOU GIVE A ( BLEEP )

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:22.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABOUT ALL THAT?

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:23.843 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.313 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT!

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.248 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT MARS!

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.051 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY WOULD I BE EXCITED ABOUT
MARS!

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.520 line:85%
I'M BARELY EXCITED ABOUT EARTH!

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:37.990 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M TELLING YOU-- TRUMP IS FIRST
IN POLLS RIGHT NOW!

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.592 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MARS!

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:44.397 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.997 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEFEAT ISIS.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.133 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.135 size:84% position:42% line:85%
YOU GOT IT, IT'S ALL YOURS.

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:52.505 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON, YOU KNOW, IN THE

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:53.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
UNIVERSE.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.708 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I'M GOING TO SAY I LOVE YOU.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.110 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YOU JUST DR. PHIL'D SCIENCE.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:00.880 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ( BLEEP )
YOU JUST SAID.

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.449 align:start position:0% line:91%
HONESTLY, I'M KIND OF WITH YOU,
TOO.

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:05.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
AMERICANS, WE DON'T CARE--
&gt;&gt; YES, THEY DO.

00:03:05.618 --> 00:03:10.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF IT'S CAITLIN JENNER'S
TEARS, YEAH, TELL ME ALL ABOUT

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.092 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WATER ON MARS.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.896 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF THERE'S ANOTHER LIFE FORM,
YOU THINK-- PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.297 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIKE EACH OTHER HERE!

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.501 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD GET MAURY POVICH TO

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:23.369 align:start position:0% line:85%
TEST THAT D.N.A.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:24.603 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES!

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:30.409 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BILL, I DID NOT KNOW
WE WOULD HAVE SUCH MARS HATEIN'.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:34.647 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HAVE TO SAY--
&gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT HATE AGO.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.685 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOLD ON--
&gt;&gt; PUT SOME MARS SCIENCE ON THEM

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:41.687 size:81% position:41% line:85%
RIGHT NOW, GO AHEAD, BILL.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.524 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS, I DON'T KNOW YOU.

00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:47.426 size:81% position:41% line:85%
DO YOU USE A MOBILE PHONE?

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.926 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.794 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE SEEN ONE.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.263 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT MY NUMBER?

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU MARRIED ON SOME
GUY?

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I CAN HAVE FRIENDS.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.137 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LET'S KEEP IT ON
MARS.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.939 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S KEEP IT ON MARS.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.440 line:85%
NOT VENUS AND MARS, JUST MARS.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.377 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU EVER USE THE ELECTRIC
INTERNET AND THE COMPUTER

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.112 size:84% position:42% line:85%
MACHINES THE KIDS ALL HAVE?

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:06.946 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT?

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.549 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE ORDERED STUFF FROM
AMAZON.

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT A
SPACE PROGRAM.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.287 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; BILL, YOU'RE SPACE SMART.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.054 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M OKAY.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.989 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M NEVER GOING TO GO TO
SPACE.

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:17.756 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M NEVER GOING TO GO TO
MARS.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.995 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO
MARS?

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:25.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU PUNCH IT, SEVEN
MONTHS.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.799 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I HATE THE FLIGHT TO L.A.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:28.701 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU GET THERE?

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:29.935 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW DO YOU GET THERE?

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON AN AIRPLANE. SOMEBODY FIGURED
IT OUT - YOU'RE JUST MESSING

00:04:32.037 --> 00:04:38.344 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH ME
&gt;&gt; RICKY IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:39.478 align:start position:0% line:85%
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.347 line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE HATES THE FLIGHT TO L.A.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.451 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HE HATES THE THOUGHT
OF ANY FLIGHT THAT LASTS OVER 20

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:46.685 align:start position:0% line:85%
MINUTES.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU TRUST THAT AIRPLANES FLY.
THAT'S THE RESULT OF THE SAME

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
SCIENCE.
&gt;&gt; I DON'T TRUST, I JUST DO IT

00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:53.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO
ANYBODY THAT, LET'S SAY --

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.460 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:57.163 line:91%
LET ME ASK YOU THIS-- WHAT ARE
THE POSSIBILITIES THERE COULD

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:02.335 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ACTUALLY BE BE LIKE LIFE WE
COULD RELATE TO ON MARS.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:05.237 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE EXCITED
ABOUT MICROBES.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
PEOPLE WOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT.

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:09.208 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GO FOR IT.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.378 line:91%
&gt;&gt; REAL PEOPLE, KIDS WHO ARE IN
SCHOOL TODAY, PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:17.350 line:91%
EIGHTH GRADE TODAY ARE GOING TO
BE ASTRONAUTS ON 2033-- 2039,

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.117 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.352 line:85%
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE HEROES.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.755 line:91%
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MATT
DAMON, WHO IS REQUIRED TO BE IN

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:23.356 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVERY MOVIE.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.256 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S ALL GOOD FOR HIM.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.459 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I HEARD HE'S HIRING, SO.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.495 line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE DOES A WORKMAN-LIKE JOB.

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:32.331 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I WANT TO GET THEM
EXCITED.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.200 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WAS EXCITED AS A KID.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:38.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE NASA BUDGET USED TO BE
FULLY 10 TIMES WHAT IT IS TODAY.

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:40.973 size:78% position:39% line:85%
USED TO BE 4% OF THE U.S.

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:42.041 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUDGET.

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.909 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW IT'S .4%.

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:47.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
DISCOVERIES MADE ON MARS ARE
MADE WITH 9% OF .4%.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:50.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BILL, I HAVE TO
INTERRUPT--

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.851 line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT CHANGED THE WORLD, MAN!

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.019 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S COOL.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.287 line:91%

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.656 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.158 size:81% position:41% line:85%
YOU HAVE TO LET ME SAY IT.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:00.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:02.728 align:start position:0% line:85%
I LOVE ALL THIS STUFF.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:03.962 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M EXCITED BY IT.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:07.533 line:91%
BUT I REMEMBER BY THE THIRD MOON
