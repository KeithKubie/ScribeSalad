00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
Music

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.260
in the future the bed I always so hope

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.730
will be a democratic elected leadership

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.380
power of people people spoil it is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.109
feminine oh and you're playing the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.300
longer the great patient war yes that's

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.279
yours okay the Dalai Lama wants to make

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.759
sure I speak with the current SI kyung

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.440
their term for a prime minister please

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.440
sit down is Tibet ever coming back

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.800
absolutely yeah you believe that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.710
absolutely but everything suggests

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.559
otherwise no because you asked me this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.070
question here in bodhgaya mm-hmm where

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.070
buddha did something impossible at an

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:04.049
Enlightenment and Buddhism is 2500 plus

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.810
years old communism is just what

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.540
hundreds of years all one-party rule is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.030
less than hundred years old there is no

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.979
competition between the two we must have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
dialogue between the invoice with daya

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.900
Lama and Chinese representative and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.200
Tibetans should be granted in genuine

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.119
autonomy as per Chinese laws within

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.000
China but you know I exist in a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.820
political world and I play hardball

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.250
Tibetans we see China in a different way

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.079
our perspectives very different we have

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.170
live side by side for thousands of years

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.380
so we kind of know them better than

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.549
anyone in the world so hence we don't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.130
fear China we are not amazed by China we

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.610
know exactly what they're doing our time

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.730
will come our opportunity to come

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.940
the Prime Minister's optimism comes from

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.060
outside the political sphere he sees

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.670
this it seems as a war of ideas and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.430
takes comfort from the longevity of the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.070
Buddhist culture in a time when the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.470
world seems to be in turmoil a turmoil

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.890
I've seen firsthand as a journalist in

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.560
Afghanistan and Iraq and beyond I have

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.730
to wonder can the Dalai Lama's message

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.730
of hope prevail
