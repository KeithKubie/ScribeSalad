♪♪

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:08.200
THE FIRST THING I TOOK APART
WAS MY MOTHER'S TELEPHONE,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.834
AND I TOOK ALL THE PIECES APART.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:14.901
AND THEN I PUT IT BACK TOGETHER,
BUT I NAILED IT TO A BOARD.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:17.567
AND SO, EVERYONE WAS TALKING
ON THE PHONE ON THIS BOARD,

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.334
WITH THE DIALER OVER HERE AND
THE RINGER OVER HERE, YOU KNOW.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:24.033
THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPLORATION
IN DECONSTRUCTION

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.367
AND RECONSTRUCTION.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE OPENING
A PRESENT.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.501
YOU HAVE THIS WONDERFUL THING,

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.634
AND THEN YOU KIND OF PEEL BACK
THESE LAYERS

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:31.968
AND SEE HOW IT FUNCTIONS.

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:35.033
I THINK THERE'S THE DISCOVERY
OF TAKING THINGS APART

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:36.868
THAT IS THE MOST EXCITING THING.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:40.033
I HAVE BEEN TAKING THINGS APART
SINCE I WAS VERY LITTLE.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.067
I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I TOOK APART THIS OLD CAMERA.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.133
I JUST, LIKE, CUT THE END
OFF ANOTHER POWER CORD,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.200
PLUGGED IT INTO THAT,
AND SPARKS WENT EVERYWHERE.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.167
AND, YEAH, THE MAGIC SMOKE
GOT OUT.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.167
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.634
FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING.

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.634
I ACTUALLY LOVE TO TAKE THINGS
APART THAT OTHER PEOPLE BUILT

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:57.868
BECAUSE YOU GET TO REALLY
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:00.934
AND WHY THEY MADE THAT DECISION.

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:02.634
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY
INTERESTING SUBTLETIES

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:05.801
THAT WENT INTO IT ON THE GOOD
DESIGNS AND THE BAD DESIGNS.

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:07.601
AND SO YOU CAN LEARN
FROM BOTH OF THEM.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.467
YOU LEARN WHAT TO DO
AND WHAT NOT TO DO.
