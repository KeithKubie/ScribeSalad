00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.030
What Napoleon had to do with the Invention
of Margarine

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.000
Odds are you probably have a stick or a tub
of it sitting in your fridge right now, but

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
do you have any idea how margarine became
a staple in most kitchens?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.580
It turns out, margarine has a long and controversial
international history, and can even boast

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.070
the involvement of Emperor Napoleon III in
its invention.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.640
Margarine derives its name from a discovery
in a chemist’s lab in France in 1813.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.439
Scientist Michel Eugène Chevreul uncovered
a new fatty acid that he decided to call “acide

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.439
margarique.”

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.580
His discovery consisted of shiny, pearl-like
deposits, so margarites seemed an apt name,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.340
as it is the Greek word for “pearly.”

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.000
Several decades later, Napoleon III was pondering
the fact that not only the poor people in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.140
his empire, but also his armed forces, could
certainly use an affordable substitute for

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.079
butter; so he offered a reward to anyone clever
enough to come up with a suitable, cheap replacement.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.079
A chemist named Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès rose
to the occasion, inventing a substance he

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.160
dubbed “oleomargarine,” which was later
shortened to “margarine.”

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.970
By 1869, Mège-Mouriès had patented the process
for creating margarine that had won him Napoleon’s

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.970
prize.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.790
His oleomargarine was comprised primarily
of beef tallow, salt, sulfate of soda, gastric

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.020
juices of a pig, and a little cream, all heated
and mixed into a butter-like substance, though

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.840
in truth at this stage it was more of a jelly
than what we think of as margarine today…

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.330
but it kind of tasted like butter at least!

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.070
Despite winning the prize, the product never
really took off.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.990
Mège-Mouriès sold the patent to a Dutch
outfit called Jurgens in 1871, which spawned

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.990
Unilever, still the leading manufacturer of
margarine to this day.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.220
This company improved upon Mège-Mouriès’
techniques and created an international market

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.330
for margarine, building factories in Germany,
Norway, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.330
England.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.590
The Dutch businessmen also realized that if
they were hoping to sell their product as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.150
a butter substitute, it would be helpful for
margarine to look as much like butter as possible.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.100
Besides improvements in texture, they also
had to fix the color.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.460
You see, margarine is naturally white; thus,
they began dyeing it slightly yellow to match

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.190
the faint yellowish tinge butter naturally
has.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.340
(Of course, today many butter makers also
dye their butter to make it a much deeper

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.130
yellow than is natural, as this is what people
have come to expect.)

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.140
The war between butter and margarine had begun.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.620
As Mark Twain recorded overhearing from a
businessman around the turn of the century

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.400
on a riverboat trip in Cincinnati:
“Why, we are turning out oleomargarine now,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.180
by the thousands of tons.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.020
And we can sell it so dirt-cheap that the
whole country has got to take it-can’t get

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.490
around it, you see.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.180
Butter don’t stand any show-there ain’t
any chance for competition.”

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.630
This particular businessman didn’t take
into account dirty politics.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.569
After buttering up various politicians, the
dairy industry convinced them to pass The

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.730
Margarine Act of 1886, which put a two cent
tax (about 50 cents today) on every pound

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.330
of margarine sold.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.200
Within two decades, that was raised to ten
cents per pound (about $2.61 today).

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.040
(In Canada, the situation was much more serious
for margarine fans – margarine was made

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.850
illegal from 1886 to 1948.)

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.850
Around this same time, particularly in U.S.
states where the dairy industry held great

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.710
sway, dying margarine yellow became illegal
to further discourage sales and keep people

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.090
hooked on butter.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.319
In a few states, it even became law that margarine
sold in those states had to be dyed pink.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.500
Nefarious advertisements were also run, such
as one in a 1911 edition of the Chicago Tribune

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.940
where it showed arsenic, tin cans, and cats
being thrown into a vat with a few other ingredients

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.230
where it was all mixed together to form margarine.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.730
Various rumors were spread about as to what
went into making margarine, even though essentially

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.599
margarine and butter weren’t all that different
at this point, with both containing about

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.560
80% animal fat and 20% water.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.180
The fats involved here were even predominately
from the same dairy animal.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.090
However, the popular main type of fat used
in margarine was about to change.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.620
The lack of available beef fat, coupled with
new techniques in the hydrogenation of plant

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.020
materials, made the use of vegetable oils
in the formulation of margarine not only possible

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.410
for the first time, but much more economically
viable.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.730
Between 1900 and 1920, oleomargarine was made
with a mixture of animal fats and vegetable

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.730
oils.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.829
The Great Depression, followed by rationing
during World War II, led to a further reduction

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.600
in the supply of animal fat, and by the mid-40s,
the original margarine had almost disappeared

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.240
from grocer’s shelves in favor of the vegetable
oil version.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.241
These events, particularly WWII, also helped
spur the popularity of margarine as butter

00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.570
shortages abounded.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.199
By 1950, this surge in popularity resulted
in the old extreme tax on margarine predominately

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.740
going away, for the first time since the beginning
putting margarine on a level playing field

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.020
with butter.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.639
There still was the coloring issue for a few
years longer.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.439
From the beginning, the margarine manufacturers
retaliated by packaging their product complete

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.840
with a packet of yellow dye included.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.809
The intent was for the margarine to be placed
in a bowl and mixed with a spoon by the consumer.

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.080
The down-side to this was that the final results
were often uneven, and could end up as light

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.889
or dark yellow, or even yellow and white striped.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.330
Another method of dyeing the margarine entailed
placing a capsule inside a plastic package

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.479
of margarine.

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.159
The package was then kneaded to distribute
the dye, a job usually given to one of the

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.669
lucky children of the household.

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.490
In the mid-1950s, like the heavy taxation
that was removed a few years before, the artificial

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.020
coloring laws were done away with and margarine
could be sold in pretty butter-like hues once

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.020
again.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.680
Since then, many efforts have been made to
progressively make margarine more healthy,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.310
such as introducing healthier fats and nixing
the trans-fats that used to be prevalent in

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.460
the substance.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.319
There have also been improvements in flavor
to get things even more butter-like.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.020
So, while the modern versions bear little
resemblance to the original oleomargarine,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.520
other than usually containing approximately
the same amount of fats and water, we still

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.629
call it margarine.

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.199
Oh, and if you’re wondering what became
of Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès…

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.270
Aside from the prize he won from Emperor Napoleon
III, he didn’t really profit from his invention;

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.969
the poor guy died, well, poor in 1880.

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:19.439
Easy come, easy go.
