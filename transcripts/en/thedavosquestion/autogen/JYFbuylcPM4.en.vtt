raised so again in order to make it
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.190
raised so again in order to make it
possible we need to devise such

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200

should not to fail to reconstruct the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900
should not to fail to reconstruct the
 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.790
should not to fail to reconstruct the
affected area as soon as possible and we

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800
affected area as soon as possible and we

affected area as soon as possible and we
know that a you know the affected area

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790
know that a you know the affected area
 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.449
know that a you know the affected area
is even you know faster asian than the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459
is even you know faster asian than the
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.920
is even you know faster asian than the
restaurant you can I mean that the

area is much higher in comparison with
 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.190
area is much higher in comparison with
the case of the japan as a whole so we

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200
the case of the japan as a whole so we
 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.530
the case of the japan as a whole so we
have to make ready construction and

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540
have to make ready construction and
 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.960
have to make ready construction and
project under the pressure of aging

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
project under the pressure of aging
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.270

formation in the affected in authority

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280
formation in the affected in authority
 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.729
formation in the affected in authority
and in fact many all the people in the

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739
and in fact many all the people in the
 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.500

businesses so i think a great outcome
would be if we can make this

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209
would be if we can make this
 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.140
would be if we can make this
reconstruction project as a model of a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150

is you know necessary for the aging in
 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.430
is you know necessary for the aging in
Japan in the future as well as the rest

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440
Japan in the future as well as the rest
 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.400
