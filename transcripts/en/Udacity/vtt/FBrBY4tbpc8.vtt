00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.510
The class that defines a marker is
called the MarkerOptions class.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.680
With this you have a number of
properties that you use to define your

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.110
map marker.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.870
You can set its position using a LatLng,
and, of course, the LatLng

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.360
contains the latitude and longitude
where you want the marker to be.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.020
And you can set its
title using a string.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.280
As you saw earlier when I
had my rinks for example,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.570
renton, all that was was
a string called renton.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.078
And here is an example of building
a marker option that does that.

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:35.200
I say MarkerOptions renton equals
new MarkerOptions.position,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.450
my latitude and longitude, I just pass
it a new LatLng, with the latitude and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.040
longitude, and then the title("renton").

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.368
So this was the code that I used to
generate that pin on renton that you saw

00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:47.820
in the application.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.680
As you can see,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.640
And when you have a map,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.830
you can add this to your map by calling
the ad marker method on your map.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.090
Let's take a look at this in
action in Android Studio.
