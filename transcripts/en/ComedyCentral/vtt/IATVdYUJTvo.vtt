All right, welcome back.
I'm here with my panel.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.037
First up,<i> Nightly Show</i>
 contributor Rory Albanese.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.773
(applause and cheering)

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.775
And<i> Nightly Show</i> contributor
Franchesca Ramsey.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.244
(applause and cheering)

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.980
You can see him
in the spring premiere episode

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.349
of<i> Empire,</i>
 "Death Will Have Its Day,"

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.085
on Wednesday, March 30
at 9:00 p.m. on Fox.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.720
Actor Jussie Smollett,
everybody.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.989
(applause and cheering)

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.324
And for everyone at home,
join our conversation right now

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:27.727
on Twitter @NightlyShow,
using the hashtag #Tonightly.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.595
Okay, so, we've been talking
about Trump this week.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.064
SMOLLETT:
Oh, damn. Oh!

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.665
-And we've talked about him
every night. -SMOLLETT: Oh!

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.867
Well, here's the thing. Here's
the thing I wanted to cover.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.269
So, the media's been
extremely Trump heavy

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.603
in their coverage
of this election.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.639
I mean, he's gotten more
air time-- this is true--

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.474
than the entire
Democratic field

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.610
and three times more attention
than Rubio and Cruz, okay.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:49.048
So, do we think Trump
is the creation of the media?

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.018
Is he the creation of media,
or is he just exploiting it?

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.120
Ooh, I think
he's just exploiting it.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.122
-Hell, yeah.
-He's good at it, though.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.459 line:0%
I have to remind you that he had
a very mediocre television show

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.494 line:0%
-filled with...
-(laughter)

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.096 line:0%
-How dare you, Franchesca!
-(laughter)

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.465
-Listen, it was full
of D-list celebrities. -Yeah.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.401
-And it was ratings gold...
-D list?

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.503
-Um, Gary Busey. Hello!
-Oh, my God.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:13.673
ALBANESE: Um, hello.
National treasure Gary Busey.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.842
SMOLLETT: I think, though,
at the same time, though,

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.477
what we have to realize
is that yes,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.145
he's-he's manipulating
the media,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.013
but the media is letting him
for ratings.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.015 line:0%
Do you know what I'm saying?
I think that

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.451 line:0%
we can all agree with that.
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:27.086 line:0%
It's just,
and we've come into...

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.356 line:0%
we're in this world right now
where we're... we're stuck

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.358 line:0%
-with this reality-TV world,
-WILMORE: Yeah.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:33.993 line:0%
but this is...
reality TV is fun,

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.628 line:0%
but not when we're talking
about the presidency

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.263 line:0%
-of the United States
of America. -RAMSEY: Whoo!

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.265
-(cheering, applause) -That's
not what we're talking about.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:40.800
But it's funny
that you said that,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.268
'cause here's a quote
from Les Moonves--

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.870
he's the head of CBS now.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.938
He says-- he's talking
about the coverage of Trump.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.508
He says, "But, you know--
it may not be good for America,

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.742
"but it's damn good

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.611
<i> for CBS,
 that's all I got to say."</i>

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.980
<i> He's admitting
 it's a horrible thing!</i>

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.682
<i>So... are we... is the media...</i>

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.518
SMOLLETT: Yo, at least
the brother is admitting it.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.087
-Yes. -'Cause all
the other people are like,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.122
"Aw, yeah..." Well,
they know that it's the truth.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.224
It's the truth. It's horrible
to say, but it's the truth.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:07.226
But I feel like the media's,
like, in an abusive relationship

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.828
-with Trump, you know what
I'm saying? -RAMSEY: No.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.696
-It's all right, baby, I'm not
gonna... -No, because to say

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.265
that they're in an abusive
relationship with Trump

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.066
would be to say
that they are being abused

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.368
and they are not victims.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.370
The media's not victims
and Trump is not a victim.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.472
So for that, they're not
in an abusive relationship.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.207
But America is the victim!

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.009
We<i> are</i> the victim.
Of course, of course.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.178
Or we're going to be
if we continue to be like,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.779
Ah-ha-ha-ha, Trump,
ha-ha-ha-ha, Trump,"

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.347
until we're like,
"Holy (bleep), that's Trump,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.049
and he's in the freakin'
White House."

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:31.284
WILMORE: Well,
we've been saying that, right?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.685
Well, first of all,
let me just say this,

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.854
'cause I think through
some sort of media conglomerate,

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.355
Les Moonves is our boss.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.457 line:0%
I think what you said
is great, Les. Uh...

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.127 line:0%
-(laughter) -Good call,
Mr. Moonves, uh, good...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.863 line:0%
Um, but I think... the thing
that's odd to me about this

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:47.633 line:0%
is why we're all so surp...
I'm surprised we're so surprised

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.202 line:0%
that this is the guy.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.004
Like, our leaders are
a reflection of our society.

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:53.472
This is our society.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:56.442
We prioritize fame,
we prioritize, like, capitalism,

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.778
-greed, all the (bleep) Trump
stands for, -Mm-hmm. Right.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.880
and now we have him
coming to the...

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.316
-Like, this is on us, do you
know what I'm saying? -Yeah.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.718 line:0%
I agree, I agree with that,
I agree with that,

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.154 line:0%
but there are different types
of prioritizing of fame

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:09.755 line:0%
and wealth and things like that.

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.924 line:0%
Are we also a nation
that supposedly prioritizes

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.392 line:0%
racism and bigotry

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.461 line:0%
-and building walls... -RAMSEY:
That's what built this country!

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:17.463
So that's really what
we're talking about.

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:19.332
-Know what I'm saying?
-No, I agree with you,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.701
but I'm saying, are we a nation
that supposedly does that? No.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.436
But historically speaking, are
we an extremely racist nation?

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.038
-Yes. Yes, we are. -That's what
we need to be talking about.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.974
'Cause to me,
it's not about the money.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.675
Listen, politics is about money.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.311
At the end of the day,
that's what their job is to do.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.480
Their job is to raise funds
for their campaign,

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.349
which is absolute bull(bleep)
to begin with anyway.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:37.850
-(whooping, applause)
-But the point is...

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:39.452
the point is,
the point is, though,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:41.087
is that their job
is to raise money.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.722
We're talking
about more than money.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.423
There's nothing wrong
with money.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.192
WILMORE:
You're talking about candidates?

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.362
Yeah. What's wrong with that
is when money is then attached

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.097
to... hate.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.766
And to me,
Trump is the mogul of hate.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.635
WILMORE: But here-here's
the thing, Jussie.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:58.804
Trump isn't raising money
and he's not spending money.

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:00.206
This is what I mean.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.842
The media is
his campaign partner in this.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.944
ALBANESE: Like, I agree--
the media is exploiting him.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.480 line:0%
WILMORE: Well, I wouldn't say
they're exploiting him.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.548 line:0%
No, I... no, I think
they are exploiting him,

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.384 line:0%
'cause this... like,
we're doing it right now.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.818
Like, this is
a money-making industry,

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.353
talking about Trump--
we're doing a show

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:16.188
-Very true. Very true.
-about it right now, right?

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:18.424
Yeah, but we were doing shows
before Trump was here,

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.793
-we'll do shows after Trump.
-But CNN was doing shows

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:22.928
-before Trump, too.
I'm saying right now -Right.

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.164
the way the media is run--
and it's broken,

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.632
the whole CNN, MSNBC system

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:28.868
is the same on
the entertainment rating system.

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.202
They just want ratings.

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:31.804
So Trump is the way to get
ratings, so it makes sense

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:34.540
that they're gonna be
talking about him 24/7.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.642
No, I understand that,
but it's not... I mean,

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.678
it's not<i> that</i> clean, because
he's running for president.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.013
-Right. -It's not like he's
just saying this crazy (bleep)

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:43.716
in his living room,
and some cameras showed up--

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.718
"You (bleep) got
to watch this (bleep).

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.720
I mean, he's saying
some crazy (bleep)."

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.822
But, you know, it's like,
"Who is this guy!

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.157
"Thank-thank you, CNN!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.758
"I never would've known
about this guy.

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.393
But I'm gonna vote for him
for president."

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:56.329
But I'll give you... like,
I'll give you an example.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:58.764
Like, you know, I was at 
<i>The Daily Show</i> for a long time,

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.633
-when Bush became president.
-Right.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.401
Eight years of Bush
at a comedy show--

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.103
but people were buying
summer houses on that guy.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:06.372
You know what I mean?
So, like, there's a part of it

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:07.973
that's like, "All right,
eight years of Trump--

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.242
like, I'm getting a jet ski."
You know, like, it's, like...

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:12.411
See, we're all... like, you
know, there is a feeding frenzy

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:15.181
around the clown, and he is
the clown with tiny hands.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.683
-We know that, you know? But...
-WILMORE: We do know that.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:18.818
There's a feeding frenzy.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.586
WILMORE: Do you think the media
plays favorites?

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:22.588
-What are we talking about?
What, what? -Do-do you think

00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:24.623
the media plays favorites
outside of getting ratings,

00:05:24.656 --> 00:05:26.759
do you think they actually play
favorites in their coverage?

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.095
Sure, I think they do,
and I think that that's the...

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.063
that's the terrible thing
about the media,

00:05:31.096 --> 00:05:33.499
especially in this
day and age is that...

00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:37.103
I'm sorry, I'm an absolute
1,000% liberal.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.872
But I shouldn't
even be looking at any network

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:41.974
and looking at a journalist
and seeing

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:44.510
that they're obviously
liberal or conservative.

00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:46.612
I actually, as a journalist,
I should be looking at

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:49.315
journalism and I should be
looking at news channels

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.550
as only the truth,
because there's-there's

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:53.018
always three sides to the story:

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:54.987
there's your side,
my side and the truth.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.690
If anything, news organizations
are supposed to be

00:05:57.723 --> 00:06:00.793
only reporting the truth
and the facts

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:02.795
-and<i> we're</i> supposed
to make our decisions. -Yeah,

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:05.765
it-it really does feel
like a reality show.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.299
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-I mean, the GOP

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:10.202
is like an episode
of<i> The Bachelor</i> at this point.

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.671
I... Ben Carson is the black
girl that never had a chance.

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:15.775
Good-bye, I have to go.
Farewell.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:19.545
Honestly. And Donald Trump
is the unhinged drama queen

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:22.014
who doesn't even
like the bachelor

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.950
and just wants screen time
and her own spinoff.

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:27.153
-Wow. -(cheering, applause)
-And that's why

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.789
-they're getting
so much attention. -So sad.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.590
It's the exact same thing.

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:35.823
It's what we've been reduced to.
All right. We'll be right back.
