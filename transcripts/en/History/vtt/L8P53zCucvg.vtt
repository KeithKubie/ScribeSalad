00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.370
DAVE: I feel alive when I
walk with a bow in my hands.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.100
My senses are heightened.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.570
I can smell the air.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.630
I can feel the wind on my cheek.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.070
Ah, here we go--

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.070
nice game trail.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.070
[bow snap]

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.700
A grouse-- I had the shot on it.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.930
And then my arrow
goes into this grouse,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.070
and the bird flies
off with my arrow.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.330
I start tracking it down,
and we got that grouse.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.500
But it was obvious that
I had hurt this animal--

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.670
arrow broke its wing clean off.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.070
I don't want to cause suffering
to any animal or being.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.030
I don't hunt to kill.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.800
I hunt to eat.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.330
I tell myself, is
it better to kill

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.600
one large animal for many
meals or a bunch of small ones?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.070
One deer-- that's the last game,
last life that I have to take.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.030
I mean, I'm hurting
these animals.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.100
[heavy sigh]

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.970
And it hurts my heart.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.470
So what do I choose,
to be oblivious?

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.030
Do I choose to be a vegetarian?

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.300
Do I push the button?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.500
[sigh]

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.170
Or do I keep killing?

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.270
I've killed five
grouse, a squirrel.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.100
[sigh]

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.330
Man, that's a lot of pain.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.400
That's a lot of pain.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.700
[heavy sigh]

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.530
The hunter left, because
he couldn't hunt anymore.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.530
[sigh]
