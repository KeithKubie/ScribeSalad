00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
Finding this place is never a problem

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.340
Zabbaleen. The city of rubbish collectors is surrounded by an accurate smell

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800
that most people would find unbearable

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800
This is where waste from the whole of Cairo are brought

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.760
No one ever saw police officer here

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
People live by their own rules

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.700
and also always happy to see stranger visiting

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.500
The region populated mainly by Coptic Christian, Egypt minority religion

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.700
Moslem lives here too,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.100
but there is no religious conflicts in Zabbaleen

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900
the dump guarantees interface peace

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.800
is the only local provider of work and liveliness

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.700
Kyrollos, and he is ten

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.100
He spent all his child in the rubbish collecting city of Zabbaleen

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.300
But he's one of the lucky ones

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.340
Unlike his peers

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.400
Kyrollos hasn't had to start doing any of the dirty work yet

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.300
Gerges inherited this job from his father

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760
He was a refuse collector too

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.700
They came to Zabbaleen 45 years ago

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.800
and recycling techniques have barely changed in these years

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.300
Gerges Saad family collects, sorts, and cleans several different types of rubbish all the time

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.200
Typically, the men work with metal and plastic

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.700
Collecting and cleaning rubbish is a family concern

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.700
The women play their part too

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.700
They sort the food waste

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.600
Shekhata El-Mogaddis is one of the wealthiest people in Zabbaleen

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.720
He calls himself mayor of the city of rubbish collectors

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.300
but officially there is no such position

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.200
also rumor has it,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.500
that Shekhata personally control the sale

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.460
of all glass at the recycling facilities

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.500
which they say generate fabulous profit for him

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.600
There's a villa with the luxurious pageant love

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.200
very close to the dump entrance

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.380
Shekhata never touches the rubbish himself

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.000
He just manages the process

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500
He doesn't even clean his own house

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.380
He has a housekeeper for that

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.800
Shekhata, He is my uncle

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.800
because his father was rich since the beginning

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.500
90 percent of the community are poor

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.500
who are the regular garbage collector

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
who are relying on the garbage which they collect

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.000
Sort and sell to the recycler

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.440
There you see, family sorting

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.920
paper compactor

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.420
 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.400
they are compacting using electrical compactor

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.600
We have our own live

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000
We have groceries shop

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We have buchos coffee shop, as you see

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.800
because men after collecting the garbage

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.500
they are very .... and come to the coffee shop

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500
to drink tea or to smoke sisha

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.860
any problem or conflict is happening between each other

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.500
it's solved internally

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.000
The big leader of the family

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.500
He will respect the all people

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.800
So, once there is a problem

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.000
all people have a round table

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"Oh, no.. , you should applogize to him, oh I'm sorry" All off

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.020
problem has finished

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.000
Never go to the police station

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.500
Never invite a police

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.200
We don't like them by the way

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.300
Because they come to make the problem more higher

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.580
The cops claim to be among the worlds, earliest Christian

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.000
They believe that their ancestors converted when Jesus still lived

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.900
and since then they always try to resolve problem peacefully

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.500
The Christian way

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.800
Gerges has working day, begins at 3.30 every morning

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.300
Avery Zabbaleen sign this a specific part of Egypt's capital

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.900
Collecting waste from a colleague territory is quickly taboo

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.400
All rubbish collectors religiously observe the unspoken rules

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.500
Look, each follow garbage is generating five daily jobs

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.400
Two are collecting from door to door

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.000
One is transporting

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.800
and two are sorting

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.800
So, it's five as the beginning

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.400
and as their saving indirect jobs,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.760
who are recycling paper, plastic, metal, glass

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.700
each ton of garbage in Cairo is creating two well jobs

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.800
everyday

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.200
You see, this bag comes from the garbage

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800
It's also make up

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.360
This is something for massage

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.600
You know what kind of massage is this?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.580
I don't know. She knows (laugh)

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.500
She told me, read it carefully

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.300
you know, for ladies or men

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.200
All this things are in the garbage

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.000
So they sale such this stylee thing that people go to the market

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.900
and she's shouting

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.600
This carries biggest Friday market

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.500
It's near the city of rubbish collectors

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.200
People come to buy gifts for their nearest and dearest

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.500
and anything else they might need at home

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.500
No seriously

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.840
Kyrollos, his parents don't buy him toys

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.500
He can find everything that interest him in the dump

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.900
and that saves money

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.200
Returning to see Gerges Saad, we meet the butcher shop owner

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.500
Sameer Fatee

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.600
It's hard to imagine swine being kept in a Moslem country

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.500
but the Cops are Christians and pork is a staple part of their diet

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.000
Not long ago, pork was banned in Egypt

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.400
The Muslim brotherhood parliamentary majority

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.500
decided to have all the life stock in the country kelt

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.700
Including the Christian pigs of Zabbaleen

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.160
At that time, Zabbaleen started to sort the organic

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.900
in downtown and keep it in the container of the multinational companies

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.800
and the big street of Cairo, so Cairo is very bad smell and dirty

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.860
This went for two years

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.700
Then revolution on 21st of January

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.000
and Egypt, Zabbaleen come back again

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.980
animals

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.400
out of the system of the brand minister

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.940
He is debit your vice capitalism

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.500
but in the garbage collector is away from Cairo

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.700
no one care this thing

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.900
Cairo will be dying

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320
Gerges Saad families meet with the pork or beef

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.800
only once a week, on Sundays

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.300
That's meat such an expensive treat

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.000
it can cost between 50 and 100 Egyptian pounds per kilo

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.400
That's 5 to 10 dollars

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.300
There is a local school in Zabbaleen

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.400
but not even that can guarantee Kyrollos education will allow him

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.500
to do anything other than collect and sort rubbish

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.500
Children study then they Mathematics

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.500
but refuse all the lessons tend to out away all of the subjects

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.000
Since the school open, 3 or 4 people have ever manage to escape from the dump

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:22.700
every one else has had little choice but to stay, live, and work here

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.000
There were farmers about 70 years ago

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.000
left their plant and come here

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.000
they don't have any other jobs

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.400
That so, I want to tell them

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.900
Yeah, this is your heads

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.600
They say no, we have our god immunity and so on

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.800
No, we have health problems

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.000
more than 42 percent of the community are infected of

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.540
We have also a lot diseases

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.000
We pay higher from our health, from our life

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.500
the average age of mortality is not more than 55 years

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.200
people are dying so young here
