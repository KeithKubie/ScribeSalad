[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.910
I run a company
called Quirky, and we

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.479
create three brand new consumer
products every single week,

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.520
and the ideas for those
products come from people

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.480
all around the world
that we've never met.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.730
Come to our site, they
share their ideas,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.400
they vote on which
idea is the best,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.900
and the best ideas in the
world get on the retail shelves

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.540
with the help of our
company and our community.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.710
We're a design company.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.620
We're a manufacturing and
supply chain business.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.280
We're a community social
network thingamajig.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.272
We run a back-end payment
system to all these inventors

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:39.980
around the world.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.259
And it's a bunch
of startups in one.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.550
It's like six companies in one.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.590
And making sure that we're
growing each one of them

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.310
at the same pace is the
most difficult thing

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.640
about what we do a
quirky, because oftentimes

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.380
over the past five years, we've
gotten really good at designing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.338
things, but the manufacturing
couldn't keep up.

00:00:57.338 --> 00:00:59.400
Or we got really
good at the website

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.430
and we couldn't
design enough product.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.544
And making sure we're leveling
up each one of these things

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:06.960
correctly at the
same time and not

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.860
letting any one get ahead of
itself is a bit of a mess,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.990
but we do it.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.030
We love the chaos, and we don't
take pride in the usual things

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.810
that startups take pride in.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.150
Our company does not celebrate
how much money we've raised

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.340
or who our investors are or
who we're partnered with.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.500
We take pride in the
inventors we help

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300
and the products we ship,
and everything else is noise.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.460
And that's the principles
that guide the business,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.470
and we just stay
true to who we are,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.300
and we try to be as
authentic as possible.
