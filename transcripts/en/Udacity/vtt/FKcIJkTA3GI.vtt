Hi and welcome to Udacity's Data
Analyst Nanodegree Program.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.090
I'm Caroline Buckey.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.244
And before I joined Udacity, I did a
combination of software engineering and

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:09.080
machine learning.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.287
Now, there's more data in the world
today than there ever has been,

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.797
and it's constantly growing.

00:00:13.797 --> 00:00:16.971
&gt;From sources like transaction records,
sensor data,

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.279
even people taking photos or
videos on their cell phones,

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.360
we're collecting more than 2.5
quintillion bytes of data every day.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.830
Because of this, data analysts
have never been in higher demand.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.180
By completing this Nanodegree program,
you'll have the qualifications you need

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.440
to either start or
advance your career as a data analyst.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
And you'll build a portfolio
of projects to prove it.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.860
To start out, you'll use statistics
to analyze the Stroop effect,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.480
a classic result in
experimental psychology.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.550
Then you'll go through the entire
data analysis process,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.430
starting by posing a question and
finishing by sharing your findings.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.035
Then you'll hone in on your data
wrangling skills by cleaning

00:00:53.035 --> 00:00:55.540
OpenStreetMap data for
a part of the world you care about.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.850
Next you'll use exploratory data
analysis techniques to build intuition

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.210
about a data set by exploring
both individual variables and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.245
how those variables interact.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:06.660
You'll also use machine learning and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.130
natural language processing to uncover
fraud in the infamous Enron scandal.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.160
You'll create an effective data
visualization that will tell an engaging

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.900
and unforgettable story for
your audience.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.890
And finally you'll analyze an A/B test
that Udacity ran, recommend whether or

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.550
not to launch the change, and
propose your own follow-up experiment.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.590
&gt;&gt; Building these
projects won't be easy.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.611
We're going to challenge you so

00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:30.820
that you're prepared to solve tough
problems and think independently.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.710
To rise to that challenge, you'll need
to keep up with your learning schedule

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.060
and engage with your
Nanodegree community.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.290
Your fellow students are here to help
you untangle the trickiest puzzles,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.140
get over the biggest hurdles, and
encourage you through all of it.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.150
And when they need help,
you'll do the same for them.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.930
The Udacity team will be here
too to deepen your learning,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.185
offer project feedback, and
help you develop professionally.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.525
By leveraging the support systems and
working consistently, you can prepare

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:58.425
yourself for an entirely new stage of
your career in a matter of months.

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:00.795
We can't wait to see where
your Nanodegree takes you.
