in addition to being a scientist I have

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250
in addition to being a scientist I have
 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.369
in addition to being a scientist I have
two other passions when is photography

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
two other passions when is photography
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.999
two other passions when is photography
and actually I had a exhibit of my

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
and actually I had a exhibit of my
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.919
and actually I had a exhibit of my
photographs in Paris and they have

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
photographs in Paris and they have
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.830
photographs in Paris and they have
nothing to do at all with a science some

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
nothing to do at all with a science some
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320
nothing to do at all with a science some
of them were taken in Norway I don't in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
of them were taken in Norway I don't in
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.179
of them were taken in Norway I don't in
the exhibit that's not the way in the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
the exhibit that's not the way in the
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.050
the exhibit that's not the way in the
1950s and 60s travel a lot and took

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
1950s and 60s travel a lot and took
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.580
1950s and 60s travel a lot and took
kodachrome pictures and after why for a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
kodachrome pictures and after why for a
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.880

while Emily took pictures of my family

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
while Emily took pictures of my family
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.209

and the thinking of maybe making up and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
and the thinking of maybe making up and
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.270
and the thinking of maybe making up and
exhibit from from those photographs now

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
exhibit from from those photographs now
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250
exhibit from from those photographs now
that I'm sort of better known as a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
that I'm sort of better known as a
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.779
that I'm sort of better known as a
photographer and the other thing is that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
photographer and the other thing is that
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.729
photographer and the other thing is that
you know when we do these calculations

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739
you know when we do these calculations
 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.310
you know when we do these calculations
we don't really do any chemistry and so

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
we don't really do any chemistry and so
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139
we don't really do any chemistry and so
the chemistry that I do do is actually

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
the chemistry that I do do is actually
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.569
the chemistry that I do do is actually
cooking and I've for many years I used

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
cooking and I've for many years I used
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.410
cooking and I've for many years I used
to work in famous restaurants and France

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
to work in famous restaurants and France
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570
to work in famous restaurants and France
and such for two or three weeks every

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
and such for two or three weeks every
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.160
and such for two or three weeks every
summer and work in the kitchen and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
summer and work in the kitchen and
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.109
summer and work in the kitchen and
replaced the people who were taking

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
replaced the people who were taking
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.920
replaced the people who were taking
their day off and so that was the real

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
their day off and so that was the real
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219
their day off and so that was the real
chemistry that I like to do and still at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
chemistry that I like to do and still at
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.640
chemistry that I like to do and still at
home now I do the cooking and my wife

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
home now I do the cooking and my wife
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.749
home now I do the cooking and my wife
that's the dishwashing and such and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
that's the dishwashing and such and
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.499
that's the dishwashing and such and
that's so I think it's nice if being a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
that's so I think it's nice if being a
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960
that's so I think it's nice if being a
scientist when you work you really work

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
scientist when you work you really work
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.170
scientist when you work you really work
full time I think that's one of the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
full time I think that's one of the
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.719
full time I think that's one of the
things you have to realize they said you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
things you have to realize they said you
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060
things you have to realize they said you
have to work really very hard you can be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
have to work really very hard you can be
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.270
have to work really very hard you can be
smart but that's not enough but for me

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
smart but that's not enough but for me
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.210
smart but that's not enough but for me
the very important part is okay I work

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
the very important part is okay I work
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.209
the very important part is okay I work
very hard when I'm doing science but

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
very hard when I'm doing science but
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.120
very hard when I'm doing science but
then I do other things and we do them as

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
then I do other things and we do them as
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.420
then I do other things and we do them as
well and I think that's a good way of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
well and I think that's a good way of
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160
well and I think that's a good way of
living it's also better for obviously

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
living it's also better for obviously
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.410
living it's also better for obviously
for your family if you can sort of

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
for your family if you can sort of
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.969
for your family if you can sort of
divide your time a little bit then we

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
divide your time a little bit then we
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.790
divide your time a little bit then we
have a chalet in the outside wall

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
have a chalet in the outside wall
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
have a chalet in the outside wall
why used to we love to go walking and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
why used to we love to go walking and
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.750
why used to we love to go walking and
such and I think that's for me at least

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
such and I think that's for me at least
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.510
such and I think that's for me at least
somebody has written that actually it's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520
somebody has written that actually it's
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.340
somebody has written that actually it's
in the preface of the photo book that

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
in the preface of the photo book that
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.040
in the preface of the photo book that
every scientist has a secret garden and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
every scientist has a secret garden and
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.030
every scientist has a secret garden and
that's my secret diary
