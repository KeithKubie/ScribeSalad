In this session,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.750
we're going to talk about a new kind of
expression called a Boolean expression.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.160
Boolean expressions enable us to
represent something that's either true

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.060
or false.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.570
For instance, is it raining outside,
true or false?

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.990
If it's true that it's raining outside,
is it also true that I have an umbrella?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's hope so.
