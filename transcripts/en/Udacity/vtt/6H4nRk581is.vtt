00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.520
So getting your first users,
it's really important, right?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.730
And you just have to do everything and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.630
anything that comes to mind and
whatever you think will work.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.071
So in our case, we put up this landing
page and I started emailing my friends.

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.501
And when they started using it and
were stories about sharing and

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:21.819
people were helping one another out, the
moment we got these first stories off,

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.460
someone was able to borrow something,
borrow a bike from a friend.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.680
And someone was able to
find a language exchange,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320
an English to Chinese language exchange.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.640
When we got those stories, I knew that
those are really heart warming, so

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.850
I just went to the local press in
Palo Alto, to Palo Alto Online and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.460
Palo Alto Weekly.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.370
And like, look, this is happening,
it's really local, and

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.600
look at all these amazing stories.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.940
And I was able to get a story out.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.700
So, that brought another
few hundreds of people, and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.515
my friends invited their friends.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:49.645
We tried things that
are totally not scalable.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:53.235
Like we printed postcards and we went
and put them in people's houses and

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:54.605
door hangers.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:58.815
Just anything to get those
first few hundreds of users and

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:02.125
to prove to yourself,
that they want it and they'll use it.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.385
To start your first user base,

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:08.890
just figure out where your users
hang out, where they do it.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.780
Is it offline?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.780
Is it online?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.120
If it's online, that's great,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.400
maybe there's a forum where
they all just hang out.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770
Maybe it's all the moms forum.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.190
Maybe it's the small business forum.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.510
Maybe it's the accounting forum.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.310
Whatever your space is, figure that
out and go there and be active.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
And approach them and tell them,
here's my thing, I just started it,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.320
will you check it out?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.685
A lot of startups do that in
places like Hacker News, and

00:01:30.685 --> 00:01:33.480
Reddit, and
those are their type of communities,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.650
but maybe it's a different
type of community for you.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.380
So just go there, put it out there, just
be very authentic about who you are,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.730
don't try to advertise.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.080
Just say look, this is who I am,
I've started this startup, I think

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.896
it can be useful for you, and I'd
appreciate your feedback, go sign up.

00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:51.270
I think people will respond to that,
better than if you try to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.950
post something very pompous about,
I'm changing the world and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.280
you should all be on this,
because you really haven't yet.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.210
So just be authentic.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.770
Common mistakes, I see.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
Start ups, I don't do or kind of like,
a misconception that they have,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.870
is that marketing is something
you can hire for, right?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.210
You build your product and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.630
you get the marketing person and
they will just make the product grow.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.150
And, actually marketing
is inside the product.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.170
It's a core part of it.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.480
And marketing is the language that you
use in your product, it's the flows you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.910
have in your product, it's the social
elements you have in your product.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.800
It's the incentives you give people,
to invite others to your product.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.020
So, marketing, the product person
should be a marketing person.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.200
Or the marketing person you hire
should be there from the get-go and

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.820
help define the product.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.844
When you're just starting out and
you don't have a budget, don't think

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:45.984
about how you can grow, grow, grow to
millions and millions and millions.

00:02:45.984 --> 00:02:48.301
Just think about how
you can experiment and

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.790
perform the largest number of
experiments to see what will work.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.760
So kind of, take the pressure off,
trying to get a million users tomorrow.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.380
And see how you can get two users, and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.600
get those two users to
bring two more users.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.150
And if that experiment
has been successful, and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.060
it's something that's replicable,
then now, maybe you have something.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.798
So just think small, try a lot of
things and figure out what works.

00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:15.220
&gt;&gt; So, to grow your user base from 0 to
1000, the first thing that I would do.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.530
The first thing that I did, actually, is
understanding what makes my user tick.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.000
Where are they spending their time?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.270
What are they doing there?

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.660
I mean what are the apps
that they are using?

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.890
What kind of website they're going to,
what are they doing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.830
on those web sites and apps?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.670
Whats interesting for them?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.770
What are their habits?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.202
What are the social platforms
that they are using?

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:46.190
And start focusing on those places.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.270
You can't do everything.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.688
Everybody wants to do everything.

00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:55.370
You can do incentives and the SCO and
social and an offline presence.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.603
You need to know exactly what's
working and what's not and

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:00.161
double in what's working.

00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:01.604
So for example,

00:04:01.604 --> 00:04:07.282
let's assume that you are doing
a keyword research for your SEO.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:12.038
But one of the by products that
you're getting from keyword research

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:15.710
is understanding your
audience interests.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.757
What they care about,
what are they asking Google,

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:21.603
when they're trying to
find something online?

00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:24.120
What kind of apps are they using?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.540
What are their habits?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.660
And when you're finding out
what people care about,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.090
you can start to
strategize your next plan.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.400
You can start understanding
what you need to do.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.920
&gt;&gt; The important question is how we got
from 0 to just 100,000 views a day,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.040
or 100,000 to 1 million views a day.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.843
How did we get from 0 videos
uploaded to 100 videos uploaded,

00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:47.790
to 1,000 videos uploaded?

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.680
And that was sort of the summer of 2005,
we went out there to a lot of different

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.180
forums out there and
told people that, if you needed to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.900
use a method, a server,
to be able to host your videos,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.430
use this as the free place,
we don't charge storage fees.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.780
We don't charge any fees for you, as a
host, to be able to upload your videos.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.050
Just upload the content and
we'll do all the trans-coding, and

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.690
we'll do all the bandwidth and we'll
pay for all the bandwidth for you, for

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.330
all the views that you
want to use the site for.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.310
So, that was really what,
I think in the beginning.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.141
But there was another part of it,
was MySpace in 2005,

00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:32.683
was one of the largest users or
largest sites out there,

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:36.950
that utilized its ability
to be able to host videos.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.080
And so, they themselves, didn't have
a service to able to host videos.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.980
Their users were desperate for a way
to be able to upload and share videos.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.113
And in comes YouTube with perfectly,
every time you uploaded a video

00:05:50.113 --> 00:05:53.746
on to YouTube, there was this
little snippet at the bottom,

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:56.046
you barely have to scroll down at all.

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:59.840
And here's a copy and paste and
we can add this copy and

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.550
paste HTML snippet on to everywhere.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.730
So, we allowed pretty much any
site that allows HTML snippets.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.230
eBay, Craigslist, but
MySpace was one of the big ones,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.150
where people were seeking out this
solution and we provided the solution.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.239
I think the equivalence,

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.963
as well as the differences between
I think different companies,

00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:21.958
different startups, but key metrics and
how do you actually get that.

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.760
I think with YouTube it was about giving
sort of almost free bandwidth out and

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.630
accumulating more users,
getting the brand name out there.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.920
For PayPal it was different, right?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.470
It was getting the people's trust and
it was trying to get people,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.760
to see this as a way to
make payments online.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.820
People were still back in that time,
1999,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.690
this was something they've
never heard of and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.550
they were still kind of trying to
feel out what the internet can do.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.140
So one thing that PayPal did early
on was to be able to assign a very

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.070
high value.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.552
I think that when we were
looking at banks out there.

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:58.346
And every customer,
had a sort of a value of about $750.

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:02.881
And so, when PayPal took a look at it
and said well, if it only takes us

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:07.655
$10 to get a new user, it's
an investment that we're making that's

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:12.290
very costly now, but the returns on
it years from now will be very big.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.823
And so, it was a sign in for
every new user that you would create,

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:20.339
every new user account automatically
gets $10 into their PayPal account, and

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.182
they can start making payments.

00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:25.016
And then,
to try to create that virality,

00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:29.662
to try to create more users and
get you are automatically connected and

00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:34.090
comfortable with this idea of
payment to payment service.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.800
It automatically gave you $10 for
every new user, that you brought online.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.790
But, you can quickly see that, once you
start getting your first 1000 users and

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.840
they're actually getting another 10,000
users it starts accumulating very

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.900
quickly, that you're actually just
paying out all the funding that you're

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.270
getting from VCs in
checks to these people.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.460
But ultimately,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.930
it also created a network that
people were comfortable with.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.415
Down the line people, it became
harder and harder to get that $10, so

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:05.790
initially it was,
you would sign up for the account and

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.760
confirm your email address, and
here's the $10 in your account.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.040
Later on it became, you have to give
us your credit card information.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.406
And then, even later on it was,
you have to give us your ACH or

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:20.779
banking account information and
then you would get $10.

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:25.131
And by that point, I think, if you're
a new user that's actually giving credit

00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.267
card information,
as well as your banking information,

00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:31.160
it's well worth the $10
to get that information.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.429
One of the questions that I get a lot
from, sort of, new entrepreneurs where

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.650
they give a talk, for example, and
I get questions coming up afterwards.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:46.666
And, it's kind of this model of question
which would be, I've this great idea.

00:08:46.666 --> 00:08:51.099
And two things, I think, one of them is,
I've been thinking about it for

00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:54.743
a long time, but I don't know
what the next step should be and

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.700
I think the obvious is,
why don't you start it?

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.575
And it's like well, no I don't know
if it's going to work, and I'm still

00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:03.560
working on something else at the time,
and it's taking up a lot of my energy.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.915
But at the end of the day, I think
behind every company there was that risk

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:10.435
and there was the ability to say forget
it for six months, three months, for

00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:12.317
a year I'm going to go without a salary.

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:17.017
And without that sort of safety net and
I'm going to take a chance, and

00:09:17.017 --> 00:09:21.450
I'm going to take some risk,
to be able to see this through.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.020
But, without ever taking
that risky first step,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.530
no company's ever been created.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.470
So, I think that's one
of the key things there.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.590
I think, the second one is always this
question that people come up and say,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.260
well, what do you think?

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.610
They would pitch this idea and
they would say, but

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.910
one of the reasons why I'm not so
ecstatic about starting this,

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.100
is that I don't see this as
a billion dollar company.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.726
And I have to say, I don't think that
whenever one of these companies,

00:09:47.726 --> 00:09:51.959
whenever Facebook started, or PayPal,
or YouTube started, we talked earlier,

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.360
YouTube was a dating site.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.930
We didn't think YouTube was
a billion dollar company.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.960
I think as long as,
it's an idea that you believe in.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.640
As long as it's an idea that you see,
either yourself or somebody, you can see

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.610
and visualize the users behind the site,
then create it because people will come.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.273
And it's going to be a question as to
how many people will use this site.

00:10:14.273 --> 00:10:18.701
But I think that's more important,
rather than trying to create

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:23.613
something that you think is going to,
rather than having to qualify that

00:10:23.613 --> 00:10:28.630
the actual start up idea with, is it
going to be this billion dollar idea?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.070
I think it's more important to just say,

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.230
is it creating a solution to
a problem that I can see?
