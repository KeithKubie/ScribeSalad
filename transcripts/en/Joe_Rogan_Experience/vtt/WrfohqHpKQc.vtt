WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.940
Boom. All right. With live, what's going on man? What do you got there?

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.520
Text messaging people. No, we'll shut your phone off. Yeah,

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.830
just put it on silent silence. Mood.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.950
How long have you been in America now for your,

5
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.720
you're only here for like two weeks, right? Uh, yeah,

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
I came for two week and three days. And the ice,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.440
you invited me on the, uh, the UFC. And did you enjoy it? Yeah.

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.300
Was Great.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.180
It was my first time at the u s the first time or even at an MMA even.

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.260
You've never been doing MMA and really, no. In France. So boring, you know,

11
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:38.094
you know that, uh,

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
now he's pretty beaten friends and you can't hate the guy when he's in on the

13
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:44.814
floor.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.680
So that's why it used to be boring in France because they fight like striking.

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.681
And then when the guy take you down and then he's just busy and just

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.740
submissions. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. So the MMA rules,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.230
when they would go to the ground, no striking at all. Striking.

18
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.320
So that's why he went to the body even in the book. Oh, I think, yeah.

19
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.180
In the buddy that can. Okay. But you can't punch the face. So boring.

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.760
That aside, I'd never, I'd never been in there. I mean me even friends,

21
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:16.260
but UFC at two, four one was crazy. Especially the fight,

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.390
the Diaz fight and the, and the,

23
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:23.190
and the main event was now as a kickboxing champion.

24
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.940
And when you watch MMA, do you,

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.890
I know that you've been training and I know that you spent some time while

26
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.680
you're out here at Aka. Yeah.

27
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.430
Are you thinking of eventually make your way to the UFC?

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.110
I'm not thinking that's what, that's what I will do. You will do. Yeah.

29
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.320
That's what I will do. That's what I, I want to do, you know, uh,

30
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.260
yeah. As you said, I'm the greeter now. I have five belt.

31
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.290
My, my first dream before groin was to, to become the, yeah.

32
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.510
The greatest kickboxing in the world. Kickboxer in the world.

33
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.240
I wanted to beat the, everybody in my division.

34
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.440
That's what I did before Niki hosken was the champ champ and defeated since six

35
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:12.240
years. Uh, yeah. W it was the greatest ingredient. And I was like, Damn, how,

36
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.890
how do I'm going to beat him? You know? He's so, he's so strong and I beat him.

37
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.220
I beat him yet twice I beat everybody. So after that,

38
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.800
before people was asking me,

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.110
do you think to go to MMA because I think you should do something great in

40
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.750
there. I was like, no, I don't like him at me. I don't want, I don't like,

41
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
like Wesleyan bs. I don't like this kind of sport. I'm a striker, you know?

42
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.530
I was like, no, I like it. And yet two years ago I was like, damn,

43
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
I think I like it. You know? Cause I, I tried once and uh, I really,

44
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:45.510
I really like it, you know? What did you like,

45
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:49.560
do you like MMA training or did you like MMA training, MMA training and Gigi,

46
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.350
so I was, and I was watching Jujitsu all the time on TV and more.

47
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:57.450
I watched Jujitsu. I was like, Oh, this is so complicated. It's so,

48
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.260
it's not only two guys who are rolling and making string stuff on the

49
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.280
underground, is this more than, than, than that? So I was like, oh,

50
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.290
it's complicated. It's very, it's not easy. So I,

51
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.190
yeah, I wanted to learn that. I wanted, I wanted someone to teach me that.

52
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.700
And uh, yeah, I was thinking about, man, man, now I really want to do it.

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.230
I want to do you know what Conor McGregor, uh, couldn't do, you know,

54
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360
he was the best in MMA in the one Columbus Sport and you wanted to be the

55
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.980
Columbine, um, Floyd, Floyd Mayweather and another combat sport.

56
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.580
He wanted to be the greatest in two combustible different combat sports.

57
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.980
He couldn't do it. He failed. And that's what I want to do it.

58
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:41.800
And I think I really, really will do it.

59
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.900
I'm the best in kickboxing and I want to be the best in MMA.

60
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.500
And I think I read them.

61
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.390
<v 2>If kickboxing was as popular as MMA,</v>

62
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:52.940
do you think you'd still have the same desire?

63
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.590
<v 1>Do it? Yes. Yes, yes. Because you just want to be the best.</v>

64
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.520
Because I'm young, you know, I'm 26, uh, I,

65
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.600
my dreams came true. You know, I'm the best in kickboxing.

66
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.990
My nickname is the best. I'm really the best. So,

67
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.360
<v 2>well, I'm a big fan of yours and, uh,</v>

68
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.190
I was really excited to get you in here and one of the things I was really

69
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.100
interested in, uh,

70
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.220
is that you sort of changed your style and you were more movement oriented and

71
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:23.490
you would win on points, but then you started fucking people up.

72
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:27.060
You started hitting like people like Nicki Holt's kid had said that about you,

73
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.760
that you're a mover. Yeah. That you're a runner.

74
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.380
I was trying to say it and the Nice, that's what he said. But man,

75
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.010
you changed that around you. You don't want people out

76
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.860
<v 1>because B a yeah. My first, my first big,</v>

77
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:43.830
big fight in,

78
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.890
in glory was against sneak cameras and that was only my third fight in glory.

79
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.650
Uh, as I beat the rank number two, who was mutual Gruner,

80
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.370
uh, as I beat him, the, they put me, um,

81
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.410
a title shot right after and I was like, Nicole's can is really,

82
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:07.580
really complicated. You were like 24, right? Yeah, I was 24. That's very young.

83
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:11.360
Yeah. Fight Nikki Holtzclaw. Yeah, I was, I was, yeah, I was,

84
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.600
I was impressed by him because he's very good. He's very good. And I still,

85
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.090
I still impressed by him because for me it's very, very great champ. It was,

86
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.840
and um, I was like, I will not knock him out. I used to, before Gloria,

87
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.320
I used to fight every month. Sometime I read to fight.

88
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.580
I used to fight three times a month and, um, I used to be, yeah.

89
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.310
Really? Yeah. Because of tournament,

90
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.560
I used to knock people out at the first round and, uh,

91
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.580
when I saw Nikki I was like, okay, I will not go for the k o.

92
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.570
So I trained myself to do all five rounds to make points and to,

93
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.980
and to stay myself, like funny in the ring and um, yeah.

94
00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:56.540
And make a lot of moon movement, heat jokes, uh,

95
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.620
play with our John Share, you know, and that's what I did. And uh, yeah.

96
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.390
And I kept going that way after Nikki, I kept the same style,

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.040
the same side of Samsung. And once I failed, you know, uh,

98
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.780
I lost the fight because, uh, because of that my, my diet wasn't very good,

99
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:15.710
you know? Uh,

100
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.880
I make a good first round and then I was tired as fuck.

101
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.881
So I couldn't do the job what I wanted to do and then I took a diet.

102
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.140
Now my story, my dad is perfect. And what did you change?

103
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.620
Like what were you eating before? Before I was like, okay,

104
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.060
I f to prepare a fight. I started two months before the fight,

105
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.300
the GD and then, uh, before I was like, okay, still two months,

106
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.550
okay, start more. I stopped next week the Diet,

107
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.080
I start to move to neutral and then we are two weeks before the fight. I'm like,

108
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.990
damn, six skills to lose. Okay.

109
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.090
I started today and then I come in a five week and I never started the Diet and

110
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.090
I started like in the,

111
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.380
and like three days before the fight I had five kilo to lose six kilo to lose

112
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.790
three days. And I was like, okay, I don't eat anything no more.

113
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.900
Now I just train, train sonar training with no food, with no food,

114
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.270
even no water. And that's was, that's, that wasn't smart. You know,

115
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.050
it's so hard for people to believe that world champions do things like that.

116
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.480
Yeah. But that is the case sometimes.

117
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.010
And sometimes you need a bad fight to sort of snap you out of it and realize,

118
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.980
hey, I have to be disciplined for many, many months out and invest. Right.

119
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.180
You know what the first thing growers say to my manager before when I won the

120
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:42.320
first title, they say, Hey, Cedric is very lucky because we don't,

121
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.680
we don't even know how, how does he come? He arrive at,

122
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.870
at this level with no, no diet, no, you know,

123
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.790
no strategies, no trainer, nothing. There was,

124
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.280
there was very surprised and yeah, I, I think,

125
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.520
I think a lot about this and that's why now I'm very professional and after that

126
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.760
diet, I start to knock everybody out. So what did you change in your diet?

127
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.540
Like what do you eat now? Now it's like, you know, my diet and Francis,

128
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.360
she's very famous, you know her name is Cecile golden coach. She's a,

129
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:20.450
the name is golden coach. Golden cause that's a real name

130
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.111
and yeah.

131
00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:29.090
And she take care of many champions in France and the, yeah, she,

132
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.670
I cannot tell you exactly what,

133
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.510
what is in inside my diet because it's so complicated.

134
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.210
But I told her I don't want,

135
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.360
I don't want you to tell me how many grams and this and this and this.

136
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.650
Just tell me right. What I need to eat Monday,

137
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.240
Tuesday morning, evening. And that's what, that's what she did.

138
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.060
She just follow her instructions, follow instruction.

139
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.980
I live a meal prep company. Someone who makes the meals for you.

140
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.820
Do it all yourself? Not yet. Yeah. Yeah. There was some in France,

141
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.280
in Paris especially, but I didn't choose yet.

142
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.360
So what kinds of foods are you eating? I love African food, but Africa,

143
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.260
African food is really,

144
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:13.210
really not good for my diet is because a lot of oil,

145
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.300
a lot of meat. Uh, sound good. That sounds great. That sounds great.

146
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:23.180
But wait, no, I used to eat, um,

147
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.790
Japanese food. Japanese. I really like Japanese food,

148
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:31.470
Sushi fish as Derek food is very healthy.

149
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.860
So I like Japanese food, Korean food.

150
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:38.490
So that's what I used to eat when I'm, I go out restaurant.

151
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.850
So now what does she have you eating now? Now I don't have to prepare any fight.

152
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:49.740
I just keep on shape. So I eat what I want now. Which one?

153
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.960
What I want today. Today? Yes.

154
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.260
But starting September and then they're going to start a new diet and yeah,

155
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.520
mornings like two eggs, two eggs. And um, how much do you have to lose?

156
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.840
Like what is your normal weight?

157
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960
My normal weight in kilograms is I'm 85 85.

158
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:12.230
What does that like find seven day? What is that? How many?

159
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.010
85 kilograms to pounds.

160
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.080
Maybe one night when 90 yeah, it's on one 60.

161
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:23.940
1.2 0.21 88 and you have to get down to one 71 17.

162
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.460
Yeah. So when I, when I say, when I say that in, uh,

163
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.900
in naked there was like, oh, you good? Oh yeah. MMA fighters lose a lot.

164
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:36.580
A lot. A lot. But before it was before, oh,

165
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.840
the biggest thing I did is in seven weeks I lost a 15.

166
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.650
No, 17, 17 kilos. Oh Wow. Seven weeks. Yeah. Last time I came to AK,

167
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:54.651
I was 95 95 eas is 200 202 plots.

168
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.550
Yeah. 95 kills. We gotta calculate here. What is it? Two 10.

169
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.570
So you are 210 pounds. Yeah.

170
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.770
And seven week later I lost the 15,

171
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.540
17 kilograms because of the sin. Ah, yeah. Yeah.

172
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.510
That was very, very hard. But your energy levels. Okay. What are you doing?

173
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:20.010
All that? Everything was good. I was just training twice a day and diet,

174
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:24.930
diet everyday, every other day. Yeah. Now kickboxing is huge in Europe. I mean,

175
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.760
very big people were big

176
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.890
<v 2>people. I mean, I had, um, Rico Verhoeven on when we discussed this,</v>

177
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:35.891
like how enormous kickboxing is in Holland and in Europe and in America.

178
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.700
For whatever reason, it never caught on. I don't understand it.

179
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.780
I've been a fan of glory and I've been trying to tell people about them for a

180
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:45.614
long time.

181
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.230
<v 1>Uh, I cannot blame USA for that because the,</v>

182
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.490
the legalize MMA, so MMA just more,

183
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.290
more attractive for people, you know, then people who doesn't know shit about,

184
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.320
about fighting, they just watch MMA is like,

185
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.830
oh two people are fighting then that's interesting. You know,

186
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.510
kickboxing and like things like sport, like way Thai kickboxing.

187
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.440
If he doesn't know the rules, it's kind of, yeah, you just want and you don't,

188
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.080
you don't understand, you don't understand. But MMA is more easy to understand,

189
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:24.640
you know, just, yeah. It's just a fight between two people. So I don't,

190
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.050
I really don't know why kickboxing is not a, it's not yet.

191
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.890
Maybe at the same level as MMA in USA. What,

192
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.250
what's crazy to me is boxing is very respected in the United States and MMA is

193
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:39.664
very respected.

194
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.790
But one of the things that people like about MMA is stand up there.

195
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.520
Like the striking. Yeah. But the best striking,

196
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.460
it's like glory or more tie.

197
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:52.660
Like the best elite kickboxers are the best strikers. That's right.

198
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:57.430
But I think people love the cage. People love the blood.

199
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.780
So small gloves.

200
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.740
That's why that's all people like people don't like you too.

201
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.570
Don't like how you say them.

202
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.280
A knockdown like k o or nothing. Yeah.

203
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.360
They don't like to brag. And the one, two, three, no. They like, yeah,

204
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.290
they like to see two to watch k. Oh,

205
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.270
so that's what I think that's what they prefer. Yeah. And then they, well,

206
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:24.250
is there a movement at all to try to get MMA full MMA legalized in France?

207
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.810
Uh, I think in January it's going to be, it's going to be okay.

208
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.740
So they're going to have to allow strikes on the ground. Yeah. Everything,

209
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:37.540
every soon. Sooner in January. So in January, January. Oh,

210
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.060
okay. And I think UFC going to come in,

211
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.470
so they'll probably be USC and Paris for sure. And think so. That sounds wild.

212
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.221
Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:49.780
Well the more guys like you get involved in MMA though,

214
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.290
the more complicated kickboxing though, because like when elite fighters,

215
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.320
world champions, like yourself make a jump to MMA,

216
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.150
then people might look at kickboxing as a stepping stone instead of as a valid

217
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:05.710
individual sport. Yeah, yeah, that's right. But,

218
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.960
uh, you mean when the guy has stepped from kickboxing to MMA? Yeah.

219
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.351
They're like,

220
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.770
maybe people won't care as much about kickboxing because they're looking at it

221
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:19.180
as a stepping stone to MMA. Yeah, of course. And the, yeah. Yeah, that's right.

222
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:23.110
That's what I, that's what I wanted. I want to do or so because I think, um,

223
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.940
for a guy from a kickboxing to to go in MMA,

224
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.570
it's not really difficult for him if, uh, yeah, if you learn the,

225
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.700
the crown game and wrestling, take rest and take them defense.

226
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.760
If you learn that it's going to be, yeah.

227
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.910
More simple than the guy who come from way tie, you know, more ties.

228
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.430
It's really different. Like kickboxing, kickboxing.

229
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.690
When you fighting kickboxing,

230
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:54.691
you move the lot already in understand standing target instead of we,

231
00:14:55.471 --> 00:14:59.840
I wait, I you did. If you watch [inaudible] you fight. They don't move a lot,

232
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:02.430
you know, they stay still and the fight is,

233
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.280
is all about poets for kicks, for punches.

234
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.820
So why do you think that's different? Because the clench because of elbows,

235
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:15.380
knees like, because of the, the, the movement, the movement in MMA,

236
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.860
they stay still and in Quebec seen the, there is no, you know,

237
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.160
there was no break. You know, they just keep fighting. One, two, three, one,

238
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:26.090
two, three, one, two, three. And the in Weta is more like one, one,

239
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.020
one elbow, knees, and yeah. Also by the cleaning.

240
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.530
Just good for everyone because then, you know, in May, yeah. The Red Tie club.

241
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.750
Yeah. Of course. This is good for me. Now in France,

242
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.500
is it easy to get wrestling? Do you get wrestling training?

243
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.860
I uh, in France I get grappling training.

244
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.320
I think here in USA you call it busy No-gi you, yeah,

245
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.180
yeah. That's what I, that's why I'm training in France.

246
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.970
Take downs or take down defense wrestling. But you know, this,

247
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.280
this type of, um, of, uh,

248
00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.180
No-gi training I get is a little bit different,

249
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.260
like as visually because we start, uh,

250
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.700
on our feet and, uh,

251
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.440
and we used to west and then after the take down, we continue,

252
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.140
right? So it's not like an Olympic western ride, but it's,

253
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.180
they call that [inaudible] you have snow looted labor is what they're called

254
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.930
Brazil. But I I know what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

255
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.960
so in America, most presenters you to, they start on the ground already,

256
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:36.830
they'll start on the knees or something like that to avoid accidents because you

257
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:37.010
know,

258
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.860
you got a class four 40 people rolling around together and they're trying to

259
00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:44.020
tackle each other and people blow their knees out and things on those lines.

260
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.290
Yeah. That's why I'm training in that in, in Paris, very big team.

261
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.800
The coaches major admin is very good. And the,

262
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.680
he say for the first few times, very, very good. I learned fast for,

263
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.580
I learned very fast. Of course you're an elite athlete now at 26,

264
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.740
but how much time do you think you need between now and when you have your first

265
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.980
MMA fight? You know, what is my dream? Yes.

266
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.280
Now is now I beat everybody.

267
00:17:13.281 --> 00:17:16.640
So like I'm getting birds in the, in kickboxing, you know,

268
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.680
I still defending right,

269
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.280
my title because I like it because of the cash price also. And,

270
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.470
uh, my dream is

271
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.180
I still didn't contract in the, for one, one year in health,

272
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.840
little bit more than one year.

273
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.570
My dream is prepare myself to MMA during one year.

274
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.670
So I still got time and after the, at the end of the contract,

275
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.090
directly go to UFC and take the chimp for the,

276
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.800
a direct dieters shot all at the five run guy.

277
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.010
I really, I really, really would like to fight new ideas or,

278
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.330
uh, Anthony Petty's for my first fight,

279
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.710
MMA to y to, to, to shook,

280
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.090
only to show the world, to,

281
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:17.091
to show everybody that a guy who come from kickboxing directly.

282
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.470
His first fight is gangs, thug guy in MMA and he,

283
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.730
he fucked him up. So that's what I want to do and I really,

284
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.540
really believe in me and I know I will. I can and I will do it.

285
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.230
Now have you been in talks with UFC?

286
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:38.660
Does UFC know about your plan? Not yet. Not yet. What they do now. Uh,

287
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.940
but I think after the show they have already, so now they're going to know.

288
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.910
So your training at Aki was at the first time you ever trained up there?

289
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.580
It was my second time. Second time. When did you train before?

290
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.750
Before it was one years ago. November. Yeah.

291
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.740
I came here after my glorified, uh, I broke my ribs,

292
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.740
so I took a little bit, uh, vacation in Thailand and then, uh, after that,

293
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.080
yeah, I just fly to, uh, Aka San Jose and yeah, I meet,

294
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.600
I met everybody. DC Cubby wasn't there,

295
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.040
but I met a lot of great, great teammates. Uh,

296
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.640
the western level is just amazing. The,

297
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.660
so I met have also Javier Mendez. Yeah, I see.

298
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.440
So that's a great camp for a guy like youtube because it's very wrestling heavy.

299
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.330
Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's what I, that's what I like. I want to turn, you know,

300
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.240
what did I say to me? Gee, in front, I say, I want to train western busy.

301
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:42.210
Like I want to be a world world champion of wrestling, you know,

302
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.610
so I just want to think wrestling like a restaurant.

303
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.950
I don't just want to train my take down defense or shit like that. No, I just,

304
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.550
I want people to be afraid of me in an underground, you know,

305
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.430
I'll say learn fast as I really like it.

306
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.030
I think that's the level I want to get.

307
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.590
And how's it going when you train at Aka, are you hanging in there? Like,

308
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.480
do you find it uncomfortable? Like of course as a,

309
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.380
as a striker, uh, inch writing. Yeah. Um,

310
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.440
my level is higher than anybody else in Aka but in the ground.

311
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.830
Yeah. And fucking focused on, so yeah.

312
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.170
Everybody did. The, I taught everybody every day. I taught in the guys. Yeah.

313
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.170
Yeah. For the movement. And uh, yeah,

314
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:34.500
they say I learned you I have plans on tapping. Yeah, of course. Yes.

315
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.240
For the moment I type and uh, because I'm learning and they say I learned very,

316
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:43.140
very fast. Like they show me once and then I get it, you know,

317
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.190
five minutes later I get it. And so I feel confident for the future

318
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.420
<v 2>in [inaudible] and I think I would do it. You well,</v>

319
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.470
I'm hoping you do.

320
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.480
It's always exciting to see world champions and particularly kickboxing,

321
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.980
make that way to MMA, to the UFC. And for a guy like you,

322
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:05.320
it's the perfect thing because you're so young,

323
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.500
cause you're 26 and you're already a very accomplished world champion.

324
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.510
That's right. And I think I'm thinking about, um, Israel,

325
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:18.250
Addison, you know, he, he, he needed and he couldn't do it,

326
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:23.080
you know, but he was very smart. Israel, the way he planned it,

327
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.320
he really worked on his take down defense and made sure that he,

328
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:29.740
by the time he made it to the UFC, he was already at an elite level.

329
00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.520
It wasn't a lit, but he got a tighter shot in the,

330
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:38.380
in glory and he lost. And after that he went to UFC, you know,

331
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:42.880
so, uh, that's what I want to do. I want to be the only one to,

332
00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:47.230
to, to be able to yeah. To, to do that, you know,

333
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.640
and the glory. Kickboxing chimp and then UFC champ,

334
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.670
he fought wellness right when this, yeah, very close fight. Just,

335
00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.730
it was very close. I thought he won. Some people thought it was and some, no.

336
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.260
Yeah. But Jason Wellness's elite is the lead of course. Yeah. Very,

337
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:09.820
very high level fighter. Yeah. Well, Gloria is like soc side. I'm such a fan.

338
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.550
I love watching it, man. It's like one of my favorite things to watch.

339
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.680
It drives me crazy that it's not popular and I was very excited when it was on

340
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:21.130
spike TV in America. It was, they were making a big deal out of it.

341
00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:25.180
It looked like they were gonna, you know, try to promote it as much as possible.

342
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:29.080
And they tried it for a little while, then they stopped and now it's on ESPN,

343
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:32.560
a little bed. It's on UFC fight pass, which is great.

344
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.000
I think that the country will grow is very, very multiple places in Holland.

345
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.450
I think French is so support bureau, you know,

346
00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.970
some people recognize me and in the street when the,

347
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.700
when were way out in front yet because of glory is very popular in Europe.

348
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.230
Well, La Martel growing heart. He's, is he the guy that you're fighting next?

349
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.010
Eh, he's the guy who want me to beat his ass next.

350
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.440
I don't know if I would fight him. Nick, do you have a fight scheduled next? No,

351
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.670
not yet. Growing, Heart's been talking a lot of shifts. Yeah.

352
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.500
Fucking little shit. You know,

353
00:23:08.501 --> 00:23:12.820
I'm the money fight [inaudible] against me, but the, yeah,

354
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.720
I would like to fight Milton next because, uh,

355
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.250
when we fight it shows other people really, really like it. It's a great fight.

356
00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.180
Yes. Very good. It was very fighter. It's very entertaining. And the, yeah,

357
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:27.430
people like it. So, but you've already beaten them.

358
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.270
Sorry if you already beaten him. Yeah, of course. Yes. You've of course.

359
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.080
What did, how did that fight go? I'm trying to remember. Uh,

360
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.490
I won like point, but it wasn't the good fight for me, you know,

361
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.810
it wasn't a good, when I look at that fight today. Yeah, for sure.

362
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:46.530
I'm seeing that, that four years ago. How many years ago was this?

363
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:52.010
<v 1>Four years ago? Yeah. Yeah. Four years ago. Yeah. Before the bell. Yeah.</v>

364
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.790
Four or five years ago I was in firees and the, yeah,

365
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:58.640
when the fight and uh, yeah,

366
00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:01.790
for me it's going to be interesting if I fight him because I fought everybody in

367
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:05.060
that division, so I don't know who they going to be.

368
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.920
Oh going to be my next opening. But yeah, sounds good for for Milton.

369
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.940
And then, yeah, he's going to be, he's going to be on the rematch, you know,

370
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.040
on the rematch. We metro match for them.

371
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.000
<v 2>So from then out, one year plus,</v>

372
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.780
then you make your way into the world of the UFC. No matter what,

373
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.030
even if glory comes with more money of glory is like, listen, Doom Bay,

374
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:33.650
we love you. [inaudible] I really, I really like glory,

375
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.630
<v 1>you know. Uh, Gloria is my, my first great experience as a, yeah.</v>

376
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.370
As a real champ. And, uh, the, they're doing a great job for me,

377
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.510
you know, uh, I really like glory, but

378
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.780
I have to think about me for, and a legacy. Yeah. My legacy. And,

379
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.460
uh, I, I like to do what I love to do. So for my, my,

380
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:03.420
I love kickboxing, I love defending my title. I love the, the, the,

381
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.710
um, the glory. Um, even, you know, the, the team I love every,

382
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.280
every, everybody and everything in glory. But tomorrow, I don't know.

383
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.410
I don't know. I just going to follow my, my goal, follow my, um,

384
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.520
my needs and uh, yeah, I want to be the,

385
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:28.100
the, I hope the first French UFC champion.

386
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.820
And uh, that's what I, that's what I want. I want to check the wall. I want to,

387
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.660
I want to write, uh,

388
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.570
my story and a new story people never had about it.

389
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.600
So even if Gloria [inaudible]

390
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.560
<v 2>[inaudible] is a big, big, big money, you know,</v>

391
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.100
I just want to follow what I want. You just have a plan.

392
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.910
You have a plan and I know I would get more, more after that.

393
00:25:50.911 --> 00:25:55.360
So I mean the thing, I'm confident. So you've been out here now, uh,

394
00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.320
you went to the UFC events and then you did some training at Aka, like, uh,

395
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.190
w when you are outside of camp, say like, whenever your fight is scheduled,

396
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.180
how much, uh, what kind of training you doing when you're not in camp?

397
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.280
Are you mixing it up now and trying to do a lot of Jujitsu? A lot of BJJ.

398
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.660
1:00 AM nothing. Kim.

399
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.380
<v 1>So my, um, my conditioning trainer, Valentino Gargiulo,</v>

400
00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.620
he followed me everywhere. He's with me today. And, uh,

401
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.680
we just train strange conditioning because before that was my weakness,

402
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.400
the condition I used, I used to knock everybody out at the first round.

403
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.520
So I never trained my condition.

404
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.480
I never took it very serious because I used to knock people out at the first

405
00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:46.230
round. So when I did my first five rounds,

406
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.560
I was like, wow, damn, the conditioning is so, so important.

407
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.780
So that's why I'm training a lot. You know,

408
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.670
a strange for sure conditioning and also, yeah, when I'm not,

409
00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.980
when I don't have a fight, kickboxing, fight plan, I trained BCG,

410
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.080
I trained wrestling, MMA and aga is a completely different conditions.

411
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.780
It's crazy when you, when you Wester with a guy and then you, you,

412
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.630
you get up and you're trying to strike, you're exhausted. Yeah.

413
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.620
Arms are filled with blood. [inaudible] nothing. Yeah, it's very crazy.

414
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.580
Now what kind of strength and conditioning are you doing and how often are you

415
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.490
doing it? Like say if you are, if you're preparing for a fight,

416
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.740
how many days a week do you do strength and conditioning?

417
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.440
When I am preparing for a fight, uh, everyday. Everyday.

418
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.600
Everyday it's not, of course it's not the same training,

419
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.140
but every day I see Valentino and uh, we train together. Yeah.

420
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:45.540
Everyday I train more conditioning and strange more than kickboxing.

421
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.450
Really. I don't have a trainer in kickboxing,

422
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.890
but that's right. Yeah. Really people,

423
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.230
people don't believe it doesn't believe it when I say that,

424
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:59.580
but [inaudible] yourself. I turned myself. That's insane. I have of course,

425
00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:04.170
my friend in the, in France who old hold meats for me for sure.

426
00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:06.330
I can meet for my myself.

427
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.660
He old miss for me and we just taught together.

428
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.540
We just plan a game plan together for a fight. We just don't,

429
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.220
I'm my own coach, you know, that is crazy.

430
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:21.810
I never had a coach at your level to be your own. You've never had a coach.

431
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.580
Of course. I had a first teacher.

432
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:29.610
He told me after that he couldn't teach me anymore because because of his job,

433
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:30.211
you know, when I,

434
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:35.211
when I was young and then I just move from a to country and countries and

435
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:38.910
countries to learn to learn, to learn. And then came back in France, Paris,

436
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.400
and it just turned myself. That is insane.

437
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.150
How many world champions just trained themselves? I think nobody.

438
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.520
How do you do that? That sounds crazy. But why didn't you get another coach?

439
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.730
I don't know. Because I didn't find a coach who can, I don't know.

440
00:28:54.731 --> 00:28:59.460
I can just teach me. I really don't know. That's a good question. I don't,

441
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:04.470
I don't, why did I, what? I didn't found a new coach.

442
00:29:04.471 --> 00:29:05.304
I don't know.

443
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.120
Cause you're not thought about making any trips to Holland or the Thailand or

444
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.040
you know, Bodo in France. Sure. So I was raised there.

445
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.940
That's where I started the kickboxing. I started with full contact, you know,

446
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:22.250
full contact shore. Rick roofers was my first. I hadn't really, yeah,

447
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.270
why I was watching Rick roof roof.

448
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:29.040
His bread is one of the big coaches in Mia. He's name is them.

449
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.500
His brother took to Griffiths. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a friend of mine.

450
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.670
He's great. Oh Nice. Yeah. He's a out of Milwaukee. Yes. Yeah. Roofing sport.

451
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.310
Yeah. Yeah. So when I start that for contact, I was watching all the fight of a,

452
00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:47.290
of is the jet special? Yeah. Rick Rufus Against Rube Cameron. Ah,

453
00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.260
yeah. The first and the second was crazy, crazy,

454
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:54.490
crazy recruits against [inaudible] for contact fight.

455
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:58.340
So after, after my, my first coach, uh,

456
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.850
couldn't teach me anymore,

457
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.950
I just float to 'em and sell them because, uh, yeah,

458
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:09.460
because of Cameron, you know, in my mind I was thinking about, OK, uh,

459
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.680
raise the best kickbox in the planet. Um, um, Harlan. So I went to Holland.

460
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:18.320
Materialism was famous because of rob Carmen because of, uh,

461
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.000
Ramia Goujon ski shore. And, uh, I went to majority,

462
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:24.430
my trend them maybe two years, you know,

463
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:29.431
I was flying a Bordeaux Amsterdam doing two years and,

464
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.140
uh, yeah, uh, the coach was under him or not. He teach me a lot, you know, uh,

465
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.450
I learned a lot there and when I,

466
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.280
I figured out that I couldn't learn anymore, uh, else in maturity,

467
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.960
I just went to Belgium because I met semi-commercial. B is a very,

468
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:51.070
very great coach for me is the best coach. I never, I never had,

469
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.140
why wouldn't you spend your camps with him then? Why? Yeah, because,

470
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.500
because we meet each other at an event in France and then I saw one of his

471
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:07.450
fighter, he was fighting and then when I saw his technique,

472
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.630
he's a, his condition. He was, you know,

473
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:15.580
his first round was looking the same at his fifth round. It was crazy.

474
00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.170
A very, very high level condition. His name is Mohammed Endo was very crazy.

475
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:25.030
And I say that's, that's like this, I want to fight. It was so technical,

476
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:28.300
you know, and I say that's what like this, I want to fight.

477
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.360
I went to Belgium in Brussels and I trained with him also two years.

478
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:38.490
I was a driving Paris present Paris [inaudible] two years during two years I

479
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.690
trained with him and I that's with here that um,

480
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.720
I want my first belt against Nick Ellis and he,

481
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.180
if you watch my fights before nickel skin and that fight against the Kilcullen,

482
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.170
he's competed two different fighter.

483
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.810
So why don't you do your camps with him now?

484
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.330
Now because he live in process and I learned, but

485
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.620
I can't anymore. So that's why I left. I mean, but some,

486
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.930
he still in my corner when I fight, I just come, you know,

487
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.660
but I don't train any moments to me. So there's no one in Paris?

488
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:18.380
No, nor in Bordeaux that you can for me the best, the best, the best, uh,

489
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.610
Tryna the best school is in percentage,

490
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:26.611
the Queensbury gym and I never found another under the chin with that kind of

491
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:30.190
fluid. So I cannot train with any coach, you know,

492
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:33.790
and I just turned myself, my, my friend holds meets for me.

493
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.500
I trained with Valentino.

494
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:39.500
The conditioning training for me was more important than,

495
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.840
than the kickboxing. Everybody know to keep up. Now we know how to kickbox,

496
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.380
but the difference we will be make with the condition. For me,

497
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:49.970
it's interesting, you know, there's a thought,

498
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:54.971
there's a thought process that follows those lines in MMA and it's a Marvin

499
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.010
Marinovich and this guy nick curse on, and they've only trained a few fighters,

500
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.940
but they've had very high levels of success because of their conditioning.

501
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.520
And what they say is that you already know how to fight.

502
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.210
So just let's concentrate on the conditioning and gets your conditioning to a

503
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:15.860
super high level. And that when you're fighting, you can just go,

504
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.030
yeah, that's right. That's what I say. Everything. When I, when I am,

505
00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.280
I give advices to, to people, they say, what should I train these, this,

506
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.160
this technique? I said, listen, between two,

507
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.810
two fighters in the same level, the same experience.

508
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.600
What's gonna make the difference? The condition in the fight. You know,

509
00:33:36.601 --> 00:33:40.480
if you fight one, two, three rounds and then you fucked up, yeah,

510
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.580
they lose the fight. Right. If fight five rounds,

511
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.540
and even if you not good enough, uh,

512
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.040
technically you're gonna win the fight for sure, because you don't get tired.

513
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:54.080
Yeah, that's fine. Now,

514
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:57.290
another crazy thing about you that people might not know.

515
00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.740
It's like you're a comedian. Yeah, that's right. You're a stand up comedian,

516
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.510
which is hilarious before, but you,

517
00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:08.720
for you to be a world champion kickboxer and a stand up comedian,

518
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.380
that is a very unusual combination. That's right. Because first,

519
00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:15.890
my first dream and Dustin still,

520
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:19.280
my dream today is to become an actor, comedian.

521
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.870
And the before, before I started a combat sport. Yeah.

522
00:34:23.871 --> 00:34:27.950
I was doing standup. I was, uh, I was in high school also.

523
00:34:27.951 --> 00:34:32.260
I was learning, um, uh, committees and stuff, uh,

524
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.540
actor acting and I really, I really like it.

525
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:39.620
And then the come the compass boat and then I started to improve myself to

526
00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:43.100
become, yeah, more to fight, to fight the fight. And then I,

527
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.030
I studied a bit, uh, yeah. Stand up acting.

528
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.960
But three months ago I was a, I played in a small movie.

529
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.860
Short movie in France. Yeah. I played that. He's gonna,

530
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.790
he's gonna go out in the shoe and shoe few weeks.

531
00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.010
Now when you do stand up in Paris, are you working at comedy clubs?

532
00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:07.940
Like do they have comedy clubs in Paris? It's not in Paris.

533
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:12.620
A community club in the environment. In Bordeaux, yeah. I was very young. I was,

534
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.490
I used to be young, but I was, yeah, 18, 19.

535
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.890
And so Bordeaux has comedy clubs. Yes.

536
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.580
Coming to club and it's all obviously in French. In France. Of course. Yeah.

537
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:27.260
Not in English. Have you ever done comedy in English and never. Never. Oh yes.

538
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.600
One in the, I think you can find it in a neutral is uh,

539
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.440
I was um, I was teaching people how to cook out to go,

540
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.260
I have to cook a great the chicken. Yeah, I did it.

541
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.400
I did that with glory. I was promoting my, my, my,

542
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:49.410
my second fight against Nicola skin and I was trending in Belgium presales and I

543
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:53.340
did a, I did it [inaudible] one find it on youtube.

544
00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.030
So is that something that you would think of doing once you retire from

545
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.850
fighting? Yeah, that's, I really want to do it. That's my first, my first, um,

546
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.930
my first way. That's what I really,

547
00:36:03.931 --> 00:36:08.400
really want to do in from the top of my bottom of UN in the top of my heart

548
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.800
does, that's what I want to become because I read that you,

549
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:14.940
if you had to choose between being a famous comedian or a famous fighter,

550
00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:18.150
you would choose to be a famous comedian. Yeah. For Shelley. Yeah. Really.

551
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.840
But that's so crazy when you see how good you are fighting yet. You know,

552
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:26.400
people, people doesn't believe me when I say that, but if,

553
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.190
if I didn't find the, uh,

554
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:34.110
if kickboxing didn't found me because I think I didn't find,

555
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.830
I didn't found kickboxing, kickboxing, finding me if he works in the, uh,

556
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.560
never find me, I will follow my, my way in a, in comedy stuff. Yeah,

557
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.510
yeah, for sure. And so now I'm good and keep working, so I just follow myself.

558
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.680
Well, you better than good. Now how did you become,

559
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:56.940
how did check boxing find you? You said found you? Because I was,

560
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.270
I was 16, so 10 years ago I was 16. And, uh,

561
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.650
I was playing soccer, I was playing soccer and uh, I wasn't that good.

562
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.160
I was, yeah, just, I was just fast, you know,

563
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.770
five and in front of the girl I was falling. No, I wasn't that good, you know?

564
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.780
And um, one,

565
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.560
one day my cousin just just call me and say, hey,

566
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.330
in front of the house, in the neighborhood, there is a gym, uh,

567
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.490
boxing is there. Eh, I thought, I thought, I thought that was boxing.

568
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:37.290
Like Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. I said, yeah, if yes, but so what?

569
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.020
He said, yeah, let's go try it. Yeah, it's going to be,

570
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.820
maybe it's going to be funny. You know, I saw,

571
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:46.890
I saw people goes out from there. The, the how, the how you,

572
00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.240
how you call black guy. He says it should be funny. I said, okay,

573
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:54.960
once we are going to do we going to go there. So after my, uh,

574
00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.460
my soccer training, I went there once I tried and I,

575
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:04.290
I discovered that it was full contact with legs with high kick.

576
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:07.740
Middle Cake was a little bit strange, but I just follow,

577
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.040
I just trained getting better and better and just, I like it.

578
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.390
So immediately like you caught the guy immediately after my first training,

579
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:17.610
I went there and you know that, that I, you know,

580
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:22.440
that my mother was against that. Uh, she said, no, no, no,

581
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:26.550
I don't want you to, to, to fight. I don't want you to train a boxing.

582
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.310
I don't want any boxing in this house. I was, I cry when the, when she,

583
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.080
she say that because I really like a full contact number spot.

584
00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:36.700
So I cry when I,

585
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:41.320
when she told me that and I was training but she doesn't, she,

586
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:45.970
she doesn't know that. She doesn't know the secret. Yeah. Secret was secret.

587
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:51.100
How old were you when you had your first fight? My first 17. 17 didn't know.

588
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.550
She didn't know. No. So this was for contact or contact,

589
00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.320
which may be three years full contact. And then I kicked my peak.

590
00:38:58.321 --> 00:39:02.830
Let's explain it. People don't know. Full contact is a no leg kicks. Yeah.

591
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:07.660
No. FullContact is no low kicks. Low kicks. Yeah, yeah,

592
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:12.660
yeah. Okay. Kick the legs. Yeah. Lonely. Immediate kinks. Yeah.

593
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.510
You guys have different terms. It's called low kick and yeah,

594
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.130
we call it leg kick. Leg Kicks. Yeah. But low kicks is crazy low. Kicks it.

595
00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:22.390
Correct. So, uh, you just can't kick the likes,

596
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:25.690
which is interesting cause that's very effective and you're very good at that.

597
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.530
Yeah. It's a big part of your game right now. So,

598
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:34.710
but I'm better in boxing because I started with this full contact and it's a

599
00:39:35.091 --> 00:39:39.370
little bit, it's a little bit similar than, than boxing. The way you move,

600
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.470
the way you fight because no low kick, no leg kicks. Right. So yeah,

601
00:39:44.471 --> 00:39:49.180
he's a little bit stiff. When I was boxing and when I was training for contact,

602
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.190
I was watching a lot of Muhammad Ali. So yeah,

603
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.000
little movements. Yeah, I'm better in the, in the,

604
00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.010
in boxing when I fight kickbox when did your mom find out?

605
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.530
After, after one year after my first fight.

606
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.060
She was like, well, when, what was your, I say, no,

607
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:14.890
it was a in the soccer training and she said, why do you have gloves and say,

608
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:18.520
oh, sometime I go to watch boxing and she say,

609
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.600
I told you I don't want you to watch and to to, to fight. I said, no, I do.

610
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.380
I'm don't. I know I'm not training, just watching. She said, no,

611
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:31.180
I don't want it. And every day I just went to the train to train,

612
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:35.200
to train and the, she doesn't see me with any,

613
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:39.300
a black guy or things like that. So one day she was very,

614
00:40:39.301 --> 00:40:42.070
very tired and I say, yeah, uh, mom, listen.

615
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.360
I went to the boxing training and she was like, okay.

616
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.440
And then the day after I wanted the boxing training. So I was like, okay.

617
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.600
I think because she didn't see me with any black eyes. That's,

618
00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.090
that's why she was scared first. Yeah. And then she,

619
00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:04.080
she just accept the, the thing because I make 'em infringed.

620
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:08.680
Recall that fussing, I just, I just went to the training like, fuck it.

621
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:13.550
I like it. So he do it. And today, what do say in France? Forcing, forcing,

622
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.370
yeah. Forcing. Like we just, uh, we just go, Eh, you don't care.

623
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.050
You don't care if someone, they say don't do that. It's like, fuck yeah,

624
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.380
like four kids. And uh, let me show you a video of my mom.

625
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.350
So it's very funny because sometimes I send her this video, I say, look at you,

626
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.190
<v 2>look at you. You, you didn't want me to,</v>

627
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.460
to fight for us and now look at you now. She's very excited. Yeah. Well,

628
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.840
I mean she must be happy that you do that now. Now that you're a world champion.

629
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.300
Yeah. She's really to watch you on television. That's my motivation. My mom, oh,

630
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:53.760
that's beautiful for me is everything. If I come control my stories is,

631
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.590
is amazing. My mom did everything for my sister and me.

632
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.300
<v 3>[inaudible] look at your mom.</v>

633
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.360
Oh, that's amazing. Yeah.

634
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.030
<v 2>Wow. That's cool.</v>

635
00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.580
<v 3>Incredible man. Um, man,</v>

636
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.100
that's amazing. That's amazing. And though she's like that,

637
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:23.470
<v 2>that's gotta be so crazy. Imagine if you're a mother, you give birth to a boy,</v>

638
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.170
you give birth to a child and then you grow that.

639
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.410
They raise that child and then you watch that child become a world champion.

640
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.670
I must be crazy. Crazy.

641
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:35.080
It'd be maybe four people up

642
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:41.320
and she's like, and when I, when I, sometimes when I talk, cause my mother,

643
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.790
I said, listen, I really, I do my best in the gym.

644
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:50.410
I train every day other than how to, to,

645
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.910
um, uh, to, to knock people out.

646
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.940
And I really hope that I will never get knock out cause I don't want you to see

647
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:05.080
to see me. Yeah. Fall down. You know, I don't, I don't want her to feel this,

648
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.090
this kind of ambition or I just want her to be, to be happy that I won.

649
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.040
So he trained very hard. So yeah, there it is. We'll watch the video here. Yeah.

650
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:19.520
That is an amazing video. And you know the,

651
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.950
the woman she's hugging, she doesn't even know her.

652
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.410
It's crazy. Your last fight against the, how do you say his name? Nabi.

653
00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:32.770
Have I live Nivea. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker, man. He's very good.

654
00:43:32.771 --> 00:43:36.160
And for you to knock him out like that, the way you, nobody knock him out,

655
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.850
you know, it's very tricky. Yeah. He's tricky. Sneaky. Yeah.

656
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.790
That guy fights very technical. Yeah.

657
00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.040
But I was so focused on that fight because, did you ever see Robin Bruh?

658
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.590
You know who Robin black as? No. Robin black is a friend of mine and he,

659
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.300
he breaks down fights.

660
00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.650
He talks about like what someone did that works so well.

661
00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.420
The guy who say enjoyed the acidity. My friends. Yes, yes, yes.

662
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:05.500
That's exactly right. So immediately he's famous for saying bink, bink.

663
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.890
I know the guy. Yeah. I love that guy. He's a good friend of mine. But uh,

664
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.330
he did a breakdown of your fight,

665
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.810
the way you set up that right hand on the way knocked him out. It's very cool.

666
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.370
It's very cool to see that getting more and more attention not be have is very

667
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:26.290
good man. So for you to set him up like that to him, second room, I say,

668
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.510
I say before the fire, I said I wouldn't look him up.

669
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.280
I had to stick around cause the second room, the first for me is just warming

670
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.040
<v 1>up. And then the second one I feel very good.</v>

671
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.030
But it's the most dangerous for a run when you fight against me because the

672
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:43.020
second one I'm wrong. You know, I just [inaudible] just ready. Yeah. Yeah.

673
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.620
I'm ready for everything. So is, he's a very good fighter.

674
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.790
You set a trap for him though. A trap. Yeah. The way you set that right hand up.

675
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For me. I just follow my, you know, my,

676
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.010
my plan, you know, I just want to fight. I,

677
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.560
I didn't want him to read my Im my move, my movements. Yeah.

678
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.250
So he just,

679
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.480
the Kale came before that knees before that new,

680
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:12.720
because I touch him with the left hook and the right hook.

681
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.900
It was wobbly on his, on his legs. And then uh, yeah,

682
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:21.570
he just throw a knee and boom. Yeah. So the finish, that was very impressive.

683
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.510
Very impressive to knock that guy out. And that's has to be,

684
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.240
so as you're looking at your career now,

685
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.720
and you're saying that there's no one else to beat after you knock out a guy,

686
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:35.700
like not be out, does that make it harder for you to get motivated? No,

687
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.530
because for me it's more when fights more than I'm getting to the top of the

688
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:42.790
world, like UFC champ and afterwards,

689
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.430
maybe after the UFC belt I will have another, I don't know, maybe a

690
00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.300
chance. Western, I don't know. I slipped. That's hilarious. That's crazy. No,

691
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:58.640
for me, I still get, because if I, now I'm to champs,

692
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.360
so if I lose my, my, my title defense now I would go, I will go down.

693
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:06.900
So I need to keep the same, same level yet at the same level.

694
00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:09.990
So that's what motivated, motivated me. Yeah.

695
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.650
So when you were telling me that you do a strength and conditioning every day,

696
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.150
like what kind of stuff are you doing today?

697
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.350
Like we talk today and you said that you were running on the beach. Yeah.

698
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.040
So today I wanted to train first like, um, it's not an, it's not strange,

699
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:25.080
but is, uh, like, um,

700
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.820
I don't know how to call that in English, but uh,

701
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.420
it's like conditioning, uh,

702
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:37.500
conditioning training we want to do. And I think that's what we will do after.

703
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.760
And conditioning with them as the bike

704
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.530
clothes are amazing. Also, I'm also running, I saw your, your,

705
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.510
your different stuff also running and he's like, he's treating me,

706
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:55.800
um, the same way I have to, I have to fill the same thing.

707
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.760
I feel inside the cage, inside the ring. So that, that's,

708
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.730
that's the conditioning, uh, training. So today was a relaxed run,

709
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.510
relaxed running. And yet tonight is going to be harder, you know,

710
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.150
where are you training tonight? Tonight?

711
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:13.440
I think I will train right after the show. Uh, in your gym. All right. Yeah.

712
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.220
And I gotta take a picture. That's my gym.

713
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.410
So I think I chained there because you have there, your gym is so, so fully,

714
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:27.000
so complete, so exhaustive. So cool. I like it. So you'll see.

715
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.950
How are we going to train? I cannot talk about a, you know,

716
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.870
<v 2>I'm like, you're the team. Yeah, you're the coach. Tell me what I do pushups.</v>

717
00:47:34.871 --> 00:47:39.250
Okay. I just do it. You just do it. Sometime I ask a question like, uh,

718
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.640
when I'm in the K in the ring, why do I need to do that?

719
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:47.300
And then he explained to me and then I, okay, let's go. But, uh, no,

720
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.120
I can talk about, uh, exactly the, the, the, the training, what does that mean?

721
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.250
So he has, you do a lot of cardio exercises, but I just want him to,

722
00:47:57.251 --> 00:48:00.370
yeah, that's what I say. Before we started training camp, I say, Hey,

723
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.120
I want my [inaudible] better than never and I want,

724
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.830
I keep my poor even improved my power. He say, I catch you and then we go.

725
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.990
So is there a lot of weightlifting as well? No. No. Not a lot.

726
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.900
We need to maybe twice a week we do that.

727
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:22.150
Very poor training twice a week. Legs and upper body.

728
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.310
And then what kind of weightlifting are you talking about?

729
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:27.670
Like Olympic style tree, like kettlebells, how you,

730
00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:31.060
how you conduct and squat,

731
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:35.530
squats and deadlifts, deadlift, yens presses,

732
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:40.360
stuff like that. Not Presses, but, uh, we do it any lateral,

733
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:45.100
like one legs. One leg. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's what it is already doing. Yeah.

734
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:49.690
So I like Rosarito. So you use kettlebells?

735
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.510
I hate kettlebells. Behave. Yeah, that hurt me. Yeah.

736
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.610
I don't like the feeling and I have big hands, so my,

737
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.330
both of my hands inside the Kettlebells, I feel like, oh,

738
00:49:01.331 --> 00:49:05.650
for swings and swings. Yeah. Well as you say, if you learn how to do correctly,

739
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:09.070
it doesn't hurt as much. Yeah. You just gotta learn how to swing it through.

740
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.610
When I put it through. When he comes here. That's hurt me a lot. Yeah.

741
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.760
Yeah. We got to learn how to just rotate it through. Maybe as you do it,

742
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:22.060
you rotate it through. Maybe I don't have the technique to calculate it is,

743
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.390
did you ever get a good kettlebell instructor to show you the Kettlebell answer

744
00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.770
to? Yeah. I even don't know that. I haven't done their thing.

745
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.220
I could show you a little bit, I'm not qualified to really show you,

746
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:36.940
but a really good kettlebell instructor. It's a technique as you're swinging,

747
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:40.930
like if you're like cleans clean as you're doing it,

748
00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:43.600
you're just sort of punching through. A lot of people.

749
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:47.230
They lift it up and it just, Oh yeah. You don't want that.

750
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:50.740
You want to control the Kettlebell I got. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.970
I'll show you some stuff. I, I'm a Kettlebell Fan.

752
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.540
I love them. Yeah, but obviously you see all, all the machines.

753
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:03.390
I swear I saw the season like at the band. She's all the monkey.

754
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:07.750
Oh yeah. Yeah. We have a big foot. I have an alien.

755
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:11.890
I have gorillas. I have a chimp tacos. Yeah.

756
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:15.010
Just see the big foot one. That's the biggest one. That's fucking huge.

757
00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:18.520
Big Floats. One's like, yeah, that's, I don't know how many kilograms that is.

758
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:23.770
I still, it's like, yeah we got star wars ones. Yeah, we got a Darth Vader.

759
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.360
Yeah, that was, those are all from on it.

760
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.580
We have a bunch of cool looking kettlebells,

761
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:33.320
but just regular kettlebells are fine. Yeah, I'm a fan. I just think they're,

762
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.530
the great thing about kettlebells is they make you use your whole body,

763
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.130
make use everything all at once. Not like him.

764
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.900
No regular weight right now. Like isolation exercises. Yes.

765
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:48.040
Do you do battle ropes? Do you do that? [inaudible] yeah,

766
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.390
I like it the most that I like is the, you know the,

767
00:50:52.391 --> 00:50:56.420
the things where you run, but he's done the electric. She just running. Yes.

768
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:59.750
We have one of those [inaudible] that's from the same assault bike company.

769
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:03.320
You said it's called the air runner. Assault air runner. Yeah.

770
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:04.183
That thing is the shit

771
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.580
on 13% harder than regular running. Oh yeah. I felt, yeah, cause you're,

772
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.710
you're forcing your footsteps. That's what I said.

773
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:18.950
The volunteer because he wrote me a program like 400 Mitha should do this for a

774
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.720
hundred minutes at 800. I was like, he's fucking difficult than decent machine.

775
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.190
It was like maybe it was [inaudible] it was good. God love her. She is hard.

776
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:32.580
Yeah. Very good. What about the versa climber? You ever used that one of visit?

777
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.610
That's the one like Oh yeah, I use it once. Oh that's hard.

778
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:42.810
I got that out there. Yeah. Yeah. For homes. Yeah. No that's amazing.

779
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:45.770
What a code. You as good or so. Yeah.

780
00:51:45.771 --> 00:51:48.140
It's amazing how many different machines there are.

781
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.580
You could get your cardio on.

782
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:53.420
So the beautiful thing about it is I like it cause it's variety. Yeah. You know,

783
00:51:53.421 --> 00:51:57.290
different things all the time. Force your body adapt to different things.

784
00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.950
My best training, what I like to do is uh, to run,

785
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.720
but on stage and stairs, yes. That's the training I prefer. Yeah.

786
00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:10.280
I do too. Once a week. Yeah. Once a week. Every Thursday morning.

787
00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:14.740
That's the training I prefer because I have big legs and yeah. I uh,

788
00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.930
it's also not pounding too right. Cause you're pushing off. Yeah.

789
00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.260
You pushing slam. Then it's like when people,

790
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:24.710
I have friends that run on concrete, I'm like, oof. Yeah.

791
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:29.450
That fear bad for your knees. I can't be good. He's good for me. I like it.

792
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.520
The hills heel stairs. Yeah. I prefer, yeah, no.

793
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:38.060
Do you rock? You said you ran on the beach today. Do you have any,

794
00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:41.820
his board Bordeaux doesn't have beaches. Right. Nuts. Nothing.

795
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.470
[inaudible] the biggest to our fall from too far into it to fall. Yeah.

796
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.950
It's too fun to put trainings. That's a great way to run too though,

797
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:52.910
if you can run on sand. Yeah. And Sandy is very, it's very good for the code.

798
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:57.450
You and those four legs, you know, that's works out of missiles. Uh,

799
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.440
very deep. Even muscles. Yes. Yes.

800
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:04.370
Like now when you're training, are you doing strength and conditioning?

801
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.770
Are you using a heart rate monitor? Are you using, what's the brand of

802
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:14.640
Polo? Polo. Yeah, that's what I use. Yeah. Shortly. He was very famous and the,

803
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.870
it's especially for the trainer because I don't care, you know,

804
00:53:17.871 --> 00:53:21.670
he just look and make his concur is a mathematics.

805
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:26.040
So he keeps you at a certain heart rate. They want to keep me on that. Do you

806
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.460
<v 1>monitor your heart rate in terms of like when you wake up to make sure that</v>

807
00:53:29.461 --> 00:53:34.350
you're not overtrained? No, I never do that. No. No. Just I just go to training.

808
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.070
If I feel good, I go train. If I freestyle,

809
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.660
I got trained as a funny man.

810
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.980
Some so many elite fighters the same way I had Terrance Crawford here the other

811
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:48.210
day. Same thing. Yeah. Just go the train. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

812
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:52.530
I like whole school, old school things. I like also new school things like,

813
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:56.700
you know, Polo things, you know, I like those kind of new things.

814
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.020
But for me, the, yeah, the, the combat sport is,

815
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:06.360
it's a mind thing or so, you know, she don't get too much. Um,

816
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.420
how you say that too much. I like to technical. Yeah.

817
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:12.990
You just say you have to train twice a day, every morning, every everything.

818
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.820
Let's go, you feel tired. Let's go training. When I'm sick, like when I got,

819
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.890
I get a call, I just go running training and instead of people say, no,

820
00:54:22.891 --> 00:54:24.330
I'm tired, I don't want to train,

821
00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.590
I go training because I think the sport is the,

822
00:54:27.591 --> 00:54:31.770
the best medication in the world. That's what I think. Even when you're sick,

823
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.860
even I'm going to sick and that's, that's worked because when you say training,

824
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:39.450
you're not kicking out sparring, not spying, just running in the bag,

825
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.480
hit the bag and not sparring because spelling is then I will contaminate my ass,

826
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:49.770
my guy terminate them. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah. So when you say mentor,

827
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.960
um, do you use a mental coach? Do you have no, no,

828
00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:00.140
because I think some people need a mentor coach and some doesn't need for me,

829
00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:06.060
like my story is, uh, I think I have my,

830
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.140
of course I need a mental coach, but I think I am my own mental coach. Uh,

831
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.600
my story for me is, is a big motivation for me. So tell everybody your story.

832
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.980
It's like, it's fucking long. But I can tell a short story like,

833
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.660
like when I think about everything, I, I,

834
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:29.580
I went through in my life, I'm talking like I'm, I'm, I'm 55, but

835
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.990
you've had a lot happen. Yeah, of course.

836
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:38.520
I was born in Cameroon and then, uh,

837
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:42.990
my mom moved to Paris when I was eight. And then one hour,

838
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:48.090
uh, later I, uh, we went, my sister and I,

839
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.410
we went to Paris to follow my mum. And uh, yeah, we was living in, uh,

840
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:57.510
in a small apartment, you know, very small apartment, one room, you know,

841
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.690
no water. We, we, we was, uh,

842
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.580
we went to the, how you said the,

843
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:09.390
the restaurant to ask water with big bottle of water empty.

844
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:13.080
We went to restaurant to ask what, uh, you know, it was, yeah,

845
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:16.170
my mom went through for so many things.

846
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.610
When I think about everything we went through in and when I'm in inside the

847
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:24.880
locker room, uh, I'm stressed, you know, uh, I'm nervous.

848
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:30.070
I just think about it and I say, Hey, listen, look where you are now.

849
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.990
You train for that, you train for this, you train for five.

850
00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.220
Everybody waiting for you. Everybody is screaming, so don't get narrowed.

851
00:56:38.221 --> 00:56:42.700
This is nothing, you know, so just go and, and uh, yeah.

852
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:44.590
Do what you like to do. Fight,

853
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.720
overcoming hardship a lot of times is the best teacher. Yeah, that's right.

854
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.340
So you know where you came from.

855
00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:54.860
So you know the hardships and I know where I want to go, when I want,

856
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:58.460
where I want to land. So for me it's, um,

857
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:03.790
before I fight a Niko skin, I used to get nervous in the locker and I say,

858
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:04.620
hey,

859
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:09.080
<v 2>you want to find any holes skin and are you nervous for this guy? Come on.</v>

860
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:12.820
I know it is funny. It's like you get what you ask for. Yeah.

861
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.290
But while you're coming up, you're like, oh, I want to fuck that guy out.

862
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:21.550
Then all of a sudden you're like, oh shit. Yeah, no, he's fine. I was like,

863
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:26.480
man, this is the same with me. I talk a lot of shit on the Internet. Right?

864
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:32.090
And when I'm in the looking and I'm like, it's time.

865
00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.850
Why don't I talk all that shit? Why did I say that?

866
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:42.650
I remember that the fight against yet I make a poster on Internet with his head.

867
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:48.070
Like I ripped that off and I was like gonna that's what's going to happen on the

868
00:57:48.291 --> 00:57:52.220
during the fight. And he was like, no, I don't care about Internet.

869
00:57:52.221 --> 00:57:56.810
I don't care about Instagram. I don't care about dark. I would talk in the ring.

870
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:58.490
I was like Paul

871
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:05.000
[inaudible] and during the fight it was in front of me and the referee was like,

872
00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.330
check to Kansas for what if we'll if you like. He was like,

873
00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.730
he wouldn't like to his corner like let's go. I want to fuck him up. And uh,

874
00:58:13.731 --> 00:58:18.500
yeah, it was like, oh you talk, you talk shit, but now you have to back it up.

875
00:58:18.501 --> 00:58:19.670
So I remember that fight.

876
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:23.390
It was very interesting cause I'm a big Nikki hold skin fan as well during the

877
00:58:23.391 --> 00:58:27.350
collision. First one. Yeah, I remember that fight I was watching. I was like,

878
00:58:27.351 --> 00:58:29.390
wow, like this guy,

879
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:32.870
he's got his number like you buy that.

880
00:58:33.110 --> 00:58:36.770
By the time the fourth round came around I was like, you are,

881
00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:42.110
you're ahead on points. And it looked like you had his style figured out.

882
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:43.000
Yeah.

883
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.610
<v 1>Yeah, I was, this is, I think for me,</v>

884
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:49.480
this is one of my best fights in the my best fight ever.

885
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.770
I was so small in this, in that fight. So yeah,

886
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.190
you're small in that fight. In what way? What do you say?

887
00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.520
You said you were so small in that fight now. I said I was smart

888
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.000
because I didn't want to knock him out. I said I will knock him out.

889
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:11.770
But that was fake. Yeah. This was only a strategy, so I know I,

890
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:16.030
I will not, I will not knock him out because he's so strong. He's so smart.

891
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:20.830
And he's a counter the counter fighter. So yeah. I was very, very smart.

892
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.060
Make my ponds and then, yeah,

893
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:28.010
after tree fight against 'em tree fight after Nikki. Yeah.

894
00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:31.640
People was calling me a runner because I was making a lot of points and,

895
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:36.500
and then now they're calling me in the number one powerful Paul in glory.

896
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.790
Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Nicki twice, twice. When did you find me again?

897
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.990
When was the second time I fought Nicki and then I fought Congo and then I

898
00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:48.470
fought Nicki again and he beat him again. Yeah. Yeah. Point.

899
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:51.830
And after the fight, I remember I say you run too much.

900
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.180
I say respect my style. I respect your styles, but my style,

901
00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.580
do you think you'd find them differently now? Mm,

902
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:04.130
yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think if I fight Nikki,

903
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.170
like tomorrow I will fail five different.

904
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:10.670
I will go for the knockout this time because I'm not the same fight as before.

905
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.450
So I think I was six, six. I will knock him out.

906
01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.360
He's over in one I've seen now. Yeah.

907
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:22.390
Which is interesting cause they fight in a cage. Gambit little gloves too.

908
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:26.610
Yeah. No. Oh he's using boy time. Weta is sometime if I little glow,

909
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.490
they mix it up a lot of uh, a lot of different rules.

910
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:35.190
Yet when he knocked out cosmo Alexander dolls on [inaudible] was a crazy,

911
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.450
that was a crazy knock out. That shows you how good he is.

912
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.830
And then he see cosmo Alexander fuck up sage north cod.

913
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:47.570
And you realize how good cosmo was then. You see how bad Nicky beat up cosmo?

914
01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:52.130
Yeah, Nikki's good. Yeah, it's very good. I like, you know, be before,

915
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.520
before I find Nikki, it was one of my, my, yeah,

916
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.100
my best fighter and I ever like,

917
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.690
because when I was watching him against Kevin Gadgets, the French fighter,

918
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:07.820
when I watch him against Joseph Walton. Amy, yeah. I was like, damn,

919
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:11.570
this is fucking fucking strong Raymond Daniels.

920
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.060
When he beat [inaudible] I was like, because for me just hunting,

921
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.030
it's not a, it's not an easy fight or any up and then he's very strong.

922
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:24.440
So they stopped him in the last round two with a right hook or maybe in left

923
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:28.520
hook [inaudible] who's a really good fighter. He got a little carried away,

924
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.730
was trying to trade with them and the end of the fight and then yeah,

925
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:35.900
Nicky caught him. I was like, I really, really liked this file.

926
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.700
And then when I, I,

927
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.440
when I received that email that I will face Nikos can, I was like

928
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:49.250
[inaudible] skin and you were only 24 at the time. Like Holy Shit, it's here.

929
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.990
Yeah. And I did. I didn't even have a strength and conditioning coach.

930
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:58.580
No. Only kickboxer, only Sameer boxing. And now as doing my,

931
01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:03.590
my shit alone, running in the morning and just train by myself.

932
01:02:03.591 --> 01:02:04.281
What kind of kick butt?

933
01:02:04.281 --> 01:02:08.330
What kind of strength conditioning were you doing other than running pushups,

934
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.100
running some crossfit, but nothing like you're doing now. No, no, no.

935
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.670
I was doing things I was watching on youtube, you know,

936
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.510
so it was really crazy world champion watching stuff on youtube and learning.

937
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.600
It's great. What do we do with like John Jones? Uh, before when he started,

938
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.143
I heard about him,

939
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:32.250
he was saying that he saw the MMA watching a fights on a,

940
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.800
on youtube. Sure. Yeah. Cause you'd try moves out fights. Yeah.

941
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:40.530
So yeah, that's on some people just talented. Yeah.

942
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:45.930
Some people find a way. Now when you think about those fights,

943
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:48.180
like, and how important those fights were to you,

944
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.280
especially the Nikki Holtz can, when you look back,

945
01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.110
it's gotta be kind of a crazy feeling that, that, that sort of,

946
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.290
that made your career that Nikki host can fight, particularly the first one.

947
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.350
Right. Because, you know,

948
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.490
my father was a little bit hilarious because the story of death fight,

949
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:07.080
uh,

950
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.970
I was the coal main event and I think that fight was,

951
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.310
was made for Niki owners can, you know,

952
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.340
because I had only three fights in Rory and the pull me a title shot as I was

953
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:24.630
edited a bit and entertaining and uh, I made pasta and things like that.

954
01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.180
They say, okay, it's going to be a good, good show,

955
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.050
but that's going to be a fight for Nicki. You know, for sure.

956
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:33.290
I think they say to themselves, nick,

957
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.900
you're going to win the fight because it's undefeated. You know,

958
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:40.530
nobody could beat him. You're gonna win the fight. And uh, yeah.

959
01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.160
Is the fight just before by the Varian Rico fights?

960
01:03:44.161 --> 01:03:47.760
So a lot of eyes was, uh, on,

961
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:52.320
so I just created the surprise and the, yeah, I just surprised everybody.

962
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:57.480
And uh, that's why I have a lot of friends in Morocco because the,

963
01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:01.230
there was waiting for better every fight and they sh they saw me.

964
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.490
So it was like I received a lot of beside from Morocco, like, oh my brother,

965
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:10.920
I really like your style. You funny and uh, yeah. And Moroccans love fights.

966
01:04:10.921 --> 01:04:14.290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was wild people. I liked American, uh,

967
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.160
American fans and Moroccan people because I yeah.

968
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.640
Went to Purcell during two years in presales.

969
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:23.370
A lot of American people in Holland also. I love American people.

970
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.730
Do you think you'll be fighting on the next Rico bought or horrified?

971
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.750
It seems like you think so? Yeah. It seems like when is that?

972
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:35.310
Because before that there is a December, December before December.

973
01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.920
There was two events in the, in the,

974
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.920
in October. And uh, they are, they're almost booked.

975
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:47.010
So I think for me it's going to be December.

976
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.570
It's going to be a good thing cause I like better area. Yes. And uh, yeah,

977
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.030
to fight in the same court. This is my third time.

978
01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:56.910
I will fight in the same color. I same as bar.

979
01:04:57.510 --> 01:05:01.620
I'm very interested to see how he fights Rico in the second fight me to very,

980
01:05:01.621 --> 01:05:04.110
very interesting because good though. Very good.

981
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:09.460
So it's not crazy cardio for Chris [inaudible] and he moves like a,

982
01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:13.670
like a welterweight. Yes. When he fights, if I had like a worker,

983
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.400
it's not like a regular weight one. He beat everybody in every division.

984
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.790
<v 2>He beats everybody. Yeah. He told me that when he was training,</v>

985
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:25.630
when he was coming up, he was training with the light guys. Yeah. So he's like,

986
01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.220
you had to move. Yeah. He's like,

987
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:32.080
so he developed that cardio and that ability from training with guys like 180

988
01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:36.270
pounds. Yeah. Yeah. That's why for me and the fight he,

989
01:05:36.271 --> 01:05:40.710
he the way photo getting to Jamal, Ben said they go, yeah.

990
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.610
It was almost almost done about the festival the second, I don't remember.

991
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.900
It was almost done. And then they will knock him out back.

992
01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:53.320
And the last or the fourth month, the forefront, it was crazy. I was like, man,

993
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.370
this dude, this is a good champ. It was a rich him, but so smart.

994
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.460
It's very smart. But you know, I like, I really,

995
01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:02.710
I think people like butter already because,

996
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.830
because of everything he story because of the man, the bad boy. Yeah.

997
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:10.080
And then I just [inaudible] yeah, he's very strong and he's,

998
01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.190
it's really cool to watch. And uh, and when, when Buzzer Com,

999
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.310
when the, when the,

1000
01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:22.420
the speaker called [inaudible] and he comes in to him,

1001
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:24.590
the mood is just, you know, everybody is,

1002
01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:29.980
you can see the flash or ev of many phones in the outage and no, it's crazy.

1003
01:06:29.981 --> 01:06:33.890
It's very crazy feeling when, when Butler very fight, he's the most famous cat.

1004
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:38.110
He's the most famous cause bucks and he's a legend and he's not just a legend

1005
01:06:38.111 --> 01:06:40.930
because of his fighting, which has been, he's been an incredible fighter,

1006
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.470
but also just cause he's so crazy. Yeah. So much wild shit.

1007
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.560
He's always getting in trouble. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

1008
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.920
That's people love by the right because of the fighter,

1009
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.700
but also because of the bad boy. Yeah.

1010
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.180
It's funny fighters that get in trouble in Conor McGregor has been in a bunch of

1011
01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.680
trouble lately. Yeah. You know,

1012
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.980
some people are upset at them and some people are not and it's just,

1013
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:08.050
it's not good. You know, everything is not good. But he's a wild man. Wild Man.

1014
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:11.170
Do Wild Shit. Yeah. Not good to smack that guy at the bar though.

1015
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:15.310
I watched that again. I thought it was like a touch last time I talked about it.

1016
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:17.350
I thought he just sorta touched him in the head with his hand.

1017
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:21.710
I saw the video with a slab. It looks like almost like a punch. Yeah,

1018
01:07:21.711 --> 01:07:26.560
almost like a buzz. Yeah, he hit him. I misspoke. I thought he just,

1019
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:29.860
I basically thought he just touched him in the face because I watched it on my

1020
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:34.060
phone and it just wasn't that clear. No going gonna Watch on a computer.

1021
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:37.930
I was like, Damn. What does, what does it do you do that? I don't know.

1022
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.640
Maybe the guy said something really bad to him, but either one is a,

1023
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.040
is another guy, you know, you just, and you're a big star, so

1024
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.390
a guy at a bar doesn't want your whiskey with your as fuck.

1025
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.730
But he's all that the wild shit.

1026
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:54.470
Like grabbing that guy's phone and stomping on it. I saw that.

1027
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.730
This just a little too crazy. Just a little too crazy.

1028
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.070
Sometime I didn't understand. Maybe it was drunk. I don't know.

1029
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.100
Probably maybe something else. Yeah.

1030
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:08.020
All I can say nothing about it, but um, yeah,

1031
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:11.550
maybe it was drank. That's what I thought. At first I was like, he was drunk so,

1032
01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:16.760
but maybe in your team mate control you, you know Yo guy May. Got You.

1033
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.640
Yeah. Bikes. If you offer a man at a bar,

1034
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:22.160
a drink and he doesn't want it and you punch him in the head,

1035
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:27.470
definitely fuck it up. He's definitely making some mistakes,

1036
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.930
but I love watching him. Fight is a while, dude.

1037
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.790
It's amazing how many fans he has. Two,

1038
01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:35.300
I've never seen anything like it or one early on,

1039
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.790
early on in his career before he was a champion.

1040
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.310
I remember after the fight when you, when you slept guys,

1041
01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.210
you'll name keep you keep building up,

1042
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:48.920
but the problem with him is going to be guys like could be and he wants a

1043
01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:52.710
rematch with could be. I don't think so. I don't think could be.

1044
01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.550
He was kind of fired up. It can be fucked him up. Why would he fight him again?

1045
01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.950
That's right. I think money. Fight. Yeah.

1046
01:08:57.951 --> 01:09:01.310
I think the money fight fan him is Nate nasal fighting. Again,

1047
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.230
that's a big fight. But Nate,

1048
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.710
they're talking about Nate fighting Mossville doll, you know, he fights.

1049
01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:11.150
So Jorge Mazda doll, I think that fight is a, that's a huge fight as well.

1050
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:14.660
And you know, Connor may or may not ever fight again. Like who knows?

1051
01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.050
He says he's going to, but I, he does. Yeah. Maybe.

1052
01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.000
Maybe boy just, yeah, maybe [inaudible] has got a fight. Could be, you know,

1053
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:26.870
I mean that's next month. That's, that's the big fight. Right.

1054
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.400
And Khabib is the big, I mean Khabib is the only one undefeated in division.

1055
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.100
His wrestling is fucking terrifying. It gets people on the ground,

1056
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:38.660
just shit out of them. I see. More like Aka, it was just crazy.

1057
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.150
[inaudible] yeah, he's thought it. It's studying a combustible when he was,

1058
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:49.550
when he was kid. You ever see how they play basketball?

1059
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.920
So we'll Harris my friend will Harris productions.

1060
01:09:54.921 --> 01:09:56.060
He's been in here before as well.

1061
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.690
He filmed these guys playing basketball over there and you watch those watching

1062
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:04.520
that book guests and that after that video I just went to the youtube to watch

1063
01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:09.290
the video you was talking about and the, yeah, the bus could book crazy.

1064
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.890
It's crazy. The Western bus get play, wrestle basketball,

1065
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:14.500
what the fuck are you doing?

1066
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.130
And then get the guy in our rear naked choke and the guy

1067
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:24.380
who keeps going, you can't even tap like the whole thing. So like there,

1068
01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:26.900
there are hard people over there and man, they are hard people.

1069
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.600
I watched the buzzer they was looking about,

1070
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:32.930
he went there to film the Bib and yes he wouldn't yet.

1071
01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.680
What's will's very talented will Harris.

1072
01:10:36.681 --> 01:10:40.690
He does a great job of capturing these guys' stories and put it in.

1073
01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.650
He's a nice guys who people like him. So they're,

1074
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:46.990
they're loose and relaxed around and he's very talented as a filmmaker.

1075
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:50.210
So when he puts these, these pieces together, they're very impactful.

1076
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.110
And that fame is on the youtube. Yes, yes. All that stuff is on youtube.

1077
01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.950
What is this Conor McGregor to face? Floyd Mayweather in Japan. What

1078
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.970
<v 4>it is today. That, so this is, I just looked up his name,</v>

1079
01:11:00.971 --> 01:11:01.720
that's why I brought it up.

1080
01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.480
There's a game show they supposedly have signed to be on where they're going to

1081
01:11:04.481 --> 01:11:09.030
compete against each other and this says he signed or he's going to sign for

1082
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.900
report at $10 million to do it.

1083
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:14.130
Do a game show on contacts so it won't bring show

1084
01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.090
<v 2>break contract or anything. So he's gonna get that much money for that.</v>

1085
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:19.800
Like 10 million bucks for a game. So,

1086
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:24.710
well they paid Floyd $9 million to fight that, uh, t jumping up.

1087
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:28.860
He's supposed to be part of that too. Yeah. Tension. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1088
01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.760
Not as who cow, who's a bad motherfucker, but he's tiny,

1089
01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:36.660
so small and a lot of people thought that that fight was fixed with him and

1090
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:39.870
Floyd. I was like, no, like even good fun. Good.

1091
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.170
Like fight commentators thought that was fake. I was like,

1092
01:11:43.171 --> 01:11:47.280
watch it and watch it again. Doll first road, Dude.

1093
01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.270
Wait on your 20 pounds. He fights 126 pounds.

1094
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:55.770
Floyd beat the fuck out of him. He's so much bigger. Flay was so loose,

1095
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.190
you just walked in. Just clubbed him in the head. This is crazy.

1096
01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:03.460
When you fight frilly Marita, you missed train like a, like you ever did that?

1097
01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.250
Like they didn't even give him enough chance.

1098
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:08.140
Like the inflow was couple of months. Yes. Fetty yeah.

1099
01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:12.390
Well he didn't have to get in shape for that guy. Look fairly this way.

1100
01:12:12.391 --> 01:12:15.270
Bigger than him. Way Bigger. I mean Floyd is not a big man.

1101
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:18.330
It's way bigger than tension. Tension's tiny.

1102
01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:22.500
He's a tiny little as but against those other 120 pound guys,

1103
01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:27.160
he fucks those guys up. He's really very good. Very even kick boxing is very,

1104
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.510
very, very, very interesting to win the fight. He does like wild shit,

1105
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.780
like weird spinning kicks and stuff like his fight of very good like my second

1106
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.460
Dorio so I'm sure one of my favorite fighter in Japan. Independence. Yes.

1107
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.270
And then tweens Bruzzo so a Europe up, we rub it and the other guy in the norm,

1108
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:50.510
it's damaging to tensions legacy because everybody thought he was a joke after

1109
01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:55.150
Floyd. Even if he left it,

1110
01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:59.010
Floyd let him kick it. Would it be a different fight? That's what I was hoping.

1111
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.200
I was hoping when they were there talking about a fight, I was like,

1112
01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:03.240
is this going to be a, a kickboxing fight?

1113
01:13:03.241 --> 01:13:06.570
Like maybe Floyd be so crazy that he said, go ahead and kick.

1114
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:10.130
Let's see what's up. Fuck his legs off course.

1115
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.720
There's only been a few, a world champion boxers. Uh, Vince Phillips,

1116
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.600
remember when he fought? He fought in Japan. He fought, uh,

1117
01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.980
Masato Masako my southern fucked his legs off whack.

1118
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:28.200
This guy was a book. So yes. World champion. Cool. Vince Phillips. Yeah. See,

1119
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:32.610
pull that up. Vince Phillips versus Masato and Vince was like,

1120
01:13:32.611 --> 01:13:37.020
at the end of his career, he's like 40 is Clinogen Vince fitted. Ah,

1121
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.190
I think he's American. I, he's American. Um, and um,

1122
01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:46.050
Masako just fucked his legs up. Dan kicked his legs out from under him. Friends,

1123
01:13:46.051 --> 01:13:48.180
both of them remember friends. Both that he fought Tyson.

1124
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:52.980
There is Vince Phillips and you know, Vince was just,

1125
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.340
it was, it was a fight was just a terrible idea.

1126
01:13:56.341 --> 01:14:01.050
And he's fighting barefoot and I mean, he really should've fought with shoes on.

1127
01:14:01.051 --> 01:14:03.300
Just said, I'm not going to kick cause he wasn't gonna kick anyway,

1128
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:05.430
but Masato just fucked those legs up.

1129
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:10.920
You didn't train like a kickboxer Huh? Just went to the phone, man.

1130
01:14:10.921 --> 01:14:15.130
I know because look, he's getting lit up. Shannon Briggs did too.

1131
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:17.560
Shannon Shannon the cannon, he went over there and he f Oh,

1132
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.910
see he's already done his Galen, um, I think it was k one. Yes.

1133
01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:22.910
They,

1134
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:27.910
I mean they basically just set it up so making his leg Masato just foxes legs

1135
01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.490
up, kicked into his arms and everything. I mean,

1136
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:34.480
Masako barely tried to box with them and look and he's already done.

1137
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.330
He can't even punch anymore. His arms are fucked up.

1138
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:42.400
And then Masato is trying to Niamh. I mean, he's fucking those legs up, man.

1139
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.560
It's a like a master class in how to fuck up a a world class boxer with kicks.

1140
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.130
See, look, Masako is dirty. He's getting them to bite those faints. Like,

1141
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:53.830
look at that leg kick right there. Ooh. You know, he's done.

1142
01:14:53.831 --> 01:14:56.050
His leg is toast right now. He could barely walk.

1143
01:14:56.051 --> 01:14:58.900
Like we were always trying to walk around and he's just hanging in there,

1144
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:03.100
hanging in there. I can't, yeah, just there it is. There it is.

1145
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.710
There it is. Yeah. He's fucked. Like he's an agony. You can boom.

1146
01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:12.430
Yeah, a book again, the kickbox and know you can't, it's amazing.

1147
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.710
And people just don't know. They really don't know.

1148
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.480
They don't know what it feels like to be like kicked,

1149
01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.710
especially by a guy like you.

1150
01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.910
Even the kickboxer even me when I get a low kick,

1151
01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:25.210
you crazy. Even the first round in the,

1152
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:30.100
in the ring because you're in the locker room, you're just running up, you know,

1153
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:34.900
and yeah. But when you inside ring punches and kick is,

1154
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:39.330
you feel me? I don't know. Maybe twice, 10 times more than the,

1155
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:42.960
in the gym. It's not the same like a spring and a fight his,

1156
01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:48.220
it's not really the same. No cause of, yeah, the pressure, the light, the,

1157
01:15:48.221 --> 01:15:52.840
the, the, yeah. Everything is different. Charming. You know, everything.

1158
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:57.470
Even the, the, the smell of, of your, your opening and buddy.

1159
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.100
Some people don't watch just so they stink when they fight. They like to do it.

1160
01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:06.100
Matt Lindland apparently was famous for that and he used to wrestle that way.

1161
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.120
He used to not not wash himself and then like we'd guys would fight on.

1162
01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:14.070
They'd be like, what the fuck? One of them, one of my left upland,

1163
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:19.060
he was thinking us, fuck. I can say he can't say his name.

1164
01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.200
He wasn't Gloria. I was like damn I the first one that he clinched me.

1165
01:16:23.201 --> 01:16:26.830
I was like [inaudible] crazy.

1166
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:31.060
You think they do that on purpose? No, I don't think so. Well it's a good move.

1167
01:16:31.061 --> 01:16:33.430
I don't think it fuck with your head a little bit.

1168
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:36.760
I was like [inaudible] think

1169
01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:42.090
I can be a good move to smell really bad. Yeah.

1170
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.620
Maybe guys wouldn't want to have anything to do with you cause I don't think

1171
01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:48.220
they test for that. Sometimes people put ty or on the gloves.

1172
01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.520
Oh I had this one time when I fought in the friends and the final of the

1173
01:16:54.941 --> 01:16:58.960
tournament I was after the first one I was, my skin was burning.

1174
01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:02.500
I was like Blah. Seems like somebody put me, you know,

1175
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:07.030
tight all on the face and get in your eyes. Yeah.

1176
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:10.010
And after the fight, my coach told me Creamy, you know

1177
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.080
<v 1>this, that team used to do that.</v>

1178
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:16.610
They put on their gloves for the first round and then they just punched you on

1179
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:20.860
the, on the face, on your eyes. They just clean shoe. And uh,

1180
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:24.340
after the first one you fucked up. Like, that's terrible. It's crazy.

1181
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:28.250
I don't know how people can do that, if you will. Even if she been in the fight,

1182
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.630
they don't test for that.

1183
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:33.020
They don't check to make sure sometimes the referee smell the gloss, you know,

1184
01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.810
the whole before. It's a small organization.

1185
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:40.670
It's not like glory you can do in glory, you know? Did you ever find more ties?

1186
01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:43.950
Well, I fought two times. Yeah.

1187
01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.440
And with errors two times two k o did you fight the same way?

1188
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:52.970
Your same style with a lot of movement and a lot of movement. Yes. But was, uh,

1189
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.330
was, yeah. [inaudible] first at the first round. Yeah.

1190
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.570
As I said before, I used to kill people first one I didn't care about.

1191
01:18:03.170 --> 01:18:06.800
I just go boom, boom, boom, kill, kill, kill before Gloria.

1192
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:11.690
Because now grow is high level that fighters, it's not easy to knock them out.

1193
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.940
Who Do you, uh,

1194
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:16.670
who do you think like the best fighters in glory outside of here?

1195
01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.700
Outside of me. You enjoy watching? If Nicaea was still there,

1196
01:18:22.701 --> 01:18:27.590
I would say Nikki, but as nick is not anymore, uh,

1197
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:31.040
which fight I like to Boyd is gone.

1198
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:35.670
Also Rubin when Huisman is really like he's going to fight MMA. Yeah.

1199
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.520
His guy. He's training in Florida with Henry Hoofed. Oh yeah, yeah. In 14.

1200
01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:44.960
And that's when he told me. Yeah. But now as the rubbing his gun,

1201
01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:50.420
a guy I like to watch fight. Um, yeah.

1202
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:55.670
Instead of bothering me but already don't fight the often.

1203
01:18:55.671 --> 01:19:00.050
Yeah. I don't know. There are many fighter I likes.

1204
01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:01.700
So, um,

1205
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:05.570
so we can look forward to fighting against some time around December hopefully.

1206
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:10.730
Yeah. And then yeah, when you do decide to come to the UFC,

1207
01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:14.630
please come back and we'll talk about it and we'll, we'll make an announcement.

1208
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.870
We'll make a big deal out of it. What do you mean? I want,

1209
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:22.290
when you do fight in the UFC, you leave glory. You want [inaudible].

1210
01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:24.650
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1211
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.420
That's a big deal to have a guy like you world champion kickboxer make it,

1212
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:33.170
make it to the UFC. That'd be fantastic. That's one of my, yeah, my big ring.

1213
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:37.340
If, if I had Dana white in front of me right now, I could hook that up.

1214
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:42.980
I would say, Hey Dan, I was up. So you trust the chimp now, right?

1215
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.880
You Trust Camaro's Mana, you trust your fighter, right?

1216
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.760
I'm the best. I'm the best in kickboxing.

1217
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:54.820
I'm the best in combat sport and I can beat your champ and I can became,

1218
01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.070
become your next champ. I'm the future. You know, I'm 26.

1219
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.490
All those people in, in welterweight division, um,

1220
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:07.890
hold off to watch.

1221
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.590
<v 2>So yeah, I'm the future and I,</v>

1222
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.710
I really think I gonna I gonna beat anybody in the division.

1223
01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.870
Well, there's guys that you're gonna have to fight first.

1224
01:20:18.930 --> 01:20:21.990
I'm just going to be honest with you. They're not gonna give you a title shot.

1225
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.770
They don't want to see you fight against a good fighter.

1226
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.730
But they could give you a fight against a top 10 contender. Yeah.

1227
01:20:30.150 --> 01:20:34.920
Because like guys like Kamara Uzman and they earn their way to be a champion.

1228
01:20:34.921 --> 01:20:38.210
Of course, you can't just jump right in there. I agree. And, but that's,

1229
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:42.430
that's why he's my dream. But a guy like Anthony Pettis, yeah.

1230
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:47.040
Who's still in elite fighter but who just lost Nate Diaz. That is possible.

1231
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.160
That is possible. Yeah. If you came in with a lot of hype and, and I noticed,

1232
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:51.660
you know,

1233
01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.540
and obviously Gloria's is on UFC fight pass and they have an agreement with

1234
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:59.670
Gloria. Cool. So they could use your highlight reel. Oh yeah, yeah, of course.

1235
01:20:59.671 --> 01:21:03.960
And we could sell it even Greek and talk with UFC and we can make something.

1236
01:21:03.961 --> 01:21:08.280
And I think, yeah, I don't think I will do it. So yeah. But this is good.

1237
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:13.010
And then specialty is a Stryker. Yes. That's what makes it interesting. Yeah.

1238
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:17.250
Pedes would try to stand with you maybe with first. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

1239
01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:22.280
As a confidence first I was thinking about [inaudible] because I really like the

1240
01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.940
way you fight is so crazy. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And I think yeah.

1241
01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:31.980
And because also nobody could knock him out.

1242
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:36.360
Maybe I'm wrong. Well, Josh Thompson knocked him out. Yeah. In the UFT,

1243
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.420
tried him on the head kick. I thought nobody couldn't knock him also.

1244
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:41.580
That's what I wanted to be the first. No,

1245
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:46.380
Josh Thompson who is probably one of the most underrated fighters ever who was

1246
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:48.480
one of the very best in the world.

1247
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.770
But then he left the UFC when the UFC dropped the 155 pound division many,

1248
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:56.340
many years back. And he went over to strike force and became one of the best,

1249
01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.280
you said it's absolutely one of the most unheralded uh,

1250
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:03.510
professional fighters over there. He's an elite elite fighter,

1251
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:07.770
but he knocked out Nate d so they had to talk to him. Yeah, he's the only guy.

1252
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.521
Well, he stopped him.

1253
01:22:08.521 --> 01:22:11.460
He dropped him with the head kick and then finished him off to ivy.

1254
01:22:11.461 --> 01:22:16.120
I be the second one. Well, maybe you'd be the first guy to submit him. Yeah,

1255
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:22.140
maybe. [inaudible] good luck with that.

1256
01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.710
But uh, listen man, I'm a fan is a honor. Have you in here.

1257
01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:27.460
I really appreciate your time. And, uh,

1258
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.940
we're gonna take some pictures of you working out here. Cool. Great. Yeah.

1259
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.700
Alright. Says you're doing bay ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, brother.

1260
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:33.534
Thank you very much.

1261
01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.573
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1262
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:44.400
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
