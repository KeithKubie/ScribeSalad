00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.700
What I have right in front
of me is the Khan Academy

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.930
measuring angles exercise.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.440
I have a small part of it in
this screen right over here.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.190
And it's a pretty cool
exercise because it

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.900
has this little
virtual protractor

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.909
that we can use to
actually measure angles.

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.700
And I want to give
credit to the person who

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.390
built this protractor, because
I think it's pretty neat.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.040
Omar Rizwan, who was actually
a high school intern,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.762
made this pretty neat module.

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:25.970
And so in general, when you
want to measure an angle,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.710
what you want to do
is you want to put

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.650
the center of your
protractor at the center of--

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.170
or I should say, at the
vertex of the angle.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.170
Or you want to put the
vertex of the angle

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.030
at the center of the protractor.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.230
And then what you want to do
is either rotate the angle

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.370
or rotate the protractor.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.610
In this case, we're going
to rotate the protractor.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.140
You want to rotate
the protractor

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.570
so that the 0 angle,
or kind of the 0 mark,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.850
is at one of the
sides of the angle.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.590
And the other side of the
angle is within the protractor.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.590
So let's try to do that.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.240
So maybe if we want to
do that, this 0 side

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.200
should be at this
side of the angle.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.120
So let's rotate it that way.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.837
Let me just keep rotating it.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.170
If I could just keep it pressed.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.560
That's better.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.720
All right.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.210
That looks about right.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.030
So one side is at the 0 mark.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.540
And then my angle,
my other side--

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.630
or if this was a
ray, it points to,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.120
looks like, pretty close
to the 20 degree mark.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.060
So I will type that
in off the screen.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.170
You don't see that.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.780
And that is the right answer.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.400
And then we can
get another angle.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.920
So let's try to measure
this one right over here.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.980
So once again, place the
center of the protractor

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.620
at the center, at the
vertex, of our angle.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.170
We can place the 0 degree,
the base of the protractor,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.340
at this side of the angle.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.920
So let's just rotate it a
little bit, maybe one more time.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.270
That looks about right.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.390
And then the angle is now
opening up-- let's see,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.200
the other side is
pointing to 110 degrees.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690
So this is larger
than 90 degrees.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.730
It's also an obtuse angle.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.260
The last one was an acute angle.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.530
This is obtuse, 110 degrees.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.790
More than 90 degrees.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.570
So let me type it in.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.020
I got the right answer.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.790
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.265
So once again, put the
center of the protractor

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:17.540
at the vertex of our angle.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.480
And now, I want to rotate it.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.130
There we go.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.570
And this looks like roughly
an 80 degree angle, not quite.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.200
If I have to be
really precise, it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.310
looks like it's maybe
81 or 82 degrees.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.312
But I'll just go with
80 as my best guess.

00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:36.270
I got the right answer.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.640
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.100
So once again,
vertex of my angle

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.050
at the center of my protractor.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.484
And then I want to put one side
of the angle at the 0 degree.

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:49.650
And I want to show you,
there's two ways to do that.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.310
You could do this.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.710
You could do just this.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.180
But this isn't too helpful,
because the angle is now

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.120
outside.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.300
The other side sits
outside of the protractor.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.350
So you want the 0
degrees on the side,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.270
so the other side is
within the protractor.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.990
So let's keep rotating it.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.020
There we go.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.480
And then our other
side opens up or you

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.620
could say points to 70 degrees.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.540
So this is an acute
angle right over here.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.430
So it is 70 degrees.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.970
So I'll leave you with that.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.370
Oh look, I'm ready to move
on, the exercise tells me.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.130
And now we can start talking
about more things about angles

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.650
now that we know
how to measure them.
