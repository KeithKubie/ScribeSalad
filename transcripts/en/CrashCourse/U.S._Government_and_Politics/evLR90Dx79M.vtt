00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today we're going to get

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.339
down and dirty wallowing in the mud that is
Congress. Okay, maybe that's a little unfair,

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.410
but the workings of Congress are kind of arcane
or byzantine or maybe let's just say extremely

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.330
complex and confusing, like me, or Game of
Thrones without the nudity. Some of the nudity, maybe.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.240
However, Congress is the most important branch,
so it would probably behoove most Americans

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.690
to know how it works. I'm going to try to
explain. Be prepared to be behooved.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:40.680
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
Both the House of Representatives and the
Senate are divided up into committees in order

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.620
to make them more efficient. The committees
you hear about most are the standing committees,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.800
which are relatively permanent and handle the
day-to-day business of Congress. The House has 19

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.220
standing committees and the Senate 16. Congressmen
and Senators serve on multiple committees.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.640
Each committee has a chairperson, or chair,
who is the one who usually gets mentioned

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
in the press, which is why you would know the name of
the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.800
Tell us in the comments if you do know,
or tell us if you are on the committee, or just say hi.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.420
Congress creates special or select committees
to deal with particular issues that are beyond

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.420
the jurisdiction of standing committees. Some
of them are temporary and some, like the Senate

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.280
Select Committee on Intelligence, are permanent.
Some of them have only an advisory function

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.830
which means they can't write laws. The Select
Committee on Energy Independence and Global

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.280
Warming has only advisory authority which
tells you pretty much all you need to know

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.799
about Congress and climate change.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.189
There are joint committees made up of members
of both houses. Most of them are standing

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.420
committees and they don't do a lot although
the joint Committee on the Library oversees

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.030
the Library of Congress, without which we
would not be able to use a lot of these pictures.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.380
Like that one, and that one, and ooh that
one's my favorite.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
Other committees are conference committees,
which are created to reconcile a bill when

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.100
the House and Senate write different versions
of it, but I'll talk about those later when

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.030
we try to figure out how a bill becomes a
law.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.140
So why does Congress have so many committees?
The main reason is that it's more efficient

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.909
to write legislation in a smaller group rather
than a larger one. Congressional committees

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.909
also allow Congressmen to develop expertise
on certain topics. So a Congressperson from

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.780
Iowa can get on an agriculture committee because
that is an issue he presumably knows something

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.840
about if he pays attention to his constituents.
Or a Congressperson from Oklahoma could be

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.180
on the Regulation of Wind Rolling Down the
Plain Committee.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.660
Committees allow members of Congress to follows
their own interests, so someone passionate

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.190
about national defense can try to get on the
armed services committee. Probably more important,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.600
serving on a committee is something that a
Congressperson can claim credit for and use

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.090
to build up his or her brand when it comes
time for reelection.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.960
Congress also has committees for historical
reasons. Congress is pretty tradish, which

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.150
is what you say when you don't have time to
say traditional. Anyway, it doesn't see much

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.840
need to change a system that has worked, for
the most part, since 1825.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.250
That doesn't mean that Congress hasn't tried
to tweak the system. Let's talk about how

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.510
committees actually work in the Thought Bubble.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.540
Any member of Congress can propose a bill,
this is called proposal power, but it has

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.100
to go to a committee first. Then to get to the rest of the
House or Senate it has to be reported out of committee.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.760
The chair determines the agenda by choosing
which issues get considered. In the House

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.720
the Speaker refers bills to particular committees,
but the committee chair has some discretion

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.650
over whether or not to act on the bills. This
power to control what ideas do or do not become

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.660
bills is what political scientists call "Gatekeeping
Authority", and it's a remarkably important

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.110
power that we rarely ever think about, largely
because when a bill doesn't make it on to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.260
the agenda, there's not much to write or talk
about.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.750
The committee chairs also manage the actual
process of writing a bill, which is called

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.599
mark-up, and the vote on the bill in the committee
itself. If a bill doesn't receive a majority

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.170
of votes in the committee, it won't be reported
out to the full House or Senate. In this case

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.730
we say the bill "died in committee" and we
have a small funeral on the National Mall.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.020
Nah we just put it in the shredder.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.740
Anyway, committee voting is kind of an efficient
practice. If a bill can't command a majority

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.959
in a small committee it doesn't have much
chance in the floor of either house. Committees

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.730
can kill bills by just not voting on them,
but it is possible in the House to force them

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.090
to vote by filing a discharge petition - this
almost never happens.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.450
Gatekeeping Authority is Congress's most important
power, but it also has oversight power, which

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.870
is an after-the-fact authority to check up
on how law is being implemented.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.879
Committees exercise oversight by assigning
staff to scrutinize a particular law or policy

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.259
and by holding hearings. Holding hearings is an
excellent way to take a position on a particular issue.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.720
Thanks Thought Bubble. So those are the basics
of how committees work, but I promised you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.370
we'd go beyond the basics, so here we go into
the Realm of Congressional History.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.930
Since Congress started using committees they have
made a number of changes, but the ones that have

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.420
bent the Congress into its current shape occurred
under the speakership of Newt Gingrich in 1994.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.320
Overall Gingrich increased the power of the
Speaker, who was already pretty powerful.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.420
The number of subcommittees was reduced, and
seniority rules in appointing chairs were changed.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.540
Before Gingrich or "BG" the chair of a committee
was usually the longest serving member of

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.749
the majority party, which for most of the
20th century was the Democrats. AG Congress,

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.619
or Anno Gingrichy Congress, holds votes to
choose the chairs. The Speaker has a lot of

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:41.689
influence over who gets chosen on these votes,
which happen more regularly because the Republicans

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.139
also impose term limits on the committee chairs.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.229
Being able to offer chairmanships to loyal
party members gives the Speaker a lot more

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.360
influence over the committees themselves.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.210
The Speaker also increased his, or her -- this
is the first time we can say that, thanks

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.150
Nancy Pelosi -- power to refer bills to committee
and act as gatekeeper.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.059
Gingrich also made changes to congressional
staffing. But before we discuss the changes,

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.490
let's spend a minute or two looking at Congressional
staff in general.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.240
There are two types of congressional staff,
the Staff Assistants that each Congressperson

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.280
or Senator has to help her or him with the
actual job of being a legislator, and the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.460
Staff Agencies that work for Congress as a
whole.

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.439
The staff of a Congressperson is incredibly
important. Some staffers' job is to research

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.219
and write legislation while others do case
work, like responding to constituents' requests.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.919
Some staffers perform personal functions,
like keeping track of a Congressperson's calendar,

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.499
or most importantly making coffee - can we
get a staffer in here?

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.939
As Congresspeople spend more and more time
raising money, more and more of the actual

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.759
legislative work is done by staff. In addition
to the individual staffers, Congress as a

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.309
whole has specialized staff agencies that
are supposed to be more independent. You may

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.300
have heard of these agencies, or at least
some of them.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.649
The Congressional Research Service is supposed to
perform unbiased factual research for Congresspeople

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.930
and their staff to help them in the process
of writing the actual bills. The Government

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.240
Accountability Office is a branch of Congress
that can investigate the finances and administration

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.929
of any government administrative office. The
Congressional Budget Office assesses the likely

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:04.380
costs and impact of legislation. When the CBO looks at
the cost of a particular bill it's called "scoring the bill."

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.780
The Congressional reforms after 1994 generally
increased the number of individual staff and

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.069
reduced the staff of the staff agencies. This
means that more legislation comes out of the

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.989
offices of individual Congresspeople.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.289
The last feature of Congress that I'm going
to mention, briefly because their actual function

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.989
and importance is nebulous, is the caucus system.
These are caucuses in Congress, so don't confuse

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:27.180
them with the caucuses that some states use to
choose candidates for office, like the ones in Iowa.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.339
Caucuses are semi-formal groups of Congresspeople
organized around particular identities or

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.849
interests. Semi-formal in this case doesn't
mean that they wear suits and ties, it means

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.360
that they don't have official function in
the legislative process.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.659
But you know what? Class it up a little - just
try to look nice.

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.619
The Congressional Black Caucus is made up
of the African American members of the legislature.

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:48.139
The Republican Study Group is the conservative
caucus that meets to discuss conservative

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.330
issues and develop legislative strategies.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.309
Since 2010 there is also a Tea Party caucus
in Congress. There are also caucuses for very

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.969
specific interests like the Bike Caucus that
focuses on cycling.

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:02.169
There should also be a Beard Caucus, shouldn't
there? Is there a Beard Caucus Stan? No? What

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.029
about an eagle punching caucus?

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:08.919
The purpose of these caucuses is for like
minded people to gather and discuss ideas.

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.319
The caucuses can help members of Congress
coordinate their efforts and also provide

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.679
leadership opportunities for individual Congresspeople
outside of the more formal structures of committees.

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:20.939
There are a lot of terms and details to remember,
but here's the big thing to take away: caucuses,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.260
congressional staff, and especially committees, all
exist to make the process of lawmaking more efficient.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.280
In particular, committees and staff allow
individual legislators to develop expertise;

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.580
this is the theory anyway.
Yes it's a theory.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.000
Committees also serve a political function
of helping Congresspeople build an identity

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.069
for voters that should help them get elected.
In some ways this is just as important in

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:42.369
the role in the process of making actual legislation.

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.979
When Congress doesn't pass many laws, committee
membership, or better yet, being a committee

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:49.770
chair is one of the only ways that a Congressperson
can distinguish him or herself. At least it

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.130
gives you something more to learn about incumbents
when you're making your voting choices.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.149
