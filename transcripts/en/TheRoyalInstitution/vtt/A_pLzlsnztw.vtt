00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.550
James and I are going to carry on with ping
pong. Now I'm rubbish at ping pong. James

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.280
is much better than me. But this gets much
trickier when you take gravity away, so let's

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.270
have a look at that.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:31.630
'Injection.' OK, game on. Now I had to have
quite a lot of ping pong balls for this because

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.350
I kept losing them, and you keep losing them
because you're floating. The balls are floating,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.360
and they just don't do what they do do on
Earth. I'm not entirely sure--

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.660
I have no idea, OK?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.870
So the ball doesn't behave like this. The
laws of physics are the same, but the physics

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.050
of your situation have changed, so everything
is more difficult. Alex, shall we have a quick

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.070
game? Yeah?

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.100
[LAUGHTER] All right.
