well imagine snowfields and that that's

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
well imagine snowfields and that that's
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.330

as an analogous to this background field

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340
as an analogous to this background field
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.180
as an analogous to this background field
you know throughout all the universe and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
you know throughout all the universe and
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.290
you know throughout all the universe and
this reflects the way that people

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300
this reflects the way that people
 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.380
this reflects the way that people
crossing it in in in different ways

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
crossing it in in in different ways
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.300
crossing it in in in different ways
depending on whether they wear skis or

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310
depending on whether they wear skis or
 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.380
depending on whether they wear skis or
snowshoes or just boots and the analogy

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
snowshoes or just boots and the analogy
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.090
snowshoes or just boots and the analogy
is then that they the people with skis

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100
is then that they the people with skis
 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.500
is then that they the people with skis
relatively unaffected in trouble with

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560
relatively unaffected in trouble with
high high speed the people with no shoes

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
high high speed the people with no shoes
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.060
high high speed the people with no shoes
do not quite so well and the people who

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
do not quite so well and the people who
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.590
do not quite so well and the people who
just wear boots go very slowly and that

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600
just wear boots go very slowly and that
 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.119
just wear boots go very slowly and that
analogy is with the effect on some kinds

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
analogy is with the effect on some kinds
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.599
analogy is with the effect on some kinds
of particles which continue to travel

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
of particles which continue to travel
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.240
of particles which continue to travel
this speed of light and the massless and

this speed of light and the massless and
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.260
this speed of light and the massless and
that what happens to particles which are

that what happens to particles which are
 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.130
that what happens to particles which are
heavier but to me that's that well that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
heavier but to me that's that well that
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980
heavier but to me that's that well that
