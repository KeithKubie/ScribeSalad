00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.010
It's tasty, a little bit
squishy, totally delightful,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.357
and even better if toasted.

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:08.940
My name is Rich
Hyndman, and I'm going

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.640
to delve into the fluffy center
of our latest Android offering

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.050
and the new hardware that
forms the latest Nexus lineup.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.500
So Android Marshmallow.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.330
Numerically, it's Android 6.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.850
And for developers,
that's API 23.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.360
It's the most stable, efficient,
and feature-packed version

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.362
of Android yet.

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.820
And the first two devices to
launch with the latest hotness

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.450
are the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.090
The Nexus 5X is a delight
built in partnership with LG.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.530
It's equipped with a
5.2-inch 1080p display,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.885
a Snapdragon 808 processor, and
a 12.3-megapixel rear camera.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:43.100
It offers top-of-the-line
performance in a compact,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.020
lightweight device.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.630
For developers, there were
two new intermediate densities

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.000
other than API 23.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Density 360 and density 420.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.710
And the new Nexus 5X is
in that latter bucket.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.295
So, for devs that are using
compatible screen declaration

00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.000
in their manifest,
you're going to need

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.980
to test your app out
and add the new values.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.280
The Nexus 6P, built with
Huawei, rocks a 5.7-inch

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.930
high-resolution
AMOLED display.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.270
front-facing stereo speakers,
and a 12.3-megapixel rear

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.200
camera, all housed in a
contoured aluminum body.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.340
I absolutely love these devices,
and both have USB-C ports

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.260
and fingerprint sensors.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.340
The updates in
Marshmallow are primarily

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.160
targeted towards improving
the user experience,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.110
smoothing out install
and update flows,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.030
speeding up authentication,
improving battery life,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.840
adding contextually
sensitive controls,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.180
and allowing applications to
assist each other at a deeper

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.184
level than ever before.

00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:38.846
Arguably one of the
biggest changes in M

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.500
has to be the arrival
of runtime permissions.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.730
While this reduces friction
for install and updates,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.730
it does come with some overhead.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.950
You can no longer assume
just because your app

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.386
is installed that all its stated
permissions have been granted.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.104
Permissions are now
granted at runtime,

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:57.650
and users can revoke permissions
on a per-app basis at any time.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.670
There are more details
in Nick Butcher's video

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.080
on permissions UI.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.600
In an effort to simplify robust
data backup for developers

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.719
and also simplify
the lives of users,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.241
Android Auto Backup ensures
up to 25 megabytes of data

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:11.970
is backed up per app.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.050
If your project
targets M, backup

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.690
will automatically be enabled.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.190
And there are a couple of
things you should be aware of.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.800
So be sure to check out the
docs and watch Matthew's video

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.919
for full details.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.461
Something I'm
personally very excited

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:26.070
about-- There are
a number of battery

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.760
optimizations in Marshmallow.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.385
But the biggest
individual contributors

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:31.745
are Doze and App Standby.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:34.460
If a user leaves their device
unplugged and stationary

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920
for a period of time
and the screen is off,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.967
then the device is going
to enter Doze mode.

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:40.543
It's going to stay
in that sleep state

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:43.030
until the device is disturbed.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.890
By default, some restrictions
apply to apps in this mode.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.820
Wake clocks may be
ignored, scheduled alarms

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.440
can be deferred, and network
access may be disabled.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.960
But if you have good
reason to wake your app,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.910
then you can do so.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.950
And Joanna Smith has
just released a video

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.019
explaining it all.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.311
There are new authentication
and security possibilities

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.710
with the addition of the
fingerprint recognition APIs.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.680
When you support an
adb testing command,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.470
you can help your users have the
most secure device as possible.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.936
Maya has the full
details in her video.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.064
If you want to make it easy
for users to transition

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:17.290
from your web content
to your app content,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.690
app linking lets you take
control of the web content

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.510
that you own.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.170
And Wojtek has a video that
explains it beautifully.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.250
On top of that, we have
Bluetooth stylus support,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.130
tech selection, context-aware
pop-ups, adoptable storage,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.410
and that Assist API which allows
you to integrate with services

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.330
built by other developers.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.700
Not strictly part of
Marshmallow but definitely worth

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.550
mentioning is the
introduction of data binding.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.950
It's an Android Studio
feature from 1.3 onwards,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.470
and it reduces
the amount of code

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.470
you need to write
to hook up your XML

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.580
layouts with your activities.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.256
See Neto's video
for the lowdown.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.384
There have also been updates
to the support library

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.440
with a number of new
libraries including

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.450
custom tabs, percentage-based
layouts, recommendations,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.270
and preferences.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.040
With all the new goodness
comes some goodbyes.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
First up, a deprecated
API has been removed.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.060
Apache HTTP was
deprecated a while back

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.080
in favor of the more
efficient HttpURLConnection.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.779
And it's been
removed in Android 6.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.421
If your app or any of the
libraries you use rely on it,

00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:19.795
you're going to need to make
a small update to include it

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.545
in your build and declare it
in your buildup Gradle file.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:26.510
Even though OpenSSL was never
part of the public NDK API,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.630
some apps still
linked against it.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.840
And now that Android a switched
from OpenSSL to BoringSSL--

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.520
yup, that's the name-- it means
that those apps will now break.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.624
If you're in this situation,
you need to get testing.

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:41.036
All the videos mentioned here
are available in our Android

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.800
Marshmallow playlist.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.035
So that's Android Marshmallow,
something harmless

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.825
and lovable that could never
possibly run amok in New York

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:49.800
and destroy us.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:05:03.125
