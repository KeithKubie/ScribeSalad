00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709
done I think but in that it's just
 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.920
done I think but in that it's just
looking a little too much - and I really

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
looking a little too much - and I really
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.960
looking a little too much - and I really
really wish it could have been done in

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
really wish it could have been done in
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.180
really wish it could have been done in
two movies where we get her best friend

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190

relationship with her and her best
 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.490
relationship with her and her best
friend and we get a lot of footage from

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500
friend and we get a lot of footage from
 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.840
friend and we get a lot of footage from
her past with who don't get in this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850
her past with who don't get in this
 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.160
her past with who don't get in this
movie at all I think that would have

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170

been really cool and I liked building up

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140
been really cool and I liked building up
 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.199
been really cool and I liked building up
her team that she's fighting with in the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
her team that she's fighting with in the
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.290
her team that she's fighting with in the
beginning of this film and I just some

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300
beginning of this film and I just some
 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.180
beginning of this film and I just some
more background with the character

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
more background with the character
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.710
more background with the character
building I think something that really

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
building I think something that really
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.630
building I think something that really
helps this feel more grounded with the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640
helps this feel more grounded with the
 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.440
