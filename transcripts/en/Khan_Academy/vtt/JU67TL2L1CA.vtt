00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.920
Define a "good word" as
a sequence of letters

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.610
that consists only of
the letters A, B, and C.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.520
Some of these letters may
not appear in the sequence.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.486
And in which A is never
immediately followed by B,

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.310
B is never immediately
followed by C,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.250
and C is never
immediately followed

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.570
by A. How many seven letter
"good words" are there?

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.500
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160
So there's letters with
just A's, B's, and C's.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.140
And then it could be all
A's, all B's, all C's

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.230
because some letters
might not appear.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740
And A is never
immediately followed

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.676
by B. So A can only be followed
by another A or another C.

00:00:45.676 --> 00:00:49.940
B is never immediately
followed by C,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.390
which means that B could only be
followed by an A or another B.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.540
And C is never
immediately followed by A.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.650
So C could only be followed
by another C or a B.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.019
So how many seven letter
"good words" are there?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.820
So let's just think
about the places.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.880
We have seven letters, so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 letters.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.200
Now, there's no constraints
on this first letter

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.090
since it's not
following anything.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.710
So it could be an A
B, or a C. So there's

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.529
three possibilities
for this first letter.

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:25.820
Now, there's three possibilities
for this first letter.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.020
But no matter what letter this
is, how many possibilities are

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.680
there for this second
letter over here?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.890
Well, if this was an
A, the second letter

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.650
could only be an A
or a C because it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.610
can't be followed by
a B. If this was a B,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.950
the second letter could
only be a B or an A

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.800
because it can't be followed
by a C. If this was a C,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.290
the second letter could
only be a B, or a C.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.570
So no matter what letter
this first letter is,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.727
the second letter can only
have two possibilities.

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.310
There could only be
two possibilities.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.737
Another way to
think about it is,

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:00.820
there's one letter, no
matter what letter this is,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.800
there's one letter that's
being ruled out here.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.720
So it could only be
two possibilities.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.540
Well, the same thing is here.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.123
We're going to stick
some letter here.

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:09.860
And no matter what letter
there is over here,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.700
it's going to rule out
one possibility over here.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.730
So we're going to have
only two possible letters

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.290
that we can put here, no
matter what letter is there.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.190
And use the same logic, only
two possibilities there,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.080
only two possibilities there,
only two possibilities there,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.690
and then only two
possibilities there.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.420
So how many total
possibilities do we have?

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.360
Well, 3 times 2 times 2
times 2 times 2 times 2.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.830
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 2's.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.780
So this is equal to 3
times 2 to the sixth power,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.630
which is 3 times 2 to
the six is 32 times 2

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.110
is 64, which is equal to
180 plus 12 is equal to 192.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.810
There's 192 possible
good seven letter

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.960
"good words," where good
words is defined above.
