is a long and difficult process it can

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
is a long and difficult process it can
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.500
is a long and difficult process it can
take anywhere from two to five years to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
take anywhere from two to five years to
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.690
take anywhere from two to five years to
bring a product from ideation all the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
bring a product from ideation all the
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820
bring a product from ideation all the
way up to product so you start with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
way up to product so you start with
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710
way up to product so you start with
ideation and then you move on to the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
ideation and then you move on to the
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690
ideation and then you move on to the
prototype phase and then you choose your

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
prototype phase and then you choose your
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700
prototype phase and then you choose your
hardware and then you design your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
hardware and then you design your
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469
hardware and then you design your
software and get that all coated up and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
software and get that all coated up and
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450
software and get that all coated up and
then you send it to a factory you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
then you send it to a factory you
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100
then you send it to a factory you
finally get done on the store shelf and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
finally get done on the store shelf and
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.840
finally get done on the store shelf and
then you cycle back and you have to go

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
then you cycle back and you have to go
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390
then you cycle back and you have to go
through updates so we live in a world

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

can change right in the middle of your
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480
can change right in the middle of your
production process so how can the design

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
production process so how can the design
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700
production process so how can the design
process keep up that's one of the main

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
process keep up that's one of the main
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469
process keep up that's one of the main
reasons that we created Android things

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

give it to the community to see what you

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.110
give it to the community to see what you
 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.130
give it to the community to see what you
guys may want to create with it and so

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140
guys may want to create with it and so
 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.750
guys may want to create with it and so
what is Lantern made of I mentioned

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:35.760
what is Lantern made of I mentioned
 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.310
what is Lantern made of I mentioned
before that it was created using

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:37.320
before that it was created using
 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.950
before that it was created using
off-the-shelf parts so there's a lamp

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960
off-the-shelf parts so there's a lamp
 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.260
off-the-shelf parts so there's a lamp
inside is a laser projector an

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270

Raspberry Pi running Android things it's

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820
Raspberry Pi running Android things it's
 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.430
Raspberry Pi running Android things it's
important to recognize that there are

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
important to recognize that there are
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.500
important to recognize that there are
two pieces of hardware that Android

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510
two pieces of hardware that Android
 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.360
two pieces of hardware that Android
things - boards excuse me that Android

things runs on it'll run on a Raspberry

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:55.980
things runs on it'll run on a Raspberry
 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.730
things runs on it'll run on a Raspberry

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740
Pi and it also run on the imx7 boards
 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.200
Pi and it also run on the imx7 boards
that are in that are in the kit the

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.210
that are in that are in the kit the
 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.540
that are in that are in the kit the
Raspberry Pi is is a little bit more

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.550
Raspberry Pi is is a little bit more
 

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.160
Raspberry Pi is is a little bit more
prevalent at this point in the maker

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.170

community so we felt like building it on

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:05.850
community so we felt like building it on
 

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.060
community so we felt like building it on
that platform with the HDMI output was

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.070
that platform with the HDMI output was
 

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.370
that platform with the HDMI output was
going to be better for this case because

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.380
going to be better for this case because
 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.630
going to be better for this case because
we could connect it directly to the

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:11.640
we could connect it directly to the
 

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.840
we could connect it directly to the
laser projector and so once it's

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:14.850
laser projector and so once it's
 

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.910
laser projector and so once it's
assembled it looks like this you may

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:16.920
assembled it looks like this you may
 

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.560
assembled it looks like this you may
have seen it over in the IOT dome we

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.570
have seen it over in the IOT dome we
 

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.390
have seen it over in the IOT dome we
have one running over there as an

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400
have one running over there as an
 

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.440
have one running over there as an
example and we really believe that this

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.450
example and we really believe that this
 

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.390
example and we really believe that this
is only now possible because of the

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400
is only now possible because of the
 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.390
is only now possible because of the
democratization of design and hardware

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400
democratization of design and hardware
 

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.580
democratization of design and hardware
and prototyping and access to these

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:31.590
and prototyping and access to these
 

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.960
and prototyping and access to these
kinds of tools that we're talking about

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:32.970
kinds of tools that we're talking about
 

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.990
kinds of tools that we're talking about
today so it was really difficult in the

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000
today so it was really difficult in the
 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.780
today so it was really difficult in the
past to say print a 3d form like this

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:38.790
past to say print a 3d form like this
 

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.140
past to say print a 3d form like this
and assemble it into a hardware shell

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.150
and assemble it into a hardware shell
 

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.060
and assemble it into a hardware shell
because hardware was expensive 3d

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.070
because hardware was expensive 3d
 

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.830
because hardware was expensive 3d
prototyping tools were inaccessible and

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:45.840
prototyping tools were inaccessible and
 

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.380
prototyping tools were inaccessible and
tools like Android things were not easy

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.390
tools like Android things were not easy
 

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.870
tools like Android things were not easy
really readily available for you to

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880
really readily available for you to
 

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.800
really readily available for you to
access to create new hardware prototypes

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:53.810
access to create new hardware prototypes
 

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.150
access to create new hardware prototypes
and so Lantern can also be assigned

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160
and so Lantern can also be assigned
 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.250
and so Lantern can also be assigned
content to its its particular context so

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260
content to its its particular context so
 

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.690
content to its its particular context so
it's aware of its orientation

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700
it's aware of its orientation
 

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.090
it's aware of its orientation
so using that accelerometer in Lantern

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.100
so using that accelerometer in Lantern
 

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.640
so using that accelerometer in Lantern
we can change its base position and then

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:07.650
we can change its base position and then
 

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.460
we can change its base position and then
project different content onto different

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:10.470
project different content onto different
 

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.470
project different content onto different
surfaces so say we wanted to project a

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480
surfaces so say we wanted to project a
 

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.330
surfaces so say we wanted to project a
star chart on the ceiling or in the

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:14.340
star chart on the ceiling or in the
 

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.310
star chart on the ceiling or in the
examples that we saw earlier you could

that's awesome so when we design things

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.250
that's awesome so when we design things
 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.010
that's awesome so when we design things
you might know that we use common

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.020

banking app for instance to a theater
app there's another instance so we use

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.370
app there's another instance so we use

these processes and forend principles to
 

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.270
these processes and forend principles to
ground our work but then we use the

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:47.280
ground our work but then we use the
 

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.130
ground our work but then we use the
design process to move forward as well

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140
design process to move forward as well
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.680

software UI design concepts and applying
them to hardware

00:10:59.259 --> 00:10:59.269
 

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:03.439
so what is design design is the creation

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:03.449
so what is design design is the creation
 

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:06.739
so what is design design is the creation
of tools for people in a context to help

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:06.749
of tools for people in a context to help

this is very similar to a user story so

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339
this is very similar to a user story so

fidelity designs so we solved this

00:15:07.569 --> 00:15:07.579
fidelity designs so we solved this
 

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:10.689
fidelity designs so we solved this
really preliminary sketches right we may

to think about how it might look and
 

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.699
to think about how it might look and
feel before it actually works we might

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:18.709
feel before it actually works we might
 

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:20.620
feel before it actually works we might
make something on a breadboard

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:20.630

so for example we may create a rough

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.080
so for example we may create a rough
 

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.710

click-through and then gain internal
 

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.120
click-through and then gain internal
feedback and iterate on that cycle or

forward in your design cycle the more

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.470
forward in your design cycle the more
 

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.890

sketching but what happened next we

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520
sketching but what happened next we
 

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.400
sketching but what happened next we
began to create a looks like feels like

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:35.410
began to create a looks like feels like
 

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.680

through the full creation process so

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:15.970
through the full creation process so
 

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.030
through the full creation process so
again we went back to sketching to think

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:18.040
again we went back to sketching to think
 

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.640
again we went back to sketching to think
about how the housing may come together

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:20.650
about how the housing may come together
 

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.740
about how the housing may come together

thinking about the parts that needed to
 

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.860
thinking about the parts that needed to
go in it well we as I mentioned earlier

the lamb and before we put everything

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:58.570
the lamb and before we put everything
 

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.080
the lamb and before we put everything
together we started to prototype what

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.090
together we started to prototype what
 

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.120
together we started to prototype what
some of these content simulations may

it's really simple
 

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.950
it's really simple
we had the projector we had the

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960
we had the projector we had the
 

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.560
we had the projector we had the
Raspberry Pi connected to an

we just said can we show you the
 

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.140
we just said can we show you the
direction or show us the direction of

which way the object is pointing
 

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.820
which way the object is pointing
so does it know if it's pointing up down

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:26.830
so does it know if it's pointing up down
 

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.950
so does it know if it's pointing up down
or sideways and then on the right hand

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960
or sideways and then on the right hand
 

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.420
or sideways and then on the right hand
side these were some of the initial

nearby device and just projecting it
 

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.340
nearby device and just projecting it
onto a notepad to see is that even

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.350
onto a notepad to see is that even
 

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.930
onto a notepad to see is that even
possible using the hardware that we

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:42.940
possible using the hardware that we
 

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.130
possible using the hardware that we
think we want to use looking at physical

prototype and here flips up at the
 

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.430
prototype and here flips up at the
ceiling then you can see the content

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440
ceiling then you can see the content
 

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.300
ceiling then you can see the content
start to come to life

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.310
start to come to life
 

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.610
start to come to life
so again we built these pieces up

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:05.620
so again we built these pieces up
 

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.680
so again we built these pieces up
individually and then started to put

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:07.690
individually and then started to put
 

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:12.120
individually and then started to put
them together into their final form so

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.130
them together into their final form so
 

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.560
them together into their final form so
one tool that I wanted to mention that

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.570
one tool that I wanted to mention that
 

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.630
one tool that I wanted to mention that
the team found highly beneficial in

so if you're a designer you may already

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:20.740
so if you're a designer you may already
 

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.130
so if you're a designer you may already
be familiar with processing as a

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:23.140
be familiar with processing as a
 

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.170
be familiar with processing as a
lightweight IDE that enables you to

quickly create visualizations for
designers like me it helps me because I

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120
designers like me it helps me because I
 

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.240
designers like me it helps me because I
can create visualizations independently

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.250
can create visualizations independently
 

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.160
can create visualizations independently
and there's a really nice library that

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.170
and there's a really nice library that
 

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.960
and there's a really nice library that
was really recently released from the

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:36.970
was really recently released from the
 

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.690
was really recently released from the
processing foundation called processing

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:39.700
processing foundation called processing
 

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.850
processing foundation called processing
for Android and what that enables you to

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:41.860
for Android and what that enables you to
 

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.620
for Android and what that enables you to
do is write processing and then test

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:43.630
do is write processing and then test
 

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.660
do is write processing and then test
that in on an Android device you can

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:45.670
that in on an Android device you can
 

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.890
that in on an Android device you can
test that on your phone you can test it

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:46.900
test that on your phone you can test it
 

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.560
test that on your phone you can test it
on your wear device but you can also use

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.570
on your wear device but you can also use
 

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.240
on your wear device but you can also use
that on Android things which is really

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.250
that on Android things which is really
 

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.350
that on Android things which is really
nice because you can work on a

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360
nice because you can work on a
 

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.730
nice because you can work on a
visualization and then

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:53.740
visualization and then
 

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.000
visualization and then
that onto your Hardware independently

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.010
that onto your Hardware independently
 

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.030
that onto your Hardware independently
what this enabled us to do was work with

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.040
what this enabled us to do was work with
 

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.799
what this enabled us to do was work with
the visualizations get them to a place

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:01.809
the visualizations get them to a place
 

00:26:01.809 --> 00:26:03.480
the visualizations get them to a place
where we wanted them and then integrate

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:03.490
where we wanted them and then integrate
 

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.060
where we wanted them and then integrate
them into the hardware I'm a few gotchas

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.070
them into the hardware I'm a few gotchas
 

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.790
them into the hardware I'm a few gotchas
when you're moving from processing you

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:08.800
when you're moving from processing you
 

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.549
when you're moving from processing you
can export an Android studio project

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559
can export an Android studio project
 

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:14.130
can export an Android studio project
however you'll need to upgrade the

however you'll need to upgrade the
 

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.220
however you'll need to upgrade the

things
 

00:26:19.929 --> 00:26:21.690
things
so Android things requires a slightly

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:21.700
so Android things requires a slightly
 

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.410
so Android things requires a slightly
higher Android build number and once you

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.420
higher Android build number and once you
 

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.910
higher Android build number and once you
do that you'll be able to connect your

do that you'll be able to connect your
 

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.310
do that you'll be able to connect your
processing visualizations to hardware to

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320
processing visualizations to hardware to
 

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.410
processing visualizations to hardware to
manipulate them through the standard

manipulate them through the standard
Android things GPIO inputs and so

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:37.510
Android things GPIO inputs and so
 

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.690
Android things GPIO inputs and so
thinking about our iterative process how

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:39.700
thinking about our iterative process how
 

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.430
thinking about our iterative process how
did we go about getting feedback on

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440
did we go about getting feedback on
 

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.090
did we go about getting feedback on
Lantern so first we started asking team

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.100
Lantern so first we started asking team
 

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.160
Lantern so first we started asking team
members around us to use it we couldn't

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:47.170
members around us to use it we couldn't
 

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:48.630
members around us to use it we couldn't
really go out to the public because this

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640
really go out to the public because this
 

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.740
really go out to the public because this
was a private thing that we were working

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:49.750
was a private thing that we were working
 

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.200
was a private thing that we were working
on but we were able to find other people

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.210
on but we were able to find other people
 

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.820

inside of Google who are not familiar
 

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.820
inside of Google who are not familiar
with the project team members such as

with the project team members such as
 

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.650
with the project team members such as
the ml team on Android things who

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:58.660
the ml team on Android things who
 

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.480
the ml team on Android things who
thought it was pretty interesting but

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:00.490
thought it was pretty interesting but
 

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.190
thought it was pretty interesting but
one thing that we had really kind of

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200
one thing that we had really kind of
 

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.990
one thing that we had really kind of
pushed away from was the idea of

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000
pushed away from was the idea of
 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.180
pushed away from was the idea of
integrating in your interactivity into

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:06.190
integrating in your interactivity into
 

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.720
integrating in your interactivity into
our MVP or our first iteration of the

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:09.730
our MVP or our first iteration of the
 

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.350
our MVP or our first iteration of the
project

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360
project
 

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.480
project
we were specifically adverse to

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.490
we were specifically adverse to
 

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.430
we were specifically adverse to
incorporating interactivity because we

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440
incorporating interactivity because we
 

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.500
incorporating interactivity because we
wanted to prove that we could project

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:16.510
wanted to prove that we could project
 

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.590
wanted to prove that we could project
content in different ways interactivity

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600
content in different ways interactivity
 

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.690
content in different ways interactivity
adds another layer of complexity so

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.700
adds another layer of complexity so
 

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.460
adds another layer of complexity so
again we wanted to simplify this into

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:23.470
again we wanted to simplify this into
 

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.070
again we wanted to simplify this into
its basic form so that we could prove

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080
its basic form so that we could prove
 

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.680
its basic form so that we could prove
that the independent on interactions

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:28.690
that the independent on interactions
 

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.560
that the independent on interactions
were working however when we shared the

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.570
were working however when we shared the
 

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.690
were working however when we shared the
prototype with the ml team they were

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:33.700
prototype with the ml team they were
 

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.560
prototype with the ml team they were
really keen on integrating a camera and

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.570
really keen on integrating a camera and
 

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.200
really keen on integrating a camera and
so because we were working with Android

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.210
so because we were working with Android
 

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.990
so because we were working with Android
things and working with 3d printing we

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000
things and working with 3d printing we
 

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.330
things and working with 3d printing we
were able to make some modifications

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340
were able to make some modifications
 

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.520
were able to make some modifications
integrate the camera and the Norden team

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:47.530
integrate the camera and the Norden team
 

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.390
integrate the camera and the Norden team
happened to be working in London and the

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:51.400
happened to be working in London and the
 

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.730
happened to be working in London and the
Mountain View team was over here and it

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:53.740
Mountain View team was over here and it
 

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.380
Mountain View team was over here and it
was really an interesting story of how

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:55.390
was really an interesting story of how
 

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.410
was really an interesting story of how
this evolved because again never before

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:58.420
this evolved because again never before
 

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.540
this evolved because again never before
have you had access to tools like this

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:00.550
have you had access to tools like this
 

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.810
have you had access to tools like this
like 3d printing from the web we were

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:03.820
like 3d printing from the web we were
 

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.000
like 3d printing from the web we were
able to actually build prototypes into

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.010
able to actually build prototypes into
 

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.020
able to actually build prototypes into
physical locations

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:07.030
physical locations
 

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.790
physical locations
collaborate on them and build them up

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:08.800
collaborate on them and build them up
 

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.100
collaborate on them and build them up
simultaneously which is really cool and

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.110
simultaneously which is really cool and
 

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.080
simultaneously which is really cool and
again Android things made it really easy

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.090
again Android things made it really easy
 

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.060
again Android things made it really easy
to integrate new hardware like this and

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.070
to integrate new hardware like this and
 

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.250
to integrate new hardware like this and
connect it to the visualization pieces

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:17.260
connect it to the visualization pieces
 

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.180
connect it to the visualization pieces
in a snap and so with the camera in

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.190
in a snap and so with the camera in
 

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.040
in a snap and so with the camera in
place we now had the possibility of a

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.050
place we now had the possibility of a
 

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.870
place we now had the possibility of a
greater range of interactivity and

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880
greater range of interactivity and
 

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.630
greater range of interactivity and
interactive input and so this led us to

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640
interactive input and so this led us to
 

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.950
interactive input and so this led us to
creating quick-draw

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
creating quick-draw
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.750
creating quick-draw
pen and paper addition so for those of

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760
pen and paper addition so for those of
 

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.340
pen and paper addition so for those of
you who are at i/o last year you may

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:32.350
you who are at i/o last year you may
 

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.220
you who are at i/o last year you may
have seen quick-draw which is a creative

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:35.230
have seen quick-draw which is a creative
 

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.310
have seen quick-draw which is a creative
labs project from Google that prompts

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320
labs project from Google that prompts
 

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.050
labs project from Google that prompts
you with a word and then as you draw it

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.060
you with a word and then as you draw it
 

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.850
you with a word and then as you draw it
on a tablet on the web or on your phone

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:41.860
on a tablet on the web or on your phone
 

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.680
on a tablet on the web or on your phone
it starts to guess what you're drawing

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:43.690
it starts to guess what you're drawing
 

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.990
it starts to guess what you're drawing
and we thought that would be really cool

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000
and we thought that would be really cool
 

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.180
and we thought that would be really cool
to do in the physical world now that we

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:48.190
to do in the physical world now that we
 

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:53.340
to do in the physical world now that we
had this projected AR system and so what

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:53.350
had this projected AR system and so what
 

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.470
had this projected AR system and so what
we did is we did just that

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480
we did is we did just that
 

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.260
we did is we did just that
right so previously it was limited to

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.270
right so previously it was limited to
 

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.990
right so previously it was limited to
screen based inputs but we thought

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.000
screen based inputs but we thought
 

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.880
screen based inputs but we thought
wouldn't it be cool if we could use just

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:02.890
wouldn't it be cool if we could use just
 

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.690
wouldn't it be cool if we could use just
a pen paper capture that input feed that

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:06.700
a pen paper capture that input feed that
 

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.430
a pen paper capture that input feed that
into the quick-draw engine and then have

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440
into the quick-draw engine and then have
 

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.860
into the quick-draw engine and then have
an interactive game that you could use

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:10.870
an interactive game that you could use
 

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.160
an interactive game that you could use
in the physical world this is an example

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.170
in the physical world this is an example
 

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.590
in the physical world this is an example
of the demonstration that we have set up

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600
of the demonstration that we have set up
 

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.380
of the demonstration that we have set up
over in the IOT dome if you have the

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:19.390
over in the IOT dome if you have the
 

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.790
over in the IOT dome if you have the
visited the dome you can check it out

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:20.800
visited the dome you can check it out
 

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.320
visited the dome you can check it out
and you can try it out for yourselves

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:22.330
and you can try it out for yourselves
 

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.870
and you can try it out for yourselves
we've got a lantern set up and it works

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880
we've got a lantern set up and it works
 

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.120
we've got a lantern set up and it works
it works great so you're prompted with a

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.130
it works great so you're prompted with a
 

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.950
it works great so you're prompted with a
word and as you start to draw with the

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960
word and as you start to draw with the
 

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.620
word and as you start to draw with the
pen and the paper it starts to guess on

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:31.630
pen and the paper it starts to guess on
 

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.690

this projected interface in front of you

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:33.700
this projected interface in front of you
 

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.030
this projected interface in front of you
so again thinking about this as a mixed

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.040
so again thinking about this as a mixed
 

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:45.039
so again thinking about this as a mixed
reality surface and there you go

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:45.049
 

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:49.220
so now we've gone one through one cycle

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:49.230
so now we've gone one through one cycle
 

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.110
so now we've gone one through one cycle
right we've planned we've prototype in

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120
right we've planned we've prototype in
 

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.279
right we've planned we've prototype in
and we've got feedback and we've

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:52.289
and we've got feedback and we've
 

00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:54.259
and we've got feedback and we've
iterated on that cycle we made some

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:54.269
iterated on that cycle we made some
 

00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:57.080
iterated on that cycle we made some
improvements and so we're done right

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.090
improvements and so we're done right
 

00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:59.120
improvements and so we're done right
we're ready to ship the project no no no

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.130
we're ready to ship the project no no no
 

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:06.610
we're ready to ship the project no no no
we're not going to ship our product yet

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:06.620
 

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.889
so what we're going to do is start the

00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899
so what we're going to do is start the
 

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:12.529
so what we're going to do is start the
production process and so what this

00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539
production process and so what this
 

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:15.560
production process and so what this
means is we're going to move forward

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.570
means is we're going to move forward
 

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.870
means is we're going to move forward
maybe mass producing something like

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880
maybe mass producing something like
 

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.210
maybe mass producing something like
Lantern

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.220
Lantern
 

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.399
Lantern
so Android things has many prototyping

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:22.409
so Android things has many prototyping
 

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:24.409
so Android things has many prototyping
tools to get you started after you've

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419
tools to get you started after you've
 

00:30:24.419 --> 00:30:26.120
tools to get you started after you've
completed your proof of concept and the

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.130
completed your proof of concept and the
 

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.310
completed your proof of concept and the
initial prototypes everything is working

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320
initial prototypes everything is working
 

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.899
initial prototypes everything is working
and you know what you want it to look

00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:29.909
and you know what you want it to look
 

00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:31.460
and you know what you want it to look
like and you know you want to move over

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:31.470
like and you know you want to move over
 

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.430
like and you know you want to move over
to a custom board this is easy because

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440
to a custom board this is easy because
 

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.259
to a custom board this is easy because
of the somme like I mentioned before you

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:36.269
of the somme like I mentioned before you
 

00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:38.299
of the somme like I mentioned before you
shouldn't have to redo all of the work

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:38.309
shouldn't have to redo all of the work
 

00:30:38.309 --> 00:30:39.560
shouldn't have to redo all of the work
that you did in the prototyping phase

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:39.570
that you did in the prototyping phase
 

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.389
that you did in the prototyping phase
just because you're using the same

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399
just because you're using the same
 

00:30:41.399 --> 00:30:45.049
just because you're using the same
architecture to create your products so

00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059
architecture to create your products so
 

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.430
architecture to create your products so
now let's say that I want to

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440
now let's say that I want to
 

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.879
now let's say that I want to
mass-produce lantern right and it's part

00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:49.889
mass-produce lantern right and it's part
 

00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:51.710
mass-produce lantern right and it's part
of the feedback process I wanted to

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720
of the feedback process I wanted to
 

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.350
of the feedback process I wanted to
learn more about factory production and

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360
learn more about factory production and
 

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.899
learn more about factory production and
bring up processes so I visit a few

00:30:56.899 --> 00:30:56.909
bring up processes so I visit a few
 

00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:59.810
bring up processes so I visit a few
factories in China as it turns out they

00:30:59.810 --> 00:30:59.820
factories in China as it turns out they
 

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.419
factories in China as it turns out they
have a process too and it Maps well to

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:02.429
have a process too and it Maps well to
 

00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:05.060
have a process too and it Maps well to
the overall product design process when

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:05.070
the overall product design process when
 

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.950
the overall product design process when
you mass-produce a product the factory

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960
you mass-produce a product the factory
 

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.590
you mass-produce a product the factory
will build out a line with stations each

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600
will build out a line with stations each
 

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.169
will build out a line with stations each
station is staffed with people who put

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179
station is staffed with people who put
 

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.750
station is staffed with people who put
together the product if I want millions

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760
together the product if I want millions
 

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.940
together the product if I want millions
of products or millions of lanterns the

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:16.950
of products or millions of lanterns the
 

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.100
of products or millions of lanterns the
factory might automate that process and

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.110
factory might automate that process and
 

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.870
factory might automate that process and
make some really cool robots and

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880
make some really cool robots and
 

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.269
make some really cool robots and
automate things with conveyor belts and

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279
automate things with conveyor belts and
 

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:25.940
automate things with conveyor belts and
those robots during the whole process

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:25.950
those robots during the whole process
 

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.190
those robots during the whole process
though it's good for you as a product

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200
though it's good for you as a product
 

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.379
though it's good for you as a product
designer to continue iterating on your

designer to continue iterating on your
 

00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:32.870
designer to continue iterating on your
product but probably leaning more

towards software instead of hardware

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:34.409
towards software instead of hardware
 

00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:38.629
towards software instead of hardware
changes and I'll show you why so you've

00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639
changes and I'll show you why so you've
 

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:40.970
changes and I'll show you why so you've
created 10 units perhaps in your

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:40.980
created 10 units perhaps in your
 

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.860
created 10 units perhaps in your
prototyping phase right and then you

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:42.870
prototyping phase right and then you
 

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.250
prototyping phase right and then you
send those off to the factory and there

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260
send those off to the factory and there
 

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.840
send those off to the factory and there
they're going to run everything through

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:47.850
they're going to run everything through
 

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.830
they're going to run everything through
something called a validation test and

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840
something called a validation test and
 

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.990
something called a validation test and
you start out with engineering

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000
you start out with engineering
 

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.760
you start out with engineering
validation tests so you send your

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:55.770
validation tests so you send your
 

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.200
validation tests so you send your
prototypes to the factory and they'll

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.210
prototypes to the factory and they'll
 

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:57.470
prototypes to the factory and they'll
say

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480
say
 

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.110
say
back maybe a hundred units and during

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120
back maybe a hundred units and during
 

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.669
back maybe a hundred units and during
that time you need to make sure that

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679
that time you need to make sure that
 

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:03.409
that time you need to make sure that
everything works with the materials that

00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419
everything works with the materials that
 

00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:05.270
everything works with the materials that
you've selected they're probably going

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:05.280
you've selected they're probably going
 

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.310
you've selected they're probably going
to be using soft tools possibly hard

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320
to be using soft tools possibly hard
 

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.680
to be using soft tools possibly hard
tools in this stage to create all of the

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:09.690
tools in this stage to create all of the
 

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.020
tools in this stage to create all of the
forms for your your industrial design

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.030
forms for your your industrial design
 

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.720
forms for your your industrial design
and then after that after you've

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:14.730
and then after that after you've
 

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.940
and then after that after you've
verified everything then you send any

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:16.950
verified everything then you send any
 

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.400
verified everything then you send any
feedback back to the factory and you

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:19.410
feedback back to the factory and you
 

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.700
feedback back to the factory and you
move on to design validation test this

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:22.710
move on to design validation test this
 

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.930
move on to design validation test this
is where you move on to stainless

this point the product design team
should be using Android things console

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.160
should be using Android things console
 

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.310
should be using Android things console
to update software and update all of the

testing throughout all of these phases
 

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.909
testing throughout all of these phases
then when you have feedback for the

00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919
then when you have feedback for the
 

00:32:43.919 --> 00:32:47.360
then when you have feedback for the
factory and you send things back then

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:47.370
factory and you send things back then
 

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.220
factory and you send things back then
you move on into the product validation

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.230
you move on into the product validation
 

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.530
you move on into the product validation
test this phase makes sure that

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:51.540
test this phase makes sure that
 

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.780
test this phase makes sure that
everything is moving as fast as possible

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:53.790
everything is moving as fast as possible

everything is moving as fast as possible
this is more for the factory than for

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.410
this is more for the factory than for
 

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.630
this is more for the factory than for
you they'll send you back around a

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640
you they'll send you back around a
 

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.180
you they'll send you back around a
thousand units and they're you should be

00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.190
thousand units and they're you should be
 

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.430
thousand units and they're you should be
continuing to use the console to run and

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440
continuing to use the console to run and
 

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.340
continuing to use the console to run and
test metrics on these devices and

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:03.350
test metrics on these devices and
 

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.870
test metrics on these devices and
finally for mass production you should

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880
finally for mass production you should
 

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.320
finally for mass production you should
be using the developer console to send

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:09.330
be using the developer console to send
 

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.020
be using the developer console to send
any zero updates if needed and gather

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.030
any zero updates if needed and gather
 

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.210
any zero updates if needed and gather
more metrics on these devices so as you

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220
more metrics on these devices so as you
 

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.400
more metrics on these devices so as you
can see here as you move through the

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:16.410
can see here as you move through the
 

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.860
can see here as you move through the
process they should be sending devices

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:18.870
process they should be sending devices
 

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:20.060

called the app library this allows you

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:50.400
called the app library this allows you
 

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.520
called the app library this allows you
to add apps to you can this allows you

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:52.530
to add apps to you can this allows you
 

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.650
to add apps to you can this allows you
to add apps to the app library and use

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:54.660
to add apps to the app library and use
 

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.360
to add apps to the app library and use
them on multiple projects so if you have

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.370
them on multiple projects so if you have
 

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.460
them on multiple projects so if you have
multiple lanterns for example you can

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:58.470
multiple lanterns for example you can
 

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.440
multiple lanterns for example you can
write one apk upload it to the App

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:00.450
write one apk upload it to the App
 

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.820
write one apk upload it to the App
library and then you can use it

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:01.830
library and then you can use it
 

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.039
library and then you can use it
throughout each of your different

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:04.049
throughout each of your different
 

00:34:04.049 --> 00:34:06.560
throughout each of your different
products

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:06.570
 

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.659
when you're ready to test over-the-air

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:08.669
when you're ready to test over-the-air
 

00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:11.060
when you're ready to test over-the-air
updates you can create releases and

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.070
updates you can create releases and
 

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.960
updates you can create releases and
channels and so sorry when you're ready

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:14.970
channels and so sorry when you're ready
 

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.630
channels and so sorry when you're ready
to build you can actually go through and

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:17.640
to build you can actually go through and
 

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.020
to build you can actually go through and
use the you can use the build settings

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.030
use the you can use the build settings
 

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.310
use the you can use the build settings
and then you can create a build

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320
and then you can create a build
 

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.169
and then you can create a build
individually and run through each of the

00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179
individually and run through each of the
 

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.669
individually and run through each of the
steps to set all of the firmware and

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679
steps to set all of the firmware and
 

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.740
steps to set all of the firmware and
software for your device and then you

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:27.750
software for your device and then you
 

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:34.010
software for your device and then you
create a build very seamlessly and when

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020
create a build very seamlessly and when
 

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.030
create a build very seamlessly and when
you're ready to test over-the-air

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040
you're ready to test over-the-air
 

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.710
you're ready to test over-the-air
updates you can create releases and

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720
updates you can create releases and
 

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.720
updates you can create releases and
channels you can push those releases to

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:38.730
channels you can push those releases to
 

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.190
channels you can push those releases to
channels so you can test your software

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200
channels so you can test your software
 

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.260
channels so you can test your software
in different groups for detailed testing

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.270
in different groups for detailed testing
 

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.659
in different groups for detailed testing
so for example here I'm creating custom

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:44.669
so for example here I'm creating custom
 

00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:46.760
so for example here I'm creating custom
channel I'm creating an update and I'm

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:46.770
channel I'm creating an update and I'm
 

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.380
channel I'm creating an update and I'm
going to push these updates to my

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:48.390
going to push these updates to my
 

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.970
going to push these updates to my
devices or my fleets of devices

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980
devices or my fleets of devices
 

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:56.270

wirelessly and finally after you release

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280
wirelessly and finally after you release
 

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.190
wirelessly and finally after you release
you can gather metrics to help you

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200
you can gather metrics to help you
 

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.810
you can gather metrics to help you
gather quantitative data on your

00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820

so for example in Lantern version 0.1

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:06.530
so for example in Lantern version 0.1
 

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.430
so for example in Lantern version 0.1
you have maybe a set set of features

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440
you have maybe a set set of features
 

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.590
you have maybe a set set of features
that you want to use and then you want

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:12.600
that you want to use and then you want
 

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.390
that you want to use and then you want
to move on in a quick draw you can do so

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400
to move on in a quick draw you can do so
 

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.820
to move on in a quick draw you can do so
fairly easily by using the build tool

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:16.830
fairly easily by using the build tool
 

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.380
fairly easily by using the build tool
and then you can check in metrics to see

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.390
and then you can check in metrics to see
 

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.490
and then you can check in metrics to see
if it's doing better and once your

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500
if it's doing better and once your
 

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.200
if it's doing better and once your
device is in the market the feedback

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:24.210
device is in the market the feedback
 

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.300
