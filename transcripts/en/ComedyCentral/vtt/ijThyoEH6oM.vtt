Marc Maron:  He pulls out
a little dime bag and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.540
he snorts it and he goes, "You
want some?" And I'm like, "I'm

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.943
driving, this is not the time to
try heroin."

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.231
Thank you everybody.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.465
If you don't know, 
here's what the

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.601
show is. It's just a bunch of
people and we're all telling

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:36.168
true stories.

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:37.303
You guys knows him from

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.605
WTF Podcast with Marc Maron.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:46.179
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Marc
Maron, everybody. 

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.581
Alright so this, this
is a comic story. Now,

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.584
comedians, we have to, you know,
we have to learn how to be

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:55.288
comedians and that takes time
and it takes writing jokes, but

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:59.425
it just takes doing it a lot.
And a very important thing about

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.994
being a comic that you learn
early on is that if you're

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:07.133
booked on a gig, you better do
your time. No more, no less. Do

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.436
your time. Now when I started
doing comedy, it was in Boston,

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.840
Massachusetts, and when I was
starting out I was just starting

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.776
to work and the way the shows
worked at that time is you do

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.579
road gigs and the first guy
would do a half an hour, the

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.181
headliner would do forty-five
minutes and that was the show.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:25.551
So now I'm just starting to open
and there was this dude who

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:29.188
moved to Boston from Cleveland,
no one knew who he was. All we

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.858
knew was that he didn't like his
name in the paper, he didn't

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.660
want his name on the marquee
because the IRS was after him

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:39.065
and an ex-wife. So this guy was
actually on the lamb doing live

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:43.202
stand-up comedy. These are the
kind of people that were around

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.939
doing comedy back in the day.
And this guy's name was Frankie

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:52.311
Bastille. Now I had to go pick
Frankie up to drive him to a gig

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.714
in Connecticut. We were going to
drive two and a half hours, me

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.150
and this guy I'd never met
before. So I go to this

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.418
apartment building and I'm
walking down this hallway to

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.121
pick this dude up and all I hear
from the end of the hall coming

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:04.724
from an apartment I can't quite
see is some guy going, "Where's

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:09.295
my tooth? Where's my fucking
tooth?" And I'm like, "What is

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:12.865
going on?" And I know on the
door and this dude opens up, he

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:15.401
looks like Keith Richards and
he's missing his front tooth. He

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:22.542
goes, "I'm Frankie, I can't find
my tooth." Alright, I'm Marc.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.544
He's like, "Alright, we gotta
find my tooth and then we go."

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.546
Um, Alright. So we look around
for the tooth for about twenty

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.548
minutes and he reaches into his
pocket and he goes, "Oh shit, I

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:32.351
got it," and he pops his tooth
into his face. So that was

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:35.388
Frankie. He had a Tibetan chant
tattooed around one arm, he had

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.390
some other tattoos on the other
arm, he looked like Keith

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.725
Richards and he talked like
that, he's like, "Alright, man,

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:42.728
we're gonna go." So I'm driving
in the car with this dude and

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.798
he's giving the lowdown on how
to do stand up, right. He's

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.267
like, "Gotta do your time, man.
It's the most important thing.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.237
That's the rules of the road,
you gotta do your time." And

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.340
right before I was about to go
on stage, he recited some poem

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:57.510
that he had written about the
road to me before I went on. I

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.979
wish to hell I could remember
it, but it was sort of like a

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:03.482
pirate shanty of some kind. So
now, like, I'm just starting

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:07.520
out. So I go on stage before him
at this place that had disco

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:11.224
balls, it was like just a bar in
Connecticut that was doing a

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:14.660
one-nighter. I go on stage, I'm
doing well, I do everything I

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:19.565
got. Every joke I have, I do all
of it. And then I stop and I go,

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.702
"Alright, thank you very much,
I'm Marc Maron, it's my pleasure

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:26.138
to bring up to the stage, he
works clubs and colleges all

00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:28.741
over, Frankie Bastille." They
all clap. Nothing, he doesn't

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:32.178
come up. Clapping stops, kind of
slows down. He doesn't come up.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:35.748
And I'm standing there, I'm
like, "Alright well, please

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:39.619
bring up Frankie Bastille."
Nothing. So now it's weird and

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.188
there's silence. And from the
back of the room I hear Frankie

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.959
go, "Twenty-six!" I'm like,
"What?" He goes, "You did

00:03:46.992 --> 00:03:52.999
twenty-six minutes, got four
minutes left!" So I do some

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.872
street joke I remember and I get
off and he goes on and kills, he

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:06.646
gets off. He goes, "Gotta do
your time, man."

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.980
And I worked with him a couple
other times.

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:13.819
Frankie was a doper and this is

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.621
one of the reasons why I love
stand-up comedy because I worked

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:17.690
with him a couple other times.
And I was doing blow at the

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:21.327
time, I was doing a little bit
of coke. And he was living in a

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.698
SRO off of Kenmore Square, you
know, and I said I'm gonna go

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:29.735
get some dope, some coke. And I
went to my dealer's house and

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.405
somehow I left with like, you
know, a half a gram and a guitar

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:39.445
amp. He was that kind of dealer.
He dealt to musicians so it was

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.915
sort of a pawn shop-slash-- So I
show up at Frankie's with this

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:46.519
half gram and I was going to do
some lines.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:47.787
He goes, "Can I do some?"

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.189
I'm like, "Yeah, it's fine." He
goes, "I'm going to shoot mine."

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:55.027
And I'm like, "Okay. I guess."

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.295
He goes, "You wanna watch?" I'm

00:04:56.328 --> 00:05:04.603
like, "Yeah, I do kinda."

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:05.905
He pulls out like something that

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:09.241
looks like, you know, the kind
of, I was never a dope guy, but

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.377
you know when you got
paraphernalia. He had this stuff

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.114
that was like, "Wow that stuff
looks pretty well used. It looks

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:18.551
like you love that equipment."
And, you know, it was the

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:21.687
fascinating thing to me about
this particular moment is he

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.124
tied himself off and then he
pulled some coke into the

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:28.561
syringe and he hit himself. And
like within thirty seconds he's

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:31.997
like, [inaudible]. And I'm like,
"Oh no, now we're in trouble."

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.834
He's like, [inaudible], this
stuff's cut with baking soda.

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:38.571
And I'm like; I thought it was
so impressive that he could

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:41.707
taste from the inside. I
thought, "This guy is really

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.578
something. Real junkie." And
then he got all hyper and

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.915
started sweating and started
talking about things. But here's

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:54.787
the last bit is like, okay. So I
got driving down to Cape Cod to

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.191
do a show at a Chinese
restaurant called Johnny E's.

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:04.764
They had like a Polynesian dance
show and then they had comedy.

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:08.234
And I'm driving Frankie about an
hour fifteen, an hour and a half

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:12.004
down there, however long it was.
And we're driving and he's

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:15.341
pulling out little bindles of
heroin and he's snorting them in

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:19.311
the car. So like he pulls out a
little dime bag and he snorts it

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:22.314
and he goes, "You want some?"
And I'm like, "I'm driving, this

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:25.351
is not the time to try heroin."

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:30.756
So like he does two bags of

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.226
heroin and he's done, man. He's
out. He's like nodding, like

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.931
he's out. And we pull up at
Johnny E's and I gotta walk him

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:41.967
in. So I'm walking this dude in
and I put him in a booth and he

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.439
just was like, "Gaaa"-- out. I
don't know what the hell to do.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:50.342
So I go up and I do my half
hour, I do my time.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.610
And now I'm bringing Frankie up

00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:55.581
and I don't know if he's even
awake. So I go, "Ladies and

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:58.684
gentleman, clubs and colleges
all over, please welcome Frankie

00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:02.788
Bastille." And like a second
didn't go by and he bounds onto

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:07.626
the stage and he does the most
animated show I have ever seen

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.497
in my life. He's sweating, he's
acting shit out, he gets a

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.634
standing ovation. Then he gets
off, we go out to the car, and

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:21.807
he's like, "Gaaaa." And I'm
driving, all I'm thinking is

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.909
like, "That dude is a
professional."

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:26.979
[applause]

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:28.113
He passed away.

00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:31.317
Rest in peace, Frankie Bastille.
Thank you very much.
