00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.839
Here's the solution. This is the code we had before. What we need to do is to

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.596
put it inside a try and add an exception handler. So now, when this code raises

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:13.254
an IOError, when the file can't be opened, we'll print our nice message and

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.316
maybe you came up with a more creative message than this one. After the try,

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.593
execution continues normally.
