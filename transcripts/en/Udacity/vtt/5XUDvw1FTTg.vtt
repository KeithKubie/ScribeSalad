Sleep is really important for learning. This is especially true for infants.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.352
There's a particular stage of sleep called rapid eye movement sleep that helps

00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:11.009
learning the most. This is when your eyes actually move back and forth really,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.565
really quickly. But Greg, why don't you tell em a little bit about that?

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:18.308
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure Lauren. You know, as it turns out, when babies sleep, they spend about 75%

00:00:18.308 --> 00:00:22.822
of their time in rapid eye movement sleep. Adults on the other hand are only

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.604
spending about 25% of their time in rapid eye movement sleep. Turns out this is

00:00:26.604 --> 00:00:31.200
not a coincidence. Because rapid eye movement sleep and brain growth are

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.514
related. Neuroscientists tell us that rapid eye movement sleep in fact

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:41.190
consolidates or makes stronger the neural growth involved in learning. So,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.490
babies' brains, because they're growing more, are spending more time in rapid

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.090
eye movement sleep.
