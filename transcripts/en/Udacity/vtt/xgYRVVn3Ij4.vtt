Okay, hopefully you realized that in this particular

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.740
situation, we're back to four possible genotypic combinations in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.660
our gametes. Having genes far enough apart on

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.550
the same chromosome allows alleles to be mixed and

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.860
matched in such a way that we can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.390
get those missing combinations that we wouldn't have gotten

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.430
otherwise if the genes were so close together

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.260
that they appeared linked. Just so you guys know,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.000
if you've had any trouble understanding this. This is one

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.370
of the most difficult concepts to understand as a beginner. But

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.700
it is also one of the most difficult concepts to

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.230
teach. So if you have trouble understanding this, it's probably all

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.740
my fault. And, what I'd really like for you to

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.260
do is go to the forums and chat with some of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
your fellow classmates. See what you've seen posted there. I'm going

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.120
to try to put some helpful links in the instructor's notes.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.670
Most of recombination is not something that we

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.620
really need a lot of for the rest of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.710
the class, other than understanding the importance of recombination

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.610
and how it provides genetic diversity. But if you

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.050
have any interest in understanding it better or knowing

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.810
more, please there are so many great resources out

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.910
there to help understand this. It is an amazing

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.410
phenomenon in biology and really is an evolutionary marvel.
