<v 1>Hey, I'm Becca Bressler.</v>

9
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.580
I'm the production manager here at Radiolab and I'm here to tell you about a new

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160
WMI c studios podcast called Cot,

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.070
that c a u g h T. Cot.

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.090
Do you remember when you were a kid or a teenager and you made a bad decision

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.210
and you said to yourself, if I just get away with it this one time,

14
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:48.830
I'll never do it again. Well,

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.730
our colleagues at w c studios are launching a new series about kids who aren't

16
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.960
so lucky. Caught, tells the stories of teenagers who make these thoughtless,

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.280
impulsive decisions and as a result gets sucked into a punitive juvenile justice

18
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:02.900
system that changes their lives.

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.350
You can find caught in iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.

Be sure to check it out and subscribe.

21
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.890
<v 3>Oh wait, you're listening.</v>

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.350
<v 4>Listening to radio lab radio from w n y.</v>

23
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.000
S. A. M. It was dismissed.

24
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.100
I was already dismissed from the day I was dismissed from,

25
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.950
I'm not even supposed to come back to my own. Everybody's so elated.

26
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:44.400
And I was kind of Moby and said, what's wrong with you? I said, well, I don't.

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.540
I like jury duty. So you're gone all day tomorrow? No, I'm not.

28
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.170
I'm here tomorrow. I'm drowned. Oh my God. Okay.

29
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.320
So if we want to do this tomorrow, we could teach things, but yeah, we could.

30
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.000
Oh, that's good. That's good to know. Okay, so Robert, let me see where,

31
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.530
where did we start? But I think we start where we left off,

32
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:04.060
right where we left off.

33
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:09.061
We thought we had simply the most fabulous animal of color wise in the world.

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.080
Champion of rainbows, of champion of rainbows. This is Radiolab by the way,

35
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.190
Chad Roberts. So, uh, seven ish years ago we did a show about colors.

36
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.630
We asked a very simple question,

37
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.830
who among us earthlings sees the best rainbow?

38
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.380
We crowned a champion and we're going to reevaluate that coronation right now as

39
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.990
one does as time passes and science advances. So, uh, we're gonna here's why.

40
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.110
Here's what I think we should do. I think we should play the original segment.

41
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.850
Yes. Because it is delightful.

42
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.260
You hear as the crowning of the champion and then we should reevaluate whether

43
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.950
the champion deserves to be crowned. OK. And uh, the, the early segment,

44
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.180
it started with Robert asking a question to a cognitive scientist by the name of

45
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.250
Mark Shane Jeezy. Well, here's a question.

46
00:02:55.251 --> 00:03:00.251
If a dog and the human and a crow where can be staring at a rainbow,

47
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.780
would they be seeing very different things? Yes.

48
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.390
Now this question that Robert just kind of tossed out during an interview with

49
00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.600
like about how different creatures would see the rainbow.

50
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.680
This ended up taking us down a little worm hole and we ended up actually getting

51
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.160
acquire to help us illustrate a, what we learned.

52
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.910
But just to set a baseline. Your normal rainbow goes like this,

53
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.100
starting bottom up. Three, two, one.

54
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.400
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

55
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.970
<v 6>red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. Roy G bit. Where'd you bev?</v>

56
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.380
<v 4>Yeah, the, I don't know why people put the I in there, but that's it.</v>

57
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.670
If you didn't have the indigo, you couldn't say it though. It'd be [inaudible].

58
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.700
That's why you need the, I think just to say the Roy g Bev,

59
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.680
you know that by the way is Tom Cronin.

60
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
I have what's called a visual ecologist. Mark suggested we give him a call.

61
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.150
He told us that human seat, seven colors in the rainbow,

62
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.250
and in the case of the dog, very different rainbow, it's gonna start off blue.

63
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:03.150
He'll be able to see blue just fine. So it was he a rainbow starting with blue,

64
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.640
same blue we see. And then grading off into

65
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.160
<v 7>green [inaudible] same green as us,</v>

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.840
and then disappearing. He would end there

67
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.890
<v 4>with a tiny bit of yellow throne. That's it. Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:19.250
So the rainbow would only be about half as thick as ours. Wow.

69
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.560
That's a sucky rainbow dog. Yeah.

70
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.730
That's why when God promised that he would never deliver another day,

71
00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.400
lose that he gave a paper, I made the promise and the rainbow,

72
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.590
the dogs just for totally unimpressed.

73
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.610
And what is it about the dog guy that makes it see this way?

74
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.050
It doesn't have red sensitive photo receptors. No red sensitive cones.

75
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.100
The weird thing is that the difference between dogs and us cone wise is just

76
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.070
one. They have cones tuned to blue and green. So do we.

77
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.570
But we have this one extra

78
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.310
<v 6>red, which doesn't really seem like a big difference. I mean it's just one comb,</v>

79
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.640
but have three is so much better than two.

80
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.500
That's Jane Nights Vision scientists,

81
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.920
because of this kind of multiplicative thing,

82
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.120
red can get mixed with blue chinks,

83
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.130
purple or red can get mixed with yellow to make orange and green to mix with

84
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.990
blue to get teal or turquoise.

85
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.490
And that's how we get about a hundred different shades of colored that we can

86
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.770
see. So by adding one

87
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.290
<v 4>photo pigment, instead of adding just one more color,</v>

88
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:27.010
you actually add about 98 colors or so. All right, let's move on.

89
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.010
So now we have a cro unless you'd like to change the bird.

90
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.410
Well the cro is not so interesting cause it's pretty much like us.

91
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.060
So let's take a LSA Co. If something like a um, a sparrow,

92
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.060
cause sparrows have ultraviolet vision, what do they see?

93
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.090
So they see the rainbow starts before our rainbow starts where we just see sky,

94
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.690
it would see an ultraviolet color.

95
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.240
<v 8>Then it would see the wireless</v>

96
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.350
N***a oranges, her first,

97
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.390
and then the red and probably would see further into the red that has because

98
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:07.190
they have the more red sensitive red receptor than we have.

99
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.620
So we see a much broader rainbow. We'll start earlier and it would end later.

100
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.663
<v 5>Woo.</v>

101
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.660
<v 4>So should we assume that we've now that this bow is the champion,</v>

102
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.310
but that's the, that's that's as high as it gets. If you're talking about Virta,

103
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.610
Brits, [inaudible] thing that has a heart and the mind and a,

104
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.980
once you leave the vertebrates then all bets are off.

105
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:34.770
You've got many animals have much better color vision than the vertebrates.

106
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.310
Like what? Butterflies are a great example.

107
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.370
Butterflies have five or six kinds of rays of color receptors.

108
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:44.840
We only have three. Remember butterflies see more colors than we do.

109
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.220
Yeah. So if a butterfly, we're looking at a rainbow.

110
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.390
I know they do. I'm sure.

111
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.850
I mean butterflies are out there and when the rain are out,

112
00:06:55.851 --> 00:06:56.840
but it was he colors.

113
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.380
We have no names for between the blues and the Greens and the Greens and the

114
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.150
yellows. Ooh. So it would go from ultraviolet. It would see that,

115
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.013
<v 8>that, yep.</v>

116
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.060
Then it would see violet and then blue and then blue,

117
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:14.680
blue, green. Yup. And Green, green, blue, blue e or whatever.

118
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.930
Right. And then an orange and red and all that.

119
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.400
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.050
<v 4>very complicated eyes. Okay. So just to recap, all right, here's the dog.</v>

121
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.700
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.660
<v 4>here's US humans.</v>

123
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.570
<v 5>Uh,</v>

124
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.403
<v 4>now the sparrow</v>

125
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.383
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.420
<v 4>more based, a little bit more high end, so to speak. And finally the butterfly</v>

127
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.730
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

128
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.920
<v 4>which is, you know, not so far above the sparrow,</v>

129
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:43.520
but it's got more mids in there. So I'm now thinking butter plot.

130
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.790
Butterflies get the crown. Yeah. But then you, if you go onto Carl reefs,

131
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.150
you come across these animals called mantis shrimps. What are they called?

132
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.800
Meta like Mantis, like a praying mantis. Oh, mantis shrimp. It was from catches.

133
00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:59.190
Pray using an arm like a praying mantis says oh managed.

134
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.490
Shrimps are are mostly pretty small about the size of a finger.

135
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.760
Some get to be as big as your forearm. Big Animals.

136
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.230
I'm actually looking this up right here. Oh. Oh my God.

137
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.530
They're so colorful. No, they are colorful though. Here, look at this.

138
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.860
Oh my God. They're just like a, it's like their electric colored. Yeah,

139
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.790
like turquoise or something iridescent in their eyes or like little cartoon eyes

140
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.770
. They're gigantic. Yeah. They have two really big eyes right on the front.

141
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.590
And you said that dogs have two cones. We have three.

142
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.590
How much does a butterfly have? Again, a butterfly has five.

143
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.100
Depends on the butterfly. A managed firms have 16

144
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.960
1616 kinds of receptors. What would the rainbow look like to them mean?

145
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:45.270
Could they even see it it, but see the rainbow fine goes.

146
00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:47.970
They live in very shallow water and so the water is pretty clear,

147
00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:51.600
almost like air. They would start the rainbow way, way, way inside.

148
00:08:51.601 --> 00:08:53.010
Where we see violet, they would see

149
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 5>ordinarily deep</v>

150
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 8>ultraviolet and then they would go on through several kinds of ultraviolet,</v>

151
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.100
probably five or six kinds of ultraviolet and then never get to violet, which,

152
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.881
which is another,

153
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:10.881
reaching our colors and go through violet and violet blue and blue and blue

154
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.994
green

155
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.780
<v 4>where they have those green bean blue blue blues as well. Yup.</v>

156
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.440
<v 5>[inaudible]. They would go out into the rent,</v>

157
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.730
so they would be about as red as us when they got to the red out,

158
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.090
but only in the red. Yeah.

159
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.690
<v 4>What a rainbow that must be. Yeah.</v>

160
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.800
They have the most complicated visual system of any animals by a factor of two

161
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:38.720
or more. Wait, wait, wait.

162
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.410
He said any do you mean you mean you mean that unequivocally? Any, yeah.

163
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.450
No other animal that we know of has a visual system within 50% is complicated.

164
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.050
Oh, right. Mantis

165
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.323
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

166
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.340
<v 8>but you know, on the other hand their brains are tiny,</v>

167
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:01.830
so who knows what then too.

168
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.850
They may not have the ability to perceive the beauty of the rainbow in the way.

169
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.270
No, I don't. I don't know. Their,

170
00:10:07.271 --> 00:10:10.800
their Venice from Sir into violence and how do we interviewed,

171
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.690
<v 4>they go around and kill things. That's, I mean really that's what they do.</v>

172
00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.560
That's, that's one reason they're so fascinating is how,

173
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:19.500
how would they have to go around and kill things? What did they say?

174
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.310
Shell crabs, other managed shrimps. Shrimps octopuses they'll kill octopuses.

175
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.650
Yeah. Small ones are good size matter.

176
00:10:26.651 --> 00:10:30.680
Shrimp will can break the wall of an aquarium where really, yeah, there's a,

177
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:34.280
there's ones in California that can break aquarium walls if they hit it hard.

178
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.100
Oh my gosh.

179
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.100
You have a pugnacious Mohammed Ali seagoing animal with incredibly great visual

180
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.523
sense

181
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.340
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

182
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.550
<v 4>special thanks to Jim Briggs, our engineer for the acquire session,</v>

183
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.420
which was a blast to mark Shank Jeezy for setting us off in this direction to

184
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.470
Michael Kirschner and the young New Yorkers Chorus and John McLay and

185
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.920
the Grease Church Curl Society and those folks from the collegiate chorale and

186
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:17.180
the DSF choirs who joined us and to Alex Ambrose of WQXR for getting everybody

187
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:18.950
together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

188

<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

189
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:34.711
<v 4>Okay,</v>

190
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:39.711
so here we are back in the present 2018 that was how we left it seven ish years

191
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:43.710
ago. And now we take it a second, somewhat more sober.

192
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:48.000
Look at this animal. Yes. Glorious achievements. Well, actually I get it.

193
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:53.050
We get to actually look at it like I, I I get to I n fact. Well, you know,

194
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.880
you met one. I did. I met the Cha,

195
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.410
I met the champ and we shared a moment, uh,

196
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.180
that I certainly will never forget.

197
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.010

<v 4>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad I remember Krulwich okay. So we,</v>

224
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:52.170
we did the thing about the mantis shrimp [inaudible] and um,

225
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.590
partially because of us, partially because I think just the world was ready.

226
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.010
The mantis shrimp has become a little bit of a celebrity animal.

227
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.020
It's become a quite popular little cartoon television. Yes.

228
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:07.210
It has had. It's had its, its had its moment. It has had its moment.

229
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.070
Well and deservedly so. When you think about what we, you know,

230
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.950
we like when you think about what its rods and cones apparently are able to

231
00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:15.320
appreciate. Yeah. You know,

232
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:19.890
you just want to close your eyes and imagine whatever it is that animal might be

233
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:24.750
seeing, which is what we tried to do seven years ago. Uh, but what as happens,

234
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.510
the science keeps going. And, uh,

235
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:30.860
one of the things that happened recently in the last few years is that the,

236
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.580
the people who study the Mantis shrimp,

237
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.800
they have released more knowledge about what it might be seeing.

238
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.010
And uh, we're going to update you on that, on that right now. Uh,

239
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.710
but first can I just tell you something? Yeah.

240
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.920
I actually got to meet a mantis shrimp of Kelp just very,

241
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:50.470
very recently in Brooklyn, as I recall. In Coney Island? Yes. Oh yeah.

242
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.010
I have dreamt at this moment, I must

243
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.770
<v 10>say. So the Mantis is in one of these tanks.</v>

244
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.400
You have one of these salt water tanks, producer Amanda and Ron Chick and I,

245
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.260
we found a fish store in Coney island.

246
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.490
It must be in murmur that actually had a real life mantis.

247
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.610
<v 11>Oh, hello. Wow.</v>

248
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.110
<v 10>It looks exactly as I imagined it. It's snow. Wow. There's so cool.</v>

249
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.880
You've sort of tucked away in an aquarium,

250
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.910
in the corner of this sort of dimly lit shop. The shop is run by this guy,

251
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.040
Chris Martin from creative crimination. Excellent. And this is your store? Yes.

252
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.590
Okay. And how long have you been here? Four years.

253
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.430
Chris sells all kinds of fish, tons of brutal starfish Urchin,

254
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.800
different kinds of clownfish. We have designer come on fish.

255
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.490
Have you ever heard of designer clownfish? Have you heard of this, nick?

256
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.470
Apparently these fashion designers are designing new clownfish so like you have

257
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:45.740
a Gucci ground for sure. Luby's Hong Kong. Yeah, definitely.

258
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:49.150
I should call designer clownfish. Just a little weird fish fact. Anyhow,

259
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:50.750
back to the uh, mantis.

260
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:55.370
It was in the corner of the shop in this aquarium of reinforced glass.

261
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.570
We actually got someone from Om Sri Lanka. This mentorship came from Sri Lanka.

262
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.290
Yeah. This is one of the stranger creatures I've ever seen.

263
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.820
And have you ever seen one of these things up close? Very, very stunningly call.

264
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:12.280
Oh my God. Oh my God. Well there it's just, I mean, astounding. Yeah.

265
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.990
These are called peacock because they're particularly colorful.

266
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.490
This is a particular guy that we saw.

267
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:19.280
He was hiding in a tube in the middle of the aquarium. He,

268
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.440
this was a peacock mantis shrimp as they're called.

269
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.940
So if you can imagine like it's got, it's their big, first of all,

270
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:29.570
they're like seven inches or so. So there's a big creature and uh,

271
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.950
if you can imagine the head of a hermit crab painted like a peacock,

272
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.600
stuck on the bright green slithering body of a miniature dragon.

273
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.320
That's what it looks like everyday through the weirdest looking thing that

274
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:43.250
you've ever seen. Yeah,

275
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:46.880
you can really see its eyes like swiveling in all different directions and they

276
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.240
have these really big googly eyes. They have beautiful eyes,

277
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.520
but we're looking at a peacock management is sitting in a lucite tube and it's

278
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:59.360
looking out at the world. It's treating the tube like it's, it's home borough,

279
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.950
which it would have. It was in the wild.

280
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.970
It's basically you're looking for something to eat. Okay. You said the voice,

281
00:17:04.971 --> 00:17:08.270
you just heard. That's a Tom Cronin, our mantis expert from the last segment.

282
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.250
He's your salesperson. No, he's [inaudible]. He's an expert. He's an expert.

283
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.620
Okay. I mean, he sells science.

284
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.130
He drove down from Baltimore to meet us and remember when he was telling us in

285
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.890
the last segment while ago that the Mantis or these violent little bastards,

286
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.610
they love to go around and kill things. Yes. He was not kidding.

287
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.820
I just want to like describe this to you before we talk about the vision.

288
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.210
All right,

289
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.210
we're staring at Peacock Mantis shrimp huddle in the tube in an aquarium.

290
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.470
And Chris is about to feed. Know what kind of,

291
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.840
what's the poor little blue thing that you're about to put in.

292
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.570
We're actually gonna feed them a Damsel fish at a certain point.

293
00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:43.880
Chris drops in this little blue fish.

294
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.700
It looks a little bit like Dory from that movie. So here it goes,

295
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.590
jumps it into the Mantas tank. Oh, fishes in

296
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.010
another fish is sensibly hiding in the back.

297
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.290
Fish is hiding behind the tube as the fish. Should

298
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.210
the little dory fish swim around for like, I don't know,

299
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:03.500
five minutes trying to find a way out. The whole time the Mantis was like icy,

300
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.880
calm, just chilling in. It's too. And then is it coming out? Is it coming out?

301
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.250
It's coming out. Launched out of it's too, but then

302
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.800
[inaudible] just like, wow, that was just so sudden.

303
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.040
You hear the snap is it hit it. I mean it made Amanda and I scream.

304
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.540
We just, we, it was shocking, you know,

305
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.510
cause they have these claws on the front of their body that they used to punch

306
00:18:29.511 --> 00:18:33.710
their prey and you can literally hear that snap from across the room.

307
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.710
And then he, and this was sad. He then took a lap and then came back and just,

308
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.613
Oh,

309
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.310
oh just punch the fish a few more times. Wow.

310
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.700
That's, that's hard. That's a hard ending for that. For the damn finish.

311
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.080
It's been hit three or four times now is one of those like nature moments where

312
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.620
you're sort of amazed, but you also sort of want to cry. But so, so okay,

313
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.620
so let's talk about his vision. No, he's just,

314
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.650
he's back in his hovel and he says cleaning his eyes now after it killed the

315
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:05.011
fish,

316
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:08.220
it went back to its tube and started kind of like scrubbing its eyeballs with

317
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.950
its little brushes. What he's doing is,

318
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:14.970
I think the important thing because it knows it's got the best eyes in the

319
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:17.010
house. He was like, did you see what I did to that fish?

320
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.980
Now check out my eyes and ask for what those eyes

321
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.050
<v 12>C R I r notion of that is totally changed over the last few years.</v>

322
00:19:24.051 --> 00:19:28.310
So a for that I'm gonna Bring in another marine biologist that Amanda talked to.

323
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.670
Do you mind introducing yourself? Uh, no. To who? To me, like I'm,

324
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.260
my name is professor Marshall and this is what I do for a living.

325
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.490
Do you want me to do that? No, no is good. No, it's good. Okay. Sorry. Hello,

326
00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:41.780
my name is Justin Marshall.

327
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:45.890
I'm a a marine biologists and neuroscientists working on the Great Barrier Reef

328
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.870
in Australia. Just for context,

329
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:54.980
he, Justin is the guy who basically put the mantis on the map. He, um,

330
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.880
he was the first guy, his lab was the first lab to,

331
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.100
to notice that they saw color at all. Oh yeah. I mean that was cool. That was,

332
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.830
um, the University of Sussex. It's about 1985, 96 apparently. Uh,

333
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.020
he had a colleague from, uh, West Africa who was wearing this particular dress.

334
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.230
You had this wonderfully colorful traditional dress on.

335
00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:15.500
She walks into his lab where he's got all the aquariums and immediately all the

336
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:17.630
Mantis shrimp were rushed to the beginning, to the top of the career.

337
00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:21.710
And they're like, hey, she walked in and the shrimps went wild.

338
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.573
What does that mean?

339
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.540
They started waving the appendages and they show off all that colors.

340
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.340
Now that I know a little bit about mantis shrimps,

341
00:20:28.341 --> 00:20:29.720
I know exactly what they were saying to her,

342
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.160
which would be entirely inappropriate. Oh they were. They were turned on.

343
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.110
They were all around and they were saying hello, colorful thing.

344
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:39.710
What should we do? So Justin was the guy that basically proved, okay,

345
00:20:39.711 --> 00:20:42.320
these animals have color vision, like they see color.

346
00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:45.650
He confirmed that with this experiment with colored containers,

347
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.380
with my districts,

348
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.930
you can get them to and just beat the living daylights out of a thing that's

349
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:52.590
colorful cause they love to smash things. Turning up.

350
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.330
<v 4>Uh, that was all background. Here's the new information.</v>

351
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.370
Recently Justin and his lab decided to ask a new question. He decided to say,

352
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:02.050
all right, these all these shrimp,

353
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:05.170
they have so many rods and cones in their eyes. And by the way,

354
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.320
he would say there were 12 rods and cones in their eyes and not 16 which is

355
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:11.110
still four times what we have. Right. So it's a lot. All right.

356
00:21:11.111 --> 00:21:14.140
They've got all these rods and cones. How well do they use them?

357
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.431
Wonder what that means.

358
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:18.880
How well do they use it and how can they must use them for some? Well,

359
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:20.470
it's sort of like if you're a scientist,

360
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:24.400
you can't just assume that they see things the way that we see things.

361
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:26.830
I mean you Kinda have to make sure it's right. So I mean, you know,

362
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.910
his simple question to start off was how well do they see different shades of

363
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:31.744
the same color?

364
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.700
<v 12>The kind of thing that we do at the grocery store all the time. So you know,</v>

365
00:21:35.701 --> 00:21:37.650
if you go pick a banana from a store,

366
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.060
even if you pick one that's just gone yellow, it's,

367
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.840
it's still a little bit green. Like is it too green,

368
00:21:42.841 --> 00:21:46.470
not yellow enough to yellow. You know, you use your eyes to make the call.

369
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.240
You wonder, can the shrimp do that?

370
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:52.260
Can this animal distinguish between this shade of red and that shade of Red,

371
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.260
this blue and that blue. Can they make those fine distinctions?

372
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.340
<v 4>Well, I assume so. Yeah, because they get all the rods and cones, right?</v>

373
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.830
I mean they wouldn't have all those things in their eyes if they weren't putting

374
00:22:01.831 --> 00:22:06.450
them to some extraordinary use in the obvious use would be more bluer board or

375
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.330
weren't sure exactly. But he wanted to be sure.

376
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.780
<v 12>So what you're, what you do is you say, alright mantis shrimp,</v>

377
00:22:11.781 --> 00:22:14.390
I'm going to give you food from this yellow thing.

378
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.540
So what he did basically is that he would show those shrimp, a yellow light,

379
00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:20.540
give him some food, yellow light food, yellow light food.

380
00:22:20.541 --> 00:22:24.710
They quickly learned that yellow means food. Cool. So then he shows the shrimp,

381
00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:28.760
a blue light where there is no food and naturally at learns to ignore that very

382
00:22:28.761 --> 00:22:31.330
quickly because the foods that the yellow, it's not at the blue, right?

383
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.760
Most animals can do this. But then what he did is he sort of mixed it up.

384
00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:37.100
He would gradually make the blue side,

385
00:22:37.101 --> 00:22:39.800
the non food side a little more yellow,

386
00:22:39.801 --> 00:22:43.040
very gradually he would shift the color from blue through to blue,

387
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:45.890
green through to green, then green, yellow,

388
00:22:45.891 --> 00:22:49.670
just to see if the shrimp could tell the difference between yellow,

389
00:22:49.671 --> 00:22:54.470
which means food and yellow, green, which doesn't mean food.

390
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.180
That's what we did and we expect it.

391
00:22:56.181 --> 00:23:00.860
The amount of shrimp to have far better distinction at that sort of level and

392
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.310
we're surprised to find that it was the worst animal on the planet so far.

393
00:23:04.311 --> 00:23:05.144
Tested.

394
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.280
<v 4>No, no, you're, are you exaggerating? No, no. Not at all.</v>

395
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.640
Our champion of the rainbow, what's the worst creature ever tested?

396
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.930
The worst. So in other words,

397
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.440
nature gives them a panoply of choice and then they can't tell the difference

398
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.600
then which the point of that that that there's something wrong with this theory.

399
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.570
I know it's kind of tragic. I am Benjamin Moore and I say to you,

400
00:23:29.571 --> 00:23:30.490
come to my pain style.

401
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:33.830
I'm going to show you 50 shades of purple and you can only see three.

402
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:35.930
Then what are you doing in there? Like, I don't know what you're doing.

403
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.070
They seem to have the equipment to see all the purple, all the colors,

404
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.550
all the many, many shades. Uh, but still they've got these amazing eyes,

405
00:23:43.551 --> 00:23:48.140
but they just don't seem to them the way that we do. I don't understand that.

406
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.240
Yeah. Okay. So

407
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.470
<v 12>this is where you need to start thinking about color and what colors are,</v>

408
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.940
I mean, according to Justin Marshall,

409
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:58.390
the basic thing to understand is that you don't actually see color with your

410
00:23:58.391 --> 00:24:00.610
eyes. I mean, you're taking the light with your eyes obviously,

411
00:24:00.611 --> 00:24:04.000
but then the color is received in your brain, right? And, um,

412
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.770
they have these little insect braids that don't seem to do color the way that

413
00:24:08.771 --> 00:24:11.650
our brains do. The way in which we see color is

414
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.570
if I see a thing, let's say somebody's wearing a blue sweater,

415
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.380
walking down the street, a nice looking lady or gentleman wearing a blue thing.

416
00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:22.600
And My blue photo receptor in my eye

417
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.150
gets really excited. So your brain is going to see that the blue,

418
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.470
it's blue sweater right now, if that blue sweater had a little bit of red in it,

419
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.040
the red photo receptor would also buzz, but not as loudly.

420
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.700
And it's actually the ratio of those excitations that gives my brain the

421
00:24:39.701 --> 00:24:42.520
sensation of color. Your brain will basically say, all right, got a lot of blue,

422
00:24:42.521 --> 00:24:43.650
a little bit of red. What could that be?

423
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.960
<v 4>The Magenta, that's what you end up seeing.</v>

424
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:50.780
Like your brain sort of paints the gap

425
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.850
<v 12>amount. So every animal on the planet sees color except for motis rooms.</v>

426
00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:02.010
<v 4>It's brain doesn't seem that interested in painting gaps.</v>

427
00:25:02.011 --> 00:25:07.011
So back in their segment when we said it sees a full throated wide voiced

428
00:25:08.101 --> 00:25:11.940
spectrum of color, like just ecstatic,

429
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.650
glorious vision, rainbow view of all creatures on earth.

430
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.760
That's we said, and that's what we said,

431
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:23.060
more more variety in the rainbow than we can or than anybody.

432
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.390
That was, I thought that was our thought. We might need to amend that. I mean,

433
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.020
so they still see colors that we don't see,

434
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.590
but they might not just be seeing as many colors as we thought.

435
00:25:34.591 --> 00:25:38.340
Like maybe their rainbow is more a series of, of rather

436
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.480
<v 8>focused discreet bands of color with not a lot in between.</v>

437
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:47.603
<v 5>Uh,</v>

438
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.540
<v 12>I am very, very well, that's actually extraordinarily puzzling.</v>

439
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:57.230
They're given the equipment that we used to see various shades of color and they

440
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:02.010
don't use it to see shades of color. What are they use it to see? Well,

441
00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:03.240
they use it to,

442
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.810
<v 4>uh, I mean this is all speculative, but uh, you know,</v>

443
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.780
Tom Cronin was telling us in the fish shop that like the science seems to be

444
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:15.710
heading towards this idea that they use colors to communicate.

445
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.730
And if that's the case, like they don't need to see all the colors.

446
00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:22.070
They just need to see the ones that mean something

447
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.590
<v 10>least in the ultraviolet. There's really good evidence now. Wait, it's not,</v>

448
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.341
it's not published.

449
00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:28.650
So I don't want to talk about too much because it's not my work.

450
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.010
But it looks like different parts of the UV have very different meanings.

451
00:26:32.011 --> 00:26:36.100
Like one part might mean fear. Don't go there.

452
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.300
Another might name sex. I'd like to get to know more about this.

453
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.670
<v 4>Maybe another part means home. Who knows?</v>

454
00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.070
It's certainly varies species to species.

455
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.220
<v 12>You were talking about the whole range of at least 500 species.</v>

456
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.540
So to sort of blanket and explanation over that is a bit simple.

457
00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.770
<v 4>But what you're saying is that instead of seeing rainbows, they're here,</v>

458
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.930
they're there having a conversation with the color. Yeah.

459
00:27:04.931 --> 00:27:07.720
Maybe they just listen to their vocabulary. That is,

460
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.290
they have all these rods and cones so they can talk to the world.

461
00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:15.040
Not that they can see the beauty of hand. This is complicated,

462
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:19.030
but they have the, they can do polarized light. Oh, do they can't,

463
00:27:19.031 --> 00:27:20.860
which is so hard to explain.

464
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.430
But apparently it's thought that some species can flash polarized light at each

465
00:27:24.431 --> 00:27:26.650
other as a way of communicating somehow.

466
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.900
I'm not even gonna try and explain that cause I don't get it.

467
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.110
<v 12>They are, uh,</v>

468
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:36.300
and unbelievably amazing and different system to any other animal on the planet.

469
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.210
So you've got to ask yourself the question why.

470
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.980
And I'd been asking myself that question for 30 years and I guess I'm a failure

471
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.910
cause I still haven't answered it. So you could call me a failed biologist.

472
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.760
I don't think we would do that. I don't think we're going to do

473
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.340
<v 4>that. That seems really, yeah, that seems not really true.</v>

474
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:58.930
If you had to distill the new information that you had, that you have,

475
00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:00.760
how would you explain it? Like the,

476
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:05.230
the thing that we know now that we didn't know 10 years ago is this. Um,

477
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.210
there were, do you fucking weird,

478
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.380
you know what I'm left with, as I said, at the end of the day, I mean, you know,

479
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.700
yeah, it has eyes. We have eyes, we assume that it's eyes do for it.

480
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:23.160
What our eyes do for us, but apparently not.

481
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:25.590
And I don't think acquire is going to bridge this gap.

482
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:30.590
That's what's called an indivil cause like every animal in the world lives with

483
00:28:30.591 --> 00:28:33.200
its own senses in a world that is defined by those senses.

484
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.190
And in a way it's one of those tragic things and it's try as you will.

485
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.580
You will never know what a batch knows. When an echo aides,

486
00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:44.090
you will never know what a deer when it looks out,

487
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.260
because we know that deer don't see our injustice by all the hundreds.

488
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.700
We are bright orange and yellow. They just don't see that range.

489
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.980
Do they see more of something else? I don't know. Well, how do,

490
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:57.470
what's an own belt? It's UMW. It's, it's a great word.

491
00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.580
It's the word that says that you are limited by what you can feel.

492
00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:08.210
Touch, smell, see. Yeah. Know on some level,

493
00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:11.030
I mean I feel like that's a problem that exist even between people of color.

494
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.380
You know what I mean? It's like I have,

495
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.490
I know regularly have moments with my wife where I'm laying nothing that's not

496
00:29:16.491 --> 00:29:19.100
blue and she's like, yeah, it's totally blue. I have that too.

497
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.250
I have it all the time. Sometimes when I don't have,

498
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.190
I have no idea what you're seeing right now and you know that's the lonely part.

499
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.510
The unloading the part is that you can try. Oh

500
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.490
yeah, that is it. It is really fun to try

501
00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:42.743
[inaudible]

502
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.830
<v 6>so we'll just keep trying.</v>

513
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.580
<v 4>one final note, uh, after we wrapped up this episode, uh,</v>

514
00:31:29.581 --> 00:31:32.940
we learned that one of the members of our shrimp choir,

515
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.430
a baritone by the name of Daniel Thompson,

516
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.060
was one of the five people who died in the tragic helicopter accident that

517
00:31:41.491 --> 00:31:44.460
happened over the East River. Uh, this past Sunday night,

518
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.230
we at radio lab were devastated to hear this news and we're sending our thoughts

519
00:31:49.231 --> 00:31:52.830
to his family and to the rest of the choir and we would like to dedicate this

520
00:31:52.831 --> 00:31:53.664
episode to him.
