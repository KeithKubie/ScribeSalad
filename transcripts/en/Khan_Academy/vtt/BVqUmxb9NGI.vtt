00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:09.310
- I couldn't stand up in front of a crowd.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.780
Everything was just intimidating to me.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.635
- I was a fish out of water.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.620
They're gonna think I'm a
crazy girl with a camera

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.059
asking them do a pose for me.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:18.223
This is for the yearbook.

00:00:18.223 --> 00:00:19.727
- Oh, you should join the band.

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:22.058
I'm, like, I don't know.

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:24.836
- I've always been short,
so I'm just thinking

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:27.356
about the others watching me.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.547
- I can't even count how nervous I was.

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:31.165
- [Girl] Like the year before I was.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:31.998
- [Girl] I feel free.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:32.958
- [Boy] Then make it creative.

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.733
- [Girl] I didn't like anybody.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.656
- [Girl] There is no reason to go

00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:39.989
if you're not going to give it your all.

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:50.029
- It's really hard studying for the SAT

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:51.769
especially as a senior because you have

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.519
so many things to do.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.135
- Whether you want to do it or
you don't, it all starts now.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.743
- I will feel confident
if I practice more.

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:07.910
- Some people come in talented,
but that's not enough.

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:12.363
You have to set goals
that you have to hit.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:15.402
- I will put a 110% 'cause
this is what I want to do.

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:19.152
This is my goal, and I
want to accomplish it.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.093
- Look at me now.

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.282
I'm number one, I'm in charge.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:24.782
To the rear heart.

00:01:28.568 --> 00:01:32.573
- If it's state championship
or test like the SAT,

00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:36.740
it all comes from practice
which you've been doing before.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.319
- You shouldn't be as scared
to do it the second time

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.473
because you already know what to expect.

00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:43.854
- The point of doing it is so your brain

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:48.021
has that muscle memory like a
second nature kind of thing.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:52.603
- You've got it.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.436
You remember this.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.429
- [Boy] The game goes silent.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.012
(upbeat music)

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.114
- In the moment, you don't really realize

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.460
that shift of confidence.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.445
- You've trained so hard
to know what to expect,

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.862
and then once you see it, it's like, wow!
