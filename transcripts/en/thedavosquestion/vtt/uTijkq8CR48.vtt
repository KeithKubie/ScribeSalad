&gt;&gt;Uh I think that 2009 the economy will be
slow prospects, and till the middle and we're

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:15.870
talking about third quarter 2009. The confidence

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.089
economy restored again we really have to get
the banks start lending, and then have the

confidence level of the investors to start
investing again.
