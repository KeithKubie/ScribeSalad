00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] Let's continue thinking

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.610
about how rational agents make decisions.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.410
So here we're told that
Sally runs a business

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.450
that only sells hamburgers
in a building she owns.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.770
Every month, they sell 5,000 hamburgers

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.240
at $5 per hamburger.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.900
She spends $2 per hamburger
on supplies, bread, meat,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.310
lettuce, et cetera.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.150
She also pays Mike and
Raj each $2,500 per month

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.100
to work at the restaurant.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.470
Finally, utilities cost $500 per month.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.820
Sally works full-time at the restaurant

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.250
and keeps the accounting
profits for herself.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.460
What is the accounting
profit of the business?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.000
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.370
All right now let's think
about this together.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.900
We're gonna think about
it in terms of some

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.580
of the types of costs we've
thought about in the past.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.430
So when we think about benefits,
and here we could think

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.710
about it to a firm, although
it's fully owned by Sally,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.860
the benefit to a firm of
doing business is its revenue.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.510
So the total revenue that she collects,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.720
and everything we're gonna be doing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.913
is going to be per month,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.290
so her total revenue is going
to be her price times quantity

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.100
so it's going to be 5,000
hamburgers at $5 per hamburger.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.740
So that is going to be $25,000.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.520
Once again, all of this
is going to be per month.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.100
So once again, we can view
this as the total benefit

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.210
that the firm, that her
business, is getting.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210
And now let's think about the costs.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.140
So first we could think about
the cost of her supplies.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.940
It's oftentimes referred
to costs of goods sold,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.870
but I'll just write supplies here.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.870
So costs, costs colon, so
let's put supplies, supplies.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.050
That would be 5,000 hamburgers
times $2 per hamburger,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.580
so that's a $10,000 cost, $10,000.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.350
Then she has the cost of her employees.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.860
So employees, I'll just write it,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.680
I'll abbreviate it like that.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.890
What's that going to be?

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.876
Well she has two folks
at $2,500 per month each.

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:15.876
So that's going to be $5,000,
two times $2,500, $5,000.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.350
And then last but not least,
she has her utilities.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.050
So utilities, let's do util for short.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.050
That's going to be $500 per month.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.340
And so from this we can
calculate the accounting profit.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.340
So we get the accounting
profit, accounting profit,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.277
is going to be 25,000 minus 15,500.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.170
That's going to be $9,500 per month.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.200
And she gets to keep all of this,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.530
and so this seems like a
pretty good amount of money

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.530
to be earning.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.220
She's earning six figures a year.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.250
But the question is, is it
rational for her to do this?

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.190
Well some of you might
be correctly thinking,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.850
well in order to determine
whether it's rational

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.360
for her to continue running this business,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.710
we have to know what
the implicit costs are.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.380
Here we've only just looked
at the explicit costs,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.890
and the most important
of the implicit costs

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.460
is the opportunity cost.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.000
And to factor that, we have to know,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.700
well maybe what she could've
rented her building out,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.120
if she wasn't running
this burger business,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.340
and maybe what she could do with her time

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.530
if she wasn't working at
the business full-time.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.540
So we need a little bit more
information and let's see

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.490
if we can get that.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.410
So now we are told that Sally
could rent out her building

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.190
for $5,000 per month.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.110
She can also make $6,000
per month as an accountant.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.440
Based on this, what is the
economic profit of her business?

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.190
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.830
Well one way to think about it is,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.880
we can start with our accounting profit

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.400
and then subtract out
all the implicit costs,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.360
especially these opportunity
costs right over here.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.493
So her opportunity
cost, opportunity costs,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.850
are going to be per month,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.420
well if she doesn't run this business,

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.210
she could rent out her
building for $5,000 per month

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.360
and then if she wasn't
doing this full-time,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.117
she could make $6,000 per
month as an accountant,

00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:32.650
$6,000 right over there.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.417
And so her opportunity costs
are a total of $11,000.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.960
And so now her economic profit would be

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.960
her total benefit minus her explicit costs

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.460
minus her implicit costs.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.787
Her economic profit, economic profit,

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.170
is going to be, well we
could start at the 9,500

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.550
and subtract the 11,000,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.097
it is negative $1,500.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.430
It's important to realize,
because economic profit

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.470
always factors in the explicit costs

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.218
and then other potential implicit costs,

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:19.150
economic profit will never be higher

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.310
than accounting profit.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.290
And assuming there are
some implicit costs,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.950
it'll always be lower
than accounting profit.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.410
So now based on all of
what we've explored,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.310
is it rational for Sally
to continue running

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.413
her burger business?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.830
Well based on the
information we've been given,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.030
it doesn't seem rational
for her to continue

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.730
running her burger business.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.060
She makes $9,500 in accounting profit

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.500
from the business, but
she's incurring $11,000

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.470
of opportunity cost to do so.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.850
And that's what makes her
economic profit negative.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.490
This is not rational.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.310
Now if we had more information,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.500
maybe she hates being an accountant.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.680
Maybe there's a benefit for her working

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.513
at the burger business.

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:03.140
She has more flexibility with her time,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.980
she likes being self-employed,
she doesn't have

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.450
to listen to her manager
tell her want to do.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.980
If that were the case,
then it would change

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.820
the calculations some
because there would be

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.360
an extra benefit from her
running her burger joint.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.656
But we don't know, and based
on the information we have,

00:06:18.656 --> 00:06:21.883
it doesn't seem rational
for her to continue.
