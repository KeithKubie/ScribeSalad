00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; So, here's a quiz using this notion of conditional

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.020
independence. So, bear with me for a second, because this is

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.530
a little bit weird the way that I wrote it. But,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.440
what I'd like you to do is find a truth setting

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.444
for thunder and lightning. So like, true/true or true/false or false/true

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:18.590
or false/false. Such that, the following thing holds true. That the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.070
probability that thunder takes on that value, given that lightning takes

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.090
on the value that you give, and the storm is true,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.260
ends up equaling the probability that thunder takes on

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.666
that value given lightning takes on the value that you

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.207
gave and storm is false. Right, so a setting

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:37.670
here so that basically the value of storm doesn't matter.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.250
&gt;&gt; So, whatever I put in the upper left box

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.700
has to be what I put in the lower left

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.340
box. What I put in the upper right box has

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.610
to be what I put in the lower right box.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.090
&gt;&gt; Right and in fact we're just not going to give you boxes for the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.100
other ones. We'll just give you the two top boxes and automatically fill in the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.540
bottom box.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, that seems reasonable.
