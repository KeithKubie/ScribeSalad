00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.790
No the data science and artificial
intelligence have a lot in common.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.290
Everything we just heard
from Dave was about

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.570
building models to understand data.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.349
Artificial intelligence as Sebastian and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.410
Ashok described was about intelligently
reacting to incoming data.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.930
If you recall the axis that Ashok drew,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.380
in machine learning we're interested
specifically in thinking optimally.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.420
We don't necessarily want to design
systems that think the way we do.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.750
We want to design systems
that think better than we do.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.640
At least in some ways.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.530
We want to design systems that
can learn from much larger

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.420
quantities of data much
more quickly than we can.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.240
That's why we covered Bayes' Rule
in data science here as well.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.190
Machine learning is largely about
looking at the data we have and learning

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.460
the mechanisms that gave rise to it
are learning the models that explain it.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.650
So let's move on to
machine learning itself.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.960
Let's start by hearing from Sebastian
through and Katie Malone for

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.690
you to ask these own
machine learning class.
