00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.567
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:02.735
[camera shutter clicks]

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.438
- IT'S A WEIRD ONE--
NOTHING OUT OF PLACE,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.406
NO MURDER WEAPON.
- AND NO MOTIVE.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.743
THERE'S JUST A COUPLE
LYING DEAD IN THEIR BED.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.012
- THE PROOF IS ALWAYS
OUT THERE, DETECTIVES.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.381
YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW
WHERE TO FIND THE PUDDING.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.116
- EXCUSE ME, SIR, YOU CAN'T BE
HERE--THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.519
- SAMWELL, IT'S OKAY.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.989
HE'S THE GREATEST SEX-CRIME
INVESTIGATOR IN HISTORY.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.390
IF IT ISN'T
DETECTIVE CHUCK VAUGHAN.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.925
- DETECTIVE SALLY FERGUSON.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.326
- WE COULD USE A GENIUS
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:30.496
- TOM SAMWELL.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.131
- WHAT HAVE WE GOT, SAMWELL?

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.034
- WELL, VAUGHAN, WE'VE GOT
OURSELVES A HARD CASE HERE.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.770
ALL WE'VE GOT IS--
- TWO BODIES, BOTH DEAD, NAKED--

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.306
ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN IN THE BED,

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.274
TWO SCENTED CANDLES
BY THE NIGHTSTAND.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:43.509
- HOW DID YOU--
- SHH.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.278
- NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.513
HE LOVED THE WAY THEY SMELLED.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.215
[sniffing]

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.750
HE WANTED TO CROSS
THE THRESHOLD

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.085
THE WAY THEY HAD
ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.921
[sighs]
YOU DIRTY DOG.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.456
[chuckles]

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.360
HE WOULD'VE EXPERIENCED
THAT PLEASURE RIGHT HERE.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.098
[pants unzip]
[groaning loudly]

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.973
ANNIVERSARY--THE COUPLE
WAS TOGETHER FOR A WHILE,

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:17.109
WANTED TO SPICE THINGS UP.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.179
CHECK THE DATE
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH.

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.085
- VAUGHAN'S RIGHT.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.387
TODAY WAS THEIR 15TH WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.956
THIS IS HUGE.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.858
- AND WHAT THE [bleep]
WAS THAT?

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.460
YOU JUST PULLED YOUR DICK OUT

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.130
AND STARTED JERKING OFF
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.999
- SAMWELL,
HE'S THE BEST THERE IS.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.001
BY PUTTING HIMSELF
IN THE PERPETRATOR'S MIND-SET,

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.337
HE'S ABLE TO SOLVE CRIMES
THAT INVOLVE SEX.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.537
BAG THIS UP.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:48.507
- SOME CALL IT A BLESSING.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:49.909
IT'S MORE LIKE A CURSE.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.310
- IS THAT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.479
- [sniffing]

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.980
THREESOME.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.017
[sighs]

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.387
YOU WANTED TO SEE THEM,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.156
YOU WANTED TO WATCH.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.325
25 FEET FROM THE BEDROOM,

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.761
ACROSS THE KITCHEN, YOU...

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.363
[huffing]

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.600
YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE THEIR FLESH YET, DID YOU?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.436
NO. HE STOOD RIGHT HERE.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:20.406
[pants unzip]
[groaning loudly]

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.285
ROLE PLAY GONE WRONG.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.954
CHECK THE LOGS.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:42.195
- WE'VE GOT A BLOODY FIRE POKER.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.330
WE'VE GOT OUR MURDER WEAPON.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.866
- UM, WHY DO YOUR REVELATIONS

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.568
REQUIRE MASTURBATION?

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.070
- WHY DO KITTENS REQUIRE MILK?

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.372
- NOPE, NOT THE SAME THING.
- HEY.

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:57.343
HEY, HE'S THE MOST BRILLIANT
GODDAMN DETECTIVE I KNOW.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.612
PUT YOUR EGO ASIDE
AND GIVE VAUGHAN HIS SPACE.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.948
- MY EGO?
WE GOT CAPTAIN PUDPULLER

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.050
FLINGING HIS FLUIDS
ALL OVER THE CRIME SCENE.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.185
- WAIT.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:09.021
HE KNEW THEM.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:10.222
HE--

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:13.259
THEY WERE CLOSE, SO CLOSE,
TOO CLOSE.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.562
HE--HE...

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:20.632
I THINK HE KNEW THE HOUSE.

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:23.369
WHY?

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.740
WHAT DID YOU WANT,
YOU SICK BASTARD?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.910
YOU WANTED TO SEE...

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.046
WHAT HE SAW EVERY DAY...

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.415
ONLY CLOSER...

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:38.084
CLOSER.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.522
HE WAS CLOSE TO HOME.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:45.558
[groaning loudly]

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.371
THERE'S OUR MAN.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.840
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO GET HIM.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.208
GO, GO!
- HOW DID YOU--

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:09.048
VAUGHAN, THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:12.151
I'M SORRY THAT I DOUBTED YOU.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.454
YOUR METHODS
ARE UNORTHODOX, BUT...

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.323
I CANNOT ARGUE
WITH YOUR RESULTS.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.625
[zipper closes]

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:20.793
- NO HARD FEELINGS?

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.562
- UH, NO, NOPE,
NOT GONNA DO THAT.
