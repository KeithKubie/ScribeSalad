00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.337
As we go to our next game,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.640
Conspiracy on the Conspira-Seas.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.813
It's spring break time,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.381
which means thousands
of depraved college students

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.483
will be filing onto cruise ships
across the seven seas.

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:18.585
But this year they may have to
share the decks

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.887
with another group of people

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.688
who should be separated
from society:

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.190
conspiracy theorists!

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.259
Uh, this is absolutely true.

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.528
It's a conspiracy-themed cruise.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.430
I would literally rather be on
a boat raided by Somali pirates

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.100
than floating around
on this barge

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.202
full of gray ponytails.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.204
According to Jezebel,
the Conspira-Sea Cruise

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.007
took its maiden voyage
in January. Or did it?!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.677
I'm kidding. Uh, with
the stated goal of uncovering

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.280
the "mind-blowing truth"
about Monsanto,

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.282
bee colony collapse, autism,
and, of course,

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.952
why the cruise has a mysterious
30:1 male-to-female ratio,

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.555
all while drinking
double margaritas

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:57.090
during '80s Karaoke Night
on Deck B.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.359
With Isaac. Comedians,

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.161
what are some things
you might overhear

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.964
on a conspiracy theory cruise?
In 60 seconds and begin.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.900
-Drew.
-Chocolate Tower 7 is down.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.703
-I think it was an inside job.
-All right, points.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.372
-Andy.
-Me? No, I love vaccines.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.641
In fact, this piÃ±a colada
is full of them.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.643
All right, points. Andy.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.112
Maybe I did take a (bleep)
in the pool.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.648
Or maybe we all took a (bleep)
in the pool.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.917
-Whoa...
-Points.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.453
Well, I guess...

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.857
I guess that would explain
all the (bleep) in the pool.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.460
-Drew. -I wish my tummy was
as flat as the Earth.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.263
Points. Kulap.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.866
I'm beginning to think
that all of the bodies of water

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.668
-are somehow connected.
-All right, points.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.537
-Andy.
-I heard that Han Solo

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.205
and Indiana Jones
are the same guy.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:47.808
-Whoa...
-Points.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.345
-Drew. -Uh, meet you
at the Grassy Knoll Bar.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:51.445
-We're taking shots.
-All right. Points. -Oh! Drew!
