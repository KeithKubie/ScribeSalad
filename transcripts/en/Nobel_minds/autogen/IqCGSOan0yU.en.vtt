religious philosopher by doubting we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
religious philosopher by doubting we
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330
religious philosopher by doubting we
come to question and by questioning we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
come to question and by questioning we
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.700
come to question and by questioning we
arrive at truth

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710
arrive at truth
 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.850

now as everything that we do in science

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
now as everything that we do in science
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.609
now as everything that we do in science
depends on evidence what does it mean it

means well for instance I have a four

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
means well for instance I have a four
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920
means well for instance I have a four
out of five rule which is if you have a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
out of five rule which is if you have a
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.410
out of five rule which is if you have a
theory and by that you might some people

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
theory and by that you might some people
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.339
theory and by that you might some people
say a hypothesis that about something

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
say a hypothesis that about something
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.680
say a hypothesis that about something
then you make an observation

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
then you make an observation
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.630
then you make an observation
we'll really think of three or four or

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
we'll really think of three or four or
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.410
we'll really think of three or four or
five other questions that need to be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
five other questions that need to be
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.470
five other questions that need to be
answered if you to ensure that your

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
answered if you to ensure that your
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.210
answered if you to ensure that your
hypothesis is correct if four out of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
hypothesis is correct if four out of
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.020
hypothesis is correct if four out of
five of your experiments work then

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030
five of your experiments work then
 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.119
five of your experiments work then
you're almost and I say almost certainly

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129
you're almost and I say almost certainly
 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.270
you're almost and I say almost certainly
right if only one out of five fit your

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280
right if only one out of five fit your
 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.130
right if only one out of five fit your
almost and I stress almost certainly

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
almost and I stress almost certainly
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.710
almost and I stress almost certainly
wrong and that was the case for c60

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
wrong and that was the case for c60
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.350
wrong and that was the case for c60
basically we did several experiments

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
basically we did several experiments
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.120
basically we did several experiments
after we conjectured that it was a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
after we conjectured that it was a
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.370
after we conjectured that it was a
soccer ball and four out of five or was

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
soccer ball and four out of five or was
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.890
soccer ball and four out of five or was
five out of five all fitted for instance

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
five out of five all fitted for instance
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.100
five out of five all fitted for instance
seventy had to be the second magic

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
seventy had to be the second magic
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.490
seventy had to be the second magic
number which it was you could put

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
number which it was you could put
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110
number which it was you could put
something on the inside so it's a cage

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
something on the inside so it's a cage
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.729
something on the inside so it's a cage
and Rick and Bob found that as you made

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
and Rick and Bob found that as you made
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.119
and Rick and Bob found that as you made
the case smaller you could put oh yeah

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129
the case smaller you could put oh yeah
 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.619
the case smaller you could put oh yeah
you could only put smaller smaller atoms

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629
you could only put smaller smaller atoms
 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.690
you could only put smaller smaller atoms
there were lots of little pointers to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
there were lots of little pointers to
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.970
there were lots of little pointers to
indicate that that we were correct and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
indicate that that we were correct and
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.610
indicate that that we were correct and
we were fundamentally proven to be sold

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
we were fundamentally proven to be sold
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.710

when I say there is a conflict between
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.170
when I say there is a conflict between
science and religion there are some

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
science and religion there are some
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.440
science and religion there are some
scientists who say that's not the case

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
scientists who say that's not the case
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.150

don't think there's any evidence for

don't think there's any evidence for
this that doesn't mean that religion

this that doesn't mean that religion
 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.610
this that doesn't mean that religion
isn't important it's important to a lot

you could say I say I'm an atheist then

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830
you could say I say I'm an atheist then
 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.499
you could say I say I'm an atheist then
some people said well you can't be an

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
agnostic well okay but what are you
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.089

agnostic about I mean you know okay I so

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.249

that mean it means that you can't prove

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240
that mean it means that you can't prove
 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.860
that mean it means that you can't prove
you can't there's no proof there isn't a

god well all right fair enough but what

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789
god well all right fair enough but what
 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.600
god well all right fair enough but what
do you mean by God what is this concept

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610
do you mean by God what is this concept
 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.730
do you mean by God what is this concept
of the God that you're talking about and

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740
of the God that you're talking about and

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.800
I can't think I don't I've no no one's
ever come up to me and give me a concept

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810
ever come up to me and give me a concept
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.809
ever come up to me and give me a concept
of a god to be agnostic about so if you

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819
of a god to be agnostic about so if you
 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:36.860
of a god to be agnostic about so if you
say you're agnostic what are you

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870
say you're agnostic what are you
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.870
say you're agnostic what are you
agnostic about and then the whole thing

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880
agnostic about and then the whole thing
 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.269
agnostic about and then the whole thing
falls into things that don't make sense

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279
falls into things that don't make sense
 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.899
falls into things that don't make sense
it just doesn't make sense to me and

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909
it just doesn't make sense to me and
 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.010
it just doesn't make sense to me and
things have to make sense I'm a

something quite different from the

something quite different from the
average from a lot of people and that's

where the conflict lies now there are

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010
where the conflict lies now there are
 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.120
where the conflict lies now there are
some scientists who do believe in God

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130
some scientists who do believe in God
 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.320
some scientists who do believe in God
that God and but they're very small

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330
that God and but they're very small
 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.110
that God and but they're very small
number of good scientists I mean it's

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120
number of good scientists I mean it's
 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.480
number of good scientists I mean it's
less than 10 percent so if we're talking

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490
less than 10 percent so if we're talking
 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.400
less than 10 percent so if we're talking
about statistics and I think that's the

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410
about statistics and I think that's the
 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.740
about statistics and I think that's the
case and there is a very small number

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750
case and there is a very small number
 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.350
case and there is a very small number
and I don't know very many scientists

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
and I don't know very many scientists
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.630
and I don't know very many scientists
actually I personally know very few

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:38.640
actually I personally know very few
 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.050
actually I personally know very few
scientists who I mean there do know some

scientists who I mean there do know some
 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.350
scientists who I mean there do know some
now that doesn't mean I don't I'm not

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360
now that doesn't mean I don't I'm not
 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.060
now that doesn't mean I don't I'm not

but the conflict is a serious one in the

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640
but the conflict is a serious one in the
 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.130
but the conflict is a serious one in the
ethical sense because if you accept as I

true then you see there's an ethical

true then you see there's an ethical
 

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.770
true then you see there's an ethical
issue in teaching in schools and the

good scientists whatever that means but

00:08:25.219 --> 00:08:25.229
good scientists whatever that means but
 

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.770
good scientists whatever that means but
I cut off the right I think they have to

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780
I cut off the right I think they have to
 

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.880
I cut off the right I think they have to
have some sort of intellectual

this is where evidence base and here is

this is where evidence base and here is
 

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.839
this is where evidence base and here is
what I believe and I accept this but the

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:38.849
what I believe and I accept this but the
 

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:40.550
what I believe and I accept this but the
interesting thing is that by and large

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560
interesting thing is that by and large
 

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.740
interesting thing is that by and large
at all but by and large these people

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:42.750
at all but by and large these people

and there's an irrationality which
doesn't make sense and but for many

doesn't make sense and but for many
 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.730
doesn't make sense and but for many
people it's not very nice to believe

people it's not very nice to believe
 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.560
people it's not very nice to believe
that there is no god there's no
