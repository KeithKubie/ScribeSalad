00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.220
I've already started with the
eye color example so I figured

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.150
no harm in continuing it.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.170
Let's say we live on a planet
or we're a species where

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:18.090
there's only two possible eye
colors: either blue-- and the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270
genotype or the allele for blue
I'll abbreviate with a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.590
lowercase b --or you could
have brown eyes.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.960
I'm doing it in this salmon
color just because I got tired

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.900
of the brown.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.049
We'll do an uppercase B.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.620
And I'll make a few other
simplifying assumptions.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.780
First of all, let's assume that
the expression of this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.900
gene is very simple, that brown
is dominant to blue.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.405
So if you have one of
each, you're going

00:00:46.405 --> 00:00:47.420
to see brown eyes.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.180
The only way you're going to see
blue eyes is if you have a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.380
blue allele from each
of your parents.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.210
And the other assumptions I'm
going to make is that this

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.680
population essentially has a
stable gene pool with respect

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.300
to the eye color gene.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.569
What do I mean by that?

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:11.400
No selection is taking place, no
natural selection based on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.100
this trait.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.030
So, for example, you're not more
or less likely to be able

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.850
to reproduce, or the number of
children you have is not going

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.290
to be larger or greater
dependent on what your eye

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.120
color is in this population.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.005
I'm also going to assume that
there's no mutations.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.450
So for whatever reason, a
chromosome that has a blue

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.130
allele can't randomly turn into
a brown or vice versa or

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.650
turn into a third color.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.190
I'm also going to assume that
I'm going to have a large

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.440
population.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.960
The reason why I'm making all
of these assumptions is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.400
because I essentially want to
have a stable gene pool, at

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.420
least relative to this gene.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.450
Relative to the eye color gene,
I want to be stable.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.530
I want to have a stable
allele frequency.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.540
What do I mean by allele
frequency?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.400
I said a large population, but
let's take a very small

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.960
population.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.890
Let's say that there's two
people in the population, and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:27.460
one guy right here, his
genotype is big B and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.050
lowercase B, and let's say that
the other guy has blue

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.280
eyes, so he has to be homozygous
recessive.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.230
Let's say this is the
entire population.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.840
Of course, a population of two
can't apply to what I'm about

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.010
to do, but I just want explain
allele frequency.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.960
The allele frequency here of the
blue eyes, the blue-eyed

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.140
allele frequency
here, is what?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.300
Well, in this population, I
have exactly four alleles.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.150
I only have two individuals,
but they

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.700
each have two alleles.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.810
So it's going to be 75%.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.800
75% of the alleles in this
population are blue, right?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.010
There's one, two, three,
four alleles, and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.650
three of them are blue.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.640
The frequency of the brown
allele is 25%.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060
And this is different than
the actual expression.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.390
If I asked you the frequency
of brown eyes versus blue

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.780
eyes-- So this is allele
frequency.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.880
Let me write that down.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.050
That's allele frequency
right there.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:37.580
If I were ask you phenotype
frequency, if I said how

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.420
frequent are blue eyes seen
in my population?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.970
Well, it's only one out of the
two people in my population,

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.020
so you'd say it's 50%, and then
for brown eyes, you would

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.790
say it's 50%.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.490
So I want to make this
distinction very clear because

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.930
it can be very confusing
when people talk

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.310
about allele frequency.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.790
Allele frequency is literally
if you were able to go and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.950
look at the actual genotype,
the actual chromosomes of

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.230
every person in the population,
and count how many

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.950
of them had the blue allele
versus the brown allele, you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.400
would come up with
this number.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.680
This is different than the
actual phenotype frequency.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.940
Now, all of that is just as a
background, because if these

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.165
set of assumptions are true and
my population isn't in any

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:26.360
way evolving, then my allele
frequency is going to be

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.860
roughly constant.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.800
I have to assume a large
population, because a small

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.260
population, just from random
chance, my allele frequency

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.710
could start to change.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.210
But let's say my allele
frequency is constant, then

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.170
I'm in a Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.070
All this is a situation
where the allele

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.320
frequency isn't changing.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.390
The reason why we're making all
of those assumptions is

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.450
because, if we can assume this,
we can start to deduce

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.230
some things about what we
observe, what must be the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.810
genotypes in the population or
the frequencies of different

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.870
phenotypes and whatever else.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.360
So, for example, if p is the
frequency of blue eyes, so let

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.940
me say p is equal to the
frequency of blue eyes, and q

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.300
is equal to the frequency of
brown eyes, what's p plus q

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.930
going to be?

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.900
What's p plus q?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.800
Well, everything is either going
to have blue eyes or

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.420
brown eyes.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.305
If this is 20%-- And anyway,
this is the allele.

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.490
Let me make that b allele.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.720
Let me make that very clear.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.500
This isn't necessarily
what you observe.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.650
This is the allele itself.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.300
This is the allele frequency, if
you were actually to count

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.920
the chromosomes and see what
percentage have the blue

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.330
allele and what percentage
have the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.170
uppercase brown allele.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.520
Well, every chromosome has to
have either of those, so these

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.140
are going to add up to
100%, or equal to 1.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.210
For example, if 30% of the
alleles are blue, then 70% are

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.090
going to have to be brown
because, I already told you at

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.590
the beginning of this video,
that we're in a world where

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.650
you either have a blue allele
or a brown allele.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.450
Now, what if we don't care about
alleles, we actually

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.710
care about the frequency
of the genotypes?

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.010
So there's a couple of
things we could do.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.860
We could literally just square
both sides of this and then

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.070
think about what
that gives us.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.350
If we square both sides as this
equation, you get what? p

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.570
plus q squared is p squared plus
2pq plus q squared, and

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.370
you square the other side and
it's equal to 1 as well.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.180
What does this tell us?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.950
What is p squared?

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.090
Well, it's the probability
that I get two of the

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.960
lowercase blue alleles, right?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.270
What's the probability that I
get two, that I end up with

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.430
lowercase b, lowercase
b as my genotype?

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.320
Well, I have to get a lowercase
b from my first

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.650
parent, and that's with a
probability of p, and then a

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.380
lowercase b from my second
parent with a

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.300
probability of p.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.610
So it's p times p, so
that's p squared.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.800
What's q squared?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
Well, that's the probability
that I get a big B, a

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.180
brown-eyed allele from each
parent, because the

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.970
probability from parent 1 is q
and then the probability from

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.400
parent 2 is also q.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.320
So that's q squared
right there.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.570
Now, what's 2pq?

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.990
Well, essentially, this
entire term is the

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.880
frequency that I'm a hybrid.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.010
I have a heterozygous
genotype.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.260
And why is that?

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.840
Because there's two ways that
I can be a heterozygote.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.590
I could be like this.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.000
I want to do that other blue.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.200
I could get blue eyes from one
parent and brown eyes from the

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.900
other or I could get brown eyes
from the first parent and

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.200
blue eyes from the second.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.390
I don't know anything about
these parents, so if I'm

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.210
making no assumptions, then I
just have to assume that the

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.760
probability that I get an allele
from either one of them

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.650
is equal to the frequency
in the population.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.540
So there's two ways
of getting these.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.780
The probability of each of these
ways, the probability of

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.450
this combination,
is p times q.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.630
The probability of this is q
times p, which is the same

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.960
thing, and you add them together
and you get 2pq.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.000
So this is essentially the
frequency of the hybrids in

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.140
the population.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.929
I've been kind of
abstract so far.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.500
Let's see if we can apply this
to a real world problem, and

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.320
obviously, I'm making some
simplifying assumptions.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.310
Let's say that we go
into a population.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.270
Let's say it's a population of
a million people, reasonably

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:53.720
large, and we observe that
9% have blue eyes.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.940
This is their phenotype.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:02.300
This is the frequency of the
genotype lowercase b,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.840
lowercase b, right?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.930
I started with this phenotype
blue eyes, but I know, since

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:13.440
blue is a recessive trait, that
they must have two copies

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.080
of the recessive allele.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.280
So this is the frequency.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.780
The frequency of having two
lowercase b's is 9%.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.920
Well, if you just look here, I
just showed you that that's

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.860
also equal to p squared.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.000
p squared is equal to 9%.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.210
And how do you think
about that?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.040
Well, p is the probability
of getting a blue allele.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.850
It's the frequency of the blue
allele in the population.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.430
In order to get two of them,
you have to multiply p by

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.910
itself twice.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.220
So what's the frequency of the
blue allele in the population?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.680
p is equal to the square root
of 0.09, which is 0.3.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.950
So if you went and actually
counted all of the alleles in

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:56.930
the population, you would
actually find that 30% of them

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.410
are the lowercase blue.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.740
Now, a much smaller percentage
of people, only 9%, showed the

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.340
blue eyes because you
need two of them.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.000
You have a 30% chance of getting
it from your mom and a

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.550
30% chance of getting
it from your dad.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:16.110
So what's the frequency of
a brown-eyed allele?

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.890
Well, we know that the frequency
of the blue eyes

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.770
plus the brown eyes is 100%,
so that's going to be 70%.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:31.100
If 30% of all of the chromosomes
or of all of the

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.180
alleles in the population are
blue, the other 70% are going

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.020
to have to be brown.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.090
So what percentage of my
population are going to be--

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.750
Well, there's a couple
of things we can do.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.720
What percentage of my population
are going to have--

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.480
Well, I'll do an easy one.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.210
What percentage of my population
are going to have

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.050
brown eyes, so if I just look
at the phenotype brown eyes?

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.170
I don't even have to
use any of these

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.530
formulas for this one.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.640
I already told you 9% have blue
eyes, so the rest must

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.280
have brown eyes.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.880
So 91% percent have
brown eyes.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:11.070
Now, we just said we have 9% who
have blue eyes, 91% have

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.940
brown eyes.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.380
What percentage of the
population are going to be

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.640
homozygous for brown eyes?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.760
So they need to have the capital
B from both parents.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.320
Well, we know that the frequency
of the capital B

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.380
allele is 70%, so what
percent are going to

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.830
be homozygous dominant?

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.330
Let me draw that.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.910
Homozygous dominant.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.410
Well, the frequency is going
to be q squared.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.070
They're going to have
to get a q.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.040
They're going to have to get
an uppercase B from each

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.320
parent, so that's going to be
0.7 squared, which is equal to

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.210
0.49, or 49%.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.120
So just starting already from
that one idea, from that one

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:02.940
idea that 9% have blue eyes,
we've already been able deduce

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.460
that 91% must have brown eyes.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.000
And of the 91% of the brown eyes
of the whole population,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.230
49%-- this isn't
49% of the 91%.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.780
This is 49% of the population.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.060
49% percent are homozygous
dominant.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.760
And then what percentage
of the population

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.350
are going to be hybrids?

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.750
Well, hybrids also have brown
eyes, but they're not

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.340
homozygous dominant, so
the remainder here.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.690
So what is that?

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:42.020
That's 42%.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:49.020
42% are going to be hybrids.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.540
And if we go back to
the Hardy-Weinberg

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.770
equation, we see that.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:13:01.110
So we get p plus q has to be
equal to 100%, or I could just

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.600
write equal to 1.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.400
And we figured out
that p was 30%.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.450
That's the frequency of the
blue-eyed allele, the actual

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.980
trait, not the observation
of it or the genotype.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.060
And the frequency of the
brown eyes was 70%.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.080
And then this is actually a
breakdown when you square

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.820
that, so we also know that
p squared plus 2pq plus q

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.090
squared is equal to 1.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.610
This is the percentage of the
population that has blue eyes.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.810
They have two blue alleles,
so that's 9%.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.880
This is the percentage of the
population that has two brown

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.450
alleles, homozygous dominant,
so that is 49%.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.120
And then the remainder, this
2pq, this whole term right

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.340
here is what's left over.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.950
So 9 plus this 58, this
is going to be 42%.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.750
42% are hybrids.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.620
And if I just talked about
phenotypes, I'd say 9% have

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.950
blue eyes and then
the remainder,

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.050
91%, have brown eyes.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.000
Hopefully, you found that
reasonably useful.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.420
Just from very simple
deductions, it's almost kind

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.120
of silly that this is almost a
separate principle, because

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.250
you can kind of deduce this from
very basic ideas, and you

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.780
can square both sides of that.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.730
But you can come up with some
fairly fascinating results

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.400
about what's going on in a
population because we can

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.185
observe maybe the frequency of,
let's say, some disease

00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:35.250
that only happens when someone
is homozygous recessive.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.410
So you can go and see, OK,
what percentage of the

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.260
population has that disease, but
then doing the math that

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.600
we just did in this video, you
can figure out what percentage

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.530
of the population have the
allele for the disease.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.110
They're carriers for the
disease, but they don't

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.750
actually show it, and
that would be the

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.680
hybrids right there.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.300
So this is actually
a pretty powerful

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.390
tool you've just learned.
