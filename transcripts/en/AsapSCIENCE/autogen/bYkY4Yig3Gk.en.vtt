00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
 The Lady. Providing nutrition for our young babies, they are one of the few members 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.400
 Which do not develop entirely at birth, and of course a great obsession with Western culture 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960
 But there is still a lot that has not been discussed about the 'or was considered taboo 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.570
 What does science say about the fast? 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.349
 Forget about wine and wine. What about blood to milk? Proteins, sugars and fats are withdrawn 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.229
 From the blood supply of hope to making milk, this is what made mammals 

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:28.689
 Very successful. Unlike birds or reptiles that rely on their parents to be brought 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.090
 Her food from the outside like insects, mammals, from the word mammal, gets nutrients 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.010
 At an early age of secretion of breast milk 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.870
 Breastfeeding comes in all shapes and sizes, although there is a positive correlation between breast size 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.440
 Genes also play an important role in the size of the body. In 50% of cases it is 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.969
 One breast is bigger than the other, often it is the left breast. It is known as an asymmetry of the breasts 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.199
 Asymmetry is normal, although scientists are not entirely clear about the cause, except I am there a potential contribution 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.309
 For changes in hormones that occur in adulthood 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.969
 Variety varies from week to week! Yes, production of estrogen and progesterone during 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.159
 PMS works to change the size of the breast 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.390
 All men and women have nipples and mammary glands, but often develop only in women 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 At puberty. This characteristic characterizes humans, and other mammalian mammals only swell 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.450
 When nurturing and feeding their young. A ring of skin dyed and surrounded by the nipple "halo" 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.960
 And are covered with small protozoa called Montgomery glands. When the milk is released, the glands produce 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 The secretions keep the nipple lubricated, and may release compounds that make 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.750
 Looks delicious to the baby 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.369
 The nipple consists not only of one hole, but of a large number of small holes that you can not see 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.570
 With the naked eye. After placing the baby, the nipple receptors are determined when the baby starts 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.450
 In breast feeding, you send messages to the mother's brain, triggering oxytocin release and persistence 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.640
 Production of prolactin. Oxytocin acts to constrict the cells lining the mammary glands 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.719
 Also known as the incubation hormone, it strengthens the bond between the mother 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.600
 And the child. Proactin is necessary for milk production. This hormonal process is complete 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.270
 Can be launched after hearing baby crying! Even if it is your child 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.979
 Children love to be loved, as well as people who love them too. One research found that people spent more time in observation 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.410
 Big bites with a certain proportion of your hips and width - this is likely to explain why 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.350
 Breast enlargement surgeries are the most common forms of plastic surgery, with 300,000 operations 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.530
 It was conducted in 2014 in America alone. However the same research shows that people 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.050
 They prefer to be eaten in all shapes and sizes, and medium-sized lentils are classified 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.970
 Statistically it is the most attractive. Hunters not only create pleasure for others, but also create them 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.110
 For the same person. Studies have shown that stimulating nipples enhances sexual arousal at 82% 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.580
 Of women and 52% of men. Interestingly, the magnetic resonance imaging scan was a brain response 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.080
 For self-stimulation of the clitoris and vagina, and found that these areas are triggered when women 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.510
 By stimulating the nipples 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.950
 Although the source of both nutrient and pleasure is a source of sustenance, it remains a non-vulnerable region 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.840
 Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in North America. Cells that are divided 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.620
 They are often at greater risk of mutations than undifferentiated cells 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.980
 They change and grow during our life cycle, these cells are constantly divided. Hormone 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.310
 Estrogen also stimulates the division of breast cells, and there are some environmental chemicals present 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 In pesticides, industrial products and even foods that mimic estrogen and which can affect 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.560
 Cell growth, increasing the risk of breast cancer. Research reveals other risk factors 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.230
 For breast cancer such as breast density, age at first pregnancy and genetic predisposition 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.480
 For breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. This scientific knowledge can help increase 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.320
 protection 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.060
 Although the stamina is not immune, it is unbelievably wonderful, regardless of sizes and shapes but it is 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.840
 A necessary aspect to the preservation of human life, and our definition as one species. Thank you
