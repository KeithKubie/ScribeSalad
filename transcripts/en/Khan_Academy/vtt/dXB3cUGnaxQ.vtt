00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:02.410
In this video, we'll
just talk a little bit

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:10.210
about what the chi-square
distribution is, sometimes

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.387
called the chi-squared
distribution.

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:13.970
And then in the next
few videos, we'll

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.820
actually use it to
really test how well

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
theoretical distributions
explain observed ones,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.260
or how good a fit
observed results

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.940
are for theoretical
distributions.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.890
So let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.640
So let's say I have
some random variables.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.540
And each of them
are independent,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.720
standard, normal, normally
distributed random variables.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.690
So let me just remind
you what that means.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.450
So let's say I have the random
variable X. If X is normally

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.590
distributed, we
could write that X

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.480
is a normal random
variable with a mean of 0

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.940
and a variance of 1.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.290
Or you could say that
the expected value of X,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.960
is equal to 0, or
in that the variance

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.160
of our random variable
X is equal to 1.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.620
Or just to visualize
it is that, when

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.310
we take an instantiation
of this very variable,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.770
we're sampling from a
normal distribution,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.560
a standardized normal
distribution that

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.850
looks like this.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.910
Mean of 0 and then a variance
of 1, which would also mean,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.080
of course, a standard
deviation of 1.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.810
So that could be the standard
deviation, or the variance,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.012
or the standard deviation,
that would be equal to 1.

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:31.720
So a chi-square
distribution, if you just

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.120
take one of these
random variables--

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.740
and let me define it this way.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.360
Let me define a new
random variable.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.230
Let me define a
new random variable

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.010
Q that is equal to--
you're essentially

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.210
sampling from this the
standard normal distribution

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.470
and then squaring
whatever number you got.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.360
So it is equal to this
random variable X squared.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.010
The distribution for this
random variable right

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.699
here is going to be an example
of the chi-square distribution.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.740
Actually what we're going
to see in this video is

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.900
that the chi-square, or the
chi-squared distribution

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.710
is actually a set
of distributions

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.870
depending on how
many sums you have.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.620
Right now, we only have
one random variable

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.750
that we're squaring.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.670
So this is just one
of the examples.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.710
And we'll talk more
about them in a second.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.710
So this right
here, this we could

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.410
write that Q is a chi-squared
distributed random variable.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.850
Or that we could use
this notation right here.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.780
Q is-- we could
write it like this.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.170
So this isn't an X anymore.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.910
This is the Greek
letter chi, although it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.210
looks a lot like a curvy X. So
it's a member of chi-squared.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.600
And since we're only
taking one sum over here--

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.180
we're only taking the
sum of one independent,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.450
normally distributed, standard
or normally distributed

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.060
variable, we say that this
only has 1 degree of freedom.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.270
And we write that over here.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.880
So this right here is
our degree of freedom.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.850
We have 1 degree of
freedom right over there.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.630
So let's call this Q1.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.150
Let's say I have
another random variable.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.820
Let's call this Q-- let me
do it in a different color.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.220
Let me do Q2 in blue.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.540
Let's say I have another
random variable, Q2,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.470
that is defined as-- let's say I
have one independent, standard,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.380
normally distributed variable.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.700
I'll call that X1.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.960
And I square it.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.030
And then I have another
independent, standard,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.240
normally distributed
variable, X2.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.115
And I square it.

00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:49.740
So you could imagine
both of these guys

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.120
have distributions like this.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
And they're independent.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.220
So get to sample Q2,
you essentially sample

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.990
X1 from this distribution,
square that value, sample X2

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.370
from the same distribution,
essentially, square that value,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.840
and then add the two.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.420
And you're going to get Q2.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.280
This over here-- here we
would write-- so this is Q1.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.620
Q2 here, Q2 we would
write is a chi-squared,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.550
distributed random variable
with 2 degrees of freedom.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.050
Right here.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.180
2 degrees of freedom.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.910
And just to visualize
kind of the set

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.990
of chi-squared distributions,
let's look at this over here.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.410
So this, I got this
off of Wikipedia.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.900
This shows us some of the
probability density functions

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.270
for some of the
chi-square distributions.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.220
This first one over here,
for k of equal to 1,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.080
that's the degrees of freedom.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.200
So this is essentially our Q1.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.300
This is our probability
density function for Q1.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.270
And notice it really
spikes close to 0.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.470
And that makes sense.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.220
Because if you are
sampling just once

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.380
from this standard
normal distribution,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.610
there's a very high
likelihood that you're

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.609
going to get something
pretty close to 0.

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.900
And then if you square
something close to 0-- remember,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.066
these are decimals, they're
going to be less than 1,

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:14.120
pretty close to 0-- it's
going to become even smaller.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.470
So you have a high probability
of getting a very small value.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.380
You have high probabilities
of getting values

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.290
less than some threshold,
this right here, less than,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.670
I guess, this is 1 right here.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.862
So the less than 1/2.

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:27.320
And you have a very
low probability

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.500
of getting a large number.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.017
I mean, to get a 4, you
would have to sample a 2

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:34.975
from this distribution.

00:05:34.975 --> 00:05:39.830
And we know that 2 is--
actually it's 2 variances

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.460
or 2 standard deviations
from the mean.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.870
So it's less likely.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.290
And actually that's to get a 4.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.910
So to get even
larger numbers are

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.560
going to be even less likely.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.435
So that's why you see
this shape over here.

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:53.060
Now when you have 2
degrees of freedom,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.960
it moderates a little bit.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.260
This is the shape,
this blue line right

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.910
here is the shape of Q2.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.890
And notice you're a little
bit less likely to get values

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.680
close to 0 and a little bit
more likely to get numbers

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.200
further out.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.430
But it still is kind of
shifted or heavily weighted

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.999
towards small numbers.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.790
And then if we had
another random variable,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.000
another chi-squared
distributed random variable--

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.470
so then we have, let's say, Q3.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.760
And let's define
it as the sum of 3

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.442
of these independent
variables, each of them

00:06:29.442 --> 00:06:31.150
that have a standard
normal distribution.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.600
So X1, X2 squared
plus X3 squared.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.990
Then all of a sudden, our
Q3-- this is Q2 right here--

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.150
has a chi-squared distribution
with 3 degrees of freedom.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.922
And so this guy
right over here--

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:47.130
that will be this green line.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.970
Maybe I should have
done this in green.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.204
This will be this
green line over here.

00:06:51.204 --> 00:06:52.620
And then notice,
now it's starting

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.036
to become a little
bit more likely

00:06:54.036 --> 00:06:56.090
that you'd get values
in this range over here

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.340
because you're taking the sum.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.130
Each of these are going
to be pretty small values,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.213
but you're taking the sum.

00:07:00.213 --> 00:07:02.627
So it starts to shift it a
little over to the right.

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:04.460
And so the more degrees
of freedom you have,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.680
the further this lump
starts to move to the right

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.850
and, to some degree, the
more symmetric it gets.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.332
And what's interesting
about this,

00:07:11.332 --> 00:07:13.790
I guess it's different than
almost every other distribution

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.327
we've looked at, although
we've looked at others that

00:07:16.327 --> 00:07:18.410
have this property as well,
is that you can't have

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.530
a value below 0 because
we're always just squaring

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.160
these values.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.162
Each of these guys can
have values below 0.

00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:25.370
They're normally distributed.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.710
They could have negative values.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.090
But since we're squaring and
taking the sum of squares,

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.810
this is always going
to be positive.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.770
And the place that this
is going to be useful--

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.728
and we're going to see
in the next few videos--

00:07:34.728 --> 00:07:38.350
is in measuring essentially
error from an expected value.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.244
And if you took take
this total error,

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:41.660
you can figure out
the probability

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.682
of getting that total error
if you assume some parameters.

00:07:48.682 --> 00:07:50.640
And we'll talk more about
it in the next video.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.850
Now with that said, I
just want to show you

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.620
how to read a chi-squared
distribution table.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.430
So if I were to ask you, if
this is our distribution--

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.231
let me pick this
blue one right here.

00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.980
So over here, we have
2 degrees of freedom

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.270
because we're adding 2
of these guys right here.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:15.880
If I were to ask you, what is
the probability of Q2 being

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.860
greater than-- or, let
me put it this way.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.174
What is the probability of
Q2 being greater than 2.41?

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.840
And I'm picking that
value for a reason.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.669
So I want the probability of
Q2 being greater than 2.41.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.250
What I want to do is I'll
look at a chi-square table

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.090
like this.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.130
Q2 is a version of chi-squared
with 2 degrees of freedom.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.380
So I look at this row right
here under 2 degrees of freedom.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.990
And I want the probability of
getting a value above 2.41.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.350
And I picked 2.41 because
it's actually at this table.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.229
And so most of these
chi-squared-- the reason

00:08:58.229 --> 00:09:00.270
why we have these weird
numbers like this instead

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.720
of whole numbers or
easy-to-read fractions

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.740
is it is actually
driven by the p value.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.900
It's driven by the
probability of getting

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.937
something larger
than that value.

00:09:08.937 --> 00:09:10.770
So normally you would
look at the other way.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.270
You'd say, OK, if I want to
say, what chi-squared value

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.580
for 2 degrees of
freedom, there's

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.270
a 30% chance of getting
something larger than that?

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.642
Then I would look up 2.41.

00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:23.100
But I'm doing it
the other way just

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.225
for the sake of this video.

00:09:24.225 --> 00:09:27.190
So if I want the probability
of this random variable

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.470
right here being greater
than 2.41, or its p value,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.400
we read it right here.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.210
It is 30%.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.570
And just to visualize
it on this chart,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.060
this chi-square distribution--
this was Q2, the blue one,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.740
over here-- 2.41 is
going to sit-- let's see.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.080
This is 3.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.400
This is 2.5.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.060
So 2.41 is going to be
someplace right around here.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.530
So essentially,
what that table is

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:58.190
telling us is, this entire
area under this blue line right

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.420
here, what is that?

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.560
And that right there is
going to be 30% of-- well,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.050
it's going to be 0.3.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.846
Or you could view it as
30% of the entire area

00:10:09.846 --> 00:10:12.220
under this curve, because
obviously all the probabilities

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.600
have to add up to 1.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.725
So that's our intro to the
chi-square distribution.

00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:17.100
In the next video,
we're actually

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.724
going to use it to make some,
or to test some, inferences.
