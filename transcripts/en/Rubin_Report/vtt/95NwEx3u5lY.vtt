WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.560
All right.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.420
I think I am or why I'm going to do a start,

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.290
a slow start here because I want to make sure that,
uh,

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
that this puppy is working.
I am in Sweden right now.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.320
I don't like to Brag,
but I am in my hotel room and we've set up Google hangouts.

6
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:27.321
I did some crazy lighting things that I don't know if they're illegal in this

7
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.064
country,

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030
but I did everything I could to do with lights and I moved the curtains and I

9
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:38.031
shifted chairs and I actually have my computer on top of a upside down ice

10
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.510
bucket a and I'm going to share all my election thoughts.

11
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.760
I'm going to make some predictions because you know,

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.730
that being in the prediction business is always a good thing to do,

13
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.130
especially the day before the election.
Uh,

14
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.400
I want to share some thoughts on all the stuff that's gone on back in the states

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.390
and uh,

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.700
give you guys a little bit of insider info on this tour that I'm on with Jordan

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.470
Peterson,
uh,
which has just been absolutely unbelievable.
Uh,

18
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.480
so I'll really get going in about two minutes or so.

19
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.690
I just want to do a little slow start here because I know when we send out these

20
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.390
live streams,
sometimes it takes a little time to get to the feed and all that.

21
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
So yeah.
So anyway,
so I am in Sweden right now.
Uh,

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.470
we have a show tonight.
It is now,

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.430
it is 5:00 PM in Sweden on November 5th.

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.010
Right now our show is at seven o'clock tonight,

25
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.670
so I'm going to do about an hour a little bit more than that right now with you

26
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:30.990
guys.
I'm going to do a Q and.
A.

27
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.460
So right now actually we've been taking questions all day long.

28
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.570
They're all morning long depending on where we are.
Uh,

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.790
but if you go to patrion.com/reuben,

30
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:42.990
you can submit a question and my guys back in America,
uh,

31
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:46.710
are taking the questions and then they're sending them to me on my trusty phone.

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.860
Here we have a Google doc and a Google man.

33
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.970
Is there anything they don't do from spying on you to not letting your videos go

34
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:58.680
out to your subscribers plus Google docs in allowing us to do this?
Um,

35
00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.880
okay.
So,
yeah,

36
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.970
it's five o'clock here in Sweden are our show tonight at seven o'clock.

37
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:04.530
I usually get there about a half hour early.

38
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:09.150
I'm only about 10 minutes away from the,
uh,
the hotel,
uh,
the store real quick.

39
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:11.640
Let me just do a little bit on that.
Um,

40
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.650
it's been absolutely amazing as of I think the show last night.

41
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.910
Um,
and last night we were in Helsinki,
Finland,

42
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.510
which I really think might've been the best show we've done.
I mean we've,

43
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.120
we've really been on a nice track with these things.

44
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.530
Jordan and I are having a really nice groove at the moment and I know when to

45
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.910
poke fun at them and have some fun in the Q and a and some nights he does some

46
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:40.020
real fire and brimstone stuff and some nights it's a little looser or some

47
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.310
nights he talks about all 12 rules.

48
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.930
Some nights he does the whole show on one rule.
Some nights I'm a little sillier.

49
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.560
Uh,

50
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.390
suffice to say that last night was the first night that we actually slow danced

51
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.940
on stage together.
That's how the show ended.

52
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:57.330
So if you haven't been to one of these shows,
they're pretty much all sold out.

53
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.170
Um,
but if you haven't been,

54
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:01.510
and there's any tickets in any of the remaining cities,

55
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.770
I hope to see you guys there.

56
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.810
I'm super excited to be there to be here in Sweden tonight actually,

57
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.830
because this is one of the countries that seems to be really effected by a lot

58
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.650
of the things that we talk about relative to political correctness and free

59
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.500
speech and identity politics.
And believe it or not,

60
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:22.501
Sweden is our fifth most viewed country despite it being a tiny country.

61
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.250
So are our most viewed as in the United States.
Then it's the UK,

62
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.610
then Australia and Canada flip back and forth on three and four,

63
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.870
and then five is Sweden,

64
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.310
which is really bizarre because there aren't that many people here in Sweden.
Um,

65
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.360
so yeah,
we've been to just in the last 10 days or so,
we were in Dublin,
Ireland.

66
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:43.090
We were in Oslo,
Norway.
We were in Helsinki,
Finland.

67
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.660
We've had a couple stops in the UK,
will be in,
uh,

68
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.220
Copenhagen tomorrow in Denmark.
Uh,
we'll be back in Helsinki.

69
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.070
We're going to be back in Denmark.
I mean it really is something else.

70
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.180
And as of this morning,

71
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:57.960
it sounds like we're just signing on for a whole bunch more.
Uh,

72
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.280
next year starting in February,

73
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.080
it looks like a whole bunch of stops in Australia.

74
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:05.410
It looks like we're going to hit up Germany and France and Belgium and a couple

75
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:10.390
of other places and uh,
it's just really cool.
Uh,
I also got some really,

76
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.820
really great,
uh,
career news,

77
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.050
which hopefully I'll be able to announce in the next week or two,
uh,

78
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.790
that I just found out a couple of days ago and it's sort of linked to all of

79
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.900
this stuff.
Um,
so I'm psyched on every front.
And you know,
it's kind of funny,

80
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.800
one of the things that I talk about when I'm doing these shows at night,

81
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.710
and it's usually the auditorium's,

82
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.840
the smallest one we did was in Amsterdam a couple of days ago.

83
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.780
We did a 900 seat theater.
That is,
that's by far the smallest.

84
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.510
Most of them are 200030004000 or so.

85
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.160
I think we did maybe one 5,000 and UK,
uh,
early on in London.
Um,

86
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.310
but I always say to the audience in the beginning that it's so bizarre because

87
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:48.010
if you spend any time online these days,
especially on Twitter,

88
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:51.070
it's like everyone hates each other.
Everyone's fighting.

89
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.760
We're all going to our sides and screaming at each other and everyone's trying

90
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.270
to own the live tards or the cuckservatives or all of that stuff.

91
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.160
And we all get caught up in a little bit.

92
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.170
I get caught up in it too sometimes and we're,

93
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:06.160
we're all not our best selves all the time.
Um,

94
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.250
but then I go out to these shows at night and I meet thousands and thousands of

95
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.100
great people.
You know,
a couple of protesters at some of the events.
The,

96
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.860
the protesters in Amsterdam,
by the way.
They handed out flyers.

97
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:20.950
I was very impressed.
Like they weren't screaming at people.
They weren't,

98
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.740
you know,
stopping anybody from getting in or shouting or anything.

99
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.620
They actually just,
they printed out some stuff and they handed it to people.

100
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.360
I didn't agree with what they printed out,
but I was like,

101
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.070
you guys are doing protests.
Right.

102
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:33.160
I actually gave him a shout out on stage cause I was like this is,

103
00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:35.950
this is kind of right.
I also made fun of what they wrote but you know,

104
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.590
separate issue.
So anyway,
um,

105
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.690
yeah the election is tomorrow and uh,
well it's tomorrow here.

106
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.190
I guess it's tomorrow for you guys to write.

107
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.720
It's about 8:00 AM I think Los Angeles time right now it's about 11:00 AM east

108
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:51.970
coast.
So the big election is tomorrow.

109
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:56.560
So there's a lot of thoughts that I want to share with you and uh,

110
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.210
and all right,
so here we go.
So first off,
I want to be very,

111
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.130
very clear about one thing.

112
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.090
If you were watching TV today or you have been watching the news for the past

113
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.790
week or reading all the think pieces or all of that stuff,

114
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.920
make it known to yourself and everyone else that nobody,

115
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.990
nobody has a freaking clue what is going to happen tomorrow.

116
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.220
So all the people pretending they know what's up and all the people who make all

117
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.850
the predictions.
And who are crunching all the numbers.
They don't know.

118
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.851
This is as big of a crapshoot in American political history as there ever has

119
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.000
been.
You know,

120
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.420
the analogy that I've used from the beginning is sort of that Trump came in here

121
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:41.840
and tossed the chessboard up.
The pieces are all over the place right now.

122
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.020
Nobody has an idea of where those pieces are going to shake out.

123
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.710
We can all take the best estimated guesses.
We can all kind,

124
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.320
we can perhaps look at polls and if pulling even works anymore,

125
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.250
and there's some questions whether polls traditionally politically work anymore.

126
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.190
There's a lot of reason to think that certain sets of people don't respond in

127
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.320
polls,
that they're using old landlines and poles,

128
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.650
that people for political reasons don't want to talk to pollsters,

129
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.860
all sorts of things.
Uh,
and you can even see,
you know,
it's really interesting.

130
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.170
If you were to listen to conventional wisdom for the last,

131
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:12.200
let's say six or eight months and you listen to mainstream media,

132
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:15.580
what they've been saying is blue wave.
It's all blue wave Bluewave blue wave.

133
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.040
Now I sit on live streams at least six months ago.

134
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.660
But that's not necessarily the way I see it because I think people are so sick

135
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.620
of what the Democratic Party has embraced,

136
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:32.480
which is identity politics.
It's this oppression,
Olympics narrative.

137
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.690
Um,
it's that government is the answer to everything.

138
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.040
It's this Democratic Socialism or Socialist Democrat Ism,
uh,

139
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.170
whatever you want to call it,
which they'll drop the,
uh,

140
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.920
the Democratic Party as soon as they're in power.
Uh,

141
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:48.380
I think people are really sick about that.
But before I give you my predictions,

142
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.810
I just,
it's very important that everyone understand.

143
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:54.920
Like all the experts are really not experts right now.
They really aren't.

144
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.230
And you can even see now in the last day or two,

145
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:00.020
and I can even see this halfway across the world,
um,

146
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.070
that a lot of the predictors,
you know,

147
00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:04.460
and Nate silver from five 38 and the rest of the people,

148
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.150
everyone's kind of now going into 50,
50 mode.
I saw some people on CNN before.

149
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.980
Suddenly everyone's going,
oh,
we thought there was a blue way,

150
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.630
but we just want to be clear.
Maybe not blue wave.

151
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.250
It's like everybody's guesses as good as anybody else's.
Um,

152
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.810
but we can all use some contextual clues to kind of figure out what we think.

153
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:23.450
So here's what I'm gonna do.
So first I'm going to tell you what I,

154
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.400
what I want to happen and some ways that I think we can get out of this mess.

155
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.320
And then I'll tell you what I think will happen.

156
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:33.020
There's probably no point in telling you what I think will happen,

157
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:35.550
because if I'm wrong,
it's like,
well,

158
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:37.880
that's so you Reuben doesn't know what he's talking about enough.
I'm right.

159
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.480
It's like,
okay.
Zippity Doo Dah.
Um,
but I will,
I will tell you about,
so look,

160
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.660
here's what I,
what I think has to happen,
you know,

161
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.950
before the election in 2016 with Trump,
um,

162
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.310
there weren't that many people that thought Trump could win.

163
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.950
And all along the way,
you saw pundits on every channel and youtube was,

164
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.090
and everybody,
it's gonna happen.
It's not real,
blah,
blah,
blah.

165
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.860
And I was one of the people,

166
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:03.530
I was on Joe Rogan's podcast the day before the election,
basically going,

167
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.200
I think the Trump things kind of real,
because I was listening,

168
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.970
I was listening to people and I was seeing what the talk was online.

169
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:13.890
I saw this incredible momentum.

170
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.530
And even though it wasn't reflected in the mainstream media,

171
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.980
I thought if anything that gave it more reason to think that it was real because

172
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:23.690
they were kind of ignoring it.
So right now it's a little,

173
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.860
if you just look at polls and you're listened to what mainstream media is

174
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:29.520
talking about,
it's almost impossible to garner what,
what is happening.
I mean,

175
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:30.060
you look,

176
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.750
you could look at some of the polls where almost every poll right now still has,

177
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.460
you know,
blue wave or Democrats winning.

178
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.580
And at the same time we're seeing these massive,
uh,

179
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.430
rallies that Trump is doing that seem as big,

180
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:45.150
if not bigger than when he was doing them two years ago.

181
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.870
Rally is not an answer,
of course.
And I can tell you that,
uh,

182
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:53.130
that David was voting yesterday in La and that the,
uh,
that the lines,

183
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:54.960
he waited in line for like three or four hours.

184
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.810
So I think there will be certain pockets that are blue that are going to vote

185
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.630
very heavily.
There'll be certain pockets that are red,
very heavily.

186
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:05.760
Couple things make,
um,
make midterms particularly difficult.

187
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.550
Uh,
one is,
it really,

188
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:12.240
really comes down to turnout in a way more than the main elections because at

189
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.270
least in presidential elections,
you're going to get that bar of,

190
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.970
of who's going to vote midterms.
You just never know.

191
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.250
Now it seems that there's going to be high turnout,
right?

192
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.950
And it seems like there's been a lot of early voting and all that kind of stuff,

193
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.640
and it does seem that both sides are so energized at the moment,

194
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:30.810
whether you're fully in it,
Trump manga or your a resistor,

195
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.990
it seems like you've got a lot on the table right now to get out there and vote.

196
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.260
So I suspect,
and I think most people would probably agree with this,

197
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.430
that the turnout is going to be pretty high.
Um,
okay,
so here's what I think.

198
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.870
Here's what I sort of want to happen right now.
Look,

199
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:47.160
if you've been watching this show,

200
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:52.161
you know the things that I care about most and you know that for years now I

201
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.030
have been talking about why identity politics is so dangerous that we will judge

202
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.070
people on their immutable characteristics,

203
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.000
whether it's their skin color or their sexuality or their gender,

204
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:05.820
of which there are two,
uh,
all of these things.

205
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.990
We will judge them and then we will take from some,
we will give to other others.

206
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:13.470
We will figure out who should get into this school,
who should get this job.

207
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.790
All of these things that are the antithesis of the American dream.
Okay?

208
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.210
They are the reverse of everything this country was founded on.

209
00:11:21.211 --> 00:11:25.500
Was the country founded perfectly?
No.
Has it made mistakes along the way?
Yes,

210
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.010
but by and large,
in the 200 plus years of this nation,

211
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.420
we have consistently bent more towards equality,

212
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.620
true equality,

213
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:38.850
which means that the laws of the nation are equal for everybody.

214
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.440
Not that you are going to be guaranteed success and some people might be born

215
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.300
with more,
some might be born with less,

216
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.810
some people will have more personal drive.
Some people will be lazy,

217
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.920
some people will be given benefits from family members,
some people.

218
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.050
All of those things are real.
Those,
those are just the,

219
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.970
that's just the sort of multitude of options that exist in a free society.

220
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.890
There is no guarantee of freedom,
but this idea,
well,
there is not a freedom.
Well,

221
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.890
there's no guarantee of freedom,
but there is no guarantee of success.

222
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.390
All we can do is set up a system that will hopefully give as many people the

223
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:15.850
opportunity to pursue happiness,

224
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:20.560
to live lives that are free based on their own ideas.
That's what you want to do.

225
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:21.394
Okay.

226
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.910
I think now at this point as I do this here on November 5th,

227
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.040
2018 that the Democratic Party has in no way at all taken a moment to reject

228
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:37.450
some of these bad ideas.

229
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.160
I say this as someone that voted Democrat my whole life.

230
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.530
I say that,
I think I've said this before.
I think in Mike Bloomberg's third term,

231
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.610
when he flipped from a Democrat to a republican or something like that,

232
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:54.250
I think I voted for him.
I'm not even totally sure in New York City,

233
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:57.430
I'm talking about as mayor.
Um,
but I have voted Democrat my whole life.

234
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:01.030
I voted Obama my whole life.
You guys know my journey,
right?

235
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:04.060
I mean the Prager u video,
while I left the left,
you know,

236
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:08.530
it's like I was one of these people.
I worked at the young Turks,
blah,
blah,
blah.

237
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.020
I still begrudgingly or,
or,
or self,
uh,

238
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.100
self flagellating Lee consider myself a liberal.
Um,

239
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.130
but the left as it stands in America today,

240
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.510
which has now taken over the Democratic Party on these democratic socialists,

241
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.760
these,
these people are not liberal.

242
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.680
The ideas that they are pushing that big government is the answer to everything.

243
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.310
These are not liberal ideas.
Now look,

244
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:40.420
you guys know I liked small government stuff and there's a great discussion to

245
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:45.010
be had about what that means.
What,
where is government necessary?

246
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.710
Where isn't it necessary?
I love talking to Libertarians.

247
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:51.400
I love talking to an caps,
classical liberals.
About about just that.

248
00:13:51.401 --> 00:13:52.870
I love talking about ideas,

249
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.830
so it's like to talk about the minutia of the day to day issues.

250
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.200
Actually isn't that interesting to me,

251
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.680
but what I believe is that the Democrats have not stopped.

252
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.780
You know when before the Trump election I kept saying,
and I,

253
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.000
I guess I was one of the few people saying it on the left at the time and I

254
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:13.030
guess that's partly why this show really took off,

255
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.840
but what I was saying basically was the left needs to stop doing it.

256
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:18.760
It needs to stop playing identity politics.

257
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:22.000
It needs to stop calling everyone racist and bigoted and homophobic and

258
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:26.710
transphobic and Islamophobic and the rest of it because all of your intellectual

259
00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:29.620
opponents are not evil.
They just aren't.

260
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.080
And I have not seen any,

261
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.040
any reflection across the board on the left.

262
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.350
What I have seen is that there are some liberals,

263
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.870
let's say some of my IDW friends,

264
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.940
better liberals that are basically on the outs of their party.
And I,

265
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.000
there's some big disagreement within the IDW now and I'm sure we'll,

266
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.920
we'll do shows about this on many of our,

267
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:56.810
about what to do right now because I'm definitely on the side that the
Democrats,

268
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.550
they sort of need to be destroyed in this election.
I don't mean just beat,

269
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:05.750
but they really need to be destroyed.
So that liberalism,

270
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:10.751
his liberalism has a chance to come back out of the ashes of this destroyed

271
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.080
ideology,
which I,
and I think it's a terrible ideology.
I think it is.

272
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.750
I think identity politics,
which they have embraced,

273
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.370
they have absolutely embraced to the point that you've got the democratic,

274
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.000
um,
uh,

275
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.920
candidate for Georgia governor embracing Linda Sarsour,
Bernie Sanders has,

276
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.780
it's just crazy.
They've embraced it,
they've taken it in,

277
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.310
and I think that thing needs to be voted out and destroyed.

278
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.360
And if it's destroyed than out of the ashes of that,

279
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.560
then I think some true liberalism,

280
00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:47.580
since some sensible voices in the democratic party can come back.

281
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.630
I don't know where they are now.
I mean people keep saying to me,
well Dave,

282
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:53.720
how could you,
how could you leave the Democrats?

283
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.850
Now that doesn't mean I'm going to be a Republican and I'll talk about the

284
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:57.860
Republicans and the conservatives in just a second,

285
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.410
but it's like I don't see anyone.

286
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:05.390
I don't see anyone that represents any of the views that I hold at this point.

287
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:09.080
Where is the JFK of the Democrats?

288
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.710
Ask not what your country can do for you.
Ask what you can do for your country.

289
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.720
That is the one 80 to what Bernie says Bernie wants to your government to give

290
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:18.290
you things.

291
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.220
It wants to tell corporations how much they have to pay you and it wants to give

292
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:25.100
you free health care and free education.

293
00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:27.290
All the things which are not free and free college for everyone.

294
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.250
At the same time,

295
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:31.610
while automation is kicking in and we're going to have less need for people to

296
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:36.140
go to college and all of these things,
they all sound good.
It all sounds good.

297
00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:39.050
Diversity and equality,
it all,

298
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.190
it's all buzzwords that all sound great,
but it's me.
It's not only meaningless,

299
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:45.860
it's much more dangerous than meaningless.
It's actually,

300
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.190
it's actually perverse and it's actually antithetical to freedom.

301
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.930
So what I think is,
well,
it gets to the predictions in a sec.

302
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.330
What I think has to happen the best way out of this right now,

303
00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:59.300
if you want to get out of this political mess that we seem to be in at the

304
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.230
moment,
I think if the,
if the Democrats basically got destroyed,

305
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.350
so that is a strong signal.

306
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.440
If the Trump signal in 2016 was not good enough,

307
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:15.250
a strong signal would be sent to them that the bulk of the country is against

308
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.520
this hysterical mob nonsense.

309
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.410
Then maybe finally the liberals would stand up,
they would say,

310
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.610
you know what?
We've,

311
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.710
we've been held hostage by our own side and we're not going to do it anymore.

312
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.620
And then they could start rebuilding a healthy party.

313
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:36.200
And I want to be clear about saying,
and this is saying that,
uh,

314
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.310
Jordan Peterson talks about often in these talks that we're doing,
you know,

315
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.510
if you're in a fight,
let's say you're in a fight with your,
uh,
with your spouse,

316
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.270
you don't want to beat your spouse.
I don't mean physically,

317
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.130
although you don't want to do that.
Um,

318
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.140
you don't want to beat them in a fight to the point that they're the loser

319
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:54.570
because then you're just married to a loser.
Okay.

320
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.310
I think this is a good analogy for this.

321
00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.480
I want these guys to be beat so that then the hands can be put out for them so

322
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.230
that they can kind of come back.
They can kind of find,

323
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.860
look through the ashes and go,
Whoa,
we lost our way.

324
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.730
Let's abandon some of these bad ideas.
Let's return to true liberalism,

325
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:16.350
true tolerance live and let live where perhaps we want a little more government.

326
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:21.300
Perhaps we want a little less to go to the military.
Perhaps.
Uh,
we,

327
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.890
we still want to fight for the social issues.
We still generally are pro choice,

328
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:30.030
but we,
we don't think that all the people who are pro life hate women,

329
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.770
I mean some semblance of liberal tolerance that used to exist.

330
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:38.520
That in effect is gone these days.
I think that can come back,

331
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:42.030
but the only way it can come back as if this thing gets destroyed.

332
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.450
So look at it the other way.
Let's say the Democrats do well.

333
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.410
So now where are we at if the Democrats take the house and the Senate,

334
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.260
well now I even hate to say this,

335
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.530
but it seems like we'd be in like this low grade cold war slash civil war where

336
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:04.251
they're going to have to try to impeach Trump and then it's like we already saw

337
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:04.920
what everything,

338
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.000
everything that happened with Cavenaugh and it's like due process won't matter.

339
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:12.600
It will just be the,
it will be a mob verse,

340
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.540
verse whatever you want to call Trump at this point.

341
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.660
And that will not be good for the country if you think it's bad.

342
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:21.300
Now we will look back and think that these were the good old days.

343
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.760
So if they win,
they will be emboldened.
The last few liberals,
whoever they are,

344
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.090
they email me every now and again.
We shell shocked with PTSD.

345
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:31.920
They can't figure out what's going on anymore.

346
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.430
The last few liberals will be purged because that's what the left has done.

347
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:39.990
The left has purged basically all of their free thinkers.
I think,
you know,

348
00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:41.660
have enough interviews that I've done to,

349
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.720
to understand why this is because they have a narrower and narrower accepted

350
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.800
range of thought.
So you can't,
I mean,
show me a democrat.

351
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.730
Where are the Blue Dog Democrats?
Show me a Democrat these days.
That's prolife.

352
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.570
It does.
It's not that important to parse every little issue like this,

353
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.950
but it's like,
show me where,
where is a Democrat who,
uh,

354
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.180
who will talk about a smaller government and state's rights and some of these

355
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:13.770
things.
These used to not just be conservative principles.
Right?
Um,

356
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.580
so I think this thing needs to be destroyed and if it's destroyed,

357
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.200
then they could possibly come back.
And then what they would do is as a sensible,

358
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:23.700
as a sensible left,

359
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.270
whether I'd be part of them are not as a sensible left.

360
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.860
I think then they could potentially moderate the parts of the right that may be

361
00:20:31.861 --> 00:20:34.140
people are worried about,
okay,
so,

362
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.020
so that's what I think would be the best situation.

363
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:40.920
So they get basically they get to straighten out,
by the way,
if,
if that happened.

364
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.100
So I know a lot of people will be watching this and thinking,
okay,

365
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:46.830
well if the Democrats get destroyed,
now Trump's got that,
you know,

366
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:48.220
he's got the house in the Senate,
he's,

367
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:50.620
he's already a year into his presidency or you know,

368
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:51.820
two years into his presidency,

369
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:55.510
one term into the presidency and now isn't he just going to be unhinged and do

370
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.720
whatever he wants to do.
Trump as a populist.

371
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.930
I still think this even now wants to be popular and you'd have to show me,

372
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:05.500
look,

373
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.560
you gotta put the tweets aside for a moment when you're talking about Trump,

374
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.000
we can talk about them perhaps in another live stream.

375
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.370
But in terms of the policy that he's done two years later,

376
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:19.480
I don't think any of the people that voted for him are that upset about policy

377
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.360
in their taxes are lower.
We don't seem to be going into any other wars.

378
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:27.150
We've reconfigured some trade deals,
uh,
that seemed to be making some sense.
Uh,

379
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.820
the economy's doing pretty well,
um,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

380
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:34.810
So I don't think any of the core Trump people,
um,
are,

381
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.870
have looked and gone,
you know what,
I voted for Trump.

382
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.540
But now I think this identity politics left makes sense.

383
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.940
Like there's gotta be somebody out there like that,

384
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:44.740
but I don't think there's many.
But you know,

385
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:49.060
another thing is look on the left right now you've got,

386
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.220
you've got the,
the far leftist,
the Democratic Socialists,
whatever they are,

387
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.160
and then you've got the couple liberals that are trying to figure out who they

388
00:21:57.161 --> 00:22:00.730
are and where they are and where they should be.
And that's it.
That,

389
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.960
that really is it.

390
00:22:01.961 --> 00:22:05.050
Maybe you've got some further left Green party people or something like that.

391
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:07.210
But in terms of what the discussion is on the left,

392
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:08.980
it's either you by identity politics,

393
00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:12.010
you buy that the Americas and evil patriarchy and all of those things.

394
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.130
Or you're pretty much on the outs.
I'm,
I'm being slightly hyperbolic here.

395
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:19.990
Obviously on the right though,
I do see intellectual diversity.

396
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:24.130
You've got the Trump wing,
you've got the anti Trump,
never Trump people.

397
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.070
You've got this new wing of Libertarians.

398
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:30.280
And I'd say classical liberals that are kind of going,
all right,

399
00:22:30.281 --> 00:22:31.480
we can play ball here.

400
00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:35.080
We seem to be able to have conversations with these people.
Um,

401
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.840
so even if we're not one of them necessarily,

402
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:40.480
or even if we don't consider ourselves conservative per se,

403
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.130
at least there we can talk to these people.
Uh,
I can tell you that for me,

404
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.811
I go to,

405
00:22:46.811 --> 00:22:50.840
I go to college events and I go to these events with Jordan and I go to Alyssa

406
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.360
and I do stand up and all these things.

407
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.830
And I talk about often too conservative crowds,
relatively conservative crowds,

408
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:58.240
let's say.
Um,

409
00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.320
and I talk about being gay married pro choice against the death penalty for

410
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:06.430
legalizing marijuana,
for euthanasia,
for reforming the prison system.

411
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:09.730
All of these things.
And people seem to dig it even if they disagree,

412
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.940
they want to have that conversation.
So I see that you got the trumps,

413
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:16.360
you've got the never trumps,
you got the libertarians,
classical liberals.
Um,

414
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:19.330
and then you probably have some,
other than,
I guess you probably have some,

415
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.750
some more neo-cons,
but maybe that's the,
the,
the never Trumpers,

416
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.320
but basically you've got a couple of wings that are kind of battling it out

417
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:30.010
right now,
not as Trump take most of the oxygen in that space.
Of course he does.

418
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.050
Absolutely.
Um,

419
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:37.040
but at least there's some level of healthy debate there.
Um,

420
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.710
and I think those people are malleable.
You know,
when I go to,
uh,

421
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.610
I spoke at the turning point USA,
um,
young leadership summit.
It was the,

422
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.970
I think they said it was the largest gathering of young conservatives in

423
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:54.730
American history.
I spoke there,
a Peter Teal spoke there.
Seb Gorka spoke there.

424
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.800
Um,
a whole slew of a,
Steve Scully's spoke there.

425
00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:59.960
I can't it's own wines and Charlie Kirk and whole bunch of others.

426
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.790
And what I found was young conservatives really are open minded.

427
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:09.200
The portion of the right that really perhaps was closed minded or really was

428
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:13.400
against gay marriage who are really,
um,
was against some of the social stuff.

429
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.780
I think that portion of,
of the religious rights say the Mike Huckabee Wing,

430
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.780
um,
I,
I don't think they have as much influence anymore.

431
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.800
And I think that partly it's because some of us in the online space have been

432
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:30.500
somewhat effective communicating that for conservatives,

433
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:33.470
if you guys want to live your lives however you want to live them,

434
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.620
you've got to let other people live their lives however they want to live them.

435
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:37.111
In this case,

436
00:24:37.111 --> 00:24:40.610
say gay people or people that want to smoke pot or whatever the hell it is

437
00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:41.540
somebody wants to do.

438
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.720
So I'm really enthused by the fact that I see a libertarian strain in the

439
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.920
Republican Party.
Look,
you know,

440
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:51.650
I've done a couple of videos with Ben Shapiro on the gay marriage issue and I

441
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:53.900
don't even like talking about it anymore because the ship has sailed.

442
00:24:53.901 --> 00:24:58.040
Gay Marriage is here and they're not going to suddenly force a zillion gay

443
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:01.850
people to get divorced and all that.
They don't like divorce either.
Okay.
Um,

444
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.890
but when I hear someone like Ben Shapiro who wasn't,
he wasn't like screaming,

445
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.890
get the government out of marriage before gay marriage.
Right?

446
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.770
But once it was passed by the Supreme Court,

447
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.600
Ben Takes the Libertarian position on it that the government shouldn't be

448
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.570
involved.
I hear Dennis Prager take the libertarian position on,

449
00:25:17.571 --> 00:25:21.770
I hear most of these guys take that position now.
That's,
that's just fine.

450
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.371
However,

451
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:25.880
you got to get to the right end conclusion that will maximize freedom for the

452
00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:28.790
most amount of people.
I think that's the best thing possible.

453
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.830
So I see some hope there.
And I know I'm,
I'm on the outs of what many of my,

454
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:38.090
uh,
my friends and,
and some of my idea w crew think about this.

455
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.290
Um,
but that,
but first off,
that's healthy and we're happy to talk about it.

456
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:44.330
So that's,
that's most important.
Um,

457
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:49.070
but I think the Democrats have to be destroyed and out of that destruction,

458
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.840
maybe something good comes out of it and they,
they reconfigure,
they figure out,

459
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.520
oh,
we're going to return to our roots.
Where are Daniel Patrick Moynihan?

460
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.550
Where our JFK is,
where are the blue dog Democrats?

461
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.430
And then because of their moderation,
right?

462
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:06.980
Because then they'll have taken their party from the far left.

463
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:10.370
They'll have brought them in a little bit.
I think what can happen on the right,

464
00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:13.100
and I'm seeing this,
I'm,
I just,
I'm seeing it,

465
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:16.520
I'm seeing it every night when I go out and I give these talks literally all

466
00:26:16.521 --> 00:26:17.331
over the world now,

467
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:20.270
but I'll do it from American context for the purposes of this.

468
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:25.450
It's like I go out there and I see tolerance amongst conservatives.

469
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:28.280
It's not what you will see on CNN.
We're,
you know,

470
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:29.510
Don Lemon's going to tell you that,

471
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.620
that all white men are evil terrorists or whatever the hell he said.
It's like,

472
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:37.730
you're not going to see that.
Um,
but I'm seeing it for real and that's why,

473
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.810
that's why I'm enthused.
I'm enthused generally right now because,
uh,

474
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.550
I live in two different,
I live in the Twitter world and as I said,

475
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:48.000
then I live in the real world where I'm meeting all sorts of great people doing

476
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:50.340
all sorts of things.
So I think there's a chance that,

477
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:55.140
that through all of this we'll see a resurrection,

478
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.440
uh,
of the Democrat if they get destroyed.

479
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.450
And I think at the same time that could cause an embolding and emboldenment of

480
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:08.340
the,
of the decent conservatives of which I think there are many now so that they

481
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:11.550
will push out the bad voices in their party.

482
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:16.551
So there were real done race realists or the white supremacists or the real far

483
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:20.040
right people who want America to be a white ethno state,

484
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.380
which is completely against,
uh,

485
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:26.010
the founding documents and that everything that America is and is not

486
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:30.120
conservative by any stretch of the imagination.
If anything,

487
00:27:30.121 --> 00:27:32.310
oddly that's more left if you really think about it,

488
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:34.880
because that's about big government making decisions about people.

489
00:27:34.881 --> 00:27:37.320
If you want people to truly be free,
which you freedom,

490
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:41.640
ultimate freedom is on the right.
Um,
I don't see how that even makes sense,

491
00:27:41.641 --> 00:27:43.950
but that's a,
that's a whole other topic.
Um,

492
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.860
how sort of race got caught up between the right left dichotomy?

493
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.520
And as I always say,
it's like this is not even about right left anymore.

494
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.700
You're either for state power or your for personal freedom.

495
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.180
If you believe in the individual,
then look,
then look down the,

496
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.230
look down the line,

497
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:02.730
look at all of the candidates you've got there in which ones and which party do

498
00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:07.230
you think will give you more power to control your life.

499
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.960
That will allow you to control more of your money,

500
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.220
you to figure out how you want to live and where you want to live and not take

501
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:18.060
from you or give to you and take from someone else or any of those things.

502
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.420
And generally that happens to be the Republican's right now.

503
00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.170
And I say this is again,
I am not a Republican.
Oh,

504
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.990
okay.
So let's,
uh,

505
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.840
let's make a couple of predictions or should I do a couple of questions here?

506
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.050
Hey guys,
give me a,
uh,
for my guys,
I'm talking to you guys right now.
Throw me a,

507
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.400
like two or three good questions right at the top of my document here.
Uh,

508
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:43.030
and I'll jump on those first.
Um,
oh,
by the way,
guys,
real quick.
Um,

509
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.780
if you're in the La area,
I'm at the,
uh,

510
00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:50.070
the Braya Improv on November 13th and,

511
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.890
and on Fort on the 14th.
I'm at Oxnard at liberty live,
uh,

512
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.710
and I will be with an IDW member doing standup.

513
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.410
So I do about an hour of stand up and then I bring on one of the IDW people.

514
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.420
We did this with Jordan Peterson as a surprise guest,
sold out,

515
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.440
sold out a salt lake city a couple weeks ago.
It was great.

516
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.970
I crushed it for like an hour.

517
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:12.540
And then I brought out Peterson and we just laughed and told jokes for like

518
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:15.420
another 45 minutes or hour or so.
Uh,
by the way,
guys,
also,

519
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:19.470
if you want to jump in on the questions that I'm going to be doing right now,
um,

520
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.430
you can go to patreon.com/ruben report and we're doing all sorts of interesting

521
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:24.780
things with patron on these days.

522
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:28.560
It's called Reuben select and we've got a members only feed where people are

523
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:30.390
having actual decent conversation,

524
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:34.440
very different often than the youtube comment section or Twitter and things of

525
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:38.130
that nature.
Okay.
So what the hell am I doing here?
Quick reset a,

526
00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:41.100
I'm talking election.
I'm live in Sweden right now.

527
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.070
I've got a show in about an hour and a half with Jordan Peterson and a,

528
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:49.690
I'm telling you my thoughts on,
uh,
on what I think will happen and,

529
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:51.910
or what I think should happen to kind of give us an out.

530
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.320
I've already given you that,
right?

531
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:57.700
A sorta just the destruction of the Democrats so that they finally start waking

532
00:29:57.701 --> 00:30:02.560
up again.
That was what I was asking for before Trump was ever elected.
Guys,

533
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.440
guess what's going to happen?
Trump's going to get elected if,
uh,

534
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:10.390
if the Democrats don't run from this identity politics stuff and run from

535
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.930
calling everybody racist and bigots,
but they haven't,
they've just doubled down,

536
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:15.640
double down,
double down,
double down.

537
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.970
And one of the reasons you're probably watching this and you're probably into

538
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:23.050
what the IDW is doing is because were were some of the few people that are

539
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:27.250
willing to talk about it mostly as,
as former lefties.
I mean,

540
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:30.430
if you look at the IDW crew,
if you look at,

541
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.670
at Eric and Brett and Sam and me and even Christina and Joe Rogan,

542
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.210
most of these people were for their either lefties.

543
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.000
Now if you can accept that that's still part of the left or they're at least

544
00:30:43.001 --> 00:30:44.020
former lefties,
you know,

545
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:47.200
there's only really the ones that I would say are traditionally conservative.

546
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:49.840
Really Shapiro is probably the only one.
So it's so funny,

547
00:30:49.841 --> 00:30:53.260
people will paint us as if we're all these right wing maniacs as the Guardian

548
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:56.650
tried to do this week.
And it's like,
no,
but,

549
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.500
but the more that you write articles like that,

550
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:04.360
the more that you make it clear that nobody that has a free thought is allowed

551
00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:06.990
to be part of the left.
Well then you're making the right,
the biggest tent ever.

552
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:07.181
And I,

553
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:10.060
that's another thing that I think is happening right now and that's why I said

554
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:13.210
there's these different columns on the right that are acceptable and that are

555
00:31:13.211 --> 00:31:17.140
having healthy dialogue and there is just not happening the other way.
Okay.

556
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.390
So here we go.
Let me,
let me knock out one or two questions and then,
uh,

557
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:25.950
and then I'll jump into some actual predictions.
Um,

558
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.680
Dave politicians keep throwing around the term blue wave without defining,

559
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.690
defining it.
In your opinion,

560
00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:35.920
what type of election results would constitute a wave?
Um,

561
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.750
well I'm going to get to my predictions in a minute,
so I'm,
let me,

562
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:41.980
let me hold that one for,
uh,
for just a sec.
Um,
I love this question.

563
00:31:41.981 --> 00:31:46.030
If you were famous in a feel disconnected from politics,

564
00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.420
would you speak out on political issues or would you stay out of it?

565
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.420
So this is tough.
So one of the questions,

566
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:55.870
we get most of these Jordan Peterson events and when I do the stand up events

567
00:31:55.871 --> 00:31:59.350
and whatever else is people that are kind of afraid to say what they think.

568
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:02.680
And often we get this ecologies where kids are afraid to say what they think to

569
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:05.620
their professors because they don't want their grades to be hurt.

570
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.320
But we get this all the time from people that are afraid to say that they,

571
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:08.591
you know,

572
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:11.140
I'm for low taxes and people are going to say you're racist and then you're

573
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:14.380
gonna get fired or something like that.
Or you'll be on the outs at your job.

574
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.190
Now that's,
that's not for a famous person,
that's just for the day to day person.

575
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:22.330
And that's,
that's most of us,
right?
So,
so that's pretty freaking scary that,

576
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.160
that there is a huge amount of people in the West walking around afraid to say

577
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:29.680
what they think.
That's why years ago I was saying this thing about,

578
00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.980
I'm not afraid right now and I still stand by this.

579
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:34.150
I said this about two years ago.

580
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.110
I am not afraid of the government coming from my free speech right now.

581
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.390
I am afraid that the masses are actively silencing themselves.

582
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.930
And then what happens when you have a,

583
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.250
a massive group of people that this little Chihuahua,

584
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.350
I think as Eric Weinstein is called the Chihuahua effect,

585
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:51.830
you've got this little massive people that are yelping and screaming like a

586
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.580
Chihuahua.
It's just really loud.
It seems much bigger than it is.

587
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.870
And then it has infected the media and it's infected academia and the rest of
it,

588
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.180
but it's,
I really still believe this.

589
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:05.060
It's not that many people that believe that stuff.

590
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:10.120
It just has figured out a way to just permeate through the system in the worst

591
00:33:10.281 --> 00:33:14.870
possible ways.
And if enough of us would just stand up and look at the Chihuahua,

592
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.800
just stare at that freaking shower.
I think that you are,
we would go running.

593
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:20.720
And I think that that's what we've got to do here.

594
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.030
That sort of the metaphor for it,

595
00:33:23.031 --> 00:33:26.600
but you gotta do is go out and vote and say no more Chihuahua,
not gonna find it.

596
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:26.991
Actually,

597
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:31.880
I think it was the Atlantic that published a study uphold maybe three weeks ago

598
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:36.881
or so that basically only 8% of people in America really are on board.

599
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.380
All of this political correctness,
social justice stuff.

600
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.150
So if that's true,
we should not be afraid of them.
And many of them,
by the way,

601
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:49.850
their cell phoning hostages there,

602
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:54.110
their own hostages because they've used those tactics.
I see this all the time.

603
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.070
If you're one of these people that has used the tactics of calling everyone you

604
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:01.370
know,
a bigot and a racist,
everyone that you disagree with as a bigot,

605
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.540
well first off,
this is why Peter,
but goes and calls it a a secular religion.

606
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.470
It's so morally empowering.
How incredible is that?

607
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.120
You're saving the world because you're fighting bigots or fighting Nazis and you

608
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:17.870
can punch Nazis,
can't you?
This is a huge problem.
It,

609
00:34:17.871 --> 00:34:19.790
it inflates your ego,
it inflates your,

610
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:24.050
your sense of self importance and it makes it like you're on a religious
mission.

611
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:26.240
These are the very same people who hate religion.

612
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.070
So I think most people are not for that.
I would say by and large,

613
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.560
80% of people just want to live and let live.

614
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.110
Now within that 80% you're going to have some that are gonna lean,

615
00:34:36.111 --> 00:34:38.930
conservative and maybe are,
I mean abortion,

616
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:42.090
I just think is an easy one to discuss this matter.
Let's say they're pro life,

617
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.890
but they want to basically live and let live and then you've got a within that

618
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:49.900
80% democrats or people on the left who are,
uh,

619
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.830
pro choice and,

620
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.520
but basically they want to live in the same society and they don't want the

621
00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:58.280
government coming in and telling everyone how to live and all of that.

622
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.820
And they don't want open borders.
You know,
I love the open borders one.
It's like,

623
00:35:01.821 --> 00:35:06.290
man,
the same people who all day long,
we'll tell you what an evil,
racist,

624
00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:10.100
patriarchy,
America's,
what do they also want?
Open borders?

625
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.430
Because apparently they want everyone to share in the horror that is America.

626
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.800
You know,
nobody ever leaves.
I say this all the time,
right?

627
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:20.120
It's like nobody ever leaves Lena Dunham.
She's still here.
She's still here.

628
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:22.070
I'm sure she could have a lot of people that would help her leave.

629
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.790
But she's still here because everyone knows at the end of the day,

630
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.740
at the end of all of the arguments,

631
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.920
tell me how horrible and evil at racist America is.

632
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:34.970
Tell me all of these deeply ridiculous things.
Not to say we're perfect,

633
00:35:34.971 --> 00:35:39.210
but tell me again and again and again how evil we are in the patriarchy and all

634
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.950
of this stuff.
And at the end,

635
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.880
everyone wants to come to America and nobody wants to leave.

636
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.770
And that tells you something.

637
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:49.650
So the next time they tell you this is like Nazi Germany.
You know what,

638
00:35:49.651 --> 00:35:54.210
Nazi Germany didn't let citizens leave Nazi Germany put its own citizens in

639
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:58.170
concentration camps.
People weren't dying to get in to Nazi Germany.

640
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.960
They were dying to get out of Nazi Germany.
Um,
so,

641
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:05.820
so also the super litigious in the hyperbole that they use is really,
uh,

642
00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:09.240
is really terrible.
So in answer to your question for famous people,

643
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:12.600
so this is someone like an actor,
let's say,
or an athlete or whatever.
I mean,

644
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:16.960
I can tell you this.
So Mark Ruffalo is a big,
uh,
lefty activist and mark rough.

645
00:36:16.961 --> 00:36:18.570
Hello.
For those of you that don't know he is,

646
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.960
he plays the hulk in the Avengers movies.
Um,

647
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.450
I followed him on Twitter for a while and he just,

648
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:27.690
he's all about identity politics.
I mean all the things that I,
that I don't like,

649
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.280
he's entitled to his views,

650
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:33.210
but like it was just like this endless stream of all of this stuff that I don't

651
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:36.330
like to the point that I was just like,
I just don't like this guy anymore.

652
00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.130
I don't like them.
And I unfollowed him.

653
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.680
But then when I was watching and then I hadn't thought about him first,
I dunno,

654
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.900
six or eight months or something.

655
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.170
And then as I was watching Avengers infinity war,

656
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:49.650
which was fan freaking tastic by the way,
um,

657
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.270
every time he would pop up on screen,
I could see the man mark rough,

658
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:57.150
low and not Bruce banner or the hulk.
I could just,
I was just like,
ah,

659
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.980
you've brought politics into this.

660
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.640
Nobody wants to think about politics when you're watching the Avengers.

661
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.820
And you guys have done that.
So.
So look,

662
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:09.480
you should use your voice however you see fit.
And Colin Kaepernick,

663
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:13.770
who I basically disagree,
uh,
with on,
on the bigger issues,

664
00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:17.220
he's welcome to do what he wants.
The owners are welcome to do what they want.

665
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:19.440
Trump is welcome to do what,
what he wants.

666
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.310
The media is welcome to critique and back whoever they want.

667
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.790
And that whole thing,
as I've said many times,
was an exercise in freedom.

668
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.550
Everyone said what they wanted and nobody got fired for it.
Everyone,
the,

669
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.570
everyone made the decision accordingly.

670
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.350
It was an exercise in freedom and freedom is a little sloppy and sometimes it

671
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:41.410
may not feel that great at the end.
Um,
because that's what freedom is.
It's,
it's,

672
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.170
it's the experiment if the experiment of life and the best thing you can do out

673
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:46.891
of that experiment,

674
00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:50.220
if you want to get something better after he's given as much opportunity for

675
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:54.990
freedom to take root.
Um,
so as for,
as for public people,

676
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.410
it's on them to decide what to do.
But I see this,
I have friends,

677
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:03.240
I mean good friends who are,
who are in Hollywood,
who are big lefties that,

678
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:07.950
you know,
tweeting and doing all this stuff.
And I'm like,
could you just not,

679
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:11.340
it's also,
it's sort of like,
just because you're an actor,

680
00:38:11.341 --> 00:38:14.100
it doesn't mean people care what you think and if anything,

681
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:16.890
I think at this point there may be getting more people to vote against the

682
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:19.530
things that they're pushing than,
than the other way around.

683
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.310
But I would say ultimately it's,
it's on everyone to figure that out.
Um,
okay,

684
00:38:23.311 --> 00:38:27.390
one more and then I'll jump in and on a couple of other things.
Um,

685
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.270
why,
this is a great one.

686
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:34.530
Why is a candidate who vows to support and follow the constitution such a hard

687
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:38.260
sell to Americans?
So I actually think that it isn't a hard sell,

688
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:41.140
but it has been framed as a hard sell because of the media.

689
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.950
Because basically if you,
if you are a constitutionalist,

690
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:47.920
so the closest we have to that,
I'd say there's a couple.
So you've got,

691
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.980
say Rand Paul who is the most libertarian member of the Senate.

692
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.210
You've got Ted Cruz,
he's pretty close to a constitutional conservative.
Uh,

693
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:58.810
you've got,
uh,
Mike Lee,
you know,
couple others.

694
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:01.750
You got Justin Amash up in,
uh,
in Michigan.
You got,

695
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:03.910
you got a couple that are a little more libertarian,

696
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:07.300
meaning they believe in states rights.
They believe in due process.

697
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:11.210
They believe in the constitution and letting states do as much as possible and,

698
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.380
and all that.
Now I think most people are for that,

699
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.600
but for some reason there's something about the cult of personality about the

700
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:23.710
presidency that makes us,
it's almost like we want a king.

701
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.330
And you know,
in Europe they often have prime minister who is in effect,

702
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.130
the president,
the one that's the head of the government.

703
00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:33.910
And then you've got the president.
It's a little bit different in every country,

704
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.140
but the president is often a sort of a figurehead that can go a,

705
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:43.141
have the dinners and meet the entrepreneurs and do and travel to other countries

706
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:46.060
and do all the niceties.
And in a weird way,

707
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:50.290
it's almost like we're starting to need that in America because Trump is now

708
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.450
both.
He's the president unless they get shit done.

709
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:55.480
And he's also the all encompassing personality all the time.

710
00:39:55.481 --> 00:40:00.370
Now that's also a little specific to to who Trump is and how he operates.
Um,

711
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.240
but I would say most people,

712
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:08.200
if they really understood what the constitution lays out,

713
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:13.230
the constitution is the most perfect document in modern history.

714
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.170
And it was only written a couple of hundred years ago.

715
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.310
It guarantees the most freedom for the most people.
It was,

716
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.840
I say this all the time guys,
it was written by imperfect men,

717
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.790
some of whom who own slaves,

718
00:40:27.791 --> 00:40:30.760
who later then we're writing the laws to free the slaves.

719
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.770
And we can look back and,

720
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.420
and use our 2018 judgements on all of the people of the past.

721
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:40.990
And guess what?
History will not be kind on you either.

722
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.820
Because if you eat meat right now,

723
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:47.530
in 40 years when they figured out all the ways to scientifically engineered
meat,

724
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.400
and there are pictures of you with a freaking ribeye bone in your mouth,

725
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:56.140
eaten meat and your grandchildren who will have been indoctrinated into all of

726
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.780
this,
look at you and think you're disgusting.

727
00:40:58.781 --> 00:41:02.500
And you just have to die and you're old and look what you did to the
environment.

728
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.070
It's like this,
this is real.
This is the repeating of history.

729
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:08.260
This is how generations move on and on and on.

730
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.210
And we've got us put an end to this.

731
00:41:10.211 --> 00:41:14.350
So I think most people do actually want to live by the constitution.

732
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.290
I think if most people really understood what limited government is,

733
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.620
if most people really understood that you should be involved more in your local

734
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:24.550
politics,
then in a national politics,

735
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.620
that if you don't like,
if Florida's education system is bad,
then move elsewhere.

736
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.680
They've got low taxes though.
So you might have to pay more taxes elsewhere.

737
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.370
If you care,
really care about,
uh,
legalizing marijuana,
you can move to cow,

738
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:41.870
Colorado.
If you don't like how lefty California is becoming a man,

739
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:45.530
the incredibly high taxes,
things that I'm not thrilled with,
right?
Um,

740
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.070
then then leave California and maybe go to Arizona.

741
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.610
What an incredible experiment you had.
You're not,
doesn't mean it's easy.

742
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:56.450
It doesn't mean it's right.
Oh No,
I have not.
Right?
Cause I do think it is right.

743
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.430
It doesn't mean it's easy.
It means it's on you to figure out a place to live in,

744
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:04.160
a community,
to be part of and all of those things.

745
00:42:04.161 --> 00:42:07.970
And you have an opportunity to do it here because if the federal government

746
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:10.560
controls everything,
you got to leave the freaking country.
And,

747
00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:13.460
and if you want a little bit more on this,
just so that I'm not repeating myself,

748
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.660
a check out.
My interview from about two years ago with Randy Barnett,

749
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:20.150
who's a constitutional law professor at Georgetown.

750
00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:23.810
He's argued in front of the Supreme Court.
Um,
he talks about the foot boat.

751
00:42:23.811 --> 00:42:27.800
It's one of the real conversations that I had that affected me the most in terms

752
00:42:27.801 --> 00:42:32.570
of why small government and constitutional principles is,
uh,
is important.

753
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:37.390
Okay,
let me,
uh,
let me jump over here guys.
By the way,
the,
uh,

754
00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:42.380
the link for the Standup Gigs November 13th and 14th in Bria and in Oxnard,

755
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:47.210
which are outside of La,
is in the description right down below.

756
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.250
I'm okay.
I've got to get to more questions.
People are getting,

757
00:42:49.251 --> 00:42:51.320
people are giving me questions and I've got to get to them.
Uh,

758
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.520
from your recent travels,

759
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:55.670
do you have an impression of how Europe and Scandinavia are handling these

760
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:56.510
issues of identity,

761
00:42:56.511 --> 00:43:00.320
politics and freedom of speech or more specifically if they're left feels

762
00:43:00.321 --> 00:43:03.200
different from that of the states in a significant way?
Now look,

763
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:07.220
it's a little bit the type of people who are coming to an event where Jordan

764
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.110
Peterson and I are speaking,
um,
obviously our self selected groups.

765
00:43:11.111 --> 00:43:13.880
So I'm talking to people who are very sensitive to these issues who are

766
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:15.950
concerned about the direction of their country.

767
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:18.950
They're worried about free speech,
they're worried about identity politics.

768
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.640
You know,
here in the,
in the Nordic countries that we've been in now Oslo,

769
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.000
uh,
and,
and here in Sweden us,

770
00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:28.280
this is the particularly interesting one because as I said,

771
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:31.670
we have a lot of viewers in Sweden and it does seem like there's something,

772
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:34.790
a little more precarious happening in Sweden at the moment.

773
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.260
I'm going to talk about it on stage tonight and we'll see.
We'll see.
Um,

774
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.440
you know,
people will always below the left often will say,
oh,

775
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:45.290
look at the Nordic countries,
look at these Socialists Nordic countries.

776
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.251
And it's like,
you know,

777
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:51.251
these countries are pretty much all white and I know you don't like that.

778
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:55.880
And they have a shared culture and they have a shared history.

779
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.210
And that actually isn't what America is.

780
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:03.650
We are the great melting pot and there is a difference when you have people that

781
00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:07.790
all come from one area and all have a shared history and a shared culture that

782
00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:11.000
just is,
that has nothing to do with racism or anything like that.

783
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.013
But at the same time,

784
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:16.340
I think these countries are all having their own struggles because as the,
uh,

785
00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.880
as the immigration numbers change and things like that and integrating people,

786
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.680
I think things have gotten a little bit weird.

787
00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:24.230
And I think this is happening across Europe.
You can watch,
uh,

788
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.820
read Douglas Murray,
his great book,

789
00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:30.200
the strange death of Europe and Germany struggling with this after letting in a

790
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.960
million plus and then how much can you give to people and then it's hard to get

791
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:36.850
them off the Dole and how do you integrate them and,

792
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.870
and all of that almost has nothing to do with religion even.

793
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:44.550
So don't make this about religion even.
Um,
so it's a little hard to say.

794
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:45.830
I think I'll have a better sense.
We're,

795
00:44:45.831 --> 00:44:48.580
we're doing a second show in Oslo and a couple of days and we'll be back here
in,

796
00:44:48.581 --> 00:44:52.140
in Sweden and a couple of days to,
uh,
I can tell you from the people I'm meeting,

797
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:53.880
there is a definite concern about it.

798
00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.050
And what a lot of them I think have said to me is that they're worried that the

799
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:01.700
culture war that seems to be being fought so hard in America right now.

800
00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:05.070
He's starting to leak into these countries.
But that's what the Internet is,

801
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:07.410
right?
Like we're all talking about the same things.

802
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.270
I can tell you one of the most inspiring things.

803
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.800
It's inspiring and kind of dangerous,

804
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:15.150
I guess at the same time or a little scary is that I'm speaking to people all

805
00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:18.210
over the world right now and it's really cool like last night,

806
00:45:18.211 --> 00:45:22.050
so at these Q and A's that I do,
um,
so people can buy an extra ticket.

807
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.580
Jordan does a separate meet and greet after and then I do a meet and greet and

808
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.980
Jordan usually gets about 100 people or so,
or maybe more than that.

809
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.220
And mine's usually smaller,
like 20 or so people.
It's all good.
It's Jordan,

810
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.320
Jordan show.
I'm not Jordan,
it's no problem.
Um,

811
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.710
but because I have a smaller group,
I can Jordan really,
you know,

812
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:39.630
he could take a picture with you.
He can say hi real quick,

813
00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:41.100
but they got to kind of keep it moving on.

814
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.580
Although people are thrilled to do it and it's wonderful for mine.
Usually we do,

815
00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:50.280
we go into my green room or a side room or a cafeteria and I get 20 or 30
people,

816
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:53.100
uh,
sometimes less,
sometimes more.
And we all kind of sit around and we,

817
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:56.010
and we chat about things and we really get one on one time and I get to meet a

818
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:58.650
lot of these people and hear their concerns and what they're talking about.

819
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.280
And it's like last night when we were in,
um,

820
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.750
where the hell was I last night was that,
oh,
we were in,
uh,
in Helsinki,
uh,

821
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.940
I chatted with a couple a Finnish people.

822
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:12.990
There was a girl and a guy there from Estonia and she was talking about the

823
00:46:12.991 --> 00:46:15.330
exact same things that the Finnish people were talking about.

824
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:18.990
There was a guy that was originally from Mexico who moved to Finland and he was

825
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:20.220
talking about the same things.

826
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.130
It's like this stuff really does transcend borders.

827
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.870
And I'm meeting people that are,

828
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.830
that are black and white and gay and straight and Trans people showing up just

829
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:31.110
Peterson shows at everything.
And,

830
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.350
and people want to fight this identity politics thing.

831
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:38.640
I think a huge growing number of people see it and that that sort of brings us

832
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:41.970
all the way back to the beginning about why I think the Democrat Party,

833
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.850
the Democratic Party in America sorta has to be.

834
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.770
It has to be hollowed out and rebuilt and I,
and I hope that is what will happen.

835
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:51.563
All right.
Let's see.

836
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:56.370
Are you concerned about the response to the left if they don't gain power in the

837
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.170
U s tomorrow?
Yeah,
I mean,
again,

838
00:46:58.171 --> 00:47:03.171
this is why calling your opponent's racist and Nazis and claiming that

839
00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:06.510
everyone's a white supremacist,
this is why it's so dangerous.

840
00:47:06.511 --> 00:47:09.560
There's no way to walk that back.
It's pasta.

841
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.600
Like I just have fundamental differences with the people that I'm talking about

842
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:18.990
here,
right?
I have differences of political opinion.
I don't think they're evil.

843
00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:23.220
I think there are some evil people pulling the strings that that some of the

844
00:47:23.221 --> 00:47:27.540
leadership was really bad people who just want power.
But I think by in large,

845
00:47:27.541 --> 00:47:29.980
the road is the road to hell is with good intentions.

846
00:47:29.981 --> 00:47:31.630
And I don't think most of these people are evil.

847
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:33.970
But Dennis Prager has a great line on this.

848
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.270
He says the right things that the left is wrong,

849
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.970
the left thinks that the right is evil.

850
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.880
And I think that that's pretty spot on here.
They,

851
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.270
if you believe that everyone you're arguing against is a Nazi,

852
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:47.680
well then you're never going to concede.

853
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:50.230
And this was also the danger from beat one.

854
00:47:50.231 --> 00:47:54.010
If you're going to keep calling Trump Hitler,
which actually is the it for this,

855
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:55.720
people that hate cultural appropriation,

856
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:57.880
this is the height of cultural appropriation.

857
00:47:57.881 --> 00:48:02.040
Taking a man who committed a mass genocide caused the,

858
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.240
I mean 6 million Jews,
20 million Russians,
Gore,
world war,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

859
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:11.230
It's like you've just appropriated the deaths of an awful lot of people to,

860
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.550
to put it on,
to put it on Trump for all the flaws that he,
this man might have.

861
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.750
Um,
but once you label somebody these horrible things,

862
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.880
it's almost impossible to walk it back.

863
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.470
So let's say they get destroyed tomorrow,
the left gets destroyed,
right?

864
00:48:26.471 --> 00:48:27.580
The Democrats get destroyed.

865
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.770
What would be sensible would be a moment of reflection.
Maybe we screwed up here.

866
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.740
Maybe we have gone a little bit off the deep end.
Maybe.

867
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.890
Maybe the American people are realizing that it can't just be the way we wanted.

868
00:48:40.891 --> 00:48:45.190
It can't just be big government and Bernie and Elizabeth Warren because we want

869
00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:49.810
it.
Um,
that what we really wanted smaller government that way.
A guy like Trump,

870
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.750
if we really think he's the devil,
can't have too much power,

871
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:55.270
that would be a sensible reevaluation.

872
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.040
Is there any evidence that that will happen?
I know,

873
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.550
I mean there isn't,
like I'm telling you what I think is the,
is the,

874
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:08.830
is the tiniest possibility here to get us out of this mess is that the party

875
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:13.810
gets resurrected that that then Trump then feels like he has a bit of a mandate.

876
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.340
He then pulled,
he can then say to the,
whoever you think is on the right,

877
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:23.490
you know,
these,
these really bad guys.
I don't need you get out of my way and,

878
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.990
and you can govern perhaps a little bit more from the center,

879
00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:29.320
which sort of is what I think he's doing at the moment any way.

880
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:31.840
But for the people that wanted to take a stronger hit on the,

881
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:36.340
on the people on the far right,
perhaps he could do that.
Um,
and also,
you know,

882
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.760
I don't think the country,

883
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:43.190
I don't think any movement can exist on anger and resentment and outrage all the

884
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:47.740
time.
So who knows,
maybe after a couple of years,
if,

885
00:49:47.741 --> 00:49:50.950
if the Democrats really got beat Trump,
maybe it would be like,
you know what,

886
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:54.190
I did it in one term and now there would be an opportunity for a decent

887
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:57.710
conservative say and Nikki Haley or somebody like that,
uh,

888
00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.880
that would run on something very different than Trump because the country

889
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:03.910
wouldn't want outrage,
wouldn't want trolling.

890
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:08.650
It wouldn't want the battle between the media and,
and the presidency anymore.
So,

891
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.080
and Trump would just say,
all right,
I did one,
I won.

892
00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:13.480
I'm going to walk away a winner here.
Somebody else.
I mean,

893
00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:15.120
it sorta sounds like the apprentice,
doesn't it?

894
00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:17.170
Like I think anything is possible these days,

895
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.310
but we got to start thinking we need to start building a better story so that

896
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:24.820
the story,
so everyone's just thinking of a story that all ends horribly,

897
00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:27.500
but we need to start putting out some stories that end well and I think that

898
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:30.650
that could potentially be one of them.
Um,

899
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.610
what's your biggest Aha moment while being on tour with Jordan?
Uh,

900
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.790
have any of your views changed or evolved?
Well,
first off,
it really,

901
00:50:37.791 --> 00:50:41.960
this has been an honor that I can't even fully explain.

902
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:45.920
Like Jordan is the leading public intellectual in the world.

903
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.920
I think he is the most influential and clearest thinker that we have possibly

904
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.750
really in the world.
I mean,
I just don't know another,

905
00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:59.280
at least certainly someone that's speaking English.
Um,

906
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:03.800
this tour has been absolutely amazing.
There has not been a moment that has,

907
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:08.360
has gone awry or wrong.
Uh,
the worst thing that happened was one in one city,

908
00:51:08.361 --> 00:51:11.570
I can't even remember where it was maybe in,
in Miami.

909
00:51:11.571 --> 00:51:14.140
I said we were in Fort Lauderdale or something like that,
like,

910
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.710
like it's just been great.
Uh,
being around him is his kind of intoxicating.

911
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:22.730
I've really tried to incorporate the 12 rules into my life.
I'm not perfect,

912
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:24.770
but I'm trying to be,
as you can see,
I'm sitting up straight.

913
00:51:24.771 --> 00:51:27.830
I think my shirt fits right.
I'm not lying and all sorts of other stuff.

914
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:32.780
I pet a cat if I see it,
even though I'm allergic.
Um,
I would say,

915
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:35.750
you know,
his debate between,
uh,

916
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.940
the debate that he had between him and Sam,
uh,

917
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:42.470
about meaning and where does value come from?

918
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.060
And that to give you the very,

919
00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:49.061
very short version that Sam believes that meaning can come from facts alone,

920
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.530
although he does believe in the value of stories.

921
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:55.790
But Jordan believes that facts alone can't give value and that you need these

922
00:51:55.791 --> 00:52:00.110
stories and that he would argue that the stories of religion of Christianity

923
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:02.120
have given a,
um,
well,

924
00:52:02.121 --> 00:52:05.870
he would say the Old Testament and the new testament have given a,

925
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.880
have unlocked an ancient truth,
let's say a timeless truth.

926
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:15.410
Um,
he has kind of moved me on that.
It's pretty powerful stuff when I hear him,

927
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:19.520
uh,
go through it every night and he really does.

928
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:21.650
I mean I'm telling you guys 90 some odd shows.

929
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:25.700
I've been around for about 70 of them and he challenges himself every night.

930
00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.970
I haven't seen him do the same show twice.
And I also can tell you this,

931
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:33.950
this guy is not an actor.
He is exactly the same off stage,

932
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:36.260
off camera,
whatever it is that he is.

933
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:38.590
Otherwise we've eaten a lot of stakes together.
Uh,

934
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.620
we've had a lot of great conversations and uh,
and I'm honored.

935
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.270
I'm really am honored to be part of this thing and,

936
00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:46.130
and hopefully we're going to keep continuing it.
And,

937
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.530
and some other cool stuff is going on.

938
00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.910
How's the response to Jordan and you different in Europe than the US?
I mean,

939
00:52:52.911 --> 00:52:55.580
one thing,
although although last night in Helsinki was a little different,

940
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:59.180
the European cars are a little more tame.
So when I've gone up usually,

941
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:02.580
so the show starts,
they announced me and host of the room board,

942
00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:06.440
Dave Rubin in America,
the crowds have virtually all,
they go completely bananas.

943
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.860
Sometimes I get standing ovations before I even do anything.
I mean,
it really,

944
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:14.360
it's like,
I'm like,
holy cow,
I cannot believe this.
Um,
and then you know,

945
00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:16.850
there I like to play with the crowd so there'll be some heckling and some

946
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:19.400
screaming and I get people to kind of yell and have fun or whatever.

947
00:53:19.401 --> 00:53:20.840
I do my thing for 10 or 15 minutes.

948
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:24.110
Jordan then does his thing for about an hour and a half or so,
as I said,

949
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:28.050
different every single night.
And then,
uh,
and then we do a moderated Q and a,

950
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:31.310
the two of us for about 40 or 45 minutes.
The crowds in,

951
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.940
in Europe generally have been a little bit more subdued.
Some of the countries,

952
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:38.550
it's English isn't their first language,
but I don't think that's necessarily it.

953
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:39.890
I think there's a certain,
uh,

954
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.810
there's just a different feeling about sort of what theater or what live

955
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.240
performances.
But last night in Helsinki was,

956
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.320
was I think it might've been our best show.
I mean it was phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

957
00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.390
Um,
so,
uh,
it's a,
it's a little bit different.

958
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.560
I think maybe we've both been a little less political.

959
00:53:58.561 --> 00:54:02.190
The shows actually haven't been very political since we've been in Europe.
Uh,

960
00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:03.540
Jordan's going more to the,

961
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.770
to the biblical stuff and sort of the more direct responsibility of the

962
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:12.150
individual stuff.
Um,
so that I would say that's been one thing.
All right guys,

963
00:54:12.151 --> 00:54:14.880
we're going to go a little bit longer and then I have to meet that Jordan

964
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.820
Peterson Fella.
We are in a Denmark,
Sweden tonight.

965
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:21.890
We're back in Denmark next week.
Tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
We're in,
we're in,

966
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.980
we're in Sweden tonight.
Uh,
then we're in Denmark tomorrow.

967
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.670
We're back in Sweden next week.
We're back in Oslo next week,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

968
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:29.971
All right,

969
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:32.580
let me just jump in on a couple of super chats cause I see a whole bunch of you

970
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:37.380
a jumping in here.
Um,
Hey Dave,
love your work.
Thoughts on canvas,

971
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:39.990
Owens blood exit and it's effects on identity politics,

972
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.000
calling it nat calling it now Jewish exit jags.
It,
I mean,
look,

973
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:48.510
I think a lot of minorities are realizing you don't have to vote for the

974
00:54:48.511 --> 00:54:51.480
Democrats just because you're a minority if you're Asian.

975
00:54:51.481 --> 00:54:55.710
And you realize now that identity politics is working against you.

976
00:54:55.711 --> 00:55:00.480
Harvard is taking less Asians because they don't want too many Asians because

977
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:02.070
Asians tests to,
well,

978
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.540
you might realize this is a bad idea that is in been embraced by the Democrats.

979
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.270
Um,
so I think,

980
00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:13.080
I think also Jewish people suffer from this because Jews by and large put a

981
00:55:13.081 --> 00:55:17.710
tremendous amount into education and into family.
And because of that,
uh,

982
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.070
they have succeeded.
And because of success,

983
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:22.890
you're no longer thought of as a victim and nobody wants to be a victim.

984
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.760
But because of that then to the standards of the oppression Olympics now a bad

985
00:55:26.761 --> 00:55:31.080
guy.
So it's like,
you know,
which is why when this Pittsburgh thing happened,

986
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:32.400
which was absolutely horrific,

987
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:36.210
obviously it's like then suddenly the lefts all about the Jews,

988
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:41.100
but it's like you kind of like people that are victims and I'd rather be alive

989
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.970
and hated than dead and liked just,
that's just me though.

990
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:46.230
Um,

991
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.640
I'm 16 and I realize how outnumbered I am as a libertarian conservative.

992
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.050
Should the voting age be lowered?

993
00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.410
I don't think the voting age should be lowered right now.

994
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.650
I think there's just too much confusion related to the Internet and everything

995
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:00.240
else.
I,
I should do a little bit more on this.

996
00:56:00.241 --> 00:56:04.980
Let me get an x expert in to come and talk about that.
Um,
Dave,

997
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:07.020
nice show some of the best stuff on Youtube.
Quick question.

998
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:10.290
Do you think we're in the middle of a political realignment?
A massive one?

999
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:10.831
I mean,
I,

1000
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:14.370
this is what I'm saying about how these ideas are spreading across the world.

1001
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.250
I think the West is grappling with what freedom is.

1002
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:21.810
I think this is happening across borders.
I think people are waking up.
I mean,

1003
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:22.081
again,

1004
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:26.470
how cool is it that a young girl who I met in Astonia last night is sitting

1005
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:29.780
across from a Mexican immigrant to Finland riff,

1006
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:34.830
an American utuber listening to a Canadian psychologist.

1007
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.860
It's awesome.
It's incredibly inspiring.

1008
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:42.190
Don't you know we all watch you guys are right now,
right now,

1009
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:43.300
you person watching this,

1010
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:46.000
you're most likely watching on this thing or on your computer,
right?

1011
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.070
And chances are you're alone right now.

1012
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:52.480
Or maybe you're listening to it and it's like you're probably alone in it makes

1013
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:54.580
you think you're the only one thinking these things.

1014
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:59.850
But don't think that Joe Rogan's podcast is crushing it are audio podcasts has

1015
00:56:59.921 --> 00:57:01.690
now superseded our youtube views,

1016
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:05.110
whether Youtube unsubscribing people are not letting videos go out to the feed

1017
00:57:05.111 --> 00:57:08.680
or whatever.
We're doing better on the audio podcast side at this point.

1018
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.470
So it's a,
it's a lonely thing,

1019
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:15.190
podcasting and all this stuff because you don't know how many other people are

1020
00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:15.760
into it,

1021
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.230
but I believe way more our intuit and that's also why they keep calling us all

1022
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:23.320
bigots and racists and all of those other things because they're losing control

1023
00:57:23.321 --> 00:57:28.090
of the narrative.
Dominic,
read this out loud and make my day.
Ha Ha.
I did it.

1024
00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:29.710
Okay.
Um,

1025
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:33.370
is the IDW going to suggest specific legislation to fix issues?

1026
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:34.870
That's a really interesting idea.

1027
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.640
What I can tell you is we're trying to figure out what the future of the IDW is.

1028
00:57:39.641 --> 00:57:43.210
You know,
are we just about having conversations or is there a political future?

1029
00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:47.440
Maybe some people are going to run.
Not me.
I would run from politics,
uh,

1030
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:48.730
but if Shapiro,
who wants to be priced at,

1031
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:52.300
and maybe I'll be press secretary for like the most ridiculously scandal this

1032
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.710
week ever.
Um,
you know,
are we a,
are we are youtube replacement?

1033
00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:00.220
Are we a touring company?
Are we a publishing house?
I mean,
who knows?

1034
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:03.280
Are we all of these things?
I think we're,
we're having all of these discussions.

1035
00:58:03.281 --> 00:58:06.850
They're ongoing,
you know,
some of us have different wants and needs than others.

1036
00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:09.550
So we're trying to figure that all out.
Um,
Dave,

1037
00:58:09.551 --> 00:58:11.470
are you at the meet and greet tonight as well as Jordan?

1038
00:58:11.471 --> 00:58:14.440
I have a little gift to give you that.
I think you'll find funny.

1039
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:15.880
It would be nice to hand it over in a person.
Thanks.

1040
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:19.900
So I do a different meet and greet than Jordan does.
Um,

1041
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.880
but if you go to the OMG VIP website,
just search Omg VIP day.
Ruben,
uh,

1042
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:27.820
you should be able to get tickets to my meet and greet if they closed it already

1043
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:31.580
cause it's so close to show time.
Uh,
the name of the tour manager is John.

1044
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:35.020
That just hand John what you want to give to me and hopefully it's not rice in

1045
00:58:35.021 --> 00:58:38.980
or something like that.
Uh,
welcome to Sweden,
Mr Ruben.
Um,

1046
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.880
okay,
I'm sorry,
I'm not getting to as many questions as I would've liked to hear.

1047
00:58:42.881 --> 00:58:43.990
Okay.
So,
all right,
so wait,

1048
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:46.480
so it's time for predictions because I only got like two or three minutes left.

1049
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:51.220
So look,
I said a year ago,
I don't think this blue wave is going to happen.
Uh,

1050
00:58:51.221 --> 00:58:52.390
I just see too much,

1051
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:57.280
too much exposure of these bad ideas to really believe that now and the media

1052
00:58:57.281 --> 00:59:00.130
can't quite get it,
which shows you how archaic they are.

1053
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.440
So I'm going to make some predictions now.
Again,

1054
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.880
how did I start this thing an hour ago?

1055
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:06.670
Pr The prediction business is a bad business and all of the people that were

1056
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:07.720
promoting blue wave,

1057
00:59:07.721 --> 00:59:11.320
now we're sort of hedging head a hedging bets and everyone's going 50 50,

1058
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.880
it will all turn out.

1059
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:17.170
It'll all be about turnout and it will all be about who's enthused,

1060
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:21.040
who scared.
All of those things.
Um,
my

1061
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.610
is that conservatives are going to do better than most people think.

1062
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:32.060
I think enough of you are just sick of this and I don't even mean this,

1063
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:33.710
that you love the Republican's.

1064
00:59:33.711 --> 00:59:38.090
I just think enough people have been moved partly cause of legs.

1065
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:40.220
It partly because of identity politics,

1066
00:59:40.221 --> 00:59:44.870
partly because of the cries of racism and Misogyny,
all that.
A huge amount.

1067
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:46.430
By the way,
I didn't even talk about Cavenaugh at all.

1068
00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:49.430
I think a lot of people are still really upset about that,

1069
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.870
seeing the sort of destruction of due process.

1070
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:59.810
I think people are really upset about these things and I think they want to vote

1071
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.830
out people who hold these ideas now.
Yes.
Will,

1072
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:08.120
there'll be plenty of people that are still voting resistance that don't care

1073
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:11.480
about these issues or just think differently than I do on these issues.
Yes.

1074
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.970
So it's almost impossible to track.
However,

1075
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:16.830
my suspicion would be that there is going to,

1076
01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.340
I'm not going to call it a red wave,
I just,
you know,
we don't need these,

1077
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.830
these silly labels on all of these things.
Um,

1078
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:25.370
but I suspect that the Republicans will do better than,

1079
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:28.400
than most people are saying.
Um,
and,

1080
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.910
and if I'm wrong and the Democrats do really well,

1081
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.010
then I would hope,

1082
01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.360
I would hope that then they would say,
okay,
we did well.

1083
01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.270
Maybe we can moderate ourselves a little bit.
Again,

1084
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.850
there's no reason to think this.
There's just,
there just isn't.

1085
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.240
So the one way that I think we get out of some of the craziness is the Democrats

1086
01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:53.840
kind of get crushed.
The Republican's are gracious in victory.

1087
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.010
Trump is gracious in victory,
pretty low chance of that.
Right.

1088
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.080
And,
and he governs,
you know,
a little more from the center,

1089
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:05.660
although I think you could make a pretty solid argument that he has governed in

1090
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:08.300
many ways from the center.
And I'm talking,
I'm talking about policy,

1091
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:11.030
not rhetoric and Twitter.
Um,

1092
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:16.520
and that from that we could get a little bit of a return to normalcy.

1093
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:20.390
But no,
I don't expect the blue wave.
I mean,
look,
nobody knows.
So yes,

1094
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:21.710
it is possible tomorrow,

1095
01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.560
but that the Democrats will just come out in massive numbers.

1096
01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:28.310
The lefties will come out in massive numbers and then what happens?
I mean,

1097
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:31.550
they've been saying it from day one,
from the first day of the Trump presidency,

1098
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:32.630
we're going to impeach Trump.

1099
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.420
That that would be a scary place to be in two years of that.
Um,
so I,

1100
01:01:37.421 --> 01:01:41.360
I hope that that doesn't happen.
And I,
and just,
you know,
one other quick thing,

1101
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:44.300
which is,
um,
there's a lot of goodness out there.
Guys.

1102
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:49.100
Don't spend as much time on Twitter.
It's driving you crazy.
Um,
if,

1103
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:52.930
if watching all these videos don't give you anything,
uh,

1104
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.740
to take for your life that you can make a better life with or feel more

1105
01:01:57.741 --> 01:02:00.860
informed,
then don't watch them.
I don't mean just this,

1106
01:02:00.861 --> 01:02:03.860
I mean any of these things,
it's like,
you know,
people always say to me,
you know,

1107
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:05.570
they'll say,
oh,
well you should do more videos.

1108
01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:08.330
And usually we do one or two a week and it's like,
man,

1109
01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:13.331
if you give me an hour or two hours or sometimes three hours a week and then

1110
01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:16.070
maybe I'm going to assume that you may be listened to one of Sam's shows,

1111
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:19.040
you're maybe listened to a Rogan who puts out a couple episodes or Shapiro's

1112
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.750
putting our data that if you listen to enough,
some of that,

1113
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:25.650
let's say you dedicate five hours a week to really thinking about what the

1114
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:29.210
issues are.
That's a lot of time.
That's a lot of time.
You,

1115
01:02:29.211 --> 01:02:30.990
you do it on your commute,
you do it at the gym,

1116
01:02:30.991 --> 01:02:33.510
you do it when you're taking your dog for a walk,
whatever it is.

1117
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.400
But you've devoted time to this.

1118
01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:38.510
But there's other things that are important in life to,
as Jordan talks about,

1119
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:41.250
it's your adventure man.
And,
and figure out the best way to,

1120
01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:42.870
to live the best life you can.

1121
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:46.170
And the reason that I talk about ideas instead of people,

1122
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.740
the reason I am not focused on specific policies,

1123
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:52.620
although I will gladly tell you what I think about any policy,

1124
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.560
is because I don't think that is really what matters.

1125
01:02:55.561 --> 01:02:58.950
I think what matters is figuring out how we can have conversation,

1126
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.410
how we can plow through the difficult topics,

1127
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:06.150
how we can agree to disagree and what laws and what type of government we should

1128
01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:09.840
have that would allow the most of us to live exactly that way.

1129
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.730
Because I want to live free so that,

1130
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.330
so I know that there are people who don't like me.
You don't like my abuse,
right?

1131
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:20.280
But I don't want,
I don't want them to have power over me.

1132
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:22.740
And that means that I can't have power over somebody else.

1133
01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:26.520
So somebody else might do something with his life that I don't like,

1134
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:30.930
but you can't do it on my property and you can't,
you can't take my stuff.
Anyway.

1135
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:35.370
I do sense that some decency,
some return to,
uh,

1136
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:41.190
to intellectual ism.
Um,
some return to logic.
I think it's all possible.

1137
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.260
There is a chance that we can get some of this in order.
Um,
but it's on us.

1138
01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:49.020
Whether you live in the United States right now and you're voting tomorrow or

1139
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:52.530
whether you live here in Sweden or whether you live in Australia that we're

1140
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:56.460
going to go to in February or wherever else it is.
Um,

1141
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.360
and the fact that these ideas are spreading all over the place and the fact that

1142
01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:04.810
so many people are connecting over them,
that is seriously cool.
And yeah,

1143
01:04:04.811 --> 01:04:05.370
it's not,

1144
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:09.300
it's not going to be what cable news talks about every moment telling you the

1145
01:04:09.301 --> 01:04:12.870
new racist of the day or what did Trump tweet or the rest of it.

1146
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:16.740
But people are tuning out of that stuff in droves and you're tuning into things

1147
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:20.400
that I think are,
are way more important and way more powerful.
Um,

1148
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:24.750
so on that note,
um,
reminder,
November 13th and 14th,

1149
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:29.040

1151

1157
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:53.970
So I've been out there meeting all you guys.
It's awesome.
I mean,

1158
01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:56.490
I'm meeting all these cool people all the time.
People say,

1159
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:59.770
is it tiring being on the road?
Like what's it like?
I'm like,
man,
it's,

1160
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:03.690
it's awesome.
I meet great people all the time.
People say Nice things to me.

1161
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.620
It's pretty great.
Um,
yeah,
so it really is.
Anyway,

1162
01:05:07.621 --> 01:05:09.330
it's going to be an interesting couple of days in the states.

1163
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:11.940
I'm going to unfortunately be sleeping when the results are coming in,

1164
01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.030
but maybe I'll wake up around 4:00 AM or whatever time that is,

1165
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:19.510
maybe 5:00 AM and kind of figure out going on.
Uh,
I'm looking forward to,
uh,

1166
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.800
to Copenhagen tomorrow,
back here in Sweden next week back in a,

1167
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:27.030
in Helsinki stand up.
And then,
uh,

1168
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.090
we got a show in Hawaii right before Thanksgiving and all kinds of stuff.
Anyway.

1169
01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.580
Oh,
and I just do want to say one other thing.
You know,
as I've been on the road,

1170
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.850
I've been here,
I've had to go home for a little brief moments to do the show.

1171
01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:40.540
And I did one crazy thing,
which was I went to,
uh,

1172
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.010
to Bob Saget and Kelly resos wedding,
uh,
which was last Sunday.

1173
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.190
So I guess that's a week ago yesterday.
Um,

1174
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.110
and I flew home from where the hell was I?
I flew home from the UK,

1175
01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.340
uh,
for a day for literally one day,
a 10 hour flight to La,

1176
01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.720
went to the wedding and then flew to Amsterdam.
And I was just like,

1177
01:06:01.721 --> 01:06:04.480
I gotta do it.
Like it doesn't make financial sense certainly.

1178
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:06.460
And I missed a couple of shows and whatever else.
But I was like,

1179
01:06:06.461 --> 01:06:07.480
this is what life's all about.

1180
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:11.260
Like you don't want to miss all the cool things that you can be part of.
Um,

1181
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:15.130
but the reason I bring that up is because,
um,
you know,
we've had to take,
uh,

1182
01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:19.260
advanced tape a couple shows.
Um,
so like the,

1183
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:22.120
the Kyle cashew show that we put up a couple of days ago,
we had to tape,

1184
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:25.360
you know,
like 10 days ago,
Tucker had been taped a little bit before that,

1185
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:29.500
Janice few Manco and I was really concerned that the quality of the show and the

1186
01:06:29.501 --> 01:06:32.560
interviews was going to suffer because normally I would just try to do a show

1187
01:06:32.561 --> 01:06:36.160
and we get it out in a day or two,
sometimes that day or we live stream it.
Um,

1188
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:39.130
but I'm really happy to see that the quality has not suffered.

1189
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:43.450
I think some of the last few shows that we've done from Coleman hues to Tucker,

1190
01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:48.010
uh,
to these last couple of Kyle and Janice and everything else,
um,

1191
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.600
I think they've been some of our best shows.

1192
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.840
The one thing I really do miss and I,
and I appreciate your patience,

1193
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.090
is I really do miss doing the direct messages.

1194
01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:58.510
The issue with that of course is that the direct messages usually are about

1195
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:01.120
something pretty topical.
And I need to be home for that.

1196
01:07:01.121 --> 01:07:04.120
We've thought about doing a couple of them just off my computer like this.

1197
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.850
So maybe we'll do a little bit more.
So I do,
uh,

1198
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:09.640
I do look forward to getting back to that cause that's really where I can share

1199
01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:11.620
what I'm thinking with you guys.
Or maybe we'll just do,

1200
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:12.730
do some more live streams.

1201
01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:15.710
I'd love to know your thoughts in the comments right down below.
Uh,

1202
01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:19.030
and on that note,
I'm going to go hang out with JP and a couple thousand new,

1203
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.480
a Swedish friends.
And then I,
maybe I got,
I got to go to Ikea,
right.

1204
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:26.400
And have some Swedish meatballs.
Um,
anyway,
thanks guys.
And,
uh,

1205
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:29.470
and we'll see what happens.
And,
uh,
we shall

1206
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.540
<v 1>continue.
I'll see you soon.</v>
