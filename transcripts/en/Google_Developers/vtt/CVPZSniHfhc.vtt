MALE SPEAKER 1: Hi, guys.

00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:02.796
Welcome to our second
day here at I/O.

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:04.420
We're so excited to
have you guys here.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.442
Have a packed house up for
the YouTube distribute talks.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.150
And basically what we
want to get at here

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.490
is there's the design
and development

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.360
part of the process.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.943
But once you've built
a great product,

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:15.150
how do you get it out there.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.195
And I can't think of a
better example than Secret

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:18.820
and all the amazing
work, David, you've

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.100
done to get your
product out there.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.600
So thank you so
much for joining us.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.308
DAVID: Of course.

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:24.110
No worries.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.230
MALE SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.290
So why don't you
let us-- I know I've

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.950
been using the app obsessively.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.140
So take myself out of
the picture, can tell us

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.850
for people who haven't used
Secret, what exactly it is.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.080
How do you interact with it?

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.580
DAVID: Sure.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.340
So Secret is, I
would say, probably

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.760
the first anonymous
social application.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.710
Which might seem at
odds with each other.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.220
But what we do is we connect
people with their friends,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.980
but anonymously.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.820
So when you come on
and post, the postings

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.153
that you think and feel, and
your friends know it's you,

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:52.990
but they don't know-- well, they
know it's one of their friends.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.573
But they don't know
who it is exactly.

00:00:54.573 --> 00:00:57.700
And this has created a really,
really interesting network

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.635
of content.

00:00:58.635 --> 00:00:59.030
MALE SPEAKER 1: Aweome.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.690
And take us back to
through the days.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.030
When did you guys launch?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.740
DAVID: Yeah, so we launched
January 30 of this year.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.991
So it was about five months,
something like that. ago.

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:10.281
MALE SPEAKER 1: So let's
rewind back those five months.

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.620
What was day one like,
when you put it out there.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.596
Tell me about your first users.

00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:16.220
DAVID: So I remember--
well, we started

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.350
building it in mid November.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.430
So in mid November, we had
an app before that also

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.872
called Secret, but it was
more about anonymous one

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:26.580
to one messaging.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.038
But we wanted
something that people

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:29.230
would come back every day.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.710
So you're like well, you know,
what if we built something

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.722
where you just broadcast
out to your friends.

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:36.930
And so it's something that
they can see and come back

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.420
to every day as stream of stuff.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.030
So we tested it out with
about 200 of our friends

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.350
over a period of about
2 and 1/2 months.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.487
And you know, January
30 we're like,

00:01:45.487 --> 00:01:46.820
well it's good enough to launch.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.665
We think design is OK.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:50.540
Like, we'll just put it
out there and kind of

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.770
slip it out there quietly.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.800
And so I remember
I was introduced

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.420
to Mike Isaac, who was
formally at Re/code.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700
And I'm like, hey.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.480
We met over beers.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.390
I'm like hey dude,
like we have this app.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.973
Like maybe you want
to write about it.

00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:03.740
I don't know.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.040
So I wanted to just kind
of get it out there.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.831
And so he did that.

00:02:05.831 --> 00:02:07.570
He wrote one article.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.070
And then there was a bunch
of people joined here

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.820
in Silicon Valley.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.400
And because the way
the product works

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.900
where it connects
your social graph,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.390
it was immediate that
such a dense network

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.390
here that people were
just instantly connected.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.848
And they're connected
to stuff that

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:22.350
meant-- it was
interesting to them.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.450
It was like tech
stuff and things

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.540
that, rumors and all that.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.873
So it just like kind of blew
up and took off from there.

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:29.840
And a bunch of people
started writing about it.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.970
And we just started hanging on.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.190
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.731
Yeah, it seems that you guys
did a terrific job of overcoming

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.930
the networking effect that a
social network like yourself

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.469
needs.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.010
DAVID: Yeah, I mean, especially
in a dense network like this.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.370
But then after that, like
how do you break out of that?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.210
How do you get into
other areas, right.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.320
We saw a lot in the
beginning in California,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.739
mostly Silicon Valley,
and then LA and New York.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.280
These are kind of
our dense networks.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.470
And people were like
well, all the secrets

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.325
are just about tech.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.491
They're just about whatever.

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.360
But over time, it's become
much more mainstream.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860
And now even other
countries-- Russia

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.437
caught on very, very big.

00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:04.770
Honestly, I can't give you
the formula for how it works.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.820
MALE SPEAKER 1: There's a
lot of secrets in Russia.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.200
DAVID: There's a lot of secrets.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.220
MALE SPEAKER 1: On and off
your platforms, though.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.720
DAVID: Yeah.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.220
Yes.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.880
It was perfect.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.430
But as far as
distribution goes, I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.770
think it's just about
making a product that people

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.320
want to use.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.840
And when you have a
network effect like that,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.442
you have people who they join.

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:22.400
They're like oh, I want
my friends to see this.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.940
They show their friends,
that kind of things.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.150
It's just, it spreads.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.567
And I think most of it's
been word of mouth that way.

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:28.650
MALE SPEAKER 1: I love it.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.150
I love it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.347
And something else, I think the
odds were so far against you.

00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:34.430
I want to bring in a quote
here from the president

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.280
of [INAUDIBLE] Sam
[INAUDIBLE], he

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.730
said that "anonymous
social networks thus far

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.330
have been in a
category of services

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.996
that they get worse
as they get better."

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:43.420
Unlike Facebook
and Twitter, they

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.582
get bigger-- they get
better as they get bigger.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:48.540
When I heard that quote,
I thought of you guys.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.595
I'm like wow, David and his
team are proving them wrong.

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:52.580
Do you believe that?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.190
And how are you
going about that?

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.420
DAVID: Yeah, that
was an early quote.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.630
I think he mentioned that
it would kind of eventually

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.600
trend to negativity.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.170
And we knew that that would
be the death knell of Secret,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.420
if that were turning that way.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.169
So we did everything
we could in our power

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.540
to kind of moderate as much as
possible, like do-- you always

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.790
promote positivity,
and mostly productive

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.760
secrets in our product.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.720
So we do little things in
design like little comment box.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.339
Instead of like write a comment,
it says like something kind.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.320
Just like drop little hints
so that hopefully things

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.870
stay like a well-lit space.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.430
And it was funny to read
that quote because here's

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.517
a VC who believes in
solving hard problems.

00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:30.850
And this is a very hard problem.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.150
MALE SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.130
DAVID: And so it only inspired
us to like really push and show

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.400
that we can do anonymity
and do it well.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.775
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Yeah, well, I can

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:39.500
see you guys like pinning up
this quote like locker room

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.239
material.

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:41.030
DAVID: Maybe I did.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.825
Maybe I did.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:42.760
With his picture.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.093
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's a secret.

00:04:44.093 --> 00:04:45.220
We'll post it on Secret.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.780
Awesome.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.430
What other challenges did
you face in the early days?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.230
I guess we're still in
the early days of Secret,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.870
in trying to get it out there.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.770
You mentioned keeping
it a well-lit space.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.010
What other hurdles did
you have to overcome?

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.050
DAVID: Well, I think
that's the biggest one.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.466
The other one was
security, right.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.900
Here we are with a bunch of
people coming on a platform.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.636
And you know, it's telling us,
telling the platform things

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:07.010
that they're
thinking and feeling

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.670
and rumors with whatever,
like some deep, heavy stuff.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.570
And so it's our job to keep
that locked down and secure,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.490
and no system is perfect.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.930
And so that's obviously an
ongoing area of research,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.810
and an ongoing challenge
for us to make sure

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.980
that the data is safe.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.690
And we even built
things into the product

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.397
to allow people to
say, you know what.

00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:28.980
Like everything I
posted, like I don't

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.120
want to be associated
with it anymore, right.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.570
So things like that we're
constantly evolving.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.420
Because honestly, it's like
30 million credit cards being

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.160
breached, or
something like that.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.001
Like, we can't allow
that to happen.

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:43.500
So that's another
challenge as well.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.140
So security, privacy,
in addition to growth.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.799
It's a delicate,
delicate balance.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:51.340
MALE SPEAKER 1: Of
course, of course.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.930
And talk to me about
your engagement numbers.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.340
I was looking at the stats.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.740
And it looks like 75% of people
with more than five friends

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.830
come back to your
platform every single day.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.390
I mean, that's just unheard
of for a network that

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.030
is around, let alone has
started just a few months ago.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.930
DAVID: Yeah, I think
conversation is the key.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.640
And it's amazing to see so much
rich and deep conversations

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.930
on an anonymous platform.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.820
Again, it's like you
wouldn't really expect that.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.480
But what we see is we have
two cohorts in our system.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.410
One is zero friends,
people with-- basically,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.060
they don't have anyone
that they're connected to.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.920
Their attention is
a little bit lower.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.530
It more 40 to 50%,
which is still very,.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.880
Very good and then
there's the people

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.710
who have more than one friend,
trending more towards 70%,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.780
and then even higher.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.940
As that goes up, it gets higher
and higher, up to about 80, 85%

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.980
in some cases.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.390
And so the key is to get people
to engage in a conversation.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.800
And that keeps that
hook of coming back,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.040
like who wrote back.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.490
Who's saying what about
what I just wrote.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.860
And that's really, really key.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.776
And you're right, like
those retention numbers

00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:56.910
are the most
important thing to me.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.415
All the press in the world,
like this is what I've learned.

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.540
All the press in the world
will not immediately get

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.140
you overnight millions of users,
especially if you are iOS only,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.040
or Android only.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.610
It just doesn't happen, right.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.730
Mobile, these things take
a little bit of time.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.010
And there's a network effect
that needs to build up.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.420
And so I would say that
instead of looking always

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.180
at absolute numbers, even
though over time, that'll

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.320
take care of itself, if
you have good retention

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.886
and good engagement.

00:07:21.886 --> 00:07:23.260
And that's what
we're focused on.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.676
And that's why those are the
numbers we like to talk about

00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:27.940
and what other-- I truly
believe other developers need

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.115
to be focused on is
just retaining users.

00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:32.490
And the other
thing I will say is

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.265
that there are many ways
under the sun to distribute

00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:39.022
your product through tap
[INAUDIBLE] or ads or whatever.

00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:41.230
You can put a lot of people
at the top of the funnel.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.604
The question is
what happens when

00:07:42.604 --> 00:07:44.460
they get to the next
step of the funnel.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.280
Are they staying around?

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.040
So that's what you
need to focus on.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.430
MALE SPEAKER 1: Absoutely.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.300
So let's talk about
the top of that funnel.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.800
And then we'll move
down towards it.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.299
How did you-- you mentioned
that you're in different markets

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:56.400
all the way spanning
into Russia how

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.200
did you-- did you
proactively outreach?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.960
Did somebody hear about Secret,
get on a plane, go to Russia,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.230
like by expanded there.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.510
How exactly did it grow so fast?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.805
It's a fascinating process.

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:10.180
DAVID: You know,
I wish I could--

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.824
I honestly wish I could break
it down to some sort of formula.

00:08:12.824 --> 00:08:14.490
We've always had grand
plans, like we're

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.527
going to have ambassadors
go to colleges.

00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:17.860
We're going to do this and that.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.370
But again, it's just been
happening pretty quickly.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.955
Because we've tapped into this
new network effect, right.

00:08:26.955 --> 00:08:28.580
And who doesn't want
come on a platform

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.788
and read secrets from people.

00:08:29.788 --> 00:08:32.820
Like that's just-- the
story tells itself, right.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.150
As far as Russia, I remember
one morning I woke up.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.970
It was like 3:00 AM.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.570
I'd gotten paged.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.140
Because I still our
main back end engineer.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.400
So I have to deal with all that.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.157
But I got paged.

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:45.740
And I woke up.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.820
And I opened my laptop.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.937
And I looked at the graph just
kind of like go straight up.

00:08:49.937 --> 00:08:51.270
And I was like, what's going on.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.137
And then I looked at the
secrets on our moderation thing.

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:55.095
And it was all Russian.

00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:58.330
I'm like, we are under attack.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.549
What is happening?

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:00.590
And it took a little bit.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.130
I used Google
Translate and whatnot.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.750
I'm like OK, these are actually
people creating real secrets.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.200
To this day, I can't explain
how or why that happened.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.252
It just-- I just picture
one guy like randomly

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:13.460
finds it in the app store
and shows someone, and then

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.704
just goes from there.

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:16.620
There's definitely been
some press we've done.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.994
When we rolled
out international,

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:21.950
we went to Netherlands and some
places that are-- Netherlands,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.960
93% of people are
connected internet.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.420
It's huge.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.650
And so these are
great, and they're

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.780
amazing social networks.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.800
Brazil, Netherlands they're
like first adopters.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.381
And so we went there, put
out some little press things,

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:35.380
get some people into it.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.546
And then the rest has to
take care of itself, right.

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.910
And so that's kind of
been our strategy so far.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.170
The next step for us is
to break a little bit out

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.860
of tech and more into
lifestyle and more

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.990
of a mainstream audience
and see how they do.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.470
But again, timing is everything.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.570
And we need to make sure
we're not going too fast, not

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.962
too far, and kind of growing
at a very steady, solid rate.

00:09:58.962 --> 00:10:00.670
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
let's talk about that.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.882
How do you move
into the mainstream?

00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:04.465
Because I think some
of these startups

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:05.770
see that tech crunch bump.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.460
They see press come in,
lots of initial users.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.377
People get excited.

00:10:09.377 --> 00:10:11.960
And then two months later, you
don't hear about those startups

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.180
again.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.320
How are you-- what are
you doing to avoid that?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.510
DAVID: I think right now for us,
it's a game of show and tell.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.740
It's always showing
the kind of content

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.240
that's created on
Secret, whether we

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.847
are kind of collecting secrets
and showing it to people,

00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:28.680
and showing them this
is the kind of content

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.320
you can find on Secret.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.430
That way people in the
Midwest or wherever,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.590
they see things
that relate to them.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.660
That's I think
the real key, when

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.410
everyone-- the goal is
whenever anyone signs up

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.530
to Secret, the first
few secrets they see

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.780
should be something
relatable, something close by,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.689
something in their campus,
something they're interested,

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:50.480
that kind of thing.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.979
And they need to make that deep
connection with the product.

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:55.490
And that kind of
content is what helps

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.430
people, especially mainstream,
kind of connect with it

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.560
and want to use it.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.395
MALE SPEAKER 1: So it
seems like your development

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:02.096
and your distribution
go hand in hand.

00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:03.470
When the user
comes on, they want

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.580
to see content that's compelling
that keeps them coming back.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.640
How do you make sure that those
first three posts are most

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.140
engaging?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.848
Is it algorithms?

00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:12.290
What are you doing to make that?

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.120
DAVID: So there's a few things.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.495
I mean, we have
a moderation team

00:11:14.495 --> 00:11:16.550
that's always curating
some of the best content.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.120
They are going through stuff and
finding it and kind of picking

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.670
out things, so that
when people do come on,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.040
that they see that kind
of stuff to kind of set

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.770
the pace and the tone
for what the product is.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.162
I fully, fully believe
the beauty begets beauty.

00:11:30.162 --> 00:11:31.620
What they see is
what they're going

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.420
to want to mimic and represent.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.330
And that goes back
to the original point

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.872
of battling negativity.

00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:40.080
If you join and you see
something extremely negative,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.454
you see something
that's hurtful,

00:11:41.454 --> 00:11:44.662
or see something
that's like whatever,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.120
not safe for work,
stuff like that.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.800
You're like what is this?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.220
What's going on?

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.605
You kind of want to help steer
people in that direction.

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:54.340
And that first experience
is the most important.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.001
The best experience,
of course, is

00:11:56.001 --> 00:11:57.500
when they join and
they're instantly

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.830
connected to their friends.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.121
And they have something that's
like this from a friend.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.650
It's like someone says
even the simplest things.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.000
Someone says like, romance me.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.958
And it's from a friend.

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.730
You're like, is
this someone I know.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:09.960
MALE SPEAKER 1: That
would make my day.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.168
DAVID: Is this my girlfriend.

00:12:11.168 --> 00:12:12.440
Is this-- yeah, exactly.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.190
And you connect with
it on a deeper level,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.170
rather than you go
to some other product

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.420
where it's just a public feed.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.350
And it's random people.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.350
You're like, romance me.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.180
Whatever, I don't
care about that.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.720
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
take me through.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.345
When was the moment
when you were first

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.480
building the product where
it resonated with you.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.100
When you're like, wow, I think
this could be something as big

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.160
as we see today with
what Secret has become.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.590
When did that happen for you?

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.006
DAVID: So I remember when we're
testing with our friends--

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:36.440
again, we only had about
250 people on the platform.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.310
It was a little bit
before Christmas.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.870
And someone had
posted and said, I'm

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.690
thinking of asking my girlfriend
to marry her-- or marry me

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.010
on Christmas Day.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.592
Is that poor form?

00:12:50.592 --> 00:12:51.550
What do you guys think?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.540
All these people, my friends
and my co-founders' friends,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.500
is the intersection
of all of us,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.979
we're giving feedback
and talking about it.

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:01.770
And I was like, this
is really interesting.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.240
I wonder if she's going to find
out what's going to happen.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.580
Then a little bit after
Christmas, my friend, Rich,

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.130
had posted on Facebook a picture
of the ring, just got engaged.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.669
It was kind of like a reveal.

00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:15.085
And that got me
thinking like, you

00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.710
know what, there's this
new class of communication.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.570
The things we think
and feel, things we

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.486
want to put out there.

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:22.420
Or we just say in private
like a dinner table,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.400
that you can't really put
out there and feel and get

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.990
your friends to
respond to, right.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.530
It's that other
side of the story.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.252
And that's what I knew that we
had something, because I fully

00:13:33.252 --> 00:13:34.960
believe, especially
with social networks,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.870
you look at new
apps like Slingshot.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.860
Or you look at all
these new things.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.680
It has to create kind of,
a new type of content,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.940
a new class of communication.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.260
You can't just build another
Instagram and build it better.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.600
Because we're all on Instagram.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.180
Why is this is going-- so
you've always got to find those

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.840
new places, those
new things, where

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.300
people have to have a new
way to express themselves.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.570
And something that
resonates with everyone.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.029
And so that's when I kind of
like knew something was there.

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.153
MALE SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:14:00.153 --> 00:14:02.180
And tell me, give me a
glimpses into the future.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.470
What's coming up for Secret?

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.720
I know you guys are having a
lot of exciting developments

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.190
to the product and adding
more experiences for users,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.290
so it even more resonates.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.760
What are you doing with Secret
to allow the distribution

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.770
to only grow?

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.860
DAVID: Yeah, so I think the
most important thing any product

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.640
that once you hit
product market fit,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.295
or you feel like you've hit
it, you need to constantly

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:25.520
be tightening the bolts and
making sure that the product is

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.247
robust and strong, and
things aren't falling off.

00:14:28.247 --> 00:14:29.330
You're not missing things.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.460
You're not losing things.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.000
You take a product
like again, Snapchat.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.790
I love Snapchat.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.410
I love how they've grown.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.130
The first year, they
were slowly growing.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.090
They were not, it was
not an overnight thing.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.117
It took Twitter a very,
very long time, right.

00:14:43.117 --> 00:14:44.075
These things take time.

00:14:44.075 --> 00:14:47.090
And you just have to build up
that core and strengthen it.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.300
And eventually, you
never when it resonates

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.755
and it goes
mainstream like that.

00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:54.130
So number one is we're just
constantly always making sure

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.500
that push notifications
work, everything works,

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.640
people are getting quality
stuff in the stream.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.970
The core is there.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.260
Then we start looking at
other things like well,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.710
we see what our users are doing.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.910
They want to message each other.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.285
They want to have these private
little conversations when

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:08.950
they connect in a
normal conversation.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.550
So should we build a
direct messaging product.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.120
And of course we
want to do that.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.280
But like I said,
timing is everything.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.520
And it needs to make sense.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.550
And everything
you-- every time you

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.970
add a new feature
to your product,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.053
it's kind of like a story.

00:15:22.053 --> 00:15:24.820
You have to go back to the
beginning and reread that story

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.570
and make sure it makes
sense cohesively.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.100
And so with that, I think direct
messaging is really, really

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.610
important.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.880
And again, just
showing more content.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.520
There's so-- I can't stress
enough how much good stuff

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.237
there is on our product
that a lot of people do see.

00:15:44.237 --> 00:15:45.320
But a lot of people don't.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.750
And we want to be able
to show some of that

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.204
and have our users
really be proud of things

00:15:50.204 --> 00:15:50.870
they've created.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.369
Maybe they don't
take credit for it,

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.720
like this was mine
of course, but just

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.910
show some of that really,
really good stuff.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.890
And I think that's
really important, too.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.150
MALE SPEAKER 1: So for me,
you mentioned that last one.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.800
It really stuck out
for me, not taking

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.216
credit for what
you put out there.

00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:05.180
Because I think like
on Facebook, Twitter,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.419
so many of us just think about
wow, it's got so many likes,

00:16:08.419 --> 00:16:09.210
it's got favorites.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:09.959
It got re-tweeted.

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:13.680
But on your network,
none of that matters.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.340
But people still
keep coming back.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.200
Why?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.540
DAVID: Well, so everyone
loves that sense or connecting

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.140
with others.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.690
And in the heart,
or like, whatever's

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.191
the light weight
feeling that someone--

00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.940
I connected with someone
out there, right.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.940
There's someone out there
that liked what I did.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.148
And that's just, it's a drug.

00:16:30.148 --> 00:16:30.950
It's addictive.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.970
And people love that.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.440
But I will say this what's
the funniest thing to me

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.520
is when people do take
credit for their secrets.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.490
They will literally post them on
Twitter, post them on Facebook,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.580
and say, oh man.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.600
I got 2000 likes on this.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.310
They'll come back a month later
and say, it's at 3,000 likes.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.210
And there's two things there.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.825
With Secret, because
things continue

00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:51.970
to spread through networks,
the half life of a given secret

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.999
can be weeks, if not months.

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:56.290
So if someone posts something,
and it just keeps going.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.302
As new people come on,
they see this secret.

00:16:58.302 --> 00:16:59.010
And they like it.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.654
And they do it.

00:17:00.654 --> 00:17:02.320
But yeah, my mom does
this all the time.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.736
She'll post something and then
literally I get like a play

00:17:04.736 --> 00:17:08.000
by play of how many hearts she's
on for whatever given secret.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.599
It's just--

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.379
MALE SPEAKER 1:
She'll update you,

00:17:09.379 --> 00:17:10.754
like David, I'm
at 50 hearts now.

00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:12.660
DAVID: Yeah, Yeah, I'm
like Mom, I get it.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.730
It's good.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.278
But yeah, she loves it.

00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:17.569
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.280
So I'm not going to ask you
to share what secrets your mom

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.030
has put out there.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.880
But I want to ask--

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.690
DAVID: Usually it's like I can't
wait to move out to California.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.910
I can't wait-- I love my boys.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.010
I'm like, gee.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.885
I wonder who this is.

00:17:28.885 --> 00:17:31.093
MALE SPEAKER 1: Really heart
wrenching secrets there.

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:32.150
Really exposes yourself.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.420
DAVID: Well, there
was one where I

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.878
was-- there was
someone who posted.

00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:37.330
It was like, I miss the beach.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.359
Or I miss the whatever.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.400
I'm like oh, that's cool.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.370
And I hearted it.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.260
It was like, my dream one day
is to move out to California.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.680
And I wasn't thinking,
like it just said friend.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.320
It's like a picture of a beach.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.820
And I'm like, you can do it.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.800
Just kind of like support.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.530
And then the comment was like,
well, my boys are out there.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.580
And I'm like, Mom, dude.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.836
So that's happened
more than once.

00:18:03.836 --> 00:18:06.900
I

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.860
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
tell me about-- you

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.490
are the creator of Secret.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.430
I want you to be able to
have a heart to heart here.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.170
What's a secret that you could
tell us about your early days,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.310
starting this startup.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.250
And maybe a regret
or a mistake you

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.600
had, something you could share.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.679
Forget the crowd here.

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:27.470
There's no cameras.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.760
This is just a secret
that's going to be totally--

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.969
DAVID: Now that you say that.

00:18:30.969 --> 00:18:32.343
MALE SPEAKER 1:
But why don't you

00:18:32.343 --> 00:18:34.460
share something that may
be from your early days.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.820
Or an insight that maybe you
wish you go back and tell

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.830
yourself, I wish I couldn't
done this differently.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.090
DAVID: I'm extremely stubborn,
extremely to a fault.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.080
And I think in the early days,
I had this idea for the ability

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.890
to send these
anonymous love notes,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.930
love-- it was very personal to
me, right, to my girlfriend.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.290
And I'm like, I want
to be able to tell her

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:00.720
I love her without her
knowing it's from me,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.424
just focus on the words,
kind of like digital flowers.

00:19:03.424 --> 00:19:04.840
And this just meant
so much to me.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.975
And I remember I showed
my now co-founder, Chris.

00:19:07.975 --> 00:19:08.640
I'm like, hey.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.840
I'm working on this thing.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.000
Let's do it.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.160
And in the very first, I guess,
two months of our building

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.270
this, he was always pushing me.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.637
Dude, I think we
need to-- there's

00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:21.720
going to be bullying here.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.640
There's going to be issues.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.070
We've got to try
something else, again,

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.400
the broadcast model, whatever.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.640
And it was a good month where
I was just like holding strong,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.620
no we have to do it this way.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.830
This is what I want.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.200
And eventually it
took a few things,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.050
but mostly it took Apple
basically coming down on us

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.420
and saying, nope, you
can't send anonymous SMS.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.880
That was the-- we
couldn't do it.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.350
We switched and pivoted.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.670
And immediately, our friends
started using it more.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.970
It was something
we were proud of.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.090
And I think the biggest
thing there was just

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.840
I was far too stubborn
with my own idea

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.129
and what I wanted
to do at that time.

00:19:59.129 --> 00:20:01.670
Because I'd built this little
thing, then actually letting go

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.110
and trying to pivot.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.600
I think a lot of companies
make the mistake of they

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.370
will hold onto an idea and
even launch it, and then

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.290
be afraid to pivot.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:12.580
But I think that's-- you
learn a lot along the way.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.170
And you need to take that
learning and change it, right.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.380
Never make the same mistakes
twice, that kind of thing.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.360
And that was a big learning
experience for me, I think.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.957
Most people don't know.

00:20:22.957 --> 00:20:24.040
MALE SPEAKER 1: Fantastic.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.790
So you've supplied so
much good stuff here

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.360
from sharing insights
about your early days,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.510
even telling us about your
mom's secrets on the platform.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.654
But I just want to
give you the space

00:20:34.654 --> 00:20:37.070
to talk about maybe a final
piece of advice you would give

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.600
to an entrepreneur or developer
who's starting from day one,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.287
remembering where
were in January.

00:20:41.287 --> 00:20:43.620
And then we're going to open
up to you guys, because I'm

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.860
sure you guys have a lot
of questions to ask David.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.550
And we'll pass around mic
so you guys get the chance.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.791
DAVID: Yeah, I think the
biggest thing that I've learned,

00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:53.290
so I was at Square
for a year after.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.380
I was at Google for
five years before that.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.920
Google's great at
managing complexity.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.680
But that's only like
one piece of the puzzle.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.452
The most important thing is
to keep it extremely simple,

00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:07.660
so you can keep the entire
product, the entire thing,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.460
in your head.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.960
Every good idea,
every good product,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.668
you should be able to
build in a weekend.

00:21:11.668 --> 00:21:13.869
Pack it together in a
weekend, you have something,

00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:14.660
and it makes sense.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.132
I mean, you look at any
really successful product

00:21:18.132 --> 00:21:20.090
and how it started, and
it started very simple.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.370
Even Google itself started
very, very, very simple.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.930
Take all these documents,
rank them in a novel way,

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.990
and then you can
search them, making it

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.834
just-- there's things you can
hack together very quickly.

00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:33.500
And I would say that again, when
it comes to building a product,

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.530
before you launch,
simplicity is the key.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.480
Everything you add
is already some form

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.937
of debt, that's the
most important thing.

00:21:41.937 --> 00:21:43.020
MALE SPEAKER 1: I love it.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.520
Cool.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.370
So we'll open up to
questions from you guys.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.818
And we'll pass around the mic.

00:21:48.818 --> 00:21:52.330
Yeah, we'll get you the
mic here so everyone

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.069
can hear your question.

00:21:54.069 --> 00:21:55.610
AUDIENCE: Could you
talk a little bit

00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:00.220
about what your user
growth curve looks like?

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.420
DAVID: Sure.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.380
So I don't have to repeat the
question since you have a mic.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.704
Our user graph curve, I think--
so first of all, obviously

00:22:07.704 --> 00:22:09.620
any product that's
growing, when you zoom out,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.510
we're only five months old,
it's this nice like linear curve

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.290
upward.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.909
But then when you zoom in and
you look on a day to day basis,

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:19.450
or you look week
over week, something

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.600
like that, you see very--
this kind of thing.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.350
It's just on the way up,
you see really big spikes.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.820
And then it dips a little
bit, and then spike and dip.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.109
I would say right now
it is nerve racking.

00:22:31.109 --> 00:22:33.150
Every time you see like
this giant spike and then

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:34.820
like oh, things
are slowing down.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.900
You're like, that it.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.440
We're out of
business, game over.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.640
But then eventually
it picks back up.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.790
And so I think we're still
too young to really have

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.800
this like nice, gradual,
exponential curve.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.025
But we have microcosms of it,
which are really interesting

00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:51.775
and nerve racking.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.590
AUDIENCE: I didn't quite
catch the-- you started on iOS

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.200
and then left.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.710
And where did you go from there?

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.970
And how did that happen again?

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.160
DAVID: So sorry, I started on?

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.368
AUDIENCE: iOS, is that right?

00:23:09.368 --> 00:23:11.774
Because somebody said you
can't send anonymous SMS.

00:23:11.774 --> 00:23:12.440
DAVID: Oh, yeah.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.240
So we initially
built the product

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.630
to send these anonymous kind
of messages, anonymous SMS,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.220
where you would pick
someone in the address book,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.680
you click a button, and
then the server sends

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.494
anonymous message to the user.

00:23:26.494 --> 00:23:27.910
And so they get a
thing that says,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.618
hey someone has shared
a secret with you.

00:23:29.618 --> 00:23:30.740
Here's the link.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.420
That's against
Apple's guidelines.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.990
There's rule 22.6.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.435
I remember very intimately,
which apparently I

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:38.060
thought I read the
guidelines before we

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.060
started working on this.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.320
And then I was really ashamed.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.910
But they just say you cannot
send anonymous or prank SMS.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.480
And that's really more for
carriers and things like that.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.410
There are apps that do that.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.900
But once you become kind of
on the radar, whatever like,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.040
it's just not good.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.610
So that's why most products
don't do the whole,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.660
select a bunch of people and
we'll just send invites to them

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.960
from the server anymore.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.800
AUDIENCE: What was your fix?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.160
DAVID: We didn't do that.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.235
We just built a new product.

00:24:08.235 --> 00:24:09.110
MALE SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.320
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about upcoming competitors

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.390
from different countries
in India, Germany,

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.780
that came same time, so they
had the same ideas, maybe around

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.460
the time.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.280
DAVID: Yeah, so
you know, I think

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.920
that's an entire
saga in the life,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.500
in the short life of Secret.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.220
With competitors, we've
intimately had to face this.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.980
There was a clone
created of Secret,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.020
literally they exact same thing.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.250
I mean, it's weird
seeing your own product,

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.370
like the exact same product.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.165
And again, it grew in Russia.

00:24:51.165 --> 00:24:54.280
But in China, this
competitor came out

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.810
and they blew up, number
one in China immediately.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.400
And here I am
like, we're looking

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.660
like there's nothing we can do.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.460
Because we had not
launched in China.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.560
We weren't ready for it.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.980
They got a huge head start.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.390
And that was really, really
nerve racking and scary.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.210
But you have to
focus on building

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.590
one product for the world.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.798
And that's what we had to do.

00:25:15.798 --> 00:25:17.430
We just don't let
it get to us, focus

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.044
on building this one product.

00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:21.210
the meantime, we built a--
we formed a joint venture

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.620
in China.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.730
We found a local team in China
to build our version of Secret,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.120
to take and rebuild it.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.092
launched about a week ago,
and as of two days ago,

00:25:32.092 --> 00:25:33.550
became number one
in the App Store.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.550
So you just, you gotta
stop and-- thank you.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.870
Thank you.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.020
You gotta just step
back and focus on

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.730
keep what you're doing.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.770
There are clones
in China, or sorry,

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.360
in India, Indonesia,
and other places.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.350
But we were there first.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.045
And we got a-- we're
the innovators.

00:25:57.582 --> 00:25:59.040
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Well, so with that,

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.956
I just want to thank
David so much for coming.

00:26:00.956 --> 00:26:01.540
And--

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.290
DAVID: Thank you.
