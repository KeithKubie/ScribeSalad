00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240
in this video we're gonna talk about how

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
in this video we're gonna talk about how
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.400
in this video we're gonna talk about how
to visualize data in particular we're

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
to visualize data in particular we're
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.490
to visualize data in particular we're
gonna use something called a stem stem

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
gonna use something called a stem stem
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.700
gonna use something called a stem stem
and leaf a stem and leaf plot and what's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
and leaf a stem and leaf plot and what's
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.560
and leaf a stem and leaf plot and what's
useful about this is it essentially

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
useful about this is it essentially
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.859
useful about this is it essentially
allows you to show all of your data and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
allows you to show all of your data and
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.990
allows you to show all of your data and
show a lot of detail about all of the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
show a lot of detail about all of the
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.060
show a lot of detail about all of the
numbers in your data set well at the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
numbers in your data set well at the
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490
numbers in your data set well at the
same time having a good sense about how

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500
same time having a good sense about how
 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950
same time having a good sense about how
those numbers in your set are

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
those numbers in your set are
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.769
those numbers in your set are
distributed right here I have a set of

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
distributed right here I have a set of
 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.209
distributed right here I have a set of
numbers when I just look at this it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
numbers when I just look at this it
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.620
numbers when I just look at this it
really doesn't make a lot of sense to me

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
really doesn't make a lot of sense to me
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.209
really doesn't make a lot of sense to me
it's just a bunch of numbers to me I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219
it's just a bunch of numbers to me I
 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.910
it's just a bunch of numbers to me I
have no sense or are more of them closer

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
have no sense or are more of them closer
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610
have no sense or are more of them closer
to 20 or 30 or more of them closer to 80

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
to 20 or 30 or more of them closer to 80
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.060
to 20 or 30 or more of them closer to 80
or theirs is their median or their mode

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070
or theirs is their median or their mode
 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.330
or theirs is their median or their mode
30 or 40 or 84 I have no idea just

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
30 or 40 or 84 I have no idea just
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799
30 or 40 or 84 I have no idea just
looking at this list of numbers but

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
looking at this list of numbers but
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020
looking at this list of numbers but
using a stem and leaf plot hopefully

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
using a stem and leaf plot hopefully
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.299
using a stem and leaf plot hopefully
some of this will become a little bit

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
some of this will become a little bit
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.830
some of this will become a little bit
more apparent and the idea here is is to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
more apparent and the idea here is is to
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.889
more apparent and the idea here is is to
list kind of the most significant digit

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
list kind of the most significant digit
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.799
list kind of the most significant digit
in each of those numbers in the stem so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
in each of those numbers in the stem so
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.270
in each of those numbers in the stem so
when we talk about the most significant

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
when we talk about the most significant
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520
when we talk about the most significant
digit these numbers right here they

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
digit these numbers right here they
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410
digit these numbers right here they
range let's see we have a number that we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
range let's see we have a number that we
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750
range let's see we have a number that we
have a two here that looks like we have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
have a two here that looks like we have
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609
have a two here that looks like we have
a one that looks like our lowest number

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
a one that looks like our lowest number
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.249
a one that looks like our lowest number
and it goes all the way up to looks like

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
and it goes all the way up to looks like
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100
and it goes all the way up to looks like
goes all the way up to 84 and has a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
goes all the way up to 84 and has a
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.539
goes all the way up to 84 and has a
bunch of numbers in between and the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
bunch of numbers in between and the
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.570
bunch of numbers in between and the
teens and the 20s and the 30s 40s 50 60

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
teens and the 20s and the 30s 40s 50 60
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969
teens and the 20s and the 30s 40s 50 60
s so on and so forth so it looks like

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
s so on and so forth so it looks like
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280
s so on and so forth so it looks like
the most significant digit here is the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
the most significant digit here is the
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.649
the most significant digit here is the
tens digit so let's write it right here

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
tens digit so let's write it right here
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.359
tens digit so let's write it right here
let's write our tens digit tens digit

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
let's write our tens digit tens digit
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.510
let's write our tens digit tens digit
and the tens digit could be a zero one

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
and the tens digit could be a zero one
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.569
and the tens digit could be a zero one
two three four let me write this a

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
two three four let me write this a
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:51.830
two three four let me write this a
little bit bigger 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or let

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
little bit bigger 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or let
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.420
little bit bigger 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or let
me scroll down a little bit or an 8 or

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430
me scroll down a little bit or an 8 or
 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880
me scroll down a little bit or an 8 or
an 8 these digits will represent our

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
an 8 these digits will represent our
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.819
an 8 these digits will represent our
stem so I'm going to draw this little

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829
stem so I'm going to draw this little
 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.760
stem so I'm going to draw this little
line around here this is going to be our

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
line around here this is going to be our
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709
line around here this is going to be our
stem right there

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
stem right there
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.279
stem right there
that right there is our stem in the stem

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
that right there is our stem in the stem
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.480
that right there is our stem in the stem
and leaf in the stem and leaf

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
and leaf in the stem and leaf
 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.720
and leaf in the stem and leaf
plot for a number like 1 the 10th it is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730
plot for a number like 1 the 10th it is
 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.790
plot for a number like 1 the 10th it is
zero you could imagine it as zero one

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800
zero you could imagine it as zero one
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.000
zero you could imagine it as zero one
for a number like 84 the intensity is

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
for a number like 84 the intensity is
 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.430
for a number like 84 the intensity is
obviously 8 so what I'm going to do is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
obviously 8 so what I'm going to do is
 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.440
obviously 8 so what I'm going to do is
rewrite all of these numbers here what

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
rewrite all of these numbers here what
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.850
rewrite all of these numbers here what
I'm going to use it using the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860
I'm going to use it using the
 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040
I'm going to use it using the
stem-and-leaf plot and the technique

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050
stem-and-leaf plot and the technique
 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.840
stem-and-leaf plot and the technique
here and I'm just gonna show you by

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
here and I'm just gonna show you by
 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.400
here and I'm just gonna show you by
example let's go through each of these

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410
example let's go through each of these
 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.430
example let's go through each of these
numbers let's say I want to write 35 so

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440
numbers let's say I want to write 35 so
 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.040
numbers let's say I want to write 35 so
35 let me cross it out

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050
35 let me cross it out
 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.880
35 let me cross it out
35 so it has a tens digit of 3 I'll put

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
35 so it has a tens digit of 3 I'll put
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.640
35 so it has a tens digit of 3 I'll put
a 5 right here that tells me that 35 is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
a 5 right here that tells me that 35 is
 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.220
a 5 right here that tells me that 35 is
one of my numbers then I have 40 to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
one of my numbers then I have 40 to
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.120
one of my numbers then I have 40 to
cross it out let me know I used it 42

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
cross it out let me know I used it 42
 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.820
cross it out let me know I used it 42
I'm writing the ones digit as leaves

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
I'm writing the ones digit as leaves
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.080
I'm writing the ones digit as leaves
you're gonna see what I'm gonna do let's

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
you're gonna see what I'm gonna do let's
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.500
you're gonna see what I'm gonna do let's
see 38 well I have a 30 I'm going to

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
see 38 well I have a 30 I'm going to
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.060
see 38 well I have a 30 I'm going to
write an 8 here so I didn't have to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
write an 8 here so I didn't have to
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.220
write an 8 here so I didn't have to
rewrite the 30 I'm just saying look I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230
rewrite the 30 I'm just saying look I
 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.520
rewrite the 30 I'm just saying look I
have a 35 and I have a 38 I'm just

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
have a 35 and I have a 38 I'm just
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.340
have a 35 and I have a 38 I'm just
writing the ones digits within the three

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350
writing the ones digits within the three
 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.950
writing the ones digits within the three
stem within the tens place within the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960
stem within the tens place within the
 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.540
stem within the tens place within the
30s place however you want to view the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550
30s place however you want to view the
 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.660
30s place however you want to view the
30s bucket then we have a 57 57 we have

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670
30s bucket then we have a 57 57 we have
 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.660
30s bucket then we have a 57 57 we have
a 2 which is you could view as a 0 2 we

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670
a 2 which is you could view as a 0 2 we
 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:35.680
a 2 which is you could view as a 0 2 we
have a 2 we have 24 24 27 27 36 36 we

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
have a 2 we have 24 24 27 27 36 36 we
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.870
have a 2 we have 24 24 27 27 36 36 we
have a 35 a 38 and a 36 45 45 60 I think

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880
have a 35 a 38 and a 36 45 45 60 I think
 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.340
have a 35 a 38 and a 36 45 45 60 I think
you get the idea but just for the sake

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350
you get the idea but just for the sake
 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.800
you get the idea but just for the sake
of completion let's finish all of these

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
of completion let's finish all of these
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:04:00.550
of completion let's finish all of these
38 38 40 another 40 a 44 44 a 1 a 1 a

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560
38 38 40 another 40 a 44 44 a 1 a 1 a
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.710
38 38 40 another 40 a 44 44 a 1 a 1 a
for another 44 a 48 so a lot of things

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720
for another 44 a 48 so a lot of things
 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.910
for another 44 a 48 so a lot of things
in this 40s bucket 48 and 84 84 a 38 38

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920
in this 40s bucket 48 and 84 84 a 38 38
 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.110
in this 40s bucket 48 and 84 84 a 38 38
a 20

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120
a 20
 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.600
a 20
so 2020 a 4 put that right there

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610
so 2020 a 4 put that right there
 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.350
so 2020 a 4 put that right there
0 4 a 2 getting a little monotonous but

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360
0 4 a 2 getting a little monotonous but
 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.960
0 4 a 2 getting a little monotonous but
let's just finish

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970
 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.200
4848 another 48 right there a 58 58 a 3

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.409
4848 another 48 right there a 58 58 a 3
stick it up there that's 0 3 then we

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419
stick it up there that's 0 3 then we
 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:57.140
stick it up there that's 0 3 then we
have a 20 a 6 a 40 40 22 22 26 26 17 1 7

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
have a 20 a 6 a 40 40 22 22 26 26 17 1 7
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.460
have a 20 a 6 a 40 40 22 22 26 26 17 1 7
that's our first number in the teens

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
that's our first number in the teens
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.370
that's our first number in the teens
bucket at 18 18 a 44 0 a lot of things

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380
bucket at 18 18 a 44 0 a lot of things
 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.200
bucket at 18 18 a 44 0 a lot of things
in the 40s a fifty one fifty one sixty

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210
in the 40s a fifty one fifty one sixty
 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.760
in the 40s a fifty one fifty one sixty

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:35.860
twenty seven forty eight forty eight 35
35 almost done 27:37 58 58 and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870
35 almost done 27:37 58 58 and
 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.610
35 almost done 27:37 58 58 and
twenty-one and we have our twenty one

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620
twenty-one and we have our twenty one
 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.440
twenty-one and we have our twenty one
and just like that it was a little

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450
and just like that it was a little
 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.300
and just like that it was a little
monotonous but we essentially just

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310
monotonous but we essentially just
 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.880
monotonous but we essentially just
rewrote this list of numbers down here I

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890
rewrote this list of numbers down here I
 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.800
rewrote this list of numbers down here I
have every number represented we haven't

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
have every number represented we haven't
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.469
have every number represented we haven't
lost any information here I know every

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479
lost any information here I know every
 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.390
lost any information here I know every
number I could go start with this and I

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400
number I could go start with this and I
 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.520
number I could go start with this and I
could list tell you every number that I

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530
could list tell you every number that I
 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.560
could list tell you every number that I
had in my original list I have a six I

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570
had in my original list I have a six I
 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.590
had in my original list I have a six I
have a twenty seven I have a 38 a 35 so

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600
have a twenty seven I have a 38 a 35 so
 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.719
have a twenty seven I have a 38 a 35 so
we haven't lost any information but

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729
we haven't lost any information but
 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.120
we haven't lost any information but
what's neat about this representation is

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130
what's neat about this representation is
 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.490
what's neat about this representation is
when the numbers are written this way we

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500
when the numbers are written this way we
 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.900
when the numbers are written this way we
actually you know we actually save ink

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910
actually you know we actually save ink
 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.640
actually you know we actually save ink
because you don't have to rewrite the 40

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
because you don't have to rewrite the 40
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.279
because you don't have to rewrite the 40
to 45 you just write the ones digit but

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289
to 45 you just write the ones digit but
 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:14.690
to 45 you just write the ones digit but
more importantly we kind of understand

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700
more importantly we kind of understand
 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.969
more importantly we kind of understand
how the numbers are distributed that we

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979
how the numbers are distributed that we
 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.129
how the numbers are distributed that we
have a bunch of numbers in the 40s and

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139
have a bunch of numbers in the 40s and
 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.050
have a bunch of numbers in the 40s and
30s and 20s that's where most of the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060
30s and 20s that's where most of the
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.120
30s and 20s that's where most of the
numbers are we have very few numbers up

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130
numbers are we have very few numbers up
 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.640
numbers are we have very few numbers up
in the 80s and we have no numbers in the

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650
in the 80s and we have no numbers in the
 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.560
in the 80s and we have no numbers in the
70s we have very few we have a lot on

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570
70s we have very few we have a lot on
 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.360
70s we have very few we have a lot on
the ones but still most of them are

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370
the ones but still most of them are
 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.110
the ones but still most of them are
focused in this range over here so this

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120
focused in this range over here so this
 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.170
focused in this range over here so this
is just one of many many many ways to

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
is just one of many many many ways to
 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.460
is just one of many many many ways to
visualize data that you

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470
visualize data that you
 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.280
visualize data that you
we'll run into in your mathematical or

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290
we'll run into in your mathematical or
 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.840
we'll run into in your mathematical or
statistical futures but I just wanted to

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
statistical futures but I just wanted to
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.870
statistical futures but I just wanted to
expose you to this
