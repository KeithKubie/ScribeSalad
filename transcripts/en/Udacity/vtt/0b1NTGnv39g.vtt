00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.921
Hi, I'm joined by Jenny Tong, the
Developer Advocate on the Firebase team.

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.449
Welcome Jenny.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.560
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.840
&gt;&gt; So I've got this friend
who has developing an app and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.665
considering Firebase.

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.002
Who's wondering if you have a little
time to answer some questions.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.920
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; So, I guess the most basic question

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.340
is, do you have some examples of
Firebase being used in the real world.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
&gt;&gt; Yes, a few examples come to mind
of a few great uses of Firebase.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.880
One is Go To Meeting which uses Firebase
for real time signaling between clients.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.000
So you know when somebody's
taken the mike to speak.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.390
Another example is Twitch TV,
which does video game streaming.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.040
They use it for signaling all
their streams coming online.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.590
My favorite is probably
Warby Parker's location in New York.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.319
Warby Parker uses it to control
the pneumatic system that delivers your

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.780
glasses to you.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.930
Right while you're waiting.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.625
&gt;&gt; That's really cool.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:09.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.470
&gt;&gt; So why did these
developers go with Firebase?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.820
What was unique about Firebase
that made it the choice for them?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.600
&gt;&gt; So, I think the thing that makes
Firebase unique because there's a lot of

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.130
options for building back ends for you
is just how easy it is to use Firebase.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.010
People usually get pretty comfortable
with Firebase after a few hours and

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.840
have a production-ready app
within In a couple of days.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.670
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.420
So in your opinion what
is like the killer app or

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.410
the most differentiating
piece of Firebase?

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.220
&gt;&gt; So I think the applications that
work best with Firebase are ones that

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.950
are going to be generating a lot of
structured data from user interactions.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.600
Like one of the classic cases of this
is chat which is one of the deceptively

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.900
hard things to build on your own.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.480
So things that you can model,
think of as

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.240
a track communication between multiple
people work really well in Firebase.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.770
&gt;&gt; So just expanding on that, in your
opinion what are the classic uses?

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.540
What are the best apps that
are suited for Firebase?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.220
&gt;&gt; The best apps that are suited for
Firebase.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.030
So any situation where you have
like low frequency information or

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.140
medium frequency information coming
from mobile apps or web applications,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.300
that need to be synchronized back and
forth between multiple platforms.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.050
[INAUDIBLE] Web and mobile.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.670
All those combinations, or even
signaling internet of think systems and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.410
you don't want to build up independent
infrastructure for each one of those.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.140
&gt;&gt; All right well Jenny thanks a lot for
your time today.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.640
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.
