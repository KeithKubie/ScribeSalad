VIDEO GAME REPAIRMAN: Brand
spanking new.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.880
RICK: I can't believe that
piece of junk turned into this.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.540
I love stuff like this.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.710
THE OLD MAN: That's the most
beautiful thing I ever seen.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.540
[laughter]

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.960
BOB: Do you get it?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.670
COREY: Yeah, I get it.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.040
[music playing]

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.330
RICK: Bob sold me a
spark plug cleaner

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.210
from the 1930s that was
in really rough shape,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.210
and then I paid
him to restore it.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.540
Hey, you want to see what
a champion this guy is?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.250
COREY: It's
definitely cool, Bob.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.040
RICK: The Alfred Champion Spark
Plug Company and this champion

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.920
restored it.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.250
[laughter]

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Do you get it?

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.750
Yeah, I get it.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420
Had to mix up
this color special.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.380
It was hard to mix up.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.000
And then media blasted it,
did all the body work on here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920
This piece was missing,
if you remember,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920
so I made one out of steel.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.080
Plus, all these graphics
here are hand-painted.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.670
This is aluminum.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.920
So when I painted it, I
scratched through the lettering

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.380
so it would show
up in the aluminum.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.790
COREY: I mean, it looks awesome.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.540
I have no doubt in my
mind we can sell it.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.790
But listening to this guy say
"champion" is going to kill me.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.040
[laughter]

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.620
RICK: When I gave
this gas pump to Rick,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.420
it was virtually worthless.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.750
Now it's all finished,
and Rick told me

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.080
I wouldn't even recognize it.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.080
I'm going to see what I got.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.460
Holy [bleep].

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.750
That is nice.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960
That is cool.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.120
A little different than
when you saw it before, huh?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.540
Yeah, it's way different.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.460
RICK (VOICEOVER): When
I saw the gas pump,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.920
it was just unbelievable.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.460
And I couldn't believe
it was the same pump.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.040
All this trim up here
was all painted and pitted,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.790
so we ended up
repolishing all that.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.380
Put your new glasses in here.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.620
Most of the parts on this
thing are all original.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.120
The only ones that
are not original

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.330
is this is a reproduction
plate, and this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.170
is a reproduction globe.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750
Everything else is
totally original on it.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.000
RICK: How much did
it cost me to fix it?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.460
Right around 2,500.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.960
RICK (VOICEOVER): That
gas pump is a beauty.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.330
It really is.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.750
It's something I really
want to bring home.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.170
I love stuff like this.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.920
I would just love gas to
be $0.32 a gallon again.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.420
Yeah, you and me both.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.170
[cash register ringing]

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.670
COREY: A few days
ago, me and Chum

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.920
dropped the Pac-Man machine
off to get repaired.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.460
I really hope it's working
because if it's not,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.750
we're going to lose money on it.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.670
Nice to see you again.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.170
See ya.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.960
The top looked horrible
when I brought it in, man.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.250
Is this brand new, or were you
able to fix the old one, or--

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.750
VIDEO GAME REPAIRMAN:
Brand spanking new.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.830
But that's just the
cosmetic artwork to it.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.120
Back in the day, people were
actually able to hack the board

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.960
and take a Pac-Man and
make it a Ms. Pac-Man

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.500
because Ms. Pac-Man
was far more popular.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.120
And so we had to convert
it back to a Pac-Man.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.880
So what was the total
cost after all is said

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.540
and done fixing this thing?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.620
Well we're looking at about
350, right where I said before.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.330
What do you think
we can get out of it?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.500
I think you should be able
to get an easy $1,000 to $1,200

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.040
for it.
- OK.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.620
CHUMLEE: Well he's gonna need
to improve before he plays me.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.880
I don't even know if you're
gonna pass the first level.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.880
[pac-man dying music]

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.500
[cash register ringing]

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.210
A few weeks ago, I brought
my sweet 1955 barber chair

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.290
to my buddy Rick
to get fixed up,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.710
and now I'm on my
way to pick it up.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.330
Whoa.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.500
I can't believe that piece
of junk turned into this.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.170
Oh, it looks great.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.920
RICK DALE: Believe it or not,
this has over 200 pieces.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.750
We had to take half
the pieces and send

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.080
them to the nickel plating
shop to get them nickel plated.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.880
And then we had to take the
upholstery and send it all out

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.040
to get upholstered.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.500
And then we painted the base.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.920
RICK: Did you fix
all the hydraulics?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.830
RICK DALE: Yeah, all the
hydraulics got redone.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.170
RICK: Was there a
lot of hair in there?

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.920
Yeah, there was tons.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.670
You want some?

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.080
Yeah.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.920
I thought it was yours.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.710
So the big question-- how
much this thing cost me?

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.540
Well to do all
the nickel plating

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.000
and the leather and the base,
it's going to be $2,500.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.330
OK.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.040
So what do you think
I can get out of it?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.920
You should have no problem
getting $6,500 for this chair.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.330
All right, sounds
like a deal to me.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.210
Well try it out.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.380
[grunting]

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.880
Oh yeah.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.750
God, I miss my hair.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.080
[cash register ringing]

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.120
Months ago, I called
a couple of buddies

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.290
who are great at picking stuff.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.960
But I might have
gone a little bit

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.620
overboard buying a '57 Chevy
for my dad's 70th birthday.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.290
Frank and Mike
really came through.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.790
Rick Dale and the
Count have been working

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.210
overtime to get it restored.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.460
And today's the day.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.920
I just hope it's ready.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.620
I cannot wait to see his face.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.960
Dammit, Rick.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.210
We just got to pick
something up real quick.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.120
ALL: SURPRISE!

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.420
[cheering]

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.290
Oh my god.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.880
Happy birthday.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.540
It's a '57 Chevy 150.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.120
That is one beautiful car.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.250
That's the most beautiful
thing I ever seen.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.540
You have no idea what a
challenge this thing was,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.080
to make a car look like this.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.330
I'll see you guys bright
and early tomorrow morning.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.000
But we got cake for you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.290
Screw the cake.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.120
[applause]

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.500
MAN: Woo!

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.670
THE OLD MAN (VOICEOVER):
Rick is a great son,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.290
but I was expecting
chicken wings.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.290
He can be a cheap SOB.
