00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.360
Now that we've got the basics
of order of operations out of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.100
the way, let's try to tackle a
really hairy and

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.240
beastly problem.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.990
So here, we have all
sorts of parentheses and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.340
numbers flying around.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.190
But in any of these order of
operations problems, you really

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.650
just have to take a deep breath
and remember, we're going

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.870
to do parentheses first.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.810
Parentheses.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.820
P for parentheses.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.760
Then exponents.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.330
Don't worry if you don't know
what exponents are, because

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.910
this has no exponents in them.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.930
Then you're going to do
multiplication and division.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.220
They're at the same level.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.980
Then you do addition
and subtraction.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.330
So some people remember PEMDAS.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.640
But if you remember PEMDAS,
remember multiplication,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.900
division, same level.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.500
Addition and subtraction,
also at the same level.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.360
So let's figure what the
order of operations say that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.290
this should evaluate to.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.100
So the first thing we're going
to do is our parentheses.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.590
And we have a lot of
parentheses here.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.800
We have this expression in
parentheses right there, and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.930
then even within that we
have these parentheses.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.370
So our order of operations say,
look, do your parentheses

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.120
first, but in order to evaluate
this outer parentheses-- this

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.910
orange thing-- we're going to
have to evaluate this thing

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.750
in yellow right there.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.000
So let's evaluate
this whole thing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.530
So how can we simplify it?

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.910
Well, if we look at just inside
of it, the first thing we want

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.690
to do is simplify the
parentheses inside

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.940
the parentheses.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.590
So you see this 5
minus 2 right there?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560
We're going to do that
first no matter what.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.000
And that's easy to evaluate.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.270
5 minus 2 is 3.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.690
And so this simplifies to--
I'll do it step by step.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.480
Once you get the hang of
it, you can do multiple

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.570
steps at once.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.770
So this is going to be
7 plus 3 times the 5

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710
minus 2, which is 3.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.620
And all of those have
parentheses around it.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.780
And of course, you have
all the stuff on either

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.960
side-- the divide 4-- no.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.820
Oops.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.650
That's not what I want.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.760
I wanted to copy and paste.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.840
I want to copy and paste
that right there.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.246
So copy, then-- no, that's
giving me the wrong thing.

00:01:55.246 --> 00:01:57.290
It would've been easier--
let me just rewrite it.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.230
That's the easiest thing.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.590
I'm having technical
difficulties.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.660
So divided by 4 times 2.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.200
And on this side, you had that
7 times 2 plus this thing in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.760
orange parentheses there.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.060
Now, at any step you
just look again.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.690
We always want to do
parentheses first.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.140
Well, you keep wanting to
do and is there really

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750
no parentheses left?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.210
So we have to evaluate this
parentheses in orange here.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.160
So we have to evaluate
this thing first.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.550
But in order to evaluate
this thing, we have

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.810
to look inside of it.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.290
And when you look inside of it,
you have 7 plus 3 times 3.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.970
So if you just had 7 plus
3 times 3, how would

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.150
you evaluate it?

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.260
Well, look back to your
order of operations.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.550
We're inside the parentheses
here, so inside of it there are

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.640
no longer any parentheses.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000
So the next thing we should do
is-- there are no exponents.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.200
There is multiplication.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.970
So we do that before we do
any addition or subtraction.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.250
So we want to do the 3 times
3 before we add the 7.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.090
So this is going to be 7
plus-- and the 3 times

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.270
3 we want to do first.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.850
We want to do the
multiplication first.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.380
7 plus 9.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.360
That's going to be in
the orange parentheses.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.020
And then you have the 7
times 2 plus that, on

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.870
the left hand side.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.060
You have the divided by 4 times
2 on the right hand side.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.370
And now this-- the thing in
parentheses-- because we

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.200
still want to do the
parentheses first.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.650
Pretty easy to evaluate.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.770
What's 7 plus 9?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.040
7 plus 9 is 16.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.280
And so everything we have
simplifies to 7 times 2 plus

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.140
16 divided by 4 times 2.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.103
Now we don't have any
parentheses left, so we

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:42.910
don't have to worry
about the P in PEMDAS.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.610
We have no E, no
exponents in this.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.650
So then we go straight to
multiplication and division.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.970
We have a multiplication--
we have some multiplication

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.200
going on there.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
We have some division
going on here, and a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
multiplication there.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.210
So we should do these
next, before we do this

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.670
addition right there.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.830
So we could do this
multiplication.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.260
We could do that
multiplication.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.480
7 times 2 is 14.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.015
We're going to wait
to do that addition.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.070
And then here we have a
16 divided by 4 times 2.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.770
That gets priority of the
addition, so we're going to do

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.160
that before we do the addition.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.370
But how do we evaluate that?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.810
Do we do the division first,
or the multiplication first?

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.340
And remember, I told you in the
last video, when you have 2--

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.760
when you have multiple
operations of the same level--

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.190
in this case, division and
multiplication-- they're

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.220
at the same level.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.460
You're safest going
left to right.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.360
Or you should go left to right.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.950
So you do 16 divided by 4 is 4.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.180
So this thing right here--
simplify 16 divided

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.680
by 4 times 2.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.420
It simplifies to 4 times 2.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.800
That's this thing in
green right there.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.180
And then we're going to want to
do the multiplication next.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.050
So this is going to simplify
to-- because multiplication

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.930
takes priority over addition--
this simplifies to 8.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.740
And so you get 14-- this
14 right here-- plus 8.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.730
And what's 14 plus 8?

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.190
That is 22.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.450
That is equal to 22.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.990
And we are done.
