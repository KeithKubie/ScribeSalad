00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.200
Now, let's talk a little bit
more about registration and

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.140
especially what to do when
a class you want is full.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.440
So here I've looked
up a different class.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.940
An intro to cognitive science class, but
what I find is that this class is full.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.070
I know it's full for
two different reasons.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.620
First, over on the left there is a C.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.690
C means closed.
That means

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.890
there's no spots left in this class.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640
Secondly, there are three columns over
on the right that represent the current

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.190
enrollment in the class.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.510
The columns are CAP, ACT, and REM.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960
CAP represents
the capacity of the class.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.160
ACT represents the number of active
students currently registered for

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.390
the class.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.020
And REM represents the remaining
slots in the class.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.420
For this class I know it's full,
because it has zero remaining slots.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
When that happens, what I have to do
is join the wait list for the class.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.166
There are three similar columns that
represent the status of the wait list,

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.062
WL Cap, WL Act, and WL rem.

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:57.255
Just like the columns for regular
registration, WL Cap, WL Act, and

00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:01.450
WL rem, represent the capacity,
the active number of students, and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.320
the remaining slots.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.129
Specifically, on the wait list.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.760
So, if I want to join a full class,
I have to join the wait list.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.640
To join the wait list,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.600
I have to use the second of the two
registration methods we talked about.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.200
First, I have to note
the class' CRN number.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.090
In this case it's 55110.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.240
And then I have to return to
the Add/Drop Classes page.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.780
Usually, I would do that through the
registration menu, but between you and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.240
me, you can actually get to it just by
clicking Add to WorkSheet, whether or

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.940
not you have anything selected.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.880
That will take you back to
the Add/Drop Classes page.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840
Scrolling down,
we want to go back to CRN section.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.490
You want to enter the five digit CRN
number that you noted before and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.020
again, click submit changes.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.570
Now here what's going to happen is
you're going to be given an error like

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.930
we talked about.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.290
Under registration add errors,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.690
you'll see closed as the status
of your registration.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.720
Under the action menu,
you can click Wait listed course.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.570
Click submit changes again.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.610
And the course will now
appear as a waitlisted course

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.030
under your current schedule.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.020
In the event that a slot in
the waitlisted course becomes available,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.340
you'll receive an email and you can
return to this page and register for

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.150
the course the way we did before.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.510
You only have a limited window of time
to register for the course however, so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.610
make sure to do so as soon as possible.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.310
For more information on how long you
have to register once you receive that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.920
email, check the registrar's website,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.970
that can change from
semester to semester.
