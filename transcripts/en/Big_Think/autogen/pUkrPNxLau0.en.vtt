dopamine is a chemical substance that

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980
dopamine is a chemical substance that
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980
dopamine is a chemical substance that
serves to send messages between two

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990
serves to send messages between two
 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.220
serves to send messages between two
cells in the brain and that's we call

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
cells in the brain and that's we call
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.460
cells in the brain and that's we call
neurotransmitters

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470
neurotransmitters
 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.400
neurotransmitters
there are many neurotransmitters and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
there are many neurotransmitters and
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.069
there are many neurotransmitters and
dopamine plays a key role in modulating

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:23.079
dopamine plays a key role in modulating
 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.279
dopamine plays a key role in modulating
the areas of the brain that enable a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289
the areas of the brain that enable a
 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.099
the areas of the brain that enable a
wide variety of functions best known is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109
wide variety of functions best known is
 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.499
wide variety of functions best known is
movement and when your dopamine cells

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509
movement and when your dopamine cells
 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.049
movement and when your dopamine cells
die for example you cannot initiate

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059
die for example you cannot initiate
 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.910
die for example you cannot initiate
movement and that's Parkinson disease

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
movement and that's Parkinson disease
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.430
movement and that's Parkinson disease
but the effects of dopamine go way

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440
but the effects of dopamine go way
 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.040
but the effects of dopamine go way
beyond movement and one of the actions

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050
beyond movement and one of the actions
 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.840

reinforcement and to be motivated by
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.610
reinforcement and to be motivated by
that reward to do actions so for example

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620
that reward to do actions so for example
 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.920
that reward to do actions so for example
it's so important that if you can

such as eating or sexual behavior are
 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.360
such as eating or sexual behavior are
linked with increases in dopamine and

what do I mean by that if you are hungry

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850
what do I mean by that if you are hungry
 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.449
what do I mean by that if you are hungry
for example and you get exposed to food

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459
for example and you get exposed to food
 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.180
for example and you get exposed to food
that will increase dopamine much more

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190
that will increase dopamine much more
 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.880
that will increase dopamine much more
that if you just finished eating and so

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890
that if you just finished eating and so
 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.520
that if you just finished eating and so
as you eat the ability of food to

as you eat the ability of food to
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.020
as you eat the ability of food to
increase dopamine goes down and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
increase dopamine goes down and
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.870
increase dopamine goes down and
eventually disappears and because it

other hand is they do not decline the
 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.699
other hand is they do not decline the
ability to increase dopamine so a person

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210
processes that determine vulnerabilities
 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.900
processes that determine vulnerabilities
for example if you can expose to drugs

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910
for example if you can expose to drugs
 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.390
for example if you can expose to drugs
when you're very young very early

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400
when you're very young very early
 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.909
when you're very young very early
adolescence they're much more likely to

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919
adolescence they're much more likely to
 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.100
adolescence they're much more likely to
become addicted that if you get exposed

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110
become addicted that if you get exposed
 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.050
become addicted that if you get exposed
to the same drugs when you are an adult

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060
to the same drugs when you are an adult
 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.300
to the same drugs when you are an adult
and this has to do with the fact that

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310
and this has to do with the fact that
 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.940
and this has to do with the fact that
the adolescent brain is much more

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950
the adolescent brain is much more
 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.580
the adolescent brain is much more
neuroplastic than the adult brain and as

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
neuroplastic than the adult brain and as
 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.430
neuroplastic than the adult brain and as
a result of that a draw which triggers

this adaptation process is likely to
 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.519
this adaptation process is likely to
produce

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529
produce
 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:18.789

this changes faster in an adolescent and

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:18.799
this changes faster in an adolescent and
 

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:21.399
this changes faster in an adolescent and
it's also the duration of those changes

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409
it's also the duration of those changes
 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.529
it's also the duration of those changes
is likely to be much longer lasting in

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539
is likely to be much longer lasting in
 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.139
is likely to be much longer lasting in
an adolescent than it is in an adult so

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:26.149
an adolescent than it is in an adult so
 

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:27.999
an adolescent than it is in an adult so
these are our two processes as it

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009
these are our two processes as it
 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.560
these are our two processes as it
relates to addiction

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570
relates to addiction
 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.630
relates to addiction
