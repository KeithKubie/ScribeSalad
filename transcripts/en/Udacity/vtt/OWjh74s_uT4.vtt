Let's change it up a little bit. I'm going

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.840
to delete this closing em tag, and I'd like

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.000
you to tell me what happens when we don't

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.670
have the closing em tag. In our previous example, we

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.510
had an opening em tag and I left off

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.410
the closing tag. When happens when we forget to

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.760
close that em tag? Nothing is italicized. The browser crashes.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.200
Everything after that opening em tag is italicized or,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.850
I don't know, your guess is as good as mine.
