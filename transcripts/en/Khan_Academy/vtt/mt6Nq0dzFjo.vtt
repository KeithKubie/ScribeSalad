00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:01.800
SALMAN KHAN: I have
some footage here

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.584
of one of the most exciting
moments in sports history.

00:00:04.584 --> 00:00:06.000
And to make it
even more exciting,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.265
the commentator is
speaking in German.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.870
And I'm assuming that
this is OK under fair use,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.062
because I'm really using
it for a math problem.

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:15.520
But I want you to
watch this video,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.100
and then I'll ask you
a question about it.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.060
[CHEERING]

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:40.700
COMMENTATOR: [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.950
SALMAN KHAN: So you see,
it's exciting in any language

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.220
that you might watch it.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.930
But my question to you is,
how fast was Usain Bolt going?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.440
What was his average
speed when he

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.550
ran that 100 meters right there?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.630
And I encourage you to watch
the video as many times

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.980
as you need to do it.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.150
And now I'll give you a little
bit of time to think about it,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.930
and then we will solve it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.560
So we needed to figure out
how fast was Usain Bolt going

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.659
over the 100 meters.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450
So we're really thinking
about, in the case

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.520
of this problem, average
speed or average rate.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.050
And you might already be
familiar with the notion

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.460
that distance is equal
to rate or speed--

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.750
I'll just write
rate-- times time.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.780
And I could write
times like that,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
but once we start doing algebra,
the traditional multiplication

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.260
symbol can seem very confusing
because it looks just

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.770
like the variable x.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.350
So instead, I will
write times like this.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.710
So distance is equal
to rate times time.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.190
And hopefully, this makes
some intuitive sense for you.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.320
If your rate or your
speed were 10 meters

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.850
per second-- just as an example.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.020
That's not necessarily
how fast he went.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.740
But if you went 10
meters per second,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.050
and if you were to do
that for two seconds,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.040
then it should hopefully
make intuitive sense

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.140
that you went 20 meters.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.710
You went 10 meters per
second for two seconds.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.490
And it also works
out mathematically.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.980
10 times 2 is equal to 20.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.500
And then you have seconds in
the denominator and seconds

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.670
up here in the numerator.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.300
I just wrote seconds
here with an s.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.390
I wrote it out there.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.250
But they also cancel
out, and you're just

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.660
left with the units of meters.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620
So you're just left
with 20 meters.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.940
So hopefully this
makes intuitive sense.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.760
With that out of the
way, let's actually

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.260
think about the problem at hand.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.990
What information do
we actually have?

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.780
So do we have the distance?

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.240
So what is the distance
in the video we just did?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.610
And I'll give you a second
or two to think about it.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.070
Well, this race
was the 100 meters.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.020
So the distance was 100 meters.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.180
Now, what else do we know?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.280
Do we know-- well, we're
trying to figure out the rate.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.863
That's what we're
going to figure out.

00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:09.780
What else do we know out of
this equation right over here?

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.840
Well, do we know the time?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.180
Do we know the time?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.240
What was the time that it
took Usain Bolt to run the 100

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.840
meters?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.150
And I'll give you another few
seconds to think about that.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.900
Well luckily, they were
timing the whole thing.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.846
And they also showed
that it's a world record.

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.470
But this right over
here is in seconds.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.370
It's how long it took Usain
Bolt to run the 100 meters.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.640
It was 9.58 seconds.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.670
And I'll just write
s for seconds.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.260
So given this information here,
what you need to attempt to do

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.139
is now give us our rate in
terms of meters per second.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.930
I want you to think if
you could figure out

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.830
the rate in terms of
meters per second.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.275
We know the distance,
and we know the time.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300
Well, let's substitute
these values

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.890
into this equation
right over here.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.490
We know the distance
is 100 meters.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.880
And it's equal to-- we
don't know the rate,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.210
so I'll just write
rate right over here.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.580
And let me write it
in that same color.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.250
It's equal to rate times--
and what's the time?

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.269
We do know the time.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.780
It's 9.58 seconds.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.750
And we care about rate.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.050
We care about solving for rate.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.900
So how can we do that?

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.590
Well, if you look at this right
hand side of the equation,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.520
I have 9.58 seconds times rate.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.290
If I were able to
divide this right hand

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.810
side by 9.58 seconds,
I'll just have

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.250
rate on the right hand side.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.140
And that's what I
want to solve for.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.740
So you say, well, why don't I
just divide the right hand side

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.330
by 9.58 seconds?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.360
Because if I did that,
the units cancel out,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.920
if we're doing
dimensional analysis.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.420
Don't worry too much if that
word doesn't make sense to you.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.340
But the units cancel out,
and the 9.58 cancels out.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.110
But I can't just divide one
side of an equation by a number.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.670
When we started off, this
is equal to this up here.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.000
If I divide the
right side by 9.58,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.820
in order for the equality
to still be true,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.590
I need to divide the left
side by the same thing.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.445
So I can't just
divide the right side.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:23.070
I have to divide the
left side in order

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.410
for the equality
to still be true.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.500
If I said one thing is
equal to another thing,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.000
and I divide the other thing
by something, in order for them

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.124
to still be equal, I have
to divide the first thing

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:33.140
by that same amount.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.810
So I divide by 9.58 seconds.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.310
So on our right
hand side-- and this

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.030
was the whole point--
these two cancel out.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.580
And then on the
left hand side, I'm

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.970
left with 100 divided by 9.58.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.460
And my units are
meters per second,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.480
which are the exact units that
I want for rate, or for speed.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.450
And so let's get the calculator
out to divide 100 by 9.58.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.920
So I've got 100 meters
divided by 9.58 seconds

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.585
gives me 10 point--
this says we've

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:09.440
got about three
significant digits here--

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.850
so let's say 10.4.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.140
So this gives us 10.4.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.170
And I'll write it
in the rate color.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:23.290
10.4-- and the units are
meters per second-- meters

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.912
per second is equal to my rate.

00:06:29.912 --> 00:06:30.870
Now, the next question.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.370
So we got this in
meters per second.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.440
But unfortunately,
meters per second,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.390
they're not the--
when we drive a car,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.130
we don't see the speedometer
in meters per second.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.700
We see either kilometers
per hour or miles per hour.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.080
So the next task I have for
you is to express this speed,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.140
or this rate-- and this
is his average speed,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.040
or his average rate,
over the 100 meters.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.600
But to think about this in
terms of kilometers per hour.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.200
So try to figure out
if you can rewrite

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.215
this in kilometers per hour.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.310
Well, let's just take
this step by step.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.970
So I'm going to
write-- so let me just

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.770
go down here, start over.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.800
So I started off with 10.4.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.260
And I'll write meters in
blue, and seconds in magenta.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.934
Now, we want to get to
kilometers per hour.

00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:24.350
Right now we're
meters per second.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.560
So let's take baby steps.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.562
Let's first think about it in
terms of kilometers per second.

00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:32.020
And I'll give you
a second to think

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.686
about what we would
do this to turn this

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:37.660
into kilometers per second.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.080
Well, the intuition here, if I'm
going 10.4 meters per second,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.190
how many kilometers
is 10.4 meters?

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.100
Well, kilometers is a much
larger unit of measurement.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.590
It's 1,000 times larger.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.210
So 10.4 meters will be a much
smaller number of kilometers.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.919
And in particular, I'm
going to divide by 1,000.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:58.460
Another way to think
about it, if you

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.290
want to focus on
the units, we want

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.150
to get rid of this in meters,
and we want a kilometers.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.440
So we want a
kilometers, and we want

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.540
to get rid of these meters.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.240
So if we had meters
in the numerator,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.790
we could divide by meters here.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.100
They would cancel out.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.100
But the intuitive way to
think about it is we're

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.030
going from a smaller
unit, meters,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.000
to a larger unit, kilometers.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.580
So 10.4 meters are going
to be a much smaller number

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.580
of kilometers.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.690
But if we look at it
this way, how many meters

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.550
are in 1 kilometer?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.360
1 kilometer is equal
to 1,000 meters.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.700
This right over here, 1
kilometer over 1,000 meters,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.750
this is 1 over 1.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.500
We're not changing
the fundamental value.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.929
We're essentially just
multiplying it by one.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.860
But when we do this,
what do we get?

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.500
Well, the meters cancel out.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.510
We're left with
kilometers and seconds.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.666
And the numbers, you get
10.4 divided by 1,000.

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:52.880
10.4 divided by 1,000
is going to give you--

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.700
so if you divide by 10,
you're going to get 1.04.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.760
You divide by 100,
you get 0.104.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:05.090
You divide by 1,000,
you get 0.0104.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.590
So that's just 10.4
divided by 1,000.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:13.230
And then our units are
kilometers per second.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.040
So that's the
kilometers, and then I

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.230
have my seconds right over here.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.990
So let me write the equal sign.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.687
Now, let's try to convert
this to kilometers per hour.

00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:26.270
And I'll give you a
little bit of time

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.630
to think about that one.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.580
Well, hours, there's
3,600 seconds in an hour.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.890
So however many kilometers
I do in a second,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.360
I'm going to do 3,600
times that in an hour.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.890
And the units will
also work out.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.090
If I do this many
in a second, so it's

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:53.815
going to be times 3,600, there
are 3,600 seconds in an hour.

00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:55.440
And another way to
think about it is we

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.850
want hours in the denominator.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.130
We had seconds.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.250
So if we multiply
by seconds per hour,

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.240
there are 3,600
seconds per hour,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.740
the seconds are
going to cancel out,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.310
and we're going to be left
with hours in the denominator.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.770
So seconds cancel out, and we're
left with kilometers per hour.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.650
But now we have to multiply
this number times 3,600.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.350
I'll get the calculator
out for that.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:31.800
So we have 0.0104 times 3,600
gives us, I'll just say 37.4.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:44.245
So this is equal to 37.4
kilometers per hour.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.950
So that's his average speed
in kilometers per hour.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.290
And now the last thing I want to
do, for those of us in America,

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.160
we'll convert into
imperial units,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.780
or sometimes called English
units, which are ironically

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.150
not necessarily used in the UK.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.320
They tend to be used in America.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.552
So let's convert this
into miles per hour.

00:11:05.552 --> 00:11:07.510
And the one thing I will
tell you, just in case

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:15.249
you don't know, is that 1.61
kilometers is equal to 1 mile.

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:16.790
So I'll give you a
little bit of time

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.980
to convert this
into miles per hour.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.040
Well, as you see
from this, a mile

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.320
is a slightly larger
or reasonably larger

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.260
unit than a kilometer.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.156
So if you're going 37.4
kilometers in a certain amount

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.280
of time, you're going to
go slightly smaller amount

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.821
of miles in a certain
amount of time.

00:11:33.821 --> 00:11:36.950
Or in particular, you're
going to divide by 1.61.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.400
So let me rewrite it.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:46.550
If I have 37.4
kilometers per hour,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.810
we're going to a larger unit.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.090
We're going to miles.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.690
So we're going to divide by
something larger than one.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.090
So we have one-- let
me write it in blue-- 1

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:04.010
mile is equal to
1.61 kilometers.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.960
Or you could say there's one
1.61th mile per kilometer.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.920
It also, once again,
works out with units.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.536
We want to get rid of the
kilometers in the numerator.

00:12:12.536 --> 00:12:14.160
So we would want it
in the denominator.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.493
We want a mile in the numerator.

00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:17.650
So that's why we have a
mile in the numerator here.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.060
So let's once again
multiply, or I

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.360
guess in this case
we're dividing by 1.61.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.450
And we get-- let's just divide
our previous value by 1.61.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.340
And we get 23 point--
I'll just round up-- 23.3.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:41.750
This is equal to 23.3.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.275
And then we have miles per hour.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.570
Which is obviously very fast.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.300
He's the fastest human.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.690
But it's not maybe as fast
as you might have imagined.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.060
In a car, 23.3 miles per
hour doesn't seem so fast.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.300
And especially relative
to the animal world,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.590
it's not particularly
noteworthy.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.890
This is actually slightly
slower than a charging elephant.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.930
Charging elephants have been
clocked at 25 miles per hour.
