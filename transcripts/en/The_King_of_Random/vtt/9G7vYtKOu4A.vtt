00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey guys welcome back, thanks for joining me today on the King of Random. When I was a kid,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
I often dreamed of being a spy like James Bond or Jason Bourne, and an

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.560
old-fashioned staple of the spy is being able to write secret messages from one person to another

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.720
There are a lot of different ways you can try and write secret messages, and the purpose of today's video is to try out three

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.689
Different types of invisible ink to see which one's work the best. The first type of invisible ink we'll try is lemon juice which is

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.849
Invisible until you hold it over a heat source

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.620
The second is a mixture of baking soda and water which is supposed to be revealed when you cover it in grape juice

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.360
the third Experiment is to try and use bleach as an ink and see if it will show up under black light

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.720
Let's get started.  For our first invisible ink test

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.100
We've got a couple of lemons. You could also buy the pre-squeezed lemon juice in bottles at the store that should work

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.140
Just as well. Let's cut our lemon in half and squeeze the juice out onto this plate

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.060
I think that looks like enough juice to be used for a lot of ink

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.240
Now let's take a piece of a bamboo skewer or a toothpick; dip it in the juice and try writing on our paper

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.399
Dip the bamboo skewer in the lemon juice so it has a little bit of a coating on it

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.908
And then use that as a stylus to write on a piece of paper

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.879
Let your lemon juice ink dry completely onto the paper

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.359
The lemon juice invisible ink is supposed to be activated by heat

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.360
you can use an incandescent light bulb, a lighter, or a stove to try and give some heat to your paper and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.400
Bring out the secret message.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.229
First I'm going to try this with the lighter. Of course you need to be very careful that you don't light your piece of paper on fire

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.379
With the heat moving evenly to reduce your risk of flames

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.020
Ooh

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.810
There we go you can clearly see the secret message. The flame did do a little bit of scorching on the paper in a couple of spots

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.240
so as I said you have to be very careful, or you could easily burn your secret message. That worked pretty

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.890
Well, I'm going to try a slight variation

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.220
I have here an old-fashioned fountain pen, and I'm going to try using the lemon juice as ink to write with this instead

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680
Write our secret message

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.910
This time instead of using the lighter because it has such a high risk of lighting the paper on fire

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.339
I'm going to be using a glass top stove

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.000
Using a glass top stove gives us a nice even surface to heat our paper over

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.219
That was supposed to be the letter U and apparently I didn't have quite enough lemon juice on my pen

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.279
Our second method involves a mixture of baking soda and water as the ink and grape juice to reveal it

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.149
I've mixed up about one part water and one part baking soda here. Not all of the baking soda will dissolve

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.219
But hopefully it will work just fine for our invisible ink. I'll try using my fancy pen again to see if this works

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.029
Let's use a little bit of paper towel to blot off the excess water. I've got two different methods

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.399
I want to try to apply the grape juice

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.519
First I'm going to use a little bit on a paper towel and rub it over the lettering

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.780
Next I'm going to put some grape juice in this small spray bottle and spray it over what I've written

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.349
The lettering is a little bit visible, but it's not standing out a ton

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.739
Not bad. It's good as a juice let's see if it's good at a secret message revealer

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.729
Well that actually kind of worked

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.690
Sprayed it on and then maybe sprayed on a little bit too much, but

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.720
Amazing I wasn't too bad it brought out the color. It's sort of a darker grey

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.129
Maybe even a hint of blue in it. Maybe that's just from the juice. That works, okay

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.469
I don't think it revealed as well as the lemon juice does

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.749
But it's kind of fun to be able to use a second chemical to make the first one appear as an experiment

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.239
I'm also going to see what happens if we use our baking soda water mixture as ink and then hold it over the heat the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240
Way we did with the lemon juice

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.940
You can see a message trying to appear.

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:03.330
Oh

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.989
What a good secret message. Actually that turned out really well

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.699
That shows up very nicely. I think that's actually even darker than the lemon juice

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.778
Let's see what happens if we also put the heat over the one that had grape juice on it

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.158
That's cool, I don't know how well it showed on my camera, but all of the grape juice just turned like a lot more purple

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.729
And it started burning the paper so that wasn't as good

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.588
For our third type of invisible ink we're going to be using bleach and an ultraviolet flashlight

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:34.339
Ultraviolet is a frequency of light that we can't pick up very well with our eyes

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.029
But there are a lot of substances that will reflect it back in a frequency we can see

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.119
We can see

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.119
So let's carefully pour out a small amount of our bleach and try riding with it to see what happens

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:46.518
First let's see if the bleach itself seems to light up in the black light. 
It doesn't seem to be doing much

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:52.039
Let's see if the bleach itself seems to light up in the black light doesn't seem to be doing much

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.029
Looks pretty much the same with the black light on it.  Well even though it's not lighting up very much on the plate

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.999
Looks pretty much the same with the black light on it well even though. It's not lighting up very much on the plate

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.999
Okay now in theory the bleach is supposed to be reflective and sort of glow under the blacklight. Let's see how this works

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.049
Okay now in theory the bleach is supposed to be reflective and sort of glow under the blacklight. Let's see how this works oh

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.289
Oh, it's the opposite of reflective

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:23.688
It's like it's black ink in the middle of the glowing white paper. That's cool

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:28.789
It's like it's black. Ink in the middle of the glowing white paper. That's cool

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.789
Weird I would not have guessed that was gonna happen

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:37.278
I thought it was gonna glow so that's interesting the bleach seems to sort of stop the

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:39.948
ultraviolet light from bouncing off of the paper

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.959
Permanently visible. It only shows up when someone uses the blacklight on it the lemon juice and the baking soda are both wonderful for sending

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.310
Concealed messages, but once they're revealed its permanently on the paper. If you use the blacklight in the bleach

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.800
Concealed messages, but once they're revealed its permanently on the paper if you use the blacklight in the bleach

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.989
It's only there when you've got the light on it

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.989
Something I like about using the bleach is that if you have a light of your own

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.840
There you have it three different methods of using invisible ink: Lemon juice which shows up under heat, baking soda and water

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:20.159
Which shows up a little bit with grape juice or also shows up with heat on it, and bleach

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.630
Which shows up a little bit with grape juice or also shows up with heat on it and bleach

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.670
But actually has the opposite effect. The paper around it glows and it stays nice and dark

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.739
But actually has the opposite effect the paper around it glows and it stays nice and dark

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:38.100
Looking at what you see. With the lemon juice or the baking soda ink

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.040
It's pretty hard to see what's going down on the paper because you can't heat it up and reveal it

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.989
Or it's no longer a secret now. Now you're all one step closer to becoming spies

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.220
Or it's no longer a secret now. You're all one step closer to becoming spies

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.379
This is a great activity for you to try at home

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.409
And it can be a fun way to send secret messages to your friends

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.980
Thank you for joining us for this experiment today, and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.220
Don't think it's gonna catch on as a breath spray

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.240
Hey guys. Thanks for supporting Nate so much in these videos

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.680
I know this used to be grant Thompson the king of random but for years there have been so many things that I wanted to

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.400
Do for you that I just couldn't do by myself, but now that Nate's here helping out

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.549
I've got some room to breathe again which means a lot of fun new things coming your way.
