00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:14.191
"New drug may cure cancer."

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.801
"Aspirin may reduce risk of 
heart attacks."

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.261
"Eating breakfast can help 
you lose weight."

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.901
Health headlines like these 
flood the news,

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.591
often contradicting each other.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.789
So how can you figure out what’s a
genuine health concern

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.769
or a truly promising remedy,

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.169
and what’s less conclusive?

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.949
In medicine,

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.929
there’s often a disconnect between 
news headlines

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.459
and the scientific research they cover.

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:45.499
That’s because a headline is designed 
to catch attention—

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.379
it’s most effective when 
it makes a big claim.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.559
By contrast,

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.409
many scientific studies produce 
meaningful results

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.909
when they focus on a narrow, 
specific question.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.899
The best way to bridge this gap

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.239
is to look at the original research 
behind a headline.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.079
We’ve come up with a simplified 
research scenario

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.579
for each of these three headlines
to test your skills.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.549
Keep watching for the explanation 
of the first study;

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.812
then pause at the headline 
to figure out the flaw.

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:19.302
Assume all the information you need
to spot the flaw is included.

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:21.732
Let’s start with this hypothetical 
scenario:

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:25.222
a study using mice to test 
a new cancer drug.

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.492
The study includes two groups of mice,

00:01:27.492 --> 00:01:30.582
one treated with the drug, 
the other with a placebo.

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:31.772
At the end of the trial,

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:34.162
the mice that receive the drug are cured,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:37.652
while those that received 
the placebo are not.

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:40.472
Can you spot the problem 
with this headline:

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:44.112
"Study shows new drug 
could cure cancer"

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.562
Since the subjects of the study were mice,

00:01:46.562 --> 00:01:50.772
we can’t draw conclusions about 
human disease based on this research.

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:56.002
In real life, early research on new drugs
and therapies is not conducted on humans.

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:57.879
If the early results are promising,

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:03.099
clinical trials follow to determine 
if they hold up in humans.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.449
Now that you’ve warmed up,

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:06.289
let’s try a trickier example:

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.439
a study about the impact of aspirin 
on heart attack risk.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.530
The study randomly divides a pool 
of men into two groups.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.105
The members of one group 
take aspirin daily,

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.785
while the others take a daily placebo.

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:21.035
By the end of the trial,

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:24.465
the control group suffered significantly 
more heart attacks

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.345
than the group that took aspirin.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:29.565
Based on this situation, what’s wrong 
with the headline:

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:32.675
"Aspirin may reduce risk of heart attacks"

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:37.725
In this case, the study shows evidence 
that aspirin reduces heart attacks in men,

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.017
because all the participants were men.

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:43.817
But the conclusion “aspirin reduces risk 
of heart attacks” is too broad;

00:02:43.817 --> 00:02:48.147
we can’t assume that results found in
men would also apply to women.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:53.097
Studies often limit participants based on
geographic location, age, gender,

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:55.086
or many other factors.

00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:57.326
Before these findings can be generalized,

00:02:57.326 --> 00:03:00.816
similar studies need to be run 
on other groups.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.896
If a headline makes a general claim,

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:07.946
it should draw its evidence from a diverse
body of research, not one study.

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:11.326
Can you take your skills from the first
two questions to the next level?

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:16.006
Try this example about the impact 
of eating breakfast on weight loss.

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:20.009
Researchers recruit a group of people 
who had always skipped breakfast

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.933
and ask them to start 
eating breakfast everyday.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:27.143
The participants include men and women 
of a range of ages and backgrounds.

00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:28.648
Over a year-long period,

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:32.188
participants lose an average 
of five pounds.

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:33.988
So what’s wrong with the headline:

00:03:33.988 --> 00:03:37.188
"Eating breakfast can help 
you lose weight"

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:40.528
The people in the study started eating 
breakfast and lost weight—

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:45.138
but we don’t know that they lost weight
because they started eating breakfast;

00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:46.878
perhaps having their weight tracked

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:50.298
inspired them to change their eating 
habits in other ways.

00:03:50.298 --> 00:03:53.768
To rule out the possibility that 
some other factor caused weight loss,

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:56.128
we would need to compare 
these participants

00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:58.608
to a group who didn’t eat breakfast 
before the study

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:01.368
and continued to skip it during the study.

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:04.698
A headline certainly shouldn’t claim the 
results of this research

00:04:04.698 --> 00:04:06.718
are generally applicable.

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:10.458
And if the study itself made such 
a claim without a comparison group,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.948
then you should question its credibility.

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:14.948
Now that you’ve battle-tested your skills

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:17.458
on these hypothetical studies 
and headlines,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:19.868
you can test them on real-world news.

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:22.798
Even when full papers aren’t available 
without a fee,

00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:26.648
you can often find summaries of 
experimental design and results

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:28.618
in freely available abstracts,

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.288
or even within the text 
of a news article.

00:04:31.288 --> 00:04:33.000
Individual studies have results

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.740
that don’t necessarily correspond 
to a grabby headline.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.080
Big conclusions for human health issues

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.360
require lots of evidence accumulated 
over time.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.440
But in the meantime,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.240
we can keep on top of the science, 
by reading past the headlines.
