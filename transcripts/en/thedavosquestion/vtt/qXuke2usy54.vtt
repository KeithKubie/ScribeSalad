&gt;&gt; Hello YouTube, this is Chad Sweet, I'm
the Chief of Staff of the Department of Homeland

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.820
Security and I think in 2008
when we look back on whether it was 9/11 or

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.400
Katrina, most of us would agree that being
prepared is something we can

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.980
all do and if you can go to www.ready.gov,
that's the website we put out for all families

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.619
and individuals to check out so
you can see what are the things you can do

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.790
to prepare for any event that are common sense
things, and I think in 2008 if

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.820
we all do our part to be ready we don't have
to be fearful, we can just be ready. Thanks.
