00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've got to say that my solution came out a little bit more complicated than I expected it to.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I think maybe I made a bad choice for the representation.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I threw in the flashlight along with the set of people,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because I figured you want one set to represent everything that's on one side.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I'm think now after this came out the way that it did

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that maybe I should have had the flashlight be a separate part of the state.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In other words, have the state be a 4-tuple, not of things that are here or there

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but of people that are here or there, then the time,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then a fourth element being the flashlight saying where is the flashlight.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That could either be true or false, saying it is it here,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or it could be a character string, saying it's there or here,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or it could be a integer--0 or 1.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I think it might've been easier if I'd chosen one of those representations.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But it didn't bother me enough to go back and make a change.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you want to, you could spend time refractoring and change that.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'm going to just push ahead. Here's what I did.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I said if the light is here, then let's look at all the people in here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We'll look at all the pairs of people--A and B.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
To make sure that they're people, I have to say that they're not the light.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
For all pairs of people A and B,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we can generate a successor state,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which is the set of people that were here

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
minus the two people and the light, because the light is going to move from here to there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The second part of the successor state is everything

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that was already over on the other side on there

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
unioned with the things that are coming over,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
which are people A and B and the light.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then the time is the time plus the maximum time that it took for A and B to get over.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Then I know it says in the specification here that the action is represented just by an arrow.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If I want to get the problem right I would do that, but then I decided

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
later on that maybe the action should be more than just the arrow.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Maybe the action should also tell who went across.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I have the option of doing thing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If I want to just solve the problem the way it was specified

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
then I would return just the arrow to represent the action,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I would do the same thing over here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
One subtlety of this that worked out well in my favor--

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it's a little bit messy dealing with frozen sets.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I don't like the idea of that the name is so long,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but I didn't have to consider separately the idea of one person going across

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and two persons going across.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Because we were dealing with sets, the set of people a, b when a is equal to b is equal to 1 person.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I get the 1 person crossing for free. That's one nice thing about my representation.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But notice that everything is in flux here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'm trying to choose a good representation.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I'm changing my mind as I go along.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Should the actions be represented by a single arrow or should they be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
represented by an arrow along with the names of the people that are going?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's all up in flux.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I should say that that type of flux is okay as long as it remains contained.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If you have uncertainties that are going to cross barriers

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
between lots of different functions, then probably you want to nail them down.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If you think that they're contained, then it's okay to have some uncertainty

00:03:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and be able to explore the exact options later.
