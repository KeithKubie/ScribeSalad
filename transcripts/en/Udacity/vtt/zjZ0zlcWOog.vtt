00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right. Initially we have--I cut 9.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So these are the cuts that I made and just to show that it's still connected.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There's a little bit of plastic that goes around without passing through any cuts

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but there should be no loops--so every little region here that a turtle could get trapped in

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
we have a cut in it and in fact, a series of cuts that gets you to the outside.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So this region here exits out through here, here and out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This region say you exit here, here and out, region then run out, run out, this one here and out.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Every region now opens up and then some other region will actually close up.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So how many cuts did I make and I'm going to say--so did you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There are many, many ways of doing these cuts, but I still think you'll had 14.
