00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
I want to go back a little bit on why

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670
I want to go back a little bit on why
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.789
I want to go back a little bit on why
did we create constraint layout so if

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
did we create constraint layout so if
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.250
did we create constraint layout so if
you look at constantly at one we wanted

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260
you look at constantly at one we wanted
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.270
you look at constantly at one we wanted
to have something that was a very

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
to have something that was a very
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.789
to have something that was a very
flexible layout manager something that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799
flexible layout manager something that
 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.369
flexible layout manager something that
would allow you to to specify the way

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
would allow you to to specify the way
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.980
would allow you to to specify the way
your UI should be laid out and behave in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
your UI should be laid out and behave in
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260
your UI should be laid out and behave in
as much of a declarative way as possible

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
as much of a declarative way as possible
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.130
as much of a declarative way as possible
and in order to do that we created a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
and in order to do that we created a
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230
and in order to do that we created a
really rich model of constraints so you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
really rich model of constraints so you
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390
really rich model of constraints so you
could position your widget relatively to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
could position your widget relatively to
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700
could position your widget relatively to
one another you could Center them in

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
one another you could Center them in
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.729
one another you could Center them in
between each other with bias you have

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
between each other with bias you have
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.500
between each other with bias you have
circular positioning dimension

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510
circular positioning dimension
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110
circular positioning dimension
constraint and ratio and change which is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
constraint and ratio and change which is
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970
constraint and ratio and change which is
pretty interesting way of positioning a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
pretty interesting way of positioning a
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.970
pretty interesting way of positioning a
group of widgets together so all of that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
group of widgets together so all of that
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.049
group of widgets together so all of that
comes with you know a lot of power in to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
comes with you know a lot of power in to
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.750
comes with you know a lot of power in to
help you create those layouts we also

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
help you create those layouts we also
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360
help you create those layouts we also
add this idea of having helper objects

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
add this idea of having helper objects
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.510
add this idea of having helper objects
and the helper object object that are

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
and the helper object object that are
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.599
and the helper object object that are
not resulting automatically in a visual

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
not resulting automatically in a visual
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.450
not resulting automatically in a visual
difference by themselves but they will

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
difference by themselves but they will
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630
difference by themselves but they will
allow you to set up your UI in an easier

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
allow you to set up your UI in an easier
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330
allow you to set up your UI in an easier
way the typical example is guideline

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
way the typical example is guideline
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.359
way the typical example is guideline
where you know you can create those

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
where you know you can create those
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700
where you know you can create those
guideline that your designers are so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
guideline that your designers are so
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370
guideline that your designers are so
fond of and just align the widget to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
fond of and just align the widget to
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.310
fond of and just align the widget to
that which is nice because often before

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
that which is nice because often before
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.399
that which is nice because often before
that you you would have to translate you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
that you you would have to translate you
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.929
that you you would have to translate you
know what they meant by guidelines in

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
know what they meant by guidelines in
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999
know what they meant by guidelines in
your in your layout well here you can

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
your in your layout well here you can
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249
your in your layout well here you can
simply create the guideline as in the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259
simply create the guideline as in the
 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.670
simply create the guideline as in the
mug and align things to it in a similar

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
mug and align things to it in a similar
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.640
mug and align things to it in a similar
way we introduced the barrier helper in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
way we introduced the barrier helper in
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100
way we introduced the barrier helper in
the construct one one that you know

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
the construct one one that you know
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469
the construct one one that you know
gives you some interesting behavior

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
gives you some interesting behavior
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.980
gives you some interesting behavior
where you could decide of a set of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
where you could decide of a set of
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.030
where you could decide of a set of
widgets where to position yourself the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
widgets where to position yourself the
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800
widgets where to position yourself the
other important aspect on construct

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
other important aspect on construct
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.600
other important aspect on construct
layout and you'll see that's going to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
layout and you'll see that's going to
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090
layout and you'll see that's going to
come in at very handy for for the rest

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
come in at very handy for for the rest
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.700
come in at very handy for for the rest
of this talk it's this notion of trying

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
of this talk it's this notion of trying
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030
of this talk it's this notion of trying
to keep the view hierarchy flat so there

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
to keep the view hierarchy flat so there
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.490
to keep the view hierarchy flat so there
is some performance reason for that but

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
is some performance reason for that but
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.889
is some performance reason for that but
more interestingly it's really this idea

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
more interestingly it's really this idea
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.760
more interestingly it's really this idea
of decoupling the layout information the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
of decoupling the layout information the
 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550
of decoupling the layout information the
layout rules to the view with the view

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
layout rules to the view with the view
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.260
layout rules to the view with the view
hierarchy itself

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
hierarchy itself
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.050
hierarchy itself
and the nice thing with this is that we

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
and the nice thing with this is that we
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.640
and the nice thing with this is that we
have an object called constraint set

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
have an object called constraint set
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920
have an object called constraint set
that can encapsulate all those rules and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930
that can encapsulate all those rules and
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.580
that can encapsulate all those rules and
you can create multiple instances of

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
you can create multiple instances of
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.610
you can create multiple instances of
this object swap them in or out

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
this object swap them in or out
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500
this object swap them in or out
you're constantly out so that gives you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
you're constantly out so that gives you
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.110
you're constantly out so that gives you
a lot of flexibility not only when you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
a lot of flexibility not only when you
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.510
a lot of flexibility not only when you
to layout and create your UI but also at

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
to layout and create your UI but also at
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.880
to layout and create your UI but also at
runtime when you want to change all your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
runtime when you want to change all your
 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.240
runtime when you want to change all your
wife

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
wife
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.350
wife
and finally it's an unbundled library we

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
and finally it's an unbundled library we
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780
and finally it's an unbundled library we
all sort of from the get-go I created

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
all sort of from the get-go I created
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640
all sort of from the get-go I created
this layout to be supported in the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650
this layout to be supported in the
 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.010
this layout to be supported in the
design tools so we have a pretty nice UI

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020
design tools so we have a pretty nice UI
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.790
design tools so we have a pretty nice UI
builder and and that brings us to

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800
builder and and that brings us to
 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.530
builder and and that brings us to
construct layer - why did we create

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
construct layer - why did we create
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.350
construct layer - why did we create
cross track here - well the the key

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
cross track here - well the the key
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.770
cross track here - well the the key
element here is ready to try to create a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
element here is ready to try to create a
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.530
element here is ready to try to create a
layout that is even more flexible we

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
layout that is even more flexible we
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.530
layout that is even more flexible we
wanted to give you back even more power

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
wanted to give you back even more power
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.130
wanted to give you back even more power
and we did that in a few ways one we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
and we did that in a few ways one we
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.560
and we did that in a few ways one we
added the concept of virtual layouts

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570
added the concept of virtual layouts
 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.530
added the concept of virtual layouts
which are helpers that will do

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
which are helpers that will do
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.900
which are helpers that will do
essentially a lot of the Grand row for

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
essentially a lot of the Grand row for
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.449
essentially a lot of the Grand row for
you so you don't have to manually set

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459
you so you don't have to manually set
 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.220
you so you don't have to manually set
the constraint one by one you could

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
the constraint one by one you could
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.620
the constraint one by one you could
apply a set of constraints we had this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
apply a set of constraints we had this
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.230
apply a set of constraints we had this
kind of the actual layout we have

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240
kind of the actual layout we have
 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.980
kind of the actual layout we have
helpers and decorators and also we

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990
helpers and decorators and also we
 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.050
helpers and decorators and also we
exposed a lot more of the internals of

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060
exposed a lot more of the internals of
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.140
exposed a lot more of the internals of
constantly add for you and that that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150
constantly add for you and that that
 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
constantly add for you and that that
means that you can do at runtime a lot

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160
means that you can do at runtime a lot
 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.390
means that you can do at runtime a lot
more stuff in constantly at - we also

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
more stuff in constantly at - we also
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.090
more stuff in constantly at - we also
did a lot of work in atomization and of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
did a lot of work in atomization and of
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.030
did a lot of work in atomization and of
course a big highlight of construct

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
course a big highlight of construct
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.090
course a big highlight of construct
layer 2 is motion layout it's really you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
layer 2 is motion layout it's really you
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.280
layer 2 is motion layout it's really you
know the more flexible way you can think

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
know the more flexible way you can think
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.740
know the more flexible way you can think
of for UI is introducing motion and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
of for UI is introducing motion and
 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.220
of for UI is introducing motion and
animation we still continue to to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230
animation we still continue to to
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.070
animation we still continue to to
strongly support design tooling and you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080
strongly support design tooling and you
 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.140
strongly support design tooling and you
know specifically we are in the process

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150
know specifically we are in the process
 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
know specifically we are in the process
of building a motion editor in order to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
of building a motion editor in order to
 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.980
of building a motion editor in order to
do and we'll talk a little bit about

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990
do and we'll talk a little bit about
 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.000
do and we'll talk a little bit about
that and in order to use it it's very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010
that and in order to use it it's very
 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.460
that and in order to use it it's very
easy just add this dependency to your

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
easy just add this dependency to your
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.140
easy just add this dependency to your
Gradle file and if you're using Android

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
Gradle file and if you're using Android
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.570
Gradle file and if you're using Android
X you know similar things just different

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580
X you know similar things just different

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.409
so check it out we are pretty happy

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419
so check it out we are pretty happy
 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.029
so check it out we are pretty happy
where we are standing in terms of API

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039
where we are standing in terms of API
 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.399
where we are standing in terms of API
and yeah we are really looking forward

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409
and yeah we are really looking forward
 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.159
and yeah we are really looking forward
to you know what kind of feedback you

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169
to you know what kind of feedback you
 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.209
to you know what kind of feedback you
can give us so to to kind of you know

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219
can give us so to to kind of you know
 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.279
can give us so to to kind of you know
present things a little here is the

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289
present things a little here is the
 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.080
present things a little here is the
overall architecture of constantly add

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090
overall architecture of constantly add
 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.790
overall architecture of constantly add
we are starting with this very generic

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800
we are starting with this very generic
 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.519
we are starting with this very generic
solver that can do a lot of computation

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529
solver that can do a lot of computation
 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.249
solver that can do a lot of computation
for us and express your layout in very

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259
for us and express your layout in very
 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.769
for us and express your layout in very
complex way but we don't expose that

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:51.779
complex way but we don't expose that
 

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.360
complex way but we don't expose that
directly what we expose this this

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370
directly what we expose this this
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.249
directly what we expose this this
constraint model the nice thing with

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259
constraint model the nice thing with
 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.309
constraint model the nice thing with
this is that we can in between add an

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319
this is that we can in between add an
 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.290
this is that we can in between add an
optimizer that take care of a lot of

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300
optimizer that take care of a lot of
 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.619
optimizer that take care of a lot of
situations that are very you know an

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629
situations that are very you know an
 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.600
situations that are very you know an
ambiguous and don't need it in a solver

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
ambiguous and don't need it in a solver
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.420
ambiguous and don't need it in a solver
so that gives us a lot more speed in

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
so that gives us a lot more speed in
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.050
so that gives us a lot more speed in
constantly up to the on top of that we

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060
constantly up to the on top of that we
 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.089
constantly up to the on top of that we
are the helpers object and the virtual

layout that are kind of using this

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:15.839
layout that are kind of using this
 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.890

this we have motion layout that takes

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729
this we have motion layout that takes
 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.740
this we have motion layout that takes
advantage of this entire foundation let

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
advantage of this entire foundation let
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.659
advantage of this entire foundation let
me cover a little bit the constraint

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669
me cover a little bit the constraint
 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.019
me cover a little bit the constraint
helpers so as I explained we did have

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029
helpers so as I explained we did have
 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.209
helpers so as I explained we did have
helpers in constantly at one in

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219
helpers in constantly at one in
 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.029
helpers in constantly at one in
constantly to we expose that class so

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039
constantly to we expose that class so
 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.249
constantly to we expose that class so
not only we can continue to create

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259
not only we can continue to create
 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.409
not only we can continue to create
helpers for you but you can actually

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419
helpers for you but you can actually
 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.829
helpers for you but you can actually
create your own address so the thing

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:42.839
create your own address so the thing
 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:43.909
create your own address so the thing
that's important to note is with the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919
that's important to note is with the
 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.829
that's important to note is with the
helpers is that they are not of your

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839
helpers is that they are not of your
 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.649
helpers is that they are not of your
group we are not adding a layer and an

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659
group we are not adding a layer and an
 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.070
group we are not adding a layer and an
extra layer of hierarchy there all we do

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080
extra layer of hierarchy there all we do
 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.480
extra layer of hierarchy there all we do
is we essentially tag the widgets with

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490
is we essentially tag the widgets with
 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.809
is we essentially tag the widgets with
that helper and the nice property is

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819
that helper and the nice property is
 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.399
that helper and the nice property is
that you can actually have multiple

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409
that you can actually have multiple
 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.760
that you can actually have multiple
helpers tagging multiple the same

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770
helpers tagging multiple the same
 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.559
helpers tagging multiple the same
widgets so one would add can actually

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569
widgets so one would add can actually
 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.329
widgets so one would add can actually
have its behavior change by multiple

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:08.339
have its behavior change by multiple
 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.029
have its behavior change by multiple
helpers but the general idea is that if

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039
helpers but the general idea is that if
 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.529
helpers but the general idea is that if
you have a repeatable behavior you can

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539
you have a repeatable behavior you can
 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.929
you have a repeatable behavior you can
encapsulate it and just use it in a

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939
encapsulate it and just use it in a
 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:16.579
encapsulate it and just use it in a
declarative way in XML and you don't

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:16.589
declarative way in XML and you don't
 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.619
declarative way in XML and you don't
have to do code after that a basic

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629
have to do code after that a basic
 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.589
have to do code after that a basic
example is a circular reveal nothing too

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599
example is a circular reveal nothing too
 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.119
example is a circular reveal nothing too
fancy here I'm just having a reveal

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:23.129
fancy here I'm just having a reveal
 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.040
fancy here I'm just having a reveal
pointing to the different widget that

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050
pointing to the different widget that
 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.399
pointing to the different widget that
appears what's interesting is the actual

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409
appears what's interesting is the actual
 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.740
appears what's interesting is the actual
code it is we are not reinventing the

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750
code it is we are not reinventing the
 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.969
code it is we are not reinventing the
wheel it's just of your animation

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979
wheel it's just of your animation
 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.020
wheel it's just of your animation
materials

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030
materials
 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.600
materials
but we encapsulated into a helper and

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610
but we encapsulated into a helper and
 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.640
but we encapsulated into a helper and
therefore we can simply use it in your

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650
therefore we can simply use it in your
 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.740
therefore we can simply use it in your
XML file without having to do any

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750
XML file without having to do any
 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.680

programming virtual layout is another

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690
programming virtual layout is another
 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.800
programming virtual layout is another
type of helpers and as I mentioned

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810
type of helpers and as I mentioned
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.900
type of helpers and as I mentioned
before the idea is to still keep the

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910
before the idea is to still keep the
 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.970
before the idea is to still keep the
hierarchy flat it will position the

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980
hierarchy flat it will position the
 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.160
hierarchy flat it will position the
widget for you what's what's nice is

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170
widget for you what's what's nice is
 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.440
widget for you what's what's nice is
because we still are the same level of

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450
because we still are the same level of
 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.990
because we still are the same level of
the hierarchy you can reference widget

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000
the hierarchy you can reference widget
 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.590
the hierarchy you can reference widget
that are inside the virtual layout and

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600
that are inside the virtual layout and
 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.500
that are inside the virtual layout and
vice versa so you can also do a lot more

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510
vice versa so you can also do a lot more
 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.480
vice versa so you can also do a lot more
runtime changes on the fly right and let

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490
runtime changes on the fly right and let
 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.030
runtime changes on the fly right and let
me cover flow which is a virtual layout

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040
me cover flow which is a virtual layout
 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.940
me cover flow which is a virtual layout
we introduced recently flows report

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950
we introduced recently flows report
 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.030
we introduced recently flows report
multiple mode on helping you layout

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040
multiple mode on helping you layout
 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.810
multiple mode on helping you layout
objects the first mode is essentially

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820
objects the first mode is essentially
 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.060
objects the first mode is essentially
creating a chain for you there is no

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070
creating a chain for you there is no
 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.060
creating a chain for you there is no
reason tile or vertical and we can also

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070
reason tile or vertical and we can also
 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.960
reason tile or vertical and we can also
sleep out different wrap modes when the

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970
sleep out different wrap modes when the
 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.490
sleep out different wrap modes when the
first one is essentially still using

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500
first one is essentially still using
 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.860
first one is essentially still using
chains as we go along the other one is

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:33.870
chains as we go along the other one is
 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.720
chains as we go along the other one is
doing a little more interesting behavior

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730
doing a little more interesting behavior
 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.150
doing a little more interesting behavior
so this is what it looks like it looks

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160
so this is what it looks like it looks
 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.570
so this is what it looks like it looks
like a normal widget we reference you

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580
like a normal widget we reference you
 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.450
like a normal widget we reference you
know older widget it to a helper as a

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460
know older widget it to a helper as a
 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.660
know older widget it to a helper as a
normal widget you can see set it

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.670
normal widget you can see set it
 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.480
normal widget you can see set it
dimensions wrap content and etc and you

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490
dimensions wrap content and etc and you
 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.980
dimensions wrap content and etc and you
can constrain it like any other wedge I

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:51.990
can constrain it like any other wedge I
 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.870
can constrain it like any other wedge I
think on Sonic layout so it's a very

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880
think on Sonic layout so it's a very
 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.290
think on Sonic layout so it's a very
familiar pattern you can even set up the

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300
familiar pattern you can even set up the
 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.090
familiar pattern you can even set up the
background which is kind of handy in

00:07:59.090 --> 00:07:59.100
background which is kind of handy in
 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.080
background which is kind of handy in
some situations and the devil builders I

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090
some situations and the devil builders I
 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.490

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.880
system that can handle that so one of
them is parent relative another one of

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:16.890
them is parent relative another one of
 

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.280
them is parent relative another one of
them is Delta relative which is actually

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.290
them is Delta relative which is actually
 

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.760
them is Delta relative which is actually
the default it allows you to move in x

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:22.770
the default it allows you to move in x
 

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:26.900
the default it allows you to move in x
and y separately the other one is path

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:26.910
and y separately the other one is path
 

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.420
and y separately the other one is path
relative so if you're deforming around

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:29.430
relative so if you're deforming around
 

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.930
relative so if you're deforming around
the path that allows you to do that the

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940
the path that allows you to do that the
 

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.670
the path that allows you to do that the
other thing that we build is a lot of

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680
other thing that we build is a lot of
 

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.600
other thing that we build is a lot of
clever on swipe and unclick behaviors

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.610
clever on swipe and unclick behaviors
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.210
clever on swipe and unclick behaviors
and actually in the beta there's some

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220
and actually in the beta there's some
 

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.890
and actually in the beta there's some
new stuff in there that's quite exciting

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:44.900
new stuff in there that's quite exciting
 

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.290
new stuff in there that's quite exciting
so how is it basically laid out in your

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300
so how is it basically laid out in your
 

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.630
so how is it basically laid out in your
layout file you'll have your views your

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:50.640
layout file you'll have your views your
 

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.410
layout file you'll have your views your
helpers your virtual layouts and it'll

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420
helpers your virtual layouts and it'll
 

00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:00.410
helpers your virtual layouts and it'll
point to the transition the constraint

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420

essentially the motion scene file so

00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:05.999
essentially the motion scene file so
 

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:11.749
essentially the motion scene file so
let's do an example okay so the basic

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:11.759
let's do an example okay so the basic
 

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.999
let's do an example okay so the basic
stuff on how you can use motion layout

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:14.009
stuff on how you can use motion layout
 

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:16.489
stuff on how you can use motion layout
is you need two states right so here I'm

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:16.499
is you need two states right so here I'm
 

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:18.980
is you need two states right so here I'm
having my little CERN and moving from

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:18.990
having my little CERN and moving from
 

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.889
having my little CERN and moving from
one state to the other it's also not

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899
one state to the other it's also not
 

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.929
one state to the other it's also not
super realistic typically us and would

00:13:23.929 --> 00:13:23.939
super realistic typically us and would
 

00:13:23.939 --> 00:13:26.059
super realistic typically us and would
go a little higher so that's one of the

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:26.069
go a little higher so that's one of the
 

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:27.889
go a little higher so that's one of the
nice thing with constraint we've also

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899
nice thing with constraint we've also
 

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:29.629
nice thing with constraint we've also
constantly are true in motion at is that

you can tweak how you get from the state

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120
you can tweak how you get from the state
 

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.449
you can tweak how you get from the state
to the end it's not just enough to do to

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459
to the end it's not just enough to do to
 

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:37.249
to the end it's not just enough to do to
define those two states because often

00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:37.259
define those two states because often
 

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:40.819

example an arc motion right and I can

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.410
example an arc motion right and I can
 

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.619
example an arc motion right and I can
simply do that by adding a key position

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:48.629
simply do that by adding a key position
 

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:50.929
simply do that by adding a key position
like a keyframe that's going to control

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:50.939
like a keyframe that's going to control
 

00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:52.879
like a keyframe that's going to control
the position at the middle of the

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:52.889
the position at the middle of the
 

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.790
the position at the middle of the
animation in a similar way often you

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800
animation in a similar way often you
 

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.650
animation in a similar way often you
want to do more than just positioning

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660
want to do more than just positioning
 

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.540
want to do more than just positioning
you want to change other type of

00:13:59.540 --> 00:13:59.550
you want to change other type of
 

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.960
you want to change other type of
attributes like here the color and we

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:02.970
attributes like here the color and we
 

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.579
attributes like here the color and we
can do that as well so that's where

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:04.589
can do that as well so that's where
 

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:07.519
can do that as well so that's where
motion it goes much beyond the pure

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:07.529
motion it goes much beyond the pure
 

00:14:07.529 --> 00:14:10.579
motion it goes much beyond the pure
layout capabilities we can change and

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:10.589
layout capabilities we can change and
 

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:13.819
layout capabilities we can change and
interpolate to you know across a lot of

just by separated with the animation as

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279
just by separated with the animation as
 

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.949
just by separated with the animation as
well you notice that here the animation

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959
well you notice that here the animation
 

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:30.350
well you notice that here the animation
is still playing even though we are in

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360
is still playing even though we are in
 

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.650
is still playing even though we are in
the middle of the transition and to

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660
the middle of the transition and to
 

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.600
the middle of the transition and to
cover all of that in more details

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:37.610
 

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.829
so we'll just go through the main tags

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839
so we'll just go through the main tags
 

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.809
so we'll just go through the main tags
there's key position and essentially it

00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:44.819
there's key position and essentially it
 

00:14:44.819 --> 00:14:47.600
there's key position and essentially it
just deforms your path using the

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:47.610
just deforms your path using the
 

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.110
just deforms your path using the
coordinate system and in this case I pin

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120
coordinate system and in this case I pin
 

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.199

equal one next one is key attributes you

00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339
equal one next one is key attributes you
 

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:01.639

post layout transforms you can do custom

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:05.550
post layout transforms you can do custom
 

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.210
post layout transforms you can do custom
attributes with which we'll reflectively

attributes with which we'll reflectively
 

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.389
attributes with which we'll reflectively
call all the different api's so what are

call all the different api's so what are
 

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:15.319
call all the different api's so what are
they ignore complex

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:15.329
they ignore complex
 

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:19.569
they ignore complex
things we add is key cycles they allow

00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:19.579
things we add is key cycles they allow
 

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:26.509
things we add is key cycles they allow
interactive animations in the in space

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519
interactive animations in the in space
 

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:29.989
interactive animations in the in space
so as that the object progresses it will

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:29.999
so as that the object progresses it will
 

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:33.979
so as that the object progresses it will
animate and it will just simply provide

00:15:33.979 --> 00:15:33.989
animate and it will just simply provide
 

00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:37.429

II Delta in the position now you can

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:37.439
II Delta in the position now you can
 

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:41.389
II Delta in the position now you can
apply key cycles to any attributes so it

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399
apply key cycles to any attributes so it
 

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.789
apply key cycles to any attributes so it
can be rotation and you'll see a whole

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:43.799
can be rotation and you'll see a whole
 

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:48.199
can be rotation and you'll see a whole
bunch of them as as we go along so in

00:15:48.199 --> 00:15:48.209
bunch of them as as we go along so in
 

00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:50.989
bunch of them as as we go along so in
this case if the as the animation

00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:50.999
this case if the as the animation
 

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:53.660
this case if the as the animation
progresses its animating across the

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:53.670
progresses its animating across the
 

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.780
progresses its animating across the
entire scene which is very different

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:56.790
entire scene which is very different
 

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.019
entire scene which is very different
from key time cycles where the animation

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:00.029
from key time cycles where the animation
 

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:03.350
from key time cycles where the animation
is independent of the position it's sort

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360
is independent of the position it's sort
 

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.879
is independent of the position it's sort
of setting the frequency of the

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:04.889
of setting the frequency of the
 

00:16:04.889 --> 00:16:06.739
of setting the frequency of the
animation and and of course you can

00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:06.749
animation and and of course you can
 

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:09.259
animation and and of course you can
deform these things with lots of clever

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:09.269
deform these things with lots of clever
 

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.629
deform these things with lots of clever
shapes and paths and produce lots of

00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639
shapes and paths and produce lots of
 

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:18.199
shapes and paths and produce lots of
interesting effects so one of the other

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:18.209
interesting effects so one of the other
 

00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:20.600
interesting effects so one of the other
things that we don't really talk about

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:20.610
things that we don't really talk about
 

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.269
things that we don't really talk about
much and when I mention is programmatic

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279
much and when I mention is programmatic
 

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:27.559
much and when I mention is programmatic
control here we can essentially as we

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:27.569
control here we can essentially as we
 

00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:30.199
control here we can essentially as we
animate we can make a programmatic

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:30.209
animate we can make a programmatic
 

00:16:30.209 --> 00:16:34.549
animate we can make a programmatic
change in direction in real time so what

00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:34.559
change in direction in real time so what
 

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:36.199
change in direction in real time so what
will happen is you're in an undefined

00:16:36.199 --> 00:16:36.209
will happen is you're in an undefined
 

00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:38.869
will happen is you're in an undefined
State because you're halfway between two

00:16:38.869 --> 00:16:38.879
State because you're halfway between two
 

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:41.539
State because you're halfway between two
states this start in the end if you

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:41.549
states this start in the end if you
 

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:45.499
states this start in the end if you
issue a command transition to a new

00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:45.509
issue a command transition to a new
 

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:48.109
issue a command transition to a new
state it will sort of recreate a

00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:48.119
state it will sort of recreate a
 

00:16:48.119 --> 00:16:51.139
state it will sort of recreate a
transition between where you were at

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:51.149
transition between where you were at
 

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:54.259
transition between where you were at
that point in time and the new position

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:54.269
that point in time and the new position
 

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.989
that point in time and the new position
that you were requested so it's it can

00:16:56.989 --> 00:16:56.999
that you were requested so it's it can
 

00:16:56.999 --> 00:17:00.859
that you were requested so it's it can
be relatively interactive with your

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:00.869
be relatively interactive with your
 

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:03.710
be relatively interactive with your
application we also have commands that

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720
application we also have commands that
 

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.539
application we also have commands that
allow you to get the constraint set

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:05.549
allow you to get the constraint set
 

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:07.759
allow you to get the constraint set
involve and then it's a constraint set

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:07.769
involve and then it's a constraint set
 

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:11.750
involve and then it's a constraint set
it's an API we've had since 1.0 you can

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760
it's an API we've had since 1.0 you can
 

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.360
it's an API we've had since 1.0 you can
go and change values and apply it back

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.370
go and change values and apply it back
 

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.789
go and change values and apply it back
into the system and rebuild the scene

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799
into the system and rebuild the scene
 

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:19.279
into the system and rebuild the scene
you can also actually point to a

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:19.289
you can also actually point to a
 

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:23.210
you can also actually point to a
completely new seen another XML layout

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220
completely new seen another XML layout
 

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.579
completely new seen another XML layout
file a motion scene file and it will

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:25.589
file a motion scene file and it will
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.760
file a motion scene file and it will
just naturally adapt to that new one

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:28.770
just naturally adapt to that new one
 

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.500
just naturally adapt to that new one
so there are actually a lot of little

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:30.510
so there are actually a lot of little
 

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.990
so there are actually a lot of little
api's in the in it to allow you to

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000
api's in the in it to allow you to
 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.990
api's in the in it to allow you to
control things dynamically based on your

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000
control things dynamically based on your
 

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.620
control things dynamically based on your
application so one of the other things I

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:39.630
application so one of the other things I
 

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.930
application so one of the other things I
wanted to show is that we can integrate

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940
wanted to show is that we can integrate
 

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.470
wanted to show is that we can integrate
will help us so this is flow layout as

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480
will help us so this is flow layout as
 

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.500
will help us so this is flow layout as
we just talked about and in fact all of

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:48.510
we just talked about and in fact all of
 

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.410
we just talked about and in fact all of
these views are are in it but within the

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:51.420
these views are are in it but within the
 

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.510
these views are are in it but within the
constraint set you can set the IDs of

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520
constraint set you can set the IDs of
 

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.720
constraint set you can set the IDs of
all the views that are inside the flow

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:55.730
all the views that are inside the flow
 

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.169
all the views that are inside the flow
so that you can change on the fly and it

00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179
so that you can change on the fly and it
 

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.080
so that you can change on the fly and it
will animate between the two layouts

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.090
will animate between the two layouts
 

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.330
will animate between the two layouts
dynamically so you can pop out views

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340
dynamically so you can pop out views
 

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.740
dynamically so you can pop out views
things like that so one of the other

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:09.750
things like that so one of the other
 

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.290
things like that so one of the other
things that is pretty important is touch

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.300
things that is pretty important is touch
 

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.910
things that is pretty important is touch
handling it tracks your velocity of your

an object to anchor to it it will just

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:25.610
an object to anchor to it it will just
 

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.600
an object to anchor to it it will just
be a percentage of the screen size and

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:29.610
be a percentage of the screen size and
 

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.850
be a percentage of the screen size and
you can you can change a lot of

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860
you can you can change a lot of
 

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.090
you can you can change a lot of
parameters on it about the velocity how

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100
parameters on it about the velocity how
 

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.070
parameters on it about the velocity how
you want it to terminate things like

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080
you want it to terminate things like
 

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.690
you want it to terminate things like
that there they're actually quite a few

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700
that there they're actually quite a few
 

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:44.960
that there they're actually quite a few
parameters on system there so let's talk

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:44.970
parameters on system there so let's talk
 

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.210
parameters on system there so let's talk
a little bit about the motion as and why

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220
a little bit about the motion as and why
 

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.760
a little bit about the motion as and why
we needed to do marble

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:51.770
we needed to do marble
 

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:56.600
we needed to do marble

this is something I just built a to show

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:29.429
this is something I just built a to show
 

00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:30.680
this is something I just built a to show
off what it looks like

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:30.690
off what it looks like
 

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.880
off what it looks like
what you can do and here is it an in in

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:33.890
what you can do and here is it an in in
 

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.380
what you can do and here is it an in in
crazy because I thought I'm sorry it

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:36.390
crazy because I thought I'm sorry it
 

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.609
crazy because I thought I'm sorry it
didn't because it's cute

00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:39.619
 

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:43.070
so now let's let's actually go through a

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080
so now let's let's actually go through a
 

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.200
so now let's let's actually go through a
little bit about the editor we're not

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.210
little bit about the editor we're not
 

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.799
little bit about the editor we're not
gonna release it yet we're still working

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:48.809
gonna release it yet we're still working
 

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:53.389
gonna release it yet we're still working
on it but it's my main job from now till

00:19:53.389 --> 00:19:53.399
on it but it's my main job from now till
 

00:19:53.399 --> 00:20:03.769
on it but it's my main job from now till
it releases so this is this is a copy of

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:03.779
it releases so this is this is a copy of
 

00:20:03.779 --> 00:20:06.019
it releases so this is this is a copy of
what's right now in master and we're

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:06.029
what's right now in master and we're
 

00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:10.009
what's right now in master and we're
running it so what you'll do is you'll

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:10.019
running it so what you'll do is you'll
 

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:12.799
running it so what you'll do is you'll
take a constraint layout and you'll just

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:12.809
take a constraint layout and you'll just
 

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:14.989
take a constraint layout and you'll just
right click and say converts emotionally

00:20:14.989 --> 00:20:14.999
right click and say converts emotionally
 

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:16.460
right click and say converts emotionally
out and and then this is what you'll see

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:16.470
out and and then this is what you'll see
 

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.320
out and and then this is what you'll see
you can go ahead and select a set of

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.330
you can go ahead and select a set of
 

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.899
you can go ahead and select a set of
constraints create a collection of

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:22.909
constraints create a collection of
 

00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:25.279
constraints create a collection of
constraint sets for the starting and the

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:25.289
constraint sets for the starting and the
 

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:28.789
constraint sets for the starting and the
ending and then make some changes on the

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799
ending and then make some changes on the
 

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.830
ending and then make some changes on the
ending and in this case I just shortened

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840
ending and in this case I just shortened
 

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.769
ending and in this case I just shortened
one of the values and it animates that

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:33.779
one of the values and it animates that
 

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:36.139
one of the values and it animates that
that's pretty much it you can go ahead

00:20:36.139 --> 00:20:36.149
that's pretty much it you can go ahead
 

00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:45.139
that's pretty much it you can go ahead
and change all the attributes so it's

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:45.149
and change all the attributes so it's
 

00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:49.339
and change all the attributes so it's
coming it we were working on it and I'm

00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:49.349
coming it we were working on it and I'm
 

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:53.779
coming it we were working on it and I'm
hoping as within the next few months

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:53.789
hoping as within the next few months
 

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:57.249
hoping as within the next few months
you'll sort of see versions in alpha

00:20:57.249 --> 00:20:57.259
you'll sort of see versions in alpha
 

00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:05.719
you'll sort of see versions in alpha
don't know when okay so Nicholas yeah so

00:21:05.719 --> 00:21:05.729
don't know when okay so Nicholas yeah so
 

00:21:05.729 --> 00:21:07.700
don't know when okay so Nicholas yeah so
let's talk a little bit on how you can

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:07.710
let's talk a little bit on how you can
 

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.769
let's talk a little bit on how you can
actually use motion the arts in your

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:09.779
actually use motion the arts in your
 

00:21:09.779 --> 00:21:12.169
actually use motion the arts in your
applications first of all all those

00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179
applications first of all all those
 

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:15.680
applications first of all all those
examples are on the github repository we

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:15.690
examples are on the github repository we
 

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.430
examples are on the github repository we
set up so check it out it should be very

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440
set up so check it out it should be very
 

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.440
set up so check it out it should be very
straightforward all the examples all the

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.450
straightforward all the examples all the
 

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.700
straightforward all the examples all the
xml's all the code so how do we

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:25.710
xml's all the code so how do we
 

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:27.469
xml's all the code so how do we
integrate motion layout with your with

00:21:27.469 --> 00:21:27.479
integrate motion layout with your with
 

00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:28.369
integrate motion layout with your with
your application

00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:28.379
your application
 

00:21:28.379 --> 00:21:32.539
your application
the basic thing to think of is that you

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:32.549
the basic thing to think of is that you
 

00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:35.180
the basic thing to think of is that you
don't have to reinvent to start from the

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.190
don't have to reinvent to start from the
 

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.580
don't have to reinvent to start from the
ground zero right you can you can start

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:37.590
ground zero right you can you can start
 

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.909
ground zero right you can you can start
to use motion they are today and

00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919
to use motion they are today and
 

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:43.099
to use motion they are today and
integrate it in your current UI so

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:43.109
integrate it in your current UI so
 

00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:45.769
integrate it in your current UI so
here's a couple of examples if you have

00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:45.779
here's a couple of examples if you have
 

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:47.599
here's a couple of examples if you have
a coordinate a layout and you have a

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:47.609
a coordinate a layout and you have a
 

00:21:47.609 --> 00:21:49.580
a coordinate a layout and you have a
collapsible toolbar

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:49.590
collapsible toolbar
 

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:54.270
collapsible toolbar
a the em if you want to have this kind

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.280
a the em if you want to have this kind
 

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.180
a the em if you want to have this kind
of animated toolbar it's right on it's

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:57.190
of animated toolbar it's right on it's
 

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.590
of animated toolbar it's right on it's
pretty difficult you have to do a lot of

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600
pretty difficult you have to do a lot of
 

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.710
pretty difficult you have to do a lot of
code or what you can do is simply take a

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720
code or what you can do is simply take a
 

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.810
code or what you can do is simply take a
motion layout and use it as the

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:03.820
motion layout and use it as the
 

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.180
motion layout and use it as the
collapsible toolbar and you you can see

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.190
collapsible toolbar and you you can see
 

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.160
collapsible toolbar and you you can see
on the on the github repository it's

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.170
on the on the github repository it's
 

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.070
on the on the github repository it's
really straightforward you you have just

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080
really straightforward you you have just
 

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.680
really straightforward you you have just
one little bit of code to pass over the

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.690
one little bit of code to pass over the
 

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.450
one little bit of code to pass over the
progress of the coordinate or layout and

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:15.460
progress of the coordinate or layout and
 

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.100
progress of the coordinate or layout and
motion the art is going to do the rest

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.110
motion the art is going to do the rest
 

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.610
motion the art is going to do the rest
so that's really democratize this type

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:20.620
so that's really democratize this type
 

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.550
so that's really democratize this type
of motion in a very similar way in very

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:23.560
of motion in a very similar way in very
 

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.920
of motion in a very similar way in very
similar pattern you can you know go

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:25.930
similar pattern you can you know go
 

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.010
similar pattern you can you know go
crazy we withdraw our layouts or you can

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.020
crazy we withdraw our layouts or you can
 

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.080
crazy we withdraw our layouts or you can
you know make a viewpager a little more

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.090
you know make a viewpager a little more
 

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.310
you know make a viewpager a little more
fancy but on my design skills and you

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320
fancy but on my design skills and you
 

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.690
fancy but on my design skills and you
can use motion you know a lot of

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:36.700
can use motion you know a lot of
 

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.410
can use motion you know a lot of
different ways so what are the ways I

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:40.420
different ways so what are the ways I
 

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.220
different ways so what are the ways I
wanted to highlight today is building a

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.230
wanted to highlight today is building a
 

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.060
wanted to highlight today is building a
custom components well this actually

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.070
custom components well this actually
 

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.370
custom components well this actually
came from someone asking about can I do

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:50.380
came from someone asking about can I do
 

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.870
came from someone asking about can I do
this and it's like yeah of course you

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880
this and it's like yeah of course you
 

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.110
this and it's like yeah of course you
can

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120
can
 

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.930
can
so starting really simple let's say you

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:54.940
so starting really simple let's say you
 

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.440
so starting really simple let's say you
just wanted to have a button that had a

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.450
just wanted to have a button that had a
 

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.020
just wanted to have a button that had a
little flash to it you can build it a

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.030
little flash to it you can build it a
 

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.510
little flash to it you can build it a
button out of motion layout do the

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520
button out of motion layout do the
 

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.880
button out of motion layout do the
animation and decide how it reacts when

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:05.890
animation and decide how it reacts when
 

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.650
animation and decide how it reacts when
you click on it and when you don't click

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:07.660
you click on it and when you don't click
 

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.590
you click on it and when you don't click
on it and all these examples are in just

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600
on it and all these examples are in just
 

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.020
on it and all these examples are in just
pure XML there's no code behind this one

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.030
pure XML there's no code behind this one
 

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.970
pure XML there's no code behind this one
in terms of from a user perspective but

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:17.980
in terms of from a user perspective but
 

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.890
in terms of from a user perspective but
you can get fancy in a bunch of

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:19.900
you can get fancy in a bunch of
 

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.050
you can get fancy in a bunch of
different ways these are three different

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.060
different ways these are three different
 

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.650
different ways these are three different
examples I just built up a few of them

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:24.660
examples I just built up a few of them
 

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.340
examples I just built up a few of them
the the top one is interesting in that

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:28.350
the the top one is interesting in that
 

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.890
the the top one is interesting in that
what's happening there is there are five

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:31.900
what's happening there is there are five
 

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.560
what's happening there is there are five
different states it can be in I have

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:34.570
different states it can be in I have
 

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.660
different states it can be in I have
different constraint sets and and we

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:36.670
different constraint sets and and we
 

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:39.210
different constraint sets and and we
have ways to make it very easy to to

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:39.220
have ways to make it very easy to to
 

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.340
have ways to make it very easy to to
build a derived constraint set from

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.350
build a derived constraint set from
 

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.960
build a derived constraint set from
another constraint set so you can derive

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:42.970
another constraint set so you can derive
 

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.410
another constraint set so you can derive
and arrive and derive and and what

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:46.420
and arrive and derive and and what
 

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.030
and arrive and derive and and what
you're seeing here is that the swipe

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.040
you're seeing here is that the swipe
 

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.000
you're seeing here is that the swipe
handling is going across all of the

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.010
handling is going across all of the
 

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.150
handling is going across all of the
constraint sets because there's a swipe

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:54.160
constraint sets because there's a swipe
 

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.040
constraint sets because there's a swipe
that moves you from one to the next to

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.050
that moves you from one to the next to
 

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.370
that moves you from one to the next to
the next and it all happens smoothly the

00:23:59.370 --> 00:23:59.380
the next and it all happens smoothly the
 

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.790
the next and it all happens smoothly the
second one is simply a swipe left right

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:02.800
second one is simply a swipe left right
 

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.010
second one is simply a swipe left right
I added a key cycle to make it look like

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.020
I added a key cycle to make it look like
 

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.920
I added a key cycle to make it look like
the object is rotating and the third one

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:07.930
the object is rotating and the third one
 

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:11.130
the object is rotating and the third one
is adding some cycles to give you that

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.140
is adding some cycles to give you that
 

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.420
is adding some cycles to give you that
bouncy effect I assume you've seen

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:15.430
bouncy effect I assume you've seen
 

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.730
bouncy effect I assume you've seen
something like that if you have liked

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:17.740
something like that if you have liked
 

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:24.360
something like that if you have liked
anything in the past so the the I show

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:24.370
anything in the past so the the I show
 

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.190
anything in the past so the the I show
you a little bit of multi-state I wanted

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200
you a little bit of multi-state I wanted
 

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.680
you a little bit of multi-state I wanted
to kind of highlight that notice there

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:28.690
to kind of highlight that notice there
 

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.440
to kind of highlight that notice there
there four states here five states here

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.450
there four states here five states here
 

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.990
there four states here five states here
the one in the center and I'm swiping

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000
the one in the center and I'm swiping
 

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.240
the one in the center and I'm swiping
across them I'm clicking on buttons

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:36.250
across them I'm clicking on buttons
 

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.930
across them I'm clicking on buttons
which transfer them so you can actually

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940
which transfer them so you can actually
 

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.230
which transfer them so you can actually
transfer between all the states and it

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240
transfer between all the states and it
 

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.360
transfer between all the states and it
all happens seamlessly and you'll see

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.370
all happens seamlessly and you'll see
 

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.740
all happens seamlessly and you'll see
that to the extreme in a later example

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:48.750
that to the extreme in a later example
 

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.900
that to the extreme in a later example
so it allows you to have many different

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:51.910
so it allows you to have many different
 

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.000
so it allows you to have many different
states and do many things very flexibly

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.010
states and do many things very flexibly
 

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.150
states and do many things very flexibly
with them it's way too much to actually

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:57.160
with them it's way too much to actually
 

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.700
with them it's way too much to actually
go into all the little details that that

00:24:59.700 --> 00:24:59.710
go into all the little details that that
 

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.410
go into all the little details that that
are involved here all the different

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:01.420
are involved here all the different
 

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:08.540
are involved here all the different
possibilities but we'll we'll go into

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:08.550
possibilities but we'll we'll go into
 

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.280
possibilities but we'll we'll go into
yeah so another way that you can use

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.290
yeah so another way that you can use
 

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.890
yeah so another way that you can use
motion layout is by driving other

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:13.900
motion layout is by driving other
 

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.330
motion layout is by driving other
components like what we've seen so far

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:15.340
components like what we've seen so far
 

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.340
components like what we've seen so far
is essentially taking motion layout and

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:17.350
is essentially taking motion layout and
 

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.820
is essentially taking motion layout and
animating stuff inside it but kind of

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:20.830
animating stuff inside it but kind of
 

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.920
animating stuff inside it but kind of
like terminal widgets right but you can

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:22.930
like terminal widgets right but you can
 

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.540
like terminal widgets right but you can
also think about motion layout as

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:24.550
also think about motion layout as
 

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.790
also think about motion layout as
something to do what coordinator

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:26.800
something to do what coordinator
 

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.560
something to do what coordinator
laureate would do and here in that

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:28.570
laureate would do and here in that
 

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.780
laureate would do and here in that
example motion node is actually handling

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:30.790
example motion node is actually handling
 

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.630
example motion node is actually handling
the scoring of the image but driving

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640
the scoring of the image but driving
 

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.780
the scoring of the image but driving
this custom view that's going to you

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:36.790
this custom view that's going to you
 

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.900
this custom view that's going to you
know get this this line being going into

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:39.910
know get this this line being going into
 

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.590
know get this this line being going into
a circle like that so you can easily

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600
a circle like that so you can easily
 

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.450
a circle like that so you can easily
drive your own custom views that would

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:45.460
drive your own custom views that would
 

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.100
drive your own custom views that would
have a specific type of animation and

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.110
have a specific type of animation and
 

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.310
have a specific type of animation and
having motion that acts as you know

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320
having motion that acts as you know
 

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.150
having motion that acts as you know
scene coordinator in a similar way you

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:54.160
scene coordinator in a similar way you
 

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.060
scene coordinator in a similar way you
can take a motion layout and put it into

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.070
can take a motion layout and put it into
 

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.370
can take a motion layout and put it into
another motion layer so which with you

00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.380
another motion layer so which with you
 

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.230
another motion layer so which with you
know we've seen this at the same example

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240
know we've seen this at the same example
 

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.150
know we've seen this at the same example
essentially we've coordinate a layout

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:03.160
essentially we've coordinate a layout
 

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.820
essentially we've coordinate a layout
but that example actually does the same

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:05.830
but that example actually does the same
 

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.980
but that example actually does the same
behavior purely in motion layout and how

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:10.990
behavior purely in motion layout and how
 

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.410
behavior purely in motion layout and how
it works is very basic you have one

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:13.420
it works is very basic you have one
 

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.779
it works is very basic you have one
motion layout the outer one level

00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:15.789

containing a motion layout for the

00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:23.019
containing a motion layout for the
 

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:25.440
containing a motion layout for the
collapsible bar and we set the progress

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:25.450
collapsible bar and we set the progress
 

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.869
collapsible bar and we set the progress
of that circle motion layout from the

00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:27.879
of that circle motion layout from the
 

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:31.590
of that circle motion layout from the
first one and the key here is not so

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600

much like we are about to replicate

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159
much like we are about to replicate
 

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:34.950
much like we are about to replicate
coordinates well they are the key is

handy when you can do that because it's

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:04.779
handy when you can do that because it's
 

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:06.899
handy when you can do that because it's
a lot easier to change there's a lot

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:06.909
a lot easier to change there's a lot

let's see what we can integrate

00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:19.619
let's see what we can integrate

let's see what we can integrate
recyclerview with motion layout or take

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.330
recyclerview with motion layout or take
 

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.789
recyclerview with motion layout or take
advantage of motion layout in

advantage of motion layout in
 

00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:27.779
advantage of motion layout in
recyclerview so I've got my screen with

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:27.789
recyclerview so I've got my screen with
 

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:32.039
recyclerview so I've got my screen with
a basic recycler view and I'd like to be

00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:32.049
a basic recycler view and I'd like to be
 

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:34.049
a basic recycler view and I'd like to be
able to have this kind of motion I take

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:34.059
able to have this kind of motion I take
 

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:36.060
able to have this kind of motion I take
my element and just make it fullscreen

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.070
my element and just make it fullscreen
 

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.159
my element and just make it fullscreen
right so we can t find that absolutely

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:40.169
right so we can t find that absolutely
 

00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:43.560
right so we can t find that absolutely
trivially in motion layout and I define

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:43.570
trivially in motion layout and I define
 

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.259
trivially in motion layout and I define
the two states very easy of course the

00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:46.269
the two states very easy of course the
 

00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:49.080
the two states very easy of course the
issue is that the position of that

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.090
issue is that the position of that
 

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.450
issue is that the position of that
element that I'm animating changes all

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:51.460

the transition listener you can

00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559
the transition listener you can
 

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:01.499
the transition listener you can
basically hook that get the crown

00:28:01.499 --> 00:28:01.509
basically hook that get the crown
 

00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:04.549

can use motion layout to animate that

00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:15.759

the advantage of being declarative like
that it gives you a lot more power a lot

that it gives you a lot more power a lot
more flexible way of tweaking your

more flexible way of tweaking your
 

00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:43.619
more flexible way of tweaking your
design and you don't have to look at

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:43.629
design and you don't have to look at
 

00:29:43.629 --> 00:29:46.740

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.360
your code it's completely iterated we
can go even crazier let's say that I'm

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.370
can go even crazier let's say that I'm
 

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.519
can go even crazier let's say that I'm
adding rotation here because why not and

adding rotation here because why not and
 

00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:53.389
adding rotation here because why not and
then you can you can get this kind of

00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399
then you can you can get this kind of
 

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:58.110
then you can you can get this kind of
sorry this kind of effect where you know

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120
sorry this kind of effect where you know
 

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.930
sorry this kind of effect where you know
it's really I'm not a good designer

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:00.940
it's really I'm not a good designer
 

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.450
it's really I'm not a good designer
right bear with me but you get the idea

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:03.460
right bear with me but you get the idea
 

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.519
right bear with me but you get the idea
you have all the features and

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:05.529
you have all the features and
 

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:08.009
you have all the features and
capabilities of motion layouts at your

00:30:08.009 --> 00:30:08.019
capabilities of motion layouts at your
 

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:12.749
capabilities of motion layouts at your
fingertips and just go with it so that

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:12.759
fingertips and just go with it so that
 

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:15.330
fingertips and just go with it so that
example was interesting but there is a

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:15.340
example was interesting but there is a
 

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.320
example was interesting but there is a
patent as very common in in UI with with

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.330
patent as very common in in UI with with
 

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.680
patent as very common in in UI with with
this kind of infinite list and for that

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:22.690
this kind of infinite list and for that
 

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.090
this kind of infinite list and for that
pattern we we have an interesting

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.100
pattern we we have an interesting
 

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.389
pattern we we have an interesting
solution so when we have a carousel like

00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399
solution so when we have a carousel like
 

00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:30.029
solution so when we have a carousel like
that you actually know exactly how many

00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039
that you actually know exactly how many
 

00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:32.129
that you actually know exactly how many
elements you have on screen typically

00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:32.139
elements you have on screen typically
 

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:35.369
elements you have on screen typically
you have one and you may have one one

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:35.379
you have one and you may have one one
 

00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:36.720
you have one and you may have one one
element that comes in when any man that

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:36.730
element that comes in when any man that
 

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.730
element that comes in when any man that
comes out but essentially the number of

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:38.740
comes out but essentially the number of
 

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.580
comes out but essentially the number of
demands that

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:39.590
demands that
 

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.190
demands that
you're playing with is limited and more

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200
you're playing with is limited and more
 

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.980
you're playing with is limited and more
importantly you know about them

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:43.990
importantly you know about them
 

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.510
importantly you know about them
recyclerview does that of course but

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:46.520
recyclerview does that of course but
 

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.730
recyclerview does that of course but
does a lot more recyclerview is going to

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:48.740
does a lot more recyclerview is going to
 

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.860
does a lot more recyclerview is going to
compute how many elements you need it's

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:50.870
compute how many elements you need it's
 

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.650
compute how many elements you need it's
going to lay them out etc etc so I'm not

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:53.660
going to lay them out etc etc so I'm not
 

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.050
going to lay them out etc etc so I'm not
saying don't use recyclerview but if you

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.060
saying don't use recyclerview but if you
 

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.390
saying don't use recyclerview but if you
have this type of pattern we could do

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:58.400
have this type of pattern we could do
 

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.890
have this type of pattern we could do
something a little more interesting

00:30:59.890 --> 00:30:59.900
something a little more interesting
 

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.770
something a little more interesting
purely in motion layouts so let's do

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:02.780
purely in motion layouts so let's do
 

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.130
purely in motion layouts so let's do
that if that's my you know starting

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.140
that if that's my you know starting
 

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.610
that if that's my you know starting
position I may want to go you know swipe

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:09.620
position I may want to go you know swipe
 

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.090
position I may want to go you know swipe
on on the right or a swipe on the left

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:12.100
on on the right or a swipe on the left
 

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.190
on on the right or a swipe on the left
and essentially I can translate that as

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200
and essentially I can translate that as
 

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.280
and essentially I can translate that as
different state in motion layouts I have

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:18.290
different state in motion layouts I have
 

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.950
different state in motion layouts I have
a start state next state previous States

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960
a start state next state previous States
 

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.890
a start state next state previous States
motion yet supports multi states and we

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:23.900
motion yet supports multi states and we
 

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.890
motion yet supports multi states and we
can take advantage of that so what do we

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:26.900
can take advantage of that so what do we
 

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.610
can take advantage of that so what do we
do with this the trick here is this

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:30.620
do with this the trick here is this
 

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.730
do with this the trick here is this
little bit of code and specifically that

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:33.740
little bit of code and specifically that
 

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.670
little bit of code and specifically that
stuff when I reach the state next what

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:36.680
stuff when I reach the state next what
 

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.300
stuff when I reach the state next what
I'm doing I reset the progress to zero

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.310
I'm doing I reset the progress to zero
 

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.160
I'm doing I reset the progress to zero
to the start state and I'm updating my

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.170
to the start state and I'm updating my
 

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.920
to the start state and I'm updating my
images so we were visually this is what

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:44.930
images so we were visually this is what
 

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.410
images so we were visually this is what
it looks like we get that we go to the

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:47.420
it looks like we get that we go to the
 

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.890
it looks like we get that we go to the
next state and then moving back the

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:50.900
next state and then moving back the
 

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.090
next state and then moving back the
progress to zero and updating my images

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:54.100
progress to zero and updating my images
 

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.880
progress to zero and updating my images
so that's what happens internally what

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:57.890
so that's what happens internally what
 

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.700
so that's what happens internally what
you see as the user is a little more

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:00.710
you see as the user is a little more
 

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.220
you see as the user is a little more
seamless you have this you swipe and

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:05.230
seamless you have this you swipe and
 

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.510
seamless you have this you swipe and
essentially it looks like the element

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:07.520
essentially it looks like the element
 

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.450
essentially it looks like the element
gets added back to the to the new cue so

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:10.460
gets added back to the to the new cue so
 

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.340
gets added back to the to the new cue so
it's a little bit of magic but it works

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:12.350
it's a little bit of magic but it works
 

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.970
it's a little bit of magic but it works
really well and here's a quick example I

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:15.980
really well and here's a quick example I
 

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.570
really well and here's a quick example I
have something that looks very much like

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:18.580
have something that looks very much like
 

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.570
have something that looks very much like
up sorry like a recycler view you notice

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:22.580
up sorry like a recycler view you notice
 

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.030
up sorry like a recycler view you notice
a couple of decorators playing in the

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.040
a couple of decorators playing in the
 

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.950
a couple of decorators playing in the
background and you notice that I can

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960
background and you notice that I can
 

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.200
background and you notice that I can
just scroll like that but you got motion

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.210
just scroll like that but you got motion
 

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.880
just scroll like that but you got motion
layout so you can go crazy on the

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:30.890
layout so you can go crazy on the
 

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.310
layout so you can go crazy on the
transformation you can go and add many

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320
transformation you can go and add many
 

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.650
transformation you can go and add many
more States to it

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:35.660
more States to it
 

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.090
more States to it
here is a quick other example where I'm

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.100
here is a quick other example where I'm
 

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.360
here is a quick other example where I'm
sorry where it does the same same type

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:43.370
sorry where it does the same same type
 

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.030
sorry where it does the same same type
of idea but just in a different pattern

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:46.040
of idea but just in a different pattern
 

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.360
of idea but just in a different pattern
so really did what I'm trying to say

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.370
so really did what I'm trying to say
 

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:52.670
so really did what I'm trying to say
here is that you can go much beyond

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:52.680
here is that you can go much beyond
 

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.160
here is that you can go much beyond
what we as the android framework defined

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.170
what we as the android framework defined
 

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:55.700
what we as the android framework defined
for you

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:55.710
for you
 

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.040
for you
motion layout is really a toolbox for

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.050
motion layout is really a toolbox for
 

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.560
motion layout is really a toolbox for
you to experiment and you know come up

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.570
you to experiment and you know come up
 

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:05.240
you to experiment and you know come up
with something new so to wrap up this

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.250
with something new so to wrap up this
 

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.799
with something new so to wrap up this
presentation first there is a lot of

recommend you to check out the github
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.940
recommend you to check out the github
repository because tons of examples and

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:25.950
repository because tons of examples and
 

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.770
repository because tons of examples and
you know I don't know about you but as a

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:27.780
you know I don't know about you but as a
 

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.480
you know I don't know about you but as a
programmer I love seeing examples and

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:29.490
programmer I love seeing examples and
 

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.860
programmer I love seeing examples and
kind of riff off of that and essentially

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:33.870
kind of riff off of that and essentially
 

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.560
kind of riff off of that and essentially
the the motion layouts as part of

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:36.570
the the motion layouts as part of
 

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.600
the the motion layouts as part of
constantly out - we are pretty happy

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:38.610
constantly out - we are pretty happy
 

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.040
constantly out - we are pretty happy
with where it stands in terms of the

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:40.050
with where it stands in terms of the
 

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.669
with where it stands in terms of the
features which is why we reach beta 1 so

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679
features which is why we reach beta 1 so
 

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:47.150
features which is why we reach beta 1 so
I encourage you to check out beta 1 play

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:47.160
I encourage you to check out beta 1 play
 

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.660
I encourage you to check out beta 1 play
