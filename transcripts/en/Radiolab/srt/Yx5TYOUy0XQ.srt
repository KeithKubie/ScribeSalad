1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,960
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,430
Do you want to say that today's a speed z?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,920
This is the perfect example of
what we've been bumping into.

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,340
All our humans are slow.
We're just too slow,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,820
but now you have to know
this Lena. It is all right.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,600
Now we have a story that should
make us all feel a little better.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,861
Can I just say,

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,730
I didn't even think this was remotely
possible but we're about to talk about the

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,781
heroine of our story.

10
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:32,520
Is Lena Vestigo or how is that a
hyphenate vista go is my middle name.

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,020
How is the last name and
my first name is lead.

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,020
Selena is a physicist at Harvard and she
has done something with speed that is

13
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,410
just remarkable. It's
the only way to say it.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,760
If we sort of stepped back once we asked
her to walk us through what she does

15
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,650
step by step because
it's totally worth it.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,740
We start out with a clump
of room temperature sodium
and at room temperature.

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:01:00,210
Sodium is actually a nice shiny metal.
Lina and her team, they take the sodium,

18
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,370
they put it oven and heat it
up. Exactly. And as it heats up,

19
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,790
Adam's in the sodium start to
vibrate faster and then faster, uh,

20
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,130
when the temperature gets to
around 350 degrees centigrade,

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,260
the Adams form of vapor,
super high pressure.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,300
And then she forces the Adams to this
little pinhole have a little hole in the

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:23,681
source.

24
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:28,681
So this thin stream of Adams now comes
out of a hole and we hit them head on

25
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:33,620
with a laser beam. So you bang
them right in their pathway? Yes.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,490
Kick them in a direction opposite to
their emotion and that slows them down.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,043
Excited.

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,010
And now we can load them into what we
call an optical molasses optical molester.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,260
This is so baroque. I love it. In
the obstacle. Molasses, the ams,

30
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,870
will you be hit by laser
beams from all directions?

31
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,980
Is that your way of like saying
don't go this way, don't go this way.

32
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,370
Don't go this way. Straight. Yes. You
corner them in from all angles. Yes.

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,910
Then we can get them to
where really slow down.

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,810
It feels a little bit like you've
enslaved these Adams. I feel bad for them.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,380
It's going to get worse. Yes.
Because that's not good enough.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,060
Now that she has these alums trapped,

37
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:17,150
she needs to make them
sit as still as possible.

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,720
So she turns off the laser's
told darkness in the lab

39
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,640
and then we turn on an electromagnet,

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,380
use the fact that he used the fact that
the Adam says small magnets to hold them

41
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,680
in a particular point in space
so they don't all fly apart.

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Then we can flip the magnet of this
small Adams and selectively kick out the

43
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,000
hardest. Just the hardest of them.

44
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,830
So they will fly out of the
magnet and we just keep a,

45
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,650
the lowest energy by flipping them.
You can say to the, there's one Adam,

46
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:56,020
that's a little bit too jumpy.
You say, get out of here.

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,430
Get out of here cause you, cause you
want just quietest Adams to stay.

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,080
That's right. So now after all this,
Lina has this teeny little cloud.

49
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,490
Oh 0.1 millimeter in size. Typically
just a few million atoms, like five,

50
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,690
10 million. And she says at this
point, they're all very, very still

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,520
because temperature is really
just a measure of speed really.

52
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,010
You know when Adam's are moving
quickly, we call that hot.

53
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,960
When they're moving
slowly, we call that cold.

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,750
These Adam's because they're so still,

55
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,390
these atoms are really cold,
colder than anything on earth.

56
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,000
Colder than the middle of
empty space. Basically.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,090
These are the coldest things
that have ever been cold. Yeah.

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,060
And at that point we have a
tone of new state of matter

59
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,040
[inaudible]

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,800
and of course she was curious about
this new state of matters. That's right.

61
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,020
I am a curious lady and now
we get to the part where, uh,

62
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,960
this is the whole reason
we're telling you this.

63
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,140
She now decides to poke this
Adams basically a center light,

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,750
Paulson shoot a beam of light into this
called Adam cloud and see how hard we

65
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,140
act. You know, we have a total in,
what was it like when, you know,

66
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,300
light fascinates me. I mean she says,

67
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:14,370
here's this thing that goes 671
million miles an hour, you know,

68
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,060
that nothing goes faster than light.

69
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,330
And the question just occurred to her
like what would happen if I took the

70
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:23,980
fastest thing in the universe and stuck
it into the coldest thing ever made.

71
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,840
Exactly. Yes. So she points or laser Epi,

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,690
adding the laser beam hits a
switch. So here you have this,

73
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,990
a light poles coming in,
zooming through space.

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,160
Then the front edge will reach our Adam
cloud and unbelievably the light bulbs

75
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,390
in that moment

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,550
from 186,000 miles per
second to 15 miles per hour.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,310
Are you kidding? No. So
the light is going like

78
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,483
right?

79
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,920
That's right. Wow. In
Oh Adam cloud. Amazing.

80
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,490
So,

81
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,563
and then

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,820
it just chugs along at a leisurely speed.

83
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,880
Something that you could
beat on your bicycle

84
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,020
and ride your bike faster
than the light. Exactly.

85
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,640
You can sort of think of this race
between a bicycle and the light pearls.

86
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:23,271
I mean,

87
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:27,470
imagine you could just bike next to this
blob of light and you could reach out

88
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:30,170
and maybe pad it a little bit,

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,060
then bike on a head, but
then you'd be in darkness,

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
but you can go and go maybe to the edge
of the cloud and wait for the lights.

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,380
And it's all that when it comes through,
you could just catch it. Well, no,

92
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,830
you can't catch it because when the
light gets to the other side of the item,

93
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:46,770
Cloud d,

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,020
the front edge will accelerate back
up to this enormous normal lightspeed.

95
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,640
And then it rushes off. It stretches
out again. So here, can you,

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,430
oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. So, so if you've
got it down to 15, is that a kind of,

97
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,630
uh, uh, like a, uh, a limit? I
mean, can you, can we, we could,

98
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,120
we could bring it Lloyd.
It's, it's not a stoplight.

99
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,240
Can you actually stop light? We can, yeah.

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,820
So that laser goes in and doesn't come
out. Yes. I mean, you hold it like a,

101
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,350
like a, we hold it. How do you do
that? Huh. Okay. So what we do is a,

102
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:26,210
it's actually, uh, okay, so things get
a little technical here, but basically,

103
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,350
probably too simply,

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,890
Lena has figured out a way to tweak
the properties of this Adam cloud.

105
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,300
She can make it like a brick that like
bounces off of or she can make it clear.

106
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,220
So like cruises through, in this case,

107
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,800
what she does is she shoots
the light into the Adam cloud.

108
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,030
So we slow it down and then right at
that moment, because it's chugging along,

109
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,800
Chuck Chuck Chuck at 15 miles an hour,

110
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:50,801
she tweaks the Adam cloud to make it
well thick and the light parts will say,

111
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,910
oops. Uh, it'll come to a
heart almost like it's frozen,

112
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:57,550
ah,

113
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,110
in a block of ice in this. Oh,
so just sits. Yes, it just sits.

114
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,690
Wow. When you, when, when
you realize what you done,

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,700
did you do a little a Jig or what
did you do you have? Oh, yes,

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,910
there was amazing. There is like
sitting in the lab of course,

117
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,880
in the middle of the night
and just knowing, Whoa,

118
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,050
you're the first one who has been in
this part of nature. Yeah, it was joy.

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,700
No,

120
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,070
you know, of course, to
some extent I'm an engineer,

121
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,270
but this whole idea that I can take
this light poles and bring it down to a

122
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:37,500
human scale, that's
something you just, uh,

123
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,840
at a very personal level
gets excited about.

124
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,630
This is more like, you know,
I mean, you can sort of say a,

125
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,170
you know, like, like, like,
like, uh, a sculpturer will,

126
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,710
will create a beautiful sculpture
for me, as I was thinking about this,

127
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,880
actually, think of it in terms
of painting, like Vermeer,
you know, the painter,

128
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,560
like,

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,430
he could create this illusion that light
was just suspended there on the canvas.

130
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:08,040
Just shimmering. Yeah. You
Timo captured the light,

131
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,500
but that was just an illusion.
Lena actually did it.

132
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,023
Yes.

133
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,450
Woo.

134
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,450
Do you ever, do you ever wonder,
do you ever like, you know,

135
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,110
after this night you walk out in,

136
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:26,090
into the log and imagine next day in the
sun is shining and you just look at the

137
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:29,590
light and you think, Huh, Oh,

138
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,180
I've got your number. You're like,
Zeus. No. You could resist for a moment,

139
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,480
perhaps being Scandinavian, right. Where
we love the uh, light around midsummer.

140
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,430
Yeah. You have a whole lot of it or
then a whole lot. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

141
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,530
Maybe you could do something about that.

142
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,950
Maybe you can store it
for the winter time.

143
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:54,070
You could store it up and then you could
unleash the cloud and suddenly there'd

144
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,910
be sunshine. When there other men
there was darkness. So save it.

145
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,160
Save it for the winter time. Yes. Yeah.

146
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,190
We've been doing this
for a number of years.

147
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,590
One of the more remarkable
conversations. Thank you very much.

148
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:12,150
This is wonderful. But you didn't get
through a real important, oh wait, whoa,

149
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,040
whoa, whoa. What? So, um, we
can play a trick. The twig is,

150
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,720
we can stop and extinguish the light
parts in one part of space and we vive it

151
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,400
in a totally different location. You mean
you can transport hands port it. Yeah.

152
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,120
At this point we were like,

153
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,480
what weird ass science fiction movie
did we just slip into? Lena says,

154
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,900
when the light hit those atoms
back in her cloud, they're like,

155
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,260
pulse cloud will create a
little imprint in the atoms.

156
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,640
It's like if you were to punch soft clay
with your hand and then you could see

157
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:46,890
the imprint of your
knuckles there in the clay.

158
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,400
That's what happens when
the light hits those atoms.

159
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,940
The Light Poles will change the atoms
a little bit. That's how it imprints.

160
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,330
It's inflammation in the atoms and
according to Lena, that imprint,

161
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,350
it's like a physical impression of the
light. All the information about volite,

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,160
it's frequency, energy, whatever. All
that stuff is copied in the atoms.

163
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,030
So there's shadow of light. Does that
mean it's a shadow of light? Yes.

164
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,790
And now we can put poulet imprint out.

165
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,260
So now what we have out in free
space is a perfect Matta copy.

166
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,710
You mean like physical matter? Yes.
And then we can move that around.

167
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,380
We can put it on the shelf
four, we can move it around,

168
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:25,620
we can squish it and then we can
take it all. If she wants to,

169
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,630
she can then make a few
tweaks to the cloud.

170
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,280
Then the light pulse will come back to
life propagates slowly through the cloud

171
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,730
and then excellent. Speed back up. So
you could store, I mean if you were,

172
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,290
if you were President Obama and
you said, I would like to put it,

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,780
put the light around me right now in a
time capsule for later generations to

174
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,710
experience, he could take it using your
process, put it in an archive somewhere,

175
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,890
and then putting a bottle in
thousand years later they would,

176
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:54,090
they would know the light
that surrounded him. Yes. No,

177
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,190
that's what she said.

178
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,600
How would you know that different
light is the same? How do you know? Oh,

179
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,860
that's the same light.

180
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,700
It's a contained in my medical RP
that preserves the information.

181
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,920
So when the new light turns on,

182
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,950
it identically copies the light from
before in a way that that makes it as as

183
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,990
specific as saying, that's Mary
Kay Jones again. Yes, that's right.

184
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,570
Oh Man. I've also also also wonder
about, you know, because we could,

185
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,350
in our lab in Cambridge, we could send
a light person, stop it, extinguish it,

186
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,420
make our own little medical.
We put it in a bottle.

187
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,010
I could put it in a suitcase, say bring
it to Copenhagen, turn it into light.

188
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,860
But I've thought about also,
how do I get that bottle?

189
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,590
So security in the airport,
what would it look like?

190
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:44,820
Would it just be a bottle full of a
full of emptiness? It would be a vacuum,

191
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:46,650
but there'll be a little
clump of atoms in there.

192
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,160
We'll have to be less than three ounces
of Adam's or they would have so much

193
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,500
less than three. Yeah. You could
just walk through the airport.

194
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,020
You've got no problems. Yeah.
Oh, you can open it and be like,

195
00:11:56,021 --> 00:12:01,021
you want to see some cool blind him and
then that would probably be also against

196
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:06,100
the law. Yes. How am I going to
get my light through security?
