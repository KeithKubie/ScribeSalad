00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.118
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:01.118 --> 00:00:02.856
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:04.605
You won't believe your eyes.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.801
You've heard this before right?

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.218
It's usually like a click bait title to get you to watch an internet video

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:10.555
or read a stupid article.

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:14.660
But are there cases when you actually can't believe your eyes?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.210
Make this video as large as you can on the screen that you're watching

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.856
and we're gonna do an experiment.

00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:23.707
Put your head at a set distance from the screen and look at this photo.

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:27.653
It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:32.690
I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.088
I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:38.639
your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.091
[ seagulls ]

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:50.406
OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse.

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.502
Are you ready?

00:00:51.502 --> 00:00:52.093
Here we go.

00:00:53.903 --> 00:01:00.976
Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island.

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.336
Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.738
You see that? There is no color in this picture.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:09.184
It's a black and white image.

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:12.803
Your brain just made up color that wasn't there.

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:14.328
Can you believe your eyes?

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.068
By the way, just in case you're curious

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:18.401
this is what the original image looked like.

00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:20.953
OK, so I just showed you a black and white image

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:23.608
and for some reason your brain saw something like this.

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:24.932
What is happening?

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:26.934
Is that something going on with your eye?

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.225
Or is that your brain?

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.364
For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two.

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:32.634
Let's investigate a little bit further.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.312
A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.861
and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy.

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.069
But my mind saw something way different.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.006
I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.012
Not that I didn't understand what was happening,

00:01:47.012 --> 00:01:50.795
but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist.

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.958
As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.055
was a genius.

00:01:56.055 --> 00:01:57.358
The bad news is though,

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.229
he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.042
So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.796
and uh, I don't want to say sleazy.

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:08.149
Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.090
and you wanted to meet them?

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.714
Well that's kinda what happened here.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.545
This is Greg.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:12.161
- Hello

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:14.754
- And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made?

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:15.680
Is that what we're gonna call it?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.210
- That's what we're gonna call it. The device.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.703
- Did you design this PCB?

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:19.374
- I did.

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.601
- Did you populate it?

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:21.378
- I did.

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:23.737
That's a lot of small chips on there, but..

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:24.898
- You're a geek man.

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:25.519
- Yeah I know. [laughs]

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.267
It gets easier.

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.971
- How long did it take to populate the board?

00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.362
- It takes about an hour and a half.

00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:33.764
- You did that whole thing in an hour and a half?

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:34.340
- Yeah.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.732
- Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup?

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:39.086
- [laughs]

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:39.989
- So those are LEDs right?

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.412
- Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:43.673
- That's pretty cool.

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:45.613
Now how are you controlling that?

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:49.849
- So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.722
And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins.

00:02:56.012 --> 00:03:01.285
And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.351
anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.328
- So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them

00:03:07.328 --> 00:03:08.984
through some software that you wrote?

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:13.182
- Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap,

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:16.540
and essentially I take that and there's actually an

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.094
infrared sensor on the display that can receive data.

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:21.971
- Oh look at that.

00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:23.324
Smarter Every Day.

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:24.388
Little homage.

00:03:24.388 --> 00:03:25.235
So how did you do that?

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.431
Did you upload that, or..

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:27.587
You did that today didn't you.

00:03:27.587 --> 00:03:29.627
- Yes actually I just created that image

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.191
right before driving out to meet you.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:33.193
- This is pretty amazing.

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:34.877
So ok, here's the deal.

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:37.564
I asked you about this because I wanted to do this.

00:03:37.564 --> 00:03:39.888
I wanted to use this high speed camera

00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:41.631
to look at what you've got here.

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:43.827
This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here.

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:47.708
This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup..

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.769
What's your update rate on the microcontroller?

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.388
- Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second.

00:03:55.388 --> 00:03:56.204
- Ahuh.

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:59.399
- And within those it updates 256 times.

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:04.700
So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.458
- OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:09.059
- No.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.682
- OK.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.296
Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here.

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:13.954
- Alright.

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.633
- What do we call these? Are these pixels?

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.195
Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians,

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:19.229
it's kinda like an arc..

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.841
- Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel.

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.207
- OK, so what do you call that?

00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:23.718
- An arxel.

00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:25.630
- Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.643
How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it?

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:32.028
- It's about one and a half degrees.

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:37.040
- If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.298
the whole time it's around?

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:45.224
Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark.

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:46.610
According to the high speed camera,

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.381
which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second,

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.198
this is what's actually happening.

00:04:52.198 --> 00:04:53.094
Check it out.

00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:56.655
Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them

00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:58.619
are kind of flipping around all over the place.

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:01.052
Most of the image is dead space.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.439
So why is your brain making that image?

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.067
To understand why the brain sees something that's not there

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:07.993
I found a guy that studies this sort of thing

00:05:07.993 --> 00:05:12.034
that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics.

00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:15.813
OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:19.568
who is a genius at the University of California San Diego

00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:20.636
and what do you study Dr Anstis?

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:25.240
- [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.880
which tell us about the normal processes of vision,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.330
how the eyes send information to the brain.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.371
- That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear

00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:36.157
that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:38.606
expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception.

00:05:38.606 --> 00:05:45.049
So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light.

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:46.054
Why am I seeing that?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:52.455
- It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time.

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:56.388
It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time,

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:58.946
and this will give you more light coming in,

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.055
greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:03.793
So anything moving gets blurred out.

00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:08.263
- What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:10.649
until my eye registers that the light is there?

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.001
There has to be a delay time there.

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:12.943
What is that?

00:06:12.943 --> 00:06:16.176
- That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range,

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:19.313
anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds.

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:22.158
- According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on,

00:06:22.158 --> 00:06:22.897
and let's look at it.

00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:25.360
Let's pretend that we have a flashing LED

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.035
and we want to look at the brain's response to that LED.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:30.072
First of all he said there's a delay,

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:33.305
so when the LED first comes on, our brain's not going to

00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:37.048
immediately see vision, it's gonna take some finite amount of time later.

00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:41.221
Secondly he said that the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time.

00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:42.288
Think about that.

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:46.717
If we have a moving average, that means that our vision has some sort of inertia to it.

00:06:46.717 --> 00:06:47.846
It works like this.

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:52.987
As the average comes along and is exposed to that LED flash, it starts to ramp up.

00:06:52.987 --> 00:06:56.666
As the light goes away, that moving average starts to ramp back down.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.702
As the light comes back that average starts to go up again,

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:04.879
and instead of having gaps that are complete darkness, we have this nice trough in the bottom.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:10.821
Therefore we have a persistence of vision even though there is no light to see at that point in time.

00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.577
Let's look back at that slo mo image from before with all the blinking LEDs.

00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:19.460
Now, let's add this time average of light and see what the image looks like.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.462
Check it out.

00:07:24.462 --> 00:07:25.527
How cool is that?

00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:27.663
It looks just like what our eyes see.

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.932
At what rate would you expect that I would quit seeing a uniform image

00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:36.483
but I would start to see like a tail dragging across the screen?

00:07:36.483 --> 00:07:41.357
- Well if the average time is less than one revolution then you're going to see a gap.

00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:47.931
But supposing as you say, the propellor goes around in 1/25th of a second, that's 40 milliseconds.

00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:02.877
- I get it now.

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:03.949
Do you understand?

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:04.666
Think about it.

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:07.770
Greg's wheel is rotating at 25 frames per second,

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.934
and that has to do with the moving time average of the human eye.

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.690
That's why this video is at least 25,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.459
it's actually 30 frames per second.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:18.565
If it wasn't, you would see flickering of the image.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:22.159
So what seems like an imperfection in our eye

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:27.224
is actually what smooths things out and makes the world work smoothly for us.

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.847
That's pretty awesome.

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:31.757
If the people watching this video were students in your class

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:35.727
what would you want them to know about Greg's wheel and the persistence of vision?

00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:41.355
- [laughs] Well I would say every system has got a limited time resolution

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:48.300
The eye has an engineering problem of trading time resolution against sensitivity to light.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:54.703
And in fact it's got sort of knobs inside which can change that trade-off relationship automatically.

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:56.974
The eye is in many ways much cleverer than the camera.

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:58.980
It's a beautiful piece of engineering.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.722
- Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time.

00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:02.943
- Thank you.

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:05.953
- Alright I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:09:05.953 --> 00:09:11.129
It was sponsored by lynda.com which helps pay for people like Micah who's a video editor.

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:11.831
- Hello.

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.644
- Who happens to actually have a certification from Lynda.

00:09:13.644 --> 00:09:17.911
Lynda is like a Smarter Every Day but on very technical topics.

00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.983
So in this particular case, after effects.

00:09:19.983 --> 00:09:22.700
I had no idea how to do this.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.758
So Micah came along and helped me.

00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:28.898
He actually took a bunch of classes on Lynda and we found one together right?

00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:29.419
- That's right.

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:30.160
- And what was it called?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.807
- Echo.

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:34.466
- This was the tutorial that taught me to model persistence of vision using After Effects.

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.258
But you can learn almost any topic you want.

00:09:36.258 --> 00:09:41.112
They've got Excel tutorials, Photoshop tutorials, even how to edit videos like I do with Premiere.

00:09:41.112 --> 00:09:45.601
This is not the stuff you're gonna find on YouTube, this is really high quality tutorials.

00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:46.796
They've got over 100,000 of them.

00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:48.566

Have a good one.

00:10:12.907 --> 00:10:16.726
OK is there any truth to the rumor that you actually proposed using one of these?

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:18.433
- There is some truth. [laughs]

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:21.315
As I was finishing up the project I thought to myself,

00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:25.256
Hey it'd be pretty cool if I could like write messages on here

00:10:25.256 --> 00:10:28.490
so I decided that's how I wanted to propose.
