00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.349
- After a special medicine is introduced

00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:04.346
into a petri dish full of bacteria,

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:08.200
the number of bacteria
remaining in the dish

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.856
decreases rapidly.

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:13.123
The relationship between the
elapsed time t, in seconds,

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:16.002
and the number of bacteria,
N of (t), in the petri dish

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.374
is modeled by the following
function, all right.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.006
Complete the following sentence

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.751
about the half-life of
the bacteria culture.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:27.971
The number of bacteria is
halved every blank seconds.

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:32.057
So t is being given to us in seconds,

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:34.628
so let's think about this a little bit.

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:37.410
I'll draw a little table here.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.323
I'll draw a little table here,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.153
so if we have, this is
t and this is N of (t)

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:47.150
and I'll start with a straightforward t

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.950
at time equals zero right when we start,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.155
this whole thing, if this t is zero,

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.957
then 1/2 to the zero over 5.5 power,

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:56.368
this is 1/2 to the zero,
that's all gonna be one

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:00.843
and you're just gonna be
left with 1000 bacteria

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:02.399
in the petri dish.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:05.638
Now at what point do we
get to multiply by 1/2?

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.164
At what point do we get
to say 1000 times 1/2?

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.025
Well in order to say 1000 times 1/2,

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:16.144
the exponent here has to be one,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.685
so at what time is the
exponent here going to be one?

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:21.756
Well the exponent here's going to be one,

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:23.070
this whole exponent's going to be one

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.362
when t is equal to 5.5 seconds.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.877
So t is 5.5 seconds,

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:32.797
and likewise we wait another 5.5 seconds,

00:01:32.797 --> 00:01:35.786
so if we go to 11 seconds,

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:40.910
then this is going to be 1000 times 11

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.686
divided by 5.5 is two,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:45.008
so times 1/2 to the second power,

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.102
so times 1/2, times 1/2.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.288
So every five-and-a-half seconds we will

00:01:51.288 --> 00:01:53.227
essentially have half of the bacteria

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.497
that we had five-and-a-half seconds ago.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:02:00.688
So the number of bacteria's
halved every 5.5 seconds.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.336
And you see it in the formula
or in the function definition

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:07.402
right over there but it's
nice to reason it through

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.903
and really, really digest
why it makes sense.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.329
Let's do a few more of these.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:18.953
The chemical element einsteinium-253

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:21.223
naturally loses its mass over time.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:26.081
A sample of einsteinium-253 had
an initial mass of 320 grams

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:27.632
when we measured it.

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:30.411
The relationship between
the elapsed time t, in days,

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:33.012
and the mass, M of (t) in
grams, left in the sample

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:34.910
is modeled by the following function.

00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:37.435
Complete the following sentence
about the rate of change

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:38.985
in the mass sample.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.953
The sample loses 87.5% of its mass

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.455
every blank days.

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:49.356
So this one, instead of
saying how much we grew

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.029
or shrunk by, we're
saying a percent change.

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:59.268
So if you lose 87.5%,

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:02.109
that means that you are left with,

00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:06.590
left with 12.5%.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:13.026
Which is the same thing,
is the same way of saying

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:17.410
that you have 0.125% of your mass.

00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.395
So another way of thinking about it is

00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:26.505
the sample is 0.125 of its mass,

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:28.228
of its original mass

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:29.505
or how long does it take

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:33.180
for the sample to be 0.125 of its mass?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.669
And there we could do a similar idea,

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.483
you see the 0.125 right over here

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:41.567
and so I could draw a table if you like,

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.301
although I think you might
guess where this is going.

00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:46.716
But let me draw a little table here.

00:03:47.673 --> 00:03:52.673
So, t and M of (t), when t is a zero,

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.785
M of (t) is 320

00:03:57.323 --> 00:03:59.884
and so at what time

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:05.138
is M of t going to be 320 times 0.125?

00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:07.732
Because this, going from this to this,

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:10.722
that is losing 87.5% of your mass.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:18.014
Losing 87-- so let me try this way.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:22.472
So this is minus 87.5% of the mass,

00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:26.559
you've lost 0.875 to get to 0.125.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:30.796
So this, you could just use
0.125 to the first power,

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:35.034
so what t do you have to
make this exponent equal one?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.030
Well t has to be 61.4.

00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:41.018
61.4 and where t is in days,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.734
61.4 days.

00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:46.387
Now you might be tempted to
always just pattern match,

00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:48.488
so, oh what ever's in the denominator,

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.310
but I really encourage you to think about,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.692
cause that's the whole
point of these problems.

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.190
If you just are pattern matching these,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.494
well I don't know how helpful
that's going to be for you.

00:04:55.825 --> 00:04:57.596
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:58.924
Howard started studying

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.792
how the number of branches
on his tree grows over time.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.089
The relationship between the
elapsed time t, in years,

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:06.784
since Howard studying the tree,

00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:08.467
and the number of its branches, N of (t),

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.104
is modeled by the following function.

00:05:10.104 --> 00:05:11.427
Complete the following sentence

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:13.424
about the rate of change
in the number of branches.

00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:18.424
Howard's tree gains 4/5 more branches

00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:20.410
every blank years.

00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:25.275
So gaining 4/5

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:28.944
is equivalent to multiplying,

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:35.122
multiplying by,

00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:37.467
now remember

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.417
you're gaining 4/5 of
what you already are,

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.530
you're not just gaining the number 4/5,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.545
you're getting 4/5 of
what you already are.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:46.344
So that's equivalent of multiplying

00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:51.073
by one plus 4/5, or 9/5.

00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:55.276
So gaining 4/5 is the same
thing as multiplying by 9/5.

00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.529
If I'm 5 years old and if
I gained 4/5 of my age,

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:03.673
I've gained 4 years to
get to be 9 years old,

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:06.192
which means I multiplied my age by 9/5.

00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.518
So Howard's tree, you could say,

00:06:09.518 --> 00:06:12.426
grows by a factor of 9/5
every how many years?

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:15.468
Well you can see over here
the common ratio is 9/5

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:18.283
and so you're going to grow by 9/5

00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:23.283
every time t is a multiple of 7.3.

00:06:23.878 --> 00:06:26.757
Or I guess you could say
every time t increases by 7.3

00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:31.488
then this exponent is going
to increase by a whole

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:35.470
and so you could do that as
multiplying again by 9/5.

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:40.754
So Howard's tree gains 4/5
more branches every 7.3 years.
