and then a message gets sent from my

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
and then a message gets sent from my
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.220
and then a message gets sent from my
head to where my vocal chords are found

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
head to where my vocal chords are found
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410
head to where my vocal chords are found
and they vibrate and cause the air to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
and they vibrate and cause the air to
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.530
and they vibrate and cause the air to
vibrate too then the air gets shot out

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
vibrate too then the air gets shot out
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040

vibration I've just made travels as a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
vibration I've just made travels as a
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.860
vibration I've just made travels as a
wave but if I vibrate it differently

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
wave but if I vibrate it differently
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049
wave but if I vibrate it differently
than it would cause the way to change if

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
than it would cause the way to change if
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.740

microphone pops the sound wave travels

through the air unless it hits a wall
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.690
through the air unless it hits a wall
then the higher frequencies get absorbed

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
then the higher frequencies get absorbed
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550
then the higher frequencies get absorbed
and the deeper ones pass through and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
and the deeper ones pass through and
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710
and the deeper ones pass through and
that's why when I'm behind a window I

that's why when I'm behind a window I
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.350
that's why when I'm behind a window I
found like this and if the wall is part

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
found like this and if the wall is part
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210
