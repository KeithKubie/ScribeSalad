it took images it studied the clouds it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
it took images it studied the clouds it
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.359
it took images it studied the clouds it
looked at the magnetic fields we knew

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
looked at the magnetic fields we knew
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.950
looked at the magnetic fields we knew
more about the outer solar system in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
more about the outer solar system in
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960
more about the outer solar system in
2001 then the film did a couple of other

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
2001 then the film did a couple of other
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.700
2001 then the film did a couple of other
interesting factors back then they

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
interesting factors back then they
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.219
interesting factors back then they
imagine that if a room sized computer

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
imagine that if a room sized computer
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.819
imagine that if a room sized computer
was of a given smarts then a spaceship

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
was of a given smarts then a spaceship
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.910
was of a given smarts then a spaceship
size computer would be even smarter it's

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
size computer would be even smarter it's
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.420
size computer would be even smarter it's
like what this is the two thousand

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430
like what this is the two thousand
 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.670
like what this is the two thousand
powers computers are small they're not

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
powers computers are small they're not
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830
powers computers are small they're not
large in fact they're so small you carry

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
large in fact they're so small you carry
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.870
large in fact they're so small you carry
them around with you that was

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
them around with you that was
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.639
them around with you that was
unthinkable in 2000 in 1968 unthinkable

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
unthinkable in 2000 in 1968 unthinkable
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.480
unthinkable in 2000 in 1968 unthinkable
and so I think we're doing better in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
and so I think we're doing better in
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.150
and so I think we're doing better in
some cases yeah I know we all wanted the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
some cases yeah I know we all wanted the
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.619
some cases yeah I know we all wanted the
moon base and things and maybe that'll

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
moon base and things and maybe that'll
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.720
moon base and things and maybe that'll
still come I think it ought to still

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
still come I think it ought to still
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.190
still come I think it ought to still
come but

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
come but
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.589
come but
I think we did well with our robotic

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599
I think we did well with our robotic
 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.390
I think we did well with our robotic
emissaries we had to be exploiting that

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
emissaries we had to be exploiting that
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.479
emissaries we had to be exploiting that
solar system vicariously and that's okay

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
solar system vicariously and that's okay
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.490
solar system vicariously and that's okay
we know how to do that we we all know

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
we know how to do that we we all know
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.030
we know how to do that we we all know
how to use a joystick and but I was

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
how to use a joystick and but I was
 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.020
how to use a joystick and but I was
still long to go there myself that's

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030
still long to go there myself that's
 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.320
still long to go there myself that's
still one of my goals if not for me then

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
still one of my goals if not for me then
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.000
still one of my goals if not for me then
for others in the nation or in the world
