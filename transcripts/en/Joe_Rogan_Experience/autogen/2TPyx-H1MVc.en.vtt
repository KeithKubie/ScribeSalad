00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180
as ever but his his big thing was to try
 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.110
as ever but his his big thing was to try
to figure out how you can get the mind

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120
to figure out how you can get the mind
 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.330
to figure out how you can get the mind
free of the influence of the body and

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340
free of the influence of the body and
 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.260
free of the influence of the body and
the best method he came up to was this

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270
the best method he came up to was this
 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.780
the best method he came up to was this
idea of the tank and he figured out

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790
idea of the tank and he figured out
 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.090
idea of the tank and he figured out
eventually to put salt water in it and

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100
eventually to put salt water in it and
 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.010
eventually to put salt water in it and
then if you put enough epson salt your

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
then if you put enough epson salt your
 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.660
then if you put enough epson salt your
body would float and then he could

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670
body would float and then he could
 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.060
body would float and then he could
maintain the heating temperature -

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070
maintain the heating temperature -
 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.370
maintain the heating temperature -
essentially what's the same temperature

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:14.380
essentially what's the same temperature
 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.500
essentially what's the same temperature
is the surface your skin and you

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510
is the surface your skin and you
 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.150
is the surface your skin and you
wouldn't be able to recognize where the

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160
wouldn't be able to recognize where the
 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.470
wouldn't be able to recognize where the
water was and it would give you the

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480
water was and it would give you the
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.050
water was and it would give you the
sensation of complete sensory

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060
sensation of complete sensory
 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.340
sensation of complete sensory
deprivation that and he figured this out

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.350
deprivation that and he figured this out
 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.960
deprivation that and he figured this out
and from that point on till like god I

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970
and from that point on till like god I
 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:36.390

experiences like we know about
dimethyltryptamine and we know about

00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319
dimethyltryptamine and we know about
 

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:21.410
dimethyltryptamine and we know about
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine being

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine being
 

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.480
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine being
produced by the human body so if those

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:23.490
produced by the human body so if those
 

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.889
produced by the human body so if those
are being produced by the body this

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899
are being produced by the body this
 

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:27.829
are being produced by the body this
could easily be some ancient method of

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:30.499
could easily be some ancient method of
stimulating that production of releasing

00:16:30.499 --> 00:16:30.509
stimulating that production of releasing
 

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:32.480
stimulating that production of releasing
some sort of a burst of that production

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:32.490
some sort of a burst of that production
 

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.329
some sort of a burst of that production

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.040
cosmonauts to keep them in orbit yeah I
think that they were having issues with

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.050
think that they were having issues with
 

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.740
think that they were having issues with
muscle deterioration and atrophy or

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:23.750
muscle deterioration and atrophy or
 

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.710
muscle deterioration and atrophy or
whatever so they I guess incorporated

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720
whatever so they I guess incorporated
 

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.400
whatever so they I guess incorporated
this system of vibration into the

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.410
this system of vibration into the
 

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.500
this system of vibration into the
strengthening of their muscles

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:31.510
strengthening of their muscles
 

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.600
strengthening of their muscles
apparently but I don't really know it

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:34.610
apparently but I don't really know it
 

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.010
apparently but I don't really know it
seems like well where did they take it

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.020
seems like well where did they take it
 

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.930
seems like well where did they take it
did they take it up in the ship with uh

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:37.940
did they take it up in the ship with uh
 

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.880
did they take it up in the ship with uh
yeah that's a good question stop off

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:39.890
yeah that's a good question stop off
 

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.310
yeah that's a good question stop off
somewhere at the place you don't use you

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320
somewhere at the place you don't use you
 

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.840
somewhere at the place you don't use you
would have to have gravity to use it

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:43.850
would have to have gravity to use it
 

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.790
would have to have gravity to use it
right yeah is it where's it at you know

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:45.800
right yeah is it where's it at you know
 

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.980
right yeah is it where's it at you know
certain electricity seems like a bulky

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:47.990
certain electricity seems like a bulky
 

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.390
certain electricity seems like a bulky
piece to bring up with you if you're

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400
piece to bring up with you if you're
 

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.550
piece to bring up with you if you're
limited amount of space I don't know

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:51.560
limited amount of space I don't know
 

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.370
limited amount of space I don't know
doesn't it all also seemed that you um

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:54.380
doesn't it all also seemed that you um
 

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.500
doesn't it all also seemed that you um
if you did use it up in space if it

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:56.510
if you did use it up in space if it
 

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.210
if you did use it up in space if it
wouldn't work yeah cuz it shoot you

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:58.220
wouldn't work yeah cuz it shoot you
 

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.650
wouldn't work yeah cuz it shoot you
right up maybe who knows you don't have

00:20:59.650 --> 00:20:59.660
right up maybe who knows you don't have
 

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.120
right up maybe who knows you don't have
any resistance yeah you have the

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.130
any resistance yeah you have the
 

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.680
any resistance yeah you have the
gravity's like half the thing right I

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:02.690
gravity's like half the thing right I
 

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.060
gravity's like half the thing right I
think that's the principle that it's

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.070
think that's the principle that it's
 

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.000
think that's the principle that it's
working with oh well that would work

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.010
working with oh well that would work
 

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.530
working with oh well that would work
fine you take a chamber up there to

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:08.540
fine you take a chamber up there to
 

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.790
fine you take a chamber up there to
space don't have to use as much salt

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.800
space don't have to use as much salt
 

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.410
space don't have to use as much salt
there or something I think it feels good

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:11.420
there or something I think it feels good
 

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.170
there or something I think it feels good
that's why I like it vibrating yeah I

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:14.180
that's why I like it vibrating yeah I
 

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.700
that's why I like it vibrating yeah I
don't know I don't know if it's doing

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:15.710
don't know I don't know if it's doing
 

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.950
don't know I don't know if it's doing
anything yeah I think I feel it's like a

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960
anything yeah I think I feel it's like a
 

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.930
anything yeah I think I feel it's like a
little body massage when I get on there

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:19.940
little body massage when I get on there
 

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.220
little body massage when I get on there
and for folks who don't know what it is

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.230
and for folks who don't know what it is
 

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.920
and for folks who don't know what it is
it's like some sort of a giant speaker

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:23.930
it's like some sort of a giant speaker
 

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.380
it's like some sort of a giant speaker
but it doesn't make sound it just sends

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:26.390
but it doesn't make sound it just sends
 

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.960
but it doesn't make sound it just sends
it's so weird to describe it sends like

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:28.970
it's so weird to describe it sends like
 

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.390
it's so weird to describe it sends like
sonic waves right yeah it moves you up

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400
sonic waves right yeah it moves you up
 

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.550
sonic waves right yeah it moves you up
and down it's a voice coil what you like

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:33.560
and down it's a voice coil what you like
 

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.620
and down it's a voice coil what you like
it's like a you know speaker has a voice

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:35.630
it's like a you know speaker has a voice
 

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.540
it's like a you know speaker has a voice
coil and has a cone on it then the voice

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:37.550
coil and has a cone on it then the voice
 

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.860
coil and has a cone on it then the voice
coil moves the cone up and down that

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:38.870
coil moves the cone up and down that
 

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.210
coil moves the cone up and down that
creates a sound wave if this those have

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.220
creates a sound wave if this those have
 

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.340
creates a sound wave if this those have
a cone has platform so it moves you up

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:42.350
a cone has platform so it moves you up
 

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.440
a cone has platform so it moves you up
and down a variety of frequencies so it

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:44.450
and down a variety of frequencies so it
 

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.570
and down a variety of frequencies so it
kind of runs you through a pattern and

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.580
kind of runs you through a pattern and
 

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.200
kind of runs you through a pattern and
yeah

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.210
yeah
 

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.670
yeah
then you could dial it up and say all

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:48.680
then you could dial it up and say all
 

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.870
then you could dial it up and say all
right when this is supposed to do this

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880
right when this is supposed to do this
 

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.640
right when this is supposed to do this
or that you know I thought it was gonna

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:51.650
or that you know I thought it was gonna
 

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.200
or that you know I thought it was gonna
be a big hit be a big hit you know cuz

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.210
be a big hit be a big hit you know cuz
 

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.730
be a big hit be a big hit you know cuz
it I think it has something to do that

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:54.740
it I think it has something to do that
 

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.320
it I think it has something to do that
fat ass syndrome you know are there

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.330
fat ass syndrome you know are there
 

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.910
fat ass syndrome you know are there
people they get that going on from too

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:57.920
people they get that going on from too
 

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.320
people they get that going on from too
much as a stopping off at the wrong

00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.330
much as a stopping off at the wrong
 

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.820
much as a stopping off at the wrong
places you know and they'll say I don't

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:00.830
places you know and they'll say I don't
 

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.680
places you know and they'll say I don't
know if the turbo sonic can fix that

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:02.690
know if the turbo sonic can fix that
 

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.600
know if the turbo sonic can fix that
it's hard you know it's true it's I

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.610
it's hard you know it's true it's I
 

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.670
it's hard you know it's true it's I
think they should you know eat less of

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:06.680
think they should you know eat less of
 

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.310
think they should you know eat less of
that shit and work out a little bit but

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320
that shit and work out a little bit but
 

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.500
that shit and work out a little bit but
what I do know about it is whatever it

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:11.510
what I do know about it is whatever it
 

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.330
what I do know about it is whatever it
does it feels good

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:13.340
does it feels good
 

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.279
does it feels good
you know I don't I don't know why it

00:22:15.279 --> 00:22:15.289
you know I don't I don't know why it
 

00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:17.560
you know I don't I don't know why it
feels good I'm not sure it feels like a

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:17.570
feels good I'm not sure it feels like a
 

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.389
feels good I'm not sure it feels like a
little on your getting vibrate or feel

00:22:19.389 --> 00:22:19.399
little on your getting vibrate or feel
 

00:22:19.399 --> 00:22:21.489
little on your getting vibrate or feel
like a little massage ash like oh yeah

00:22:21.489 --> 00:22:21.499
like a little massage ash like oh yeah
 

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:22.960
like a little massage ash like oh yeah
you can believe something's happening

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:22.970
you can believe something's happening
 

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.070
you can believe something's happening
you know I don't know exactly what's

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
you know I don't know exactly what's
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.840
you know I don't know exactly what's
going on but it seems to be something

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:25.850
going on but it seems to be something
 

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.090
going on but it seems to be something
the variations too it's really cool

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:28.100
the variations too it's really cool
 

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.610
the variations too it's really cool
cycle we're gonna go really fast and

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:30.620
cycle we're gonna go really fast and
 

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.039
cycle we're gonna go really fast and
really slow so it keeps you kind of

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:33.049
really slow so it keeps you kind of
 

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:34.810
really slow so it keeps you kind of
interested in it and it's supposed to by

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.820
interested in it and it's supposed to by
 

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.369
interested in it and it's supposed to by
doing that it's supposed to be

00:22:36.369 --> 00:22:36.379
doing that it's supposed to be
 

00:22:36.379 --> 00:22:39.519
doing that it's supposed to be
stimulating individual glands and get

00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:39.529
stimulating individual glands and get
 

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:41.649
stimulating individual glands and get
your flow going you know you're like you

00:22:41.649 --> 00:22:41.659
your flow going you know you're like you
 

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:43.360
your flow going you know you're like you
were saying about that working up like

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:43.370
were saying about that working up like
 

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.039
were saying about that working up like
that and you got to get your body in

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:45.049
that and you got to get your body in
 

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:47.470
that and you got to get your body in
motion you know I think people they sit

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480
motion you know I think people they sit
 

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.359
motion you know I think people they sit
too long on a chair all day long without

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:49.369
too long on a chair all day long without
 

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.529
too long on a chair all day long without
moving around I don't think it's

00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:50.539
moving around I don't think it's
 

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:51.940
moving around I don't think it's
probably not that good yeah we've talked

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:51.950
probably not that good yeah we've talked
 

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.830
probably not that good yeah we've talked
about it a million times the whole thing

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840
about it a million times the whole thing
 

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.119
about it a million times the whole thing
is just sitting in an office it's a

00:22:58.119 --> 00:22:58.129
is just sitting in an office it's a
 

00:22:58.129 --> 00:22:59.440
is just sitting in an office it's a
fucking terrible way to live your life

00:22:59.440 --> 00:22:59.450
fucking terrible way to live your life
 

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.299
fucking terrible way to live your life
it's supposed to be super bad for you as

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:01.309
it's supposed to be super bad for you as
 

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:03.460
it's supposed to be super bad for you as
I said in an office well you know this

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:03.470
I said in an office well you know this
 

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.169
I said in an office well you know this
we only do it like three hours at a pop

00:23:05.169 --> 00:23:05.179
we only do it like three hours at a pop
 

00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:07.680
we only do it like three hours at a pop
and even then I get up and I'm like I

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:07.690
and even then I get up and I'm like I
 

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.210
and even then I get up and I'm like I
have an office I sit in my office every

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:10.220
have an office I sit in my office every
 

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.560
have an office I sit in my office every
day all day long then I get out of it

used to be the same dinosaurs out in the
 

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.020
used to be the same dinosaurs out in the
middle of the ocean I don't think

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.030
middle of the ocean I don't think
 

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.910
middle of the ocean I don't think
there's any more I think they think it's

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:39.920
there's any more I think they think it's
 

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.100

rotten plankton yeah up at the top of

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.110
rotten plankton yeah up at the top of
 

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:44.530
rotten plankton yeah up at the top of
the frozen Alps and bottom of the ocean

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:44.540
the frozen Alps and bottom of the ocean
 

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.930
the frozen Alps and bottom of the ocean
and over here in the desert and

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:45.940
and over here in the desert and
 

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.650
and over here in the desert and
everywhere at one time there was

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:47.660
everywhere at one time there was
 

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.600
everywhere at one time there was
plankton all over an hour or whatever to

stuff that we're pumping out for some

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.030
stuff that we're pumping out for some
 

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.300
stuff that we're pumping out for some
reason and then you say oh look step

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:55.310
reason and then you say oh look step
 

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.040
reason and then you say oh look step
back and say but what if I'm an alien

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.050
back and say but what if I'm an alien

what are those guys doing down there

00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:58.580
what are those guys doing down there
 

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.160
what are those guys doing down there
well you know they're they're pumping

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:00.170
well you know they're they're pumping
 

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.720
well you know they're they're pumping
this stuff out of there the oil they

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:01.730
this stuff out of there the oil they
 

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.460
this stuff out of there the oil they
call it and then they turn it into a

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.470
call it and then they turn it into a
 

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.890
call it and then they turn it into a
plastic material that that litters the

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:05.900
plastic material that that litters the
 

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.120
plastic material that that litters the
planet they can't get rid of it

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.130
planet they can't get rid of it
 

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.130
planet they can't get rid of it
or they take it and then they burn it

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.140
or they take it and then they burn it
 

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.960
or they take it and then they burn it
into the atmosphere and poison

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:10.970
into the atmosphere and poison
 

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.000
into the atmosphere and poison
themselves and then and then what they

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.010
themselves and then and then what they
 

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.220
themselves and then and then what they
do they spend all their money to fight

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:15.230
do they spend all their money to fight
 

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.600
do they spend all their money to fight
amongst each other to see who gets

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:16.610
amongst each other to see who gets
 

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:18.460
amongst each other to see who gets
control of it and you think and this

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:18.470
control of it and you think and this
 

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.170
control of it and you think and this
whole stuff isn't really that necessary

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:20.180
whole stuff isn't really that necessary
 

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.940
whole stuff isn't really that necessary
could be done without back to the hemp

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:21.950
could be done without back to the hemp
 

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.500
could be done without back to the hemp
again look at that ham plate what it has

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:23.510
again look at that ham plate what it has
 

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.930
again look at that ham plate what it has
to offer to be ass bacon well it's just

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:25.940
to offer to be ass bacon well it's just
 

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.910
to offer to be ass bacon well it's just
too difficult to control you know there

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:27.920
too difficult to control you know there
 

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.990
too difficult to control you know there
was a book on the process of oil being

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000
was a book on the process of oil being
 

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.030
was a book on the process of oil being
developed that they were trying to

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:34.040
developed that they were trying to
 

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.820
developed that they were trying to
speculate somehow or another that it was

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:35.830
speculate somehow or another that it was
 

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.900
speculate somehow or another that it was
that it was developed through a natural

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:37.910
that it was developed through a natural
 

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.000
that it was developed through a natural
process in the earth and they were

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.010
process in the earth and they were
 

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.800
process in the earth and they were
saying that our ideas of it were

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:41.810
saying that our ideas of it were
 

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.630
saying that our ideas of it were
incorrect but I don't think it was

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640
incorrect but I don't think it was
 

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.120
incorrect but I don't think it was
well-received I have the book I never

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.130
well-received I have the book I never
 

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.530
well-received I have the book I never
read it I bought it and I was like I'm

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:47.540
read it I bought it and I was like I'm
 

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.910
read it I bought it and I was like I'm
gonna read that one day and I just sat

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:48.920
gonna read that one day and I just sat
 

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.920
gonna read that one day and I just sat
there I never fucking read it I just

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:50.930
there I never fucking read it I just
 

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.290
there I never fucking read it I just
couldn't get behind it it just seemed it

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:53.300
couldn't get behind it it just seemed it
 

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.760
couldn't get behind it it just seemed it
seemed kind of goofy that anybody

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:54.770
seemed kind of goofy that anybody
 

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.390
seemed kind of goofy that anybody
wouldn't have figured that out by now

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:57.400
wouldn't have figured that out by now
 

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.860
wouldn't have figured that out by now
exactly are you going Wow

00:30:59.860 --> 00:30:59.870
exactly are you going Wow
 

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.290
exactly are you going Wow
that thing about the planets to know

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:02.300
that thing about the planets to know
 

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.460
that thing about the planets to know
they're supposed to be circle eyes in

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:03.470
they're supposed to be circle eyes in
 

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.320
they're supposed to be circle eyes in
the earth what the Sun let's say the Sun

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.330
the earth what the Sun let's say the Sun
 

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.810
the earth what the Sun let's say the Sun
is moving right it's going this way so

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:07.820
is moving right it's going this way so
 

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.770
is moving right it's going this way so
now the others believe although the

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:08.780
now the others believe although the
 

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.390
now the others believe although the
planets are circling the Sun is it I

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:10.400
planets are circling the Sun is it I
 

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.520
planets are circling the Sun is it I
think that this makes more sense to me

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:12.530
think that this makes more sense to me
 

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.380
think that this makes more sense to me
and there's other you know this isn't my

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:14.390
and there's other you know this isn't my
 

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.820
and there's other you know this isn't my
thought but somebody showed date that

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:15.830
thought but somebody showed date that
 

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.680
thought but somebody showed date that
you know oh yeah that means say this Sun

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:17.690
you know oh yeah that means say this Sun
 

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.720
you know oh yeah that means say this Sun
is going this way well what makes us

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:19.730
is going this way well what makes us
 

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:21.400
is going this way well what makes us
think we're not in rotation in a vortex

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.410
think we're not in rotation in a vortex
 

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.440
think we're not in rotation in a vortex
being pulled by the Sun going somewhere

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.450
being pulled by the Sun going somewhere
 

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.540
being pulled by the Sun going somewhere
and I think we're we're on a trip man

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:25.550
and I think we're we're on a trip man
 

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.100
and I think we're we're on a trip man
we're going somewhere started off where

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.110
we're going somewhere started off where
 

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.500
we're going somewhere started off where
where was the Sun 100 years ago where's

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:29.510
where was the Sun 100 years ago where's
 

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.210
where was the Sun 100 years ago where's
it at now and then where we gonna be

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:31.220
it at now and then where we gonna be
 

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.010
it at now and then where we gonna be
later I believe the Sun is pulling us

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.020
later I believe the Sun is pulling us
 

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.350
later I believe the Sun is pulling us
through space and we're in well that's

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360
through space and we're in well that's
 

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.960
through space and we're in well that's
not a belief that's a fact that's that's

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:37.970
not a belief that's a fact that's that's
 

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.340
not a belief that's a fact that's that's
absolutely what's happening the whole

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:39.350
absolutely what's happening the whole
 

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.680
absolutely what's happening the whole
galaxies are moving ya know this is

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:41.690
galaxies are moving ya know this is
 

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.380
galaxies are moving ya know this is
something that astrophysicists have

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.390
something that astrophysicists have
 

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.090
something that astrophysicists have
figured out a while ago so the whole

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.100
figured out a while ago so the whole
 

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.220
figured out a while ago so the whole
universe is kind of moving that's that

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.230
universe is kind of moving that's that
 

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.320
universe is kind of moving that's that
expansion thing I don't know I think

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:50.330
expansion thing I don't know I think
 

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.720
expansion thing I don't know I think
we're going are galaxies moving I think

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:52.730
we're going are galaxies moving I think
 

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.460
we're going are galaxies moving I think
we're going in a direction somewhere I

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:54.470
we're going in a direction somewhere I
 

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.050
we're going in a direction somewhere I
think that if we figured out worth the

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.060
think that if we figured out worth the
 

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.380
think that if we figured out worth the
Sun and where is it off - I think we're

00:31:59.380 --> 00:31:59.390
Sun and where is it off - I think we're
 

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.000
Sun and where is it off - I think we're
behind it I think that we're following

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.010
behind it I think that we're following
 

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.340
behind it I think that we're following
it in this is the way the rotation I

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:03.350
it in this is the way the rotation I
 

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.780
it in this is the way the rotation I
don't know which way is up or down in

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:04.790
don't know which way is up or down in
 

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.850
don't know which way is up or down in
here where's the north thing that is

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:06.860
here where's the north thing that is
 

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.470
here where's the north thing that is
exactly how it's supposed to be

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480
exactly how it's supposed to be
 

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.900
exactly how it's supposed to be
described I think as it goes you know

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:10.910
described I think as it goes you know
 

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.850
described I think as it goes you know
we're circling around it I think we're

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:12.860
we're circling around it I think we're
 

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.570
we're circling around it I think we're
going around this way I don't know I

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:15.580
going around this way I don't know I
 

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.980
going around this way I don't know I
don't know I don't understand it at all

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:17.990
don't know I don't understand it at all
 

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.610
don't know I don't understand it at all
I mean when I watched those scientific

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:20.620
I mean when I watched those scientific
 

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.870
I mean when I watched those scientific
documentaries on space it's one of the

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880
documentaries on space it's one of the
 

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.090

by it didn't just stay on because it was

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480
by it didn't just stay on because it was
 

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.990
by it didn't just stay on because it was
the batteries were dog shit back then

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000
the batteries were dog shit back then
 

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.090
the batteries were dog shit back then
you know if it was gonna stay on it

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:45.100
you know if it was gonna stay on it
 

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.900

would had to be like a foot yeah yeah I

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:48.910
would had to be like a foot yeah yeah I
 

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.060
would had to be like a foot yeah yeah I
mean these batteries were just dog shit

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.070
mean these batteries were just dog shit
 

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.980
mean these batteries were just dog shit
but ever thought about that yeah I mean

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:52.990
but ever thought about that yeah I mean
 

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.440
but ever thought about that yeah I mean
those were it's remember the calculator

but that's a your phone is kind of a
 

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.400
but that's a your phone is kind of a
computer that's a one device choice yeah

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:11.410
computer that's a one device choice yeah
 

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.200
computer that's a one device choice yeah
um you better off with a compass what if

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:13.210
um you better off with a compass what if
 

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.700
um you better off with a compass what if
you get lost all you guys a fucking time

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:14.710
you get lost all you guys a fucking time
 

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:20.820
you get lost all you guys a fucking time
yeah you have something that makes them

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:20.830
yeah you have something that makes them
 

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.980
yeah you have something that makes them
fire yeah why do you got a fucking

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:22.990
fire yeah why do you got a fucking
 

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.170
fire yeah why do you got a fucking
calculator with not that as our first

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:25.180
calculator with not that as our first
 

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.690
calculator with not that as our first
development here and that's also the

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:27.700
development here and that's also the
 

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.160
development here and that's also the
calculator watch was invented with

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:29.170
calculator watch was invented with
 

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.750
calculator watch was invented with
calculators we're only like that big

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760
calculators we're only like that big
 

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.750
calculators we're only like that big
like I mean what the fuck you doing how

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760
like I mean what the fuck you doing how
 

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.330
like I mean what the fuck you doing how
often is that coming up except this is

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:36.340
often is that coming up except this is
 

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.440
often is that coming up except this is
the one thing that I know people are

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:37.450
the one thing that I know people are
 

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.300
the one thing that I know people are
probably yelling at me right now except

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:39.310
probably yelling at me right now except
 

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.280
probably yelling at me right now except
people cheating in school I bet there

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:41.290
people cheating in school I bet there
 

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.290
people cheating in school I bet there
was a window I bet there was a small

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:43.300
was a window I bet there was a small
 

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.810
was a window I bet there was a small
window where teachers are still fucking

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:45.820
window where teachers are still fucking
 

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.030
window where teachers are still fucking
old people who were there they're out of

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040
old people who were there they're out of
 

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.160
old people who were there they're out of
touch with modern technology in a lot of

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.170
touch with modern technology in a lot of
 

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.810
touch with modern technology in a lot of
ways so there's probably a window where

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:51.820
ways so there's probably a window where
 

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.400
ways so there's probably a window where
these young little rascals went in there

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:53.410
these young little rascals went in there
 

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.080
these young little rascals went in there
with their technological wizard phones

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.090
with their technological wizard phones
 

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.700

it gives me a better sense of what time
 

00:53:18.489 --> 00:53:20.880
it gives me a better sense of what time
is then when I look at a number when I

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:20.890
is then when I look at a number when I
 

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.009
is then when I look at a number when I
look at numbers and it's totally

00:53:23.009 --> 00:53:23.019
look at numbers and it's totally
 

00:53:23.019 --> 00:53:24.059
look at numbers and it's totally
illogical but I

00:53:24.059 --> 00:53:24.069
illogical but I
 

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:25.949
illogical but I
look at this number on my computer the

00:53:25.949 --> 00:53:25.959
look at this number on my computer the
 

00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:27.599
look at this number on my computer the
upper left-hand upper right-hand corner

00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:27.609
upper left-hand upper right-hand corner
 

00:53:27.609 --> 00:53:29.039
upper left-hand upper right-hand corner
my computer and then I look at that

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:29.049
my computer and then I look at that
 

00:53:29.049 --> 00:53:30.479
my computer and then I look at that
that's more pleasurable to me for

00:53:30.479 --> 00:53:30.489
that's more pleasurable to me for
 

00:53:30.489 --> 00:53:31.609
that's more pleasurable to me for
whatever reason

00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619
whatever reason
 

00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:35.309
whatever reason
that's an interesting evaluation I think

00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319
that's an interesting evaluation I think
 

00:53:35.319 --> 00:53:36.989
that's an interesting evaluation I think
I have a more natural sense of we

00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:36.999
I have a more natural sense of we
 

00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:38.819
I have a more natural sense of we
haven't had a log thing yeah you know

00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:38.829
haven't had a log thing yeah you know

out kinda then they what they would do

00:53:49.799 --> 00:53:49.809
out kinda then they what they would do
 

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:52.049
out kinda then they what they would do
is they'll go digital analog digital and

00:53:52.049 --> 00:53:52.059
is they'll go digital analog digital and
 

00:53:52.059 --> 00:53:54.719
is they'll go digital analog digital and
then back to analog yeah try to mix this

00:53:54.719 --> 00:53:54.729
then back to analog yeah try to mix this
 

00:53:54.729 --> 00:53:56.849
then back to analog yeah try to mix this

from situations like this I think with

01:34:27.690 --> 01:34:27.700
from situations like this I think with
 

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.270
from situations like this I think with
in the 1960s in the death of Kennedy and

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280
in the 1960s in the death of Kennedy and

for then and for those times I think
 

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.270
for then and for those times I think
that ultimately that kind of stuff is

01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280
that ultimately that kind of stuff is
 

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.920
that ultimately that kind of stuff is

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.859
in the 1940s go back and look at the the
1940s and the distance between them and

01:37:10.859 --> 01:37:10.869
1940s and the distance between them and
 

01:37:10.869 --> 01:37:12.930
1940s and the distance between them and
the same amount of time and you're in

01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:12.940
the same amount of time and you're in
 

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:16.109
the same amount of time and you're in
the 1800s okay you're in the like the

01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119
the 1800s okay you're in the like the
 

01:37:16.119 --> 01:37:17.819
the 1800s okay you're in the like the
times where he were riding horses and

01:37:17.819 --> 01:37:17.829
times where he were riding horses and
 

01:37:17.829 --> 01:37:20.100
times where he were riding horses and
they had to paint their pictures that's

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:20.110
they had to paint their pictures that's
 

01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:22.620
they had to paint their pictures that's
that's how much distance has traveled I

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:22.630
that's how much distance has traveled I
 

01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:23.790
that's how much distance has traveled I
mean we really

01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800
mean we really
 

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.190
mean we really
if you go back to 1940 and you look at

01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:26.200
if you go back to 1940 and you look at
 

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.960
if you go back to 1940 and you look at
those guys that are running the space

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:27.970
those guys that are running the space
 

01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:29.550
those guys that are running the space
program or look those guys are involved

01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560
program or look those guys are involved
 

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.350
program or look those guys are involved
a nuclear program well how old were they

01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360
a nuclear program well how old were they
 

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.150
a nuclear program well how old were they
in their 40s let's say they're in their

01:37:33.150 --> 01:37:33.160
in their 40s let's say they're in their
 

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.670
in their 40s let's say they're in their
40s let's say that they were born in the

01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:35.680
40s let's say that they were born in the
 

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:39.060
40s let's say that they were born in the
year 1900 and they were designing and

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:39.070
year 1900 and they were designing and
 

01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:40.710
year 1900 and they were designing and
working on all these these crazy

01:37:40.710 --> 01:37:40.720
working on all these these crazy
 

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:42.330
working on all these these crazy
technological innovations from the time

01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:42.340
technological innovations from the time
 

01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:46.230
technological innovations from the time

that there 1940 like world to us like

01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480
that there 1940 like world to us like
 

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:09.630
that there 1940 like world to us like
when we consider the 1940 world is the

01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:09.640
when we consider the 1940 world is the
 

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.040
when we consider the 1940 world is the
early 1800s to them it's essentially two

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:14.050
early 1800s to them it's essentially two
 

01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:18.120
early 1800s to them it's essentially two
decades or two cents on the just that

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:18.130
decades or two cents on the just that
 

01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:20.940
decades or two cents on the just that
you know the the regular ratio mm-hmm

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:20.950
you know the the regular ratio mm-hmm
 

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:22.170
you know the the regular ratio mm-hmm
and you start to consider that what you

01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:22.180
and you start to consider that what you
 

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:23.850
and you start to consider that what you
know the exponential type situation oh

01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:23.860
know the exponential type situation oh
 

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:24.330
know the exponential type situation oh
yeah

01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:24.340
yeah
 

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:28.470
yeah
their growth is uh you know defied as it

01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480
their growth is uh you know defied as it
 

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.930
their growth is uh you know defied as it
goes on it continues to expand itself

01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:30.940
goes on it continues to expand itself
 

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.760
goes on it continues to expand itself
out no doubt I mean the growth and

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:32.770
out no doubt I mean the growth and
 

01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:36.390
out no doubt I mean the growth and
change between 1820 and 1940 was nothing

compared to 1940 to 2010 I mean it's

01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:39.700
compared to 1940 to 2010 I mean it's
 

01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.270
compared to 1940 to 2010 I mean it's
just this this is mad more then it look

01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280
just this this is mad more then it look
 

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.580

what's hard to believe is that we're
 

01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:27.110
what's hard to believe is that we're
still operating on that same mechanism

01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120
still operating on that same mechanism

02:24:31.350 --> 02:24:31.360
safety of being around the ocean we're
 

02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.140
safety of being around the ocean we're
basing it on the few hundred years of

02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:37.340
running out of time so let's talk about
 

02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:40.179
running out of time so let's talk about
your your tank Center and the new place

02:43:40.179 --> 02:43:40.189
your your tank Center and the new place
 

02:43:40.189 --> 02:43:41.529
your your tank Center and the new place
that you guys are doing and what's the

02:43:41.529 --> 02:43:41.539
that you guys are doing and what's the
 

02:43:41.539 --> 02:43:43.710
that you guys are doing and what's the
difference between what you're doing and

02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720
difference between what you're doing and
 

02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:46.840
difference between what you're doing and
what a lot of these commercial places

02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:46.850
what a lot of these commercial places
 

02:43:46.850 --> 02:43:50.080
what a lot of these commercial places
that are using these home tanks we have

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:50.090
that are using these home tanks we have
 

02:43:50.090 --> 02:43:51.550
that are using these home tanks we have
there's a real problem with that right

02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:51.560
there's a real problem with that right
 

02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:53.769
there's a real problem with that right
as far as like infections and far as

02:43:53.769 --> 02:43:53.779
as far as like infections and far as
 

02:43:53.779 --> 02:43:56.590
as far as like infections and far as
safety and as far as like everything

02:43:56.590 --> 02:43:56.600
safety and as far as like everything
 

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.229
safety and as far as like everything
needs to be moved to a higher standard

02:43:58.229 --> 02:43:58.239
needs to be moved to a higher standard
 

02:43:58.239 --> 02:44:01.389
needs to be moved to a higher standard
that's certainly our opinion of the

02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:01.399
that's certainly our opinion of the
 

02:44:01.399 --> 02:44:03.189
that's certainly our opinion of the
situation you know we've been working

02:44:03.189 --> 02:44:03.199
situation you know we've been working
 

02:44:03.199 --> 02:44:05.080
situation you know we've been working
with you know with NSF and the other

02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:05.090
with you know with NSF and the other
 

02:44:05.090 --> 02:44:07.960
with you know with NSF and the other
state and local authorities then to get

02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:07.970
state and local authorities then to get
 

02:44:07.970 --> 02:44:10.300
state and local authorities then to get
in tune with what's required as far as

02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:10.310
in tune with what's required as far as
 

02:44:10.310 --> 02:44:12.910
in tune with what's required as far as
rules and regulations as far as testing

02:44:12.910 --> 02:44:12.920
rules and regulations as far as testing
 

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:14.740
rules and regulations as far as testing
the water and that's that's our

02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:14.750
the water and that's that's our
 

02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:16.750
the water and that's that's our
certification we've been certified for

02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:16.760
certification we've been certified for
 

02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:18.639
certification we've been certified for
that which I have a 3 log kill what they

02:44:18.639 --> 02:44:18.649
that which I have a 3 log kill what they
 

02:44:18.649 --> 02:44:20.710
that which I have a 3 log kill what they
call which a 99.9 of all the

02:44:20.710 --> 02:44:20.720
call which a 99.9 of all the
 

02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:22.330
call which a 99.9 of all the
microorganisms that are in fact they

02:44:22.330 --> 02:44:22.340
microorganisms that are in fact they
 

02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:24.399
microorganisms that are in fact they
infect the water then they see how long

02:44:24.399 --> 02:44:24.409
infect the water then they see how long
 

02:44:24.409 --> 02:44:26.710
infect the water then they see how long
it takes to eradicate this infection and

02:44:26.710 --> 02:44:26.720
it takes to eradicate this infection and
 

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:27.670
it takes to eradicate this infection and
obviously this is a big difference

02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680
obviously this is a big difference
 

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:29.290
obviously this is a big difference
between someone who just has one that's

02:44:29.290 --> 02:44:29.300
between someone who just has one that's
 

02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:30.760
between someone who just has one that's
only for them only for their own

02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:30.770
only for them only for their own
 

02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:32.620
only for them only for their own
personal use which is like a lot of

02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:32.630
personal use which is like a lot of
 

02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:34.599
personal use which is like a lot of
these more low-end ones and someone who

02:44:34.599 --> 02:44:34.609
these more low-end ones and someone who
 

02:44:34.609 --> 02:44:36.849
these more low-end ones and someone who
is running a commercial business sort of

02:44:36.849 --> 02:44:36.859
is running a commercial business sort of
 

02:44:36.859 --> 02:44:38.170
is running a commercial business sort of
