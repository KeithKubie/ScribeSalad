00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.150
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.010
We're back here at Devoxx.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.610
And I'm here with Sam.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.170
Welcome, Sam.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.520
SAM DUTTON: Hey.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.930
Good to see you.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.971
MALE SPEAKER: And we're
here to talk about media.

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:16.830
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.060
MALE SPEAKER: In the large
grand scheme of things, media.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
Maybe before we talk about
WebRTC, which is obviously

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.050
the topic we'll get into,
let's talk about media

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.080
and what it represents
in the web today.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.947
Do you want to say
a few words about--

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:30.905
SAM DUTTON: Absolutely.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.080
MALE SPEAKER: How media is
being consumed, produced.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.640
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
it's astonishing.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.140
Yeah.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.012
So I guess what we've seen on
the web is kind of two trends.

00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:41.220
The first is sort of obvious.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.870
We have all these devices
that we're using now.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.550
More mobile phones than
pencils or toothbrushes,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.240
all that stuff.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.100
But with that has come, it's
not the same old, same old.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.260
There's a change in what
we're doing on the web.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.860
And these devices which
are kind of oriented

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.260
to consumption and
communication in some ways,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.720
have led to a change in
what we're doing on the web.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.240
And with that, we're
getting the rise and rise

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270
of media on the web.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.790
The figures I had
recently from Cisco

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.560
saying within the
next three years

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.580
or so, we'll have something like
potentially 90% of web traffic

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.840
will be video.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.130
That's TV, On Demand,
communication, and so on.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.747
But that's a huge shift in what
people are doing on the web.

00:01:26.747 --> 00:01:27.580
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.890
And that means we need
to evolve the standards.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.500
And as part of that, the
WebRTC plays a big-- I mean,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.980
that's what comes to mind.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.600
So tell us about
maybe what WebRTC is.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.620
Let's start there.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.360
And for those that
have not used it

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.440
or that don't really
know what it is.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.065
SAM DUTTON: OK.

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:47.370
So WebRTC is a way to do
real-time communication

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.450
in the browser on the web.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.160
And it's really well supported
now on Chrome, and desktop

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.770
for Android, Firefox, and
desktop, and Android and so on.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.010
And what it means is that
plug-in-free, royalty-free,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.820
open-source software, you
can build that into your web

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.170
apps to do the
obvious use cases,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.910
stuff like video chat
right in your web app.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.030
You can run a telephone
system in your web apps.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.830
You can put a
telephone in a web app,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.154
just with a few
lines of JavaScript.

00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:19.070
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
talking about replacing

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.690
existing, potentially
expensive software that's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.750
been running this
type of use cases

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.085
for the longest time with free,
open-source, open standards.

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:31.460
SAM DUTTON: And
the cool thing is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.250
that WebRTC is designed
to work peer-to-peer.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.680
So the existing
frameworks, we've

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.760
always involved a kind
of centralized model

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.850
where you're running
someone else's services,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.550
but essentially
the core of WebRTC

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.180
is communication
happens directly

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.330
between the peers, which
is much more efficient.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.205
MALE SPEAKER: Once
connection is established,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.990
do you never need any central--

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.930
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.159
Now of course, to do
this, there's no way,

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.450
at this point in time, to
just shout into the internet,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.220
connect me to my friends.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.980
You can't do that.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.650
So you do need to negotiate the
connection, otherwise called

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.260
signaling.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.680
And then we live in the
real world with NATs,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.187
and firewalls, and
all this stuff,

00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:12.270
so we also have something
called the ICE framework

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.526
that WebRTC uses.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.900
It's been around
for a few years.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.330
And it's a way of
connecting, even

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.247
when you have these
complex network scenarios.

00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:19.955
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:20.470
Great.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.480
So let's see.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.740
What's new with WebRTC?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.370
SAM DUTTON: Aw, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.080
MALE SPEAKER: I feel like I've
been hearing about WebRTC.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.420
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.980
Yeah.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.170
I'll tell you what I
love at the moment.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.470
I've seen amazing stuff with
using the other side of WebRTC,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.400
which is the ability to
exchange arbitrary data.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.210
So not just audio and
video, but arbitrary,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.460
binary data, or just text.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.480
And we've sent a couple
of things with that.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.460
Something called
Sharefest, which

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.760
enables you to share
files between peers

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.630
in a completely
peer-to-peer way.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.360
It's not going via some
intermediary server.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.880
And that's yet
working very well.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.020
Another similar application--
it's got a prototype

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.650
really called peerCDN.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.060
And all you have to do is
incorporate, add the peerCDN

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.040
JavaScript to top
of your web page.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.420
And then what it'll do is try to
get the content on the web page

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.770
from a peer that has the same
stuff, so the same images,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.529
the same video, or whatever.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.529
So in other words, it's a
peer-to-peer file distribution

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.380
set-up using WebRTC.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.449
So CDN via WebRTC.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.240
MALE SPEAKER: Nice.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.920
SAM DUTTON: And
that's pretty cool.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.415
MALE SPEAKER:
That's pretty cool.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:29.420
Indeed.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.390
So you mentioned mobile devices.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.080
How real is WebRTC on
those mobile devices?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.530
I mean, usually the
mobile, in terms

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.970
of supporting the standards and
the advanced HTML5 standards,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.362
it's kind of trailing a bit.

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:44.070
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.090
MALE SPEAKER: So where
do we stand there?

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.090
SAM DUTTON: It's looking
good with WebRTC.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.980
So all the APIs implemented
in Chrome and in Firefox

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.330
on mobile.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.890
We've WebRTC bindings, in
fact, for Java and for iOS.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.190
Still work being done on the
iOS stuff, but that's coming.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.650
So we've got the ability
to do that stuff on mobile.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.800
But also, I think one
of the main concerns

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.410
for us is battery life
and power consumption.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.760
And what we're seeing
now is the integration

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.580
of hardware encoding.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.560
So encoding and decoding
done in hardware,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.320
much, much more efficient,
much less power consumption.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.200
So that is a really huge
focus of the WebRTC team

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.350
at the moment, is making that
power consumption very, very

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.380
efficient and
working on hardware.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.380
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.030
So WebRTC, just like
many other fields,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.130
are filled with acronyms.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.470
So you want to walk me through?

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.442
I think there are two that you
wanted to cover-- EME and MSE?

00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:46.150
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.650
Sure.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.560
Yeah, so there are a couple
of related technologies

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.550
with using video.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.810
There's something called EME
that people may have seen.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.590
It stands for Encrypted
Media Extensions.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.380
This is a standard being
developed by the W3C

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.160
to enable content
protection done

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.740
via the browser interacting
with a DRM system.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.990
This means that a
distributor's broadcasters

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.090
can use web apps
without resorting

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.550
to plug-ins like
Flash and Silverlight.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.000
The other one I
wanted to mention,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.430
which is another one of
these alphabet city things

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.920
is MSE, which is Media
Source Extensions.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.740
This is kind of
a complicated way

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.920
of saying that you can put
together a stream of video

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.880
in JavaScript from
chunks of videos.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.460
Now what's
interesting about that

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.070
is that it enables you to do
things like adaptive streaming,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.970
so raising and lowering
based on bandwidth,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.680
and things like
time-shifting, and so on.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.325
So yeah, two of the many
APIs adding richness

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:58.100
to video, the web.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.552
MALE SPEAKER: So how is
Google using WebRTC today?

00:07:01.552 --> 00:07:02.260
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.250
So obviously, the move
is for Google Hangouts

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.567
to be using WebRTC.

00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:08.400
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.700
SAM DUTTON: And yeah,
that's, of course,

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.650
gives us better
quality and the ability

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.870
to do HD between, we hope,
more reliable connections.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.609
That's, of course, a
huge push at the moment.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.275
MALE SPEAKER: So we
talked about mobile.

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:25.740
How about accessibility?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.170
I mean, people like Vint
Cerf advocate for the fact

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.150
that-- And we pride
ourselves in making

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.919
data available and accessible.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:33.960
How is that part being--?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.110
SAM DUTTON: This is
something dear to my heart.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.830
There is something
called a track element

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.860
that you can use inside
a video element in HTML5.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.010
And it's really simple.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.780
It's just a text
file with timings

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.870
for what are called cues,
so subtitles or captions.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.380
And you'd prompt that
in a video element,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.890
link it to the text
file that has that data,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.500
and then render it over the
video captions or subtitles.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.130
Now that's cool,
but you can also

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.640
use that-- It's great for
accessibility, of course.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.364
But you can also use that by
adding data in there, instead

00:08:08.364 --> 00:08:09.530
of just plain old subtitles.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.130
So then you've got this
incredible richness,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.770
with the ability to add
timed metadata, essentially,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.550
into a video.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.304
So a million use cases for that.

00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:21.220
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.430
Yeah, that's very useful.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.480
So you mentioned the video tag.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.400
Anything new there?

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.108
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:08:27.108 --> 00:08:30.498
Some things I've seen recently.

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:33.940
I've worked with this
on Chrome, the ability

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.490
to use alpha transparency.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.770
So what this means is you can
record a video, a green screen

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.970
video, and then in Chrome now--
I think it's still in Canary,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.530
but it's coming
to Stable and it's

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.950
coming to mobile as well,
which is cool-- is the ability

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.880
to have a transparent
background.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.760
So you can do things like
play one video over another.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.700
Great for gaming.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.750
Great for all
kinds of use cases.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.680
People have been asking
for this for a long time.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.060
That's one thing I love
which is brand new.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.180
MALE SPEAKER: Coming to a
Chrome browser near you.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:06.680
Awesome.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.840
Anything fun you've seen
recently around WebRTC

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.830
that you found amazing
that people have built?

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.538
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:15.216
Actually, I was just
thinking what's really new.

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:16.590
What I saw the
other day I loved.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.460
Someone had built, for their
own use, a baby monitor.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.550
Some techie, his
wife had a baby.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.330
He was feeling
like he didn't want

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.270
to just use someone
else's system.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:33.067
So he did this with WebRTC
using motion detection.

00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:33.900
So it's really cool.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.960
So it doesn't just sit
there and just show you

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.260
the video because you
could do that already.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.370
So what it does is it shows
when there's some movement.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.780
And then you can
do some tweaking

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.840
about when you
might be notified,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.820
get it some kind of
alarm or something,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.070
so you can check when your
baby's woken up and all

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.781
this stuff without having to
just permanently listen in.

00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:54.030
But I love that sort of thing.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.890
People have this DIY
developer spirit.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.390
It's good.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.610
MALE SPEAKER: That's
what it's all about,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.170
enabling these developers
with great technologies.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.460
And the sky's the limit.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.170
There's so many things that
we haven't thought about it.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.410
SAM DUTTON: No, it's great.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.670
To me, this is an
incredibly rich API.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.470
It's an amazing,
really, I think,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.370
an amazing feat of engineering.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.297
Just amazing.

00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:16.130
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.370
Well, Sam, thank you so much.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.870
That's all the time
we have for you.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.580
SAM DUTTON: Thanks
for having me.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.200
MALE SPEAKER:
Guys, see you soon.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.690
Cheers.
