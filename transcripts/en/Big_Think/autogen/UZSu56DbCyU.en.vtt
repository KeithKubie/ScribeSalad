met all these interesting people and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
met all these interesting people and
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.400
met all these interesting people and
discovered that it was impossible to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
discovered that it was impossible to
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380
discovered that it was impossible to
stay in touch with them by telephone

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
stay in touch with them by telephone
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.780
stay in touch with them by telephone
because the telephone system was so bad

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
because the telephone system was so bad
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.840
because the telephone system was so bad
whereas email you just send the mail and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
whereas email you just send the mail and
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459
whereas email you just send the mail and
it might take a day or two to go through

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
it might take a day or two to go through
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020
it might take a day or two to go through
but it would get through so I started

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
but it would get through so I started
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.260
but it would get through so I started
using email to stay in touch with the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
using email to stay in touch with the
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740
using email to stay in touch with the
people I'd met in Russia so that in a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
people I'd met in Russia so that in a
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.880
people I'd met in Russia so that in a
sense the existence of the Internet

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890
sense the existence of the Internet
 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.590
sense the existence of the Internet
enabled me to stay in touch with people

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
enabled me to stay in touch with people
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450
enabled me to stay in touch with people

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
which therefore made the travel more
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.750
which therefore made the travel more
worthwhile and in my personal case it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
worthwhile and in my personal case it
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.070
worthwhile and in my personal case it
vastly increased my travel because it

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080
vastly increased my travel because it
 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.300
vastly increased my travel because it
you take a trip and it kind of adds

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
you take a trip and it kind of adds
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.740
you take a trip and it kind of adds
value to the trip by enabling you to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
value to the trip by enabling you to
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
value to the trip by enabling you to
maintain the contact after the trip and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
maintain the contact after the trip and
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670
maintain the contact after the trip and
then so you go make another trip and so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
then so you go make another trip and so
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.780
then so you go make another trip and so

cavernous place full of file drawers and
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.670
cavernous place full of file drawers and
file folders and you find probably a two

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
file folders and you find probably a two
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.100

and that was all you had to go on so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
and that was all you had to go on so
 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.410
and that was all you had to go on so
then you would try and figure out the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
then you would try and figure out the
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359
then you would try and figure out the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
phone number for the PR got you to call
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740
phone number for the PR got you to call
the PR guy and then you'd get a big

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
releases and then you just had to call
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990
releases and then you just had to call
around and find sources there was it was

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000
around and find sources there was it was
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.819
around and find sources there was it was
actually really hard to do research and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
actually really hard to do research and
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.380

the untrue stuff so the the availability
 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.750
the untrue stuff so the the availability
of information is just astonishing

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
of information is just astonishing
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.270
of information is just astonishing
compared to what it was like and the

compared to what it was like and the
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.160
compared to what it was like and the
speed with which you can get it all this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
speed with which you can get it all this
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.340

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.219
response and so people are beginning to
expect two-way communication rather than

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.750
expect two-way communication rather than
simply listening to the candidate

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760
simply listening to the candidate
 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.050
simply listening to the candidate

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060
 
 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.120
