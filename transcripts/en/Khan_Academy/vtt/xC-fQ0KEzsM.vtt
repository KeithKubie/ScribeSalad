00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.530
We're asked to rewrite
the expression 7

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.370
times open parentheses 5
plus 11 close parentheses

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.217
as the sum of 35 and
another whole number.

00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:12.800
So really what they're
asking us to do

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.530
is just apply the
distributive property.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.150
We have 7 times the
quantity 5 plus 11.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.400
Now this is easy to calculate.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.750
You could just say 5 plus 11 is
16 and then 16 times 7 is what?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.427
That's 70 plus 42
which would be 112.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:28.260
But that's not what
they're asking us to do.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.030
They're not saying
just calculate this.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.530
They're saying
express this as a sum

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.960
of 35 and another whole number.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.950
So let's apply the
distributive property

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.390
and let's see if we
can get a sum of 35

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.770
and another whole number.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.860
So 7 times 5 plus 11, that's
the same thing as 7 times 5

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.359
plus 7 times 11.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.150
And you can see with
this expression editor

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.990
right over here,
it tells you-- it

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.790
puts it kind of the
nice math formatting

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.200
for what it looks
like for the computer.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.740
So if we're distributing
the 7 over the 5 and the 11,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.599
it's 7 times 5 plus 7 times 11.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.760
Well, 7 times 5 is 35.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.430
And 7 times 11 is 77.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.380
Now, have we done what
they're asking us?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.970
They said rewrite
this expression

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.464
as the sum of 35 and
another whole number.

00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:18.380
Well, we've done that.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.530
We've written it as a sum of
35 and another whole number

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.660
and we were able to do it using
the distributive property.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.780
So let's check to make sure
that we got the right answer.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.330
Yes, we did.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.240
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.330
Rewrite the expression 12 plus
75 in the following form--

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.870
a times 4 plus c where a and
c represent whole numbers.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.410
Now this might look
complex, but they're really

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.250
asking us to factor
out an a-- factoring

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.940
out an a out of this
expression right over here.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.870
Seeing how much
we can factor out

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.570
so that one of these
two numbers becomes a 4.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.200
So let's think about
how to do that.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.120
If we look at these two numbers,
the greatest common divisor

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.060
of 12 and 75 looks like it is 3.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180
Both of them are divisible by 3.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.540
So you can write 12.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.930
12 is the same
thing as 3 times 4.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.760
And 75 is the same
thing as 3 times 25.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.890
Now what we could do is we could
essentially factor out the 3.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.150
So this is where you could say
we're undistributing the 3.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.460
So that's the same thing.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.910
3 times 4 plus 3
times 25, that's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.850
the same thing as
3 times 4 plus 25.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.590
And it looks like we've
actually put it in the form

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.425
that they want us to put
it in, where 3 is a and 4

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:54.050
is right there.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.550
It's 4.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.120
And then c is 25.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.490
So we've put it
in the right form.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.010
Let's check our answer.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.080
We got it right.
