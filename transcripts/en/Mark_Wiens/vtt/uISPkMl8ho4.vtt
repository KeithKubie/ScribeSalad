00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.822
- In this video I'm gonna share with you

00:00:01.822 --> 00:00:03.592
a Thai green curry recipe.

00:00:03.592 --> 00:00:05.588
We've got all the ingredients
to pound up the paste.

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.785
And got a free range
chicken, my mother-in-law

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:09.290
is actually gonna do the cooking.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.557
And I'm gonna do the pounding.

00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:14.779
Stay tuned for an authentic
Thai family green curry recipe.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.362
(upbeat music)

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:22.295
Hey everyone it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:23.596
I'm in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.147
And today my mother-in-law
and I are gonna be making

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.105
Thai green curry with chicken.

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:30.578
The first step in making
this recipe is to pound up

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:31.411
the curry paste.

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:34.046
And so we got all the
ingredients laying out here.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.793
I think it's mainly gonna
be these Thai green chilies

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:39.411
that we're gonna use to make it green.

00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.964
And then we're also gonna
use a lot of spices.

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:44.595
My mother-in-law doesn't
write down any recipes

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.506
but somehow she just knows
all of the ingredients

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.826
and the amounts in her head.

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:51.094
And by taste testing.

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:54.534
So I'm actually, we're
gonna watch her and then

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:55.984
I'm gonna write down all the ingredients

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.234
and I'll include them in this recipe.

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:01.731
And then also I will write them
over on Eatingthaifood.com.

00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:03.589
You can find the full
recipe and all the details

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.400
and all the ingredients there as well.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.950
For this recipe, we're gonna
be making a full chicken

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469
and it's not a huge chicken.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.971
It's a free range chicken,
she said it was 1.4 kilos.

00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:14.046
The first step is just to prepare

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.368
all of the ingredients to pound.

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.471
So the first step is to peel your garlic.

00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.690
Next up for shallots and the same thing.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.202
She's just gonna peel the shallots,

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:25.716
kinda like garlic actually.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:27.633
Just get that skin off.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.256
Next step is Galangal.

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.616
That's about a thumb sized chunk.

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:42.187
And she's just chopping
this up in order to pound it

00:01:42.187 --> 00:01:44.187
so it's easier to pound.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.979
And it's young Galangal.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.194
And next up lemongrass and
these are only the bottoms

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.379
of the stalks of the lemongrass

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.709
and then again she's
just slicing it finely

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.626
to be able to pound it.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.231
And then next up this is a Kaffir lime

00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:03.834
And we're not gonna be
using the juice of the lime

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.515
but only the peel.

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.406
And that's going to provide
so much citrus flavor

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:12.745
in the curry paste. (upbeat music)

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:16.912
And next up these are
cilantro roots. (upbeat music)

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.871
I can already really smell
that Kaffir lime peel.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:26.977
It's so fragrant.

00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:28.735
All of the pre-preparation is done,

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:30.324
we got all the ingredients ready.

00:02:30.324 --> 00:02:32.172
It's now time to start pounding.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:33.609
You can kind of just throw everything,

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.711
we're gonna eventually
be putting everything

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.234
and pounding it altogether.

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:40.567
But she's first putting in the Galangal.

00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:44.315
And then lemongrass.

00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:52.547
And one thing I want to
mention, this is coriander seeds

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:56.538
and cumin, which she just
toasted and dry roasted in a pan

00:02:56.538 --> 00:02:59.847
just to make it fragrant
just for about 30 seconds

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.320
over a medium heat and dry roasted it.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.140
Make it extra fragrant and that's gonna go

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.554
into the curry paste as well.

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:09.345
It actually doesn't work so
well to pound on a surface

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:11.283
that bounces like a table
so it's actually best

00:03:11.283 --> 00:03:13.646
to take the mortar down to the ground

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:14.479
and pound on the ground.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.646
Now in goes the cilantro
roots. (upbeat music)

00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:21.773
And the lime peel.

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:26.294
This is white peppercorns, all go in.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.112
And also the cumin and coriander seeds.

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.029
I got the okay to just toss in everything

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.745
so next the garlic and the shallots.

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:42.390
We're gonna pound all of
these ingredients first

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.021
and then after that we'll
be adding the green chilies.

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.021
Okay, in goes some salt.

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:52.945
I'm gonna start pounding up everything.

00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:55.358
This is gonna, it's gonna take awhile

00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:57.580
but I'm gonna tell you
that it is so worth it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.396
to make your own curry paste.

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:01.304
You could buy green
curry paste at the store

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:03.764
that's already pre-pounded
and oftentimes in Thailand

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:06.543
actually we go to the market
and buy green curry paste

00:04:06.543 --> 00:04:07.928
that's already pre-made.

00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:09.147
But when you make it yourself

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:12.188
and you control the
ingredients and the flavor

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:15.865
and the freshness, it's
absolutely incredible.

00:04:15.865 --> 00:04:17.427
And one more thing I'd
like to mention is that

00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:19.582
you can make a big batch
of green curry paste

00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:21.554
and you can store it in
the fridge or the freezer

00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:25.198
and then you can use it in small amounts

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.126
when you make green curry.

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:28.133
So feel free to pound up

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:30.461
a whole big batch of green curry paste

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.294
and keep on eating it.

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:36.367
Also if you don't already have
a stone mortar and pestle,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.377
you should invest in
one because you need it

00:04:39.377 --> 00:04:41.794
for almost every Thai recipe.

00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:46.694
It's one of the ultimate
tools of Thai cooking.

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.408
I've just been pounding
for about five minutes

00:04:54.408 --> 00:04:57.040
and already you can see how
the oils of the lemongrass,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.044
the shallots, the garlic
and the Kaffir lime peel,

00:05:00.044 --> 00:05:01.700
all of the oils are coming out,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.015
it's already smelling incredibly fragrant.

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:05.263
It's gonna be delicious.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.430
My mouth is already watering
for the final product.

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:15.376
Next up we're gonna add the chilies

00:05:15.376 --> 00:05:16.930
and these are Thai Bird's Eye chilies

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.881
but they are green in color so
if you can get green in color

00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.076
that's what's gonna give your
green curry the green color.

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:25.113
One more detail she just mentioned is that

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:27.971
green chilies aren't that
spicy so she's gonna add in

00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.889
a few red chilies as well
because the red chilies

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.523
are a little more spicy but mainly

00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:34.856
Thai green chilies for this.

00:05:36.164 --> 00:05:38.907
So in go all of the chilies
and I'm gonna probably

00:05:38.907 --> 00:05:41.812
just add one handful first.

00:05:41.812 --> 00:05:43.302
Pound them up a bit.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:47.219
So they don't go flying
and then add some more.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.618
But we'll be using all of those chilies.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.785
Alright I can add in another
handful. (upbeat music)

00:06:02.776 --> 00:06:04.461
At this point you're gonna
just keep on pounding

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.150
and pounding so I have a cup of coffee.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.567
You might wanna grab some coffee like me.

00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:14.804
And then keep on pounding.

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:28.233
And you can really see
the green color coming out

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:30.852
of the chilies, still have a
whole lot more pounding to do

00:06:30.852 --> 00:06:33.015
but it's coming along nicely.

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:35.377
This is definitely the
most time consuming part

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:38.135
of this entire Thai green curry recipe.

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:40.761
So once we have this,
it will be relatively

00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.240
not too difficult and pretty fast

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.843
to put everything together.

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:49.152
But I understand that
you are very busy and so

00:06:49.152 --> 00:06:51.742
if you have the time to
pound it by hand like this,

00:06:51.742 --> 00:06:53.859
the green curry paste,
that's the best case scenario

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:55.589
because you'll get all the
oils that will come out

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:56.725
of the ingredients.

00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:57.998
It will taste the best.

00:06:57.998 --> 00:07:00.783
But I understand if you
don't have the time,

00:07:00.783 --> 00:07:04.383
still better than buying
store bought curry paste

00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:06.073
in a can or something.

00:07:06.073 --> 00:07:09.296
You can take the same ingredients
and you can process them.

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:12.300
Food process them, blend them
up maybe with a little bit

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.323
of water to get them going.

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:18.061
And then that will be the
second best case scenario,

00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:20.478
that will save a lot of time.

00:07:21.348 --> 00:07:25.515
But if you have the time and
the energy, pound and plus.

00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:31.224
You don't need to go, this is
better than going to the gym.

00:07:31.224 --> 00:07:35.041
You can get your workout in
and have something delicious

00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:36.541
to eat at the end.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:46.295
I just got the approval.

00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:49.437
The curry paste is good
to go, the next step,

00:07:49.437 --> 00:07:51.353
we got a nice puree,
the next step is to add,

00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:54.853
the final step is to add the shrimp paste.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.587
Kinda smoosh it all together
with that shrimp paste.

00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:07.254
It should be a nice puree paste.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:14.113
I love that sound at the end
of making your curry paste.

00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:18.103
It's kind of like a
squishy sound. (laughs)

00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:20.131
For this Thai green curry chicken recipe,

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:23.400
you can definitely buy chicken
pieces or chicken thighs

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.114
or chicken breasts or whatever
type of chicken you want.

00:08:26.114 --> 00:08:27.702
But we're gonna be using a whole chicken

00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:30.764
and it's a free range
chicken so our next step

00:08:30.764 --> 00:08:33.237
is to wash and clean the chicken.

00:08:33.237 --> 00:08:35.820
(upbeat music)

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:58.608
She first chopped off the feet
and the head of the chicken.

00:08:58.608 --> 00:09:02.882
And now she chopped it in
half and gonna clean it up.

00:09:02.882 --> 00:09:04.717
Also it is good with all the organs

00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:07.073
so you can include the
organs in your curry as well.

00:09:07.073 --> 00:09:10.044
Rather than cutting up the
chicken into like thigh

00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:12.154
and drumsticks pieces, the Thai style

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:16.339
for lots of chicken curry
dishes and soups in Thailand

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.506
is to chop up the entire
chicken into bite sized pieces.

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:25.622
(upbeat music)

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:44.897
(laughs)

00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:51.961
I definitely just got splattered
by some chicken juice.

00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:54.764
The chicken is clean
and I have just set up

00:09:54.764 --> 00:09:56.984
the street food cart.

00:09:56.984 --> 00:10:00.271
We're gonna assemble all
of the entire green curry

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.188
with the coconut milk and the curry paste.

00:10:03.188 --> 00:10:06.599
So the first thing she's doing.
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:09.341
She's just putting a
pot on the stove first.

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.428
The street food stove.

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:14.814
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:14.814 --> 00:10:15.647
I'll write all the ingredients

00:10:15.647 --> 00:10:19.444
but that's about a half a
liter or so, maybe two cups.

00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:21.833
So first she's gonna boil that water.

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.797
And then she said she's
gonna put in the curry paste,

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:26.452
the chicken and boil that
for a while while stirring.

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:29.356
(speaking foreign language) (laughs)

00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:31.526
Mom said the curry paste
smells really good.

00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:35.995
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:38.232
(laughs)

00:10:38.232 --> 00:10:40.594
She said it smells really
good, the curry paste.

00:10:40.594 --> 00:10:42.553
So you put that curry paste.

00:10:42.553 --> 00:10:45.760
She'll use use most of what
we pounded into the water

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.968
and dissolve that in the water first.

00:10:47.968 --> 00:10:50.413
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:50.413 --> 00:10:52.662
That green curry paste is boiling away

00:10:52.662 --> 00:10:55.405
and it smells incredible.

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.372
Okay.

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:58.528
And now she's adding in
all the chicken pieces.

00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:01.111
(upbeat music)

00:11:07.853 --> 00:11:10.315
It smells citrusy and
you can also really smell

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:12.774
those green chilies.

00:11:12.774 --> 00:11:16.524
That is called green
curry steam on the lens.

00:11:19.566 --> 00:11:21.131
And she's moving over to
the chopping board now

00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:24.131
to slice up some Kaffir lime leaves.

00:11:26.343 --> 00:11:28.194
And toss those Kaffir lime leaves in there

00:11:28.194 --> 00:11:29.527
to brew as well.

00:11:31.814 --> 00:11:35.981
That's gonna add more
fragrance to your green curry.

00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:39.264
In addition to the
chicken, it's common to add

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:42.529
a certain type of vegetable
to your green curry.

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:44.345
And sometimes you can
use like winter melon

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:48.066
or you can use an
assortment of different kind

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:50.161
of tubular vegetables.

00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:51.852
We're gonna be using Thai eggplant

00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:55.126
which is a traditional
additive to green curry as well

00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:58.800
and then also she's gonna
add in some sweet basil

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.133
right there too.

00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:05.608
Take the sweet basil and
take it off of the stems.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.249
(speaking foreign language)

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:13.072
I think in English they are Spur chilies.

00:12:13.072 --> 00:12:14.757
These chilies are not
spicy but they're sort of

00:12:14.757 --> 00:12:18.330
more for looks to add some
red to your green curry.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.484
And then next step is
for the Thai eggplant.

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:24.930
She's cutting them into quarters.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.824
She's dropping the eggplant into the water

00:12:27.824 --> 00:12:30.324
so that they don't turn black.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:34.483
Oh, I wish you could smell that steam.

00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:55.761
- [Mark] It's been simmering
for about 10 minutes or so,

00:12:55.761 --> 00:12:57.419
she said the chicken is soft now.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:00.419
And we're gonna assemble everything.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.432
Micah has come to take
a whiff, take a smell

00:13:04.432 --> 00:13:05.731
of that green curry.

00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:09.358
Hello Micah! (speaking foreign language)

00:13:09.358 --> 00:13:11.608
He just woke up from a nap.

00:13:13.673 --> 00:13:15.328
Micah I'm not gonna touch
you because my hands

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:18.351
probably have some curry
paste still on them.

00:13:18.351 --> 00:13:20.009
And some chilies.

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:22.614
But I love you little boy.

00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:24.211
I love you little boy.

00:13:24.211 --> 00:13:25.368
- I love you too Dad.

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:27.114
- [Mark] And you can see
a lot of the water has,

00:13:27.114 --> 00:13:28.887
a lot of the liquid has evaporated

00:13:28.887 --> 00:13:32.841
so we've got a nice looking,
like thick curry paste

00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:34.533
down below there.

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.950
Now in go the eggplant first.

00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:44.794
(speaking foreign language)

00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:47.120
- [Mark] And give that a nice stir.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.287
You can see how almost all
the water has boiled out.

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:55.263
Next up for the coconut cream.

00:13:58.268 --> 00:14:01.244
And yeah that's the coconut
cream, the thick, buttery,

00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:02.661
rich, good stuff.

00:14:16.385 --> 00:14:19.972
Oh and you can just
see how creamy that is.

00:14:19.972 --> 00:14:22.389
That's full of delicious fat.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:27.254
And she's adding about a spoonful of salt.

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:29.676
But it's important, you wanna taste test

00:14:29.676 --> 00:14:31.591
the curry because there's a lot of salt

00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:34.381
and also the shrimp
paste in the curry paste

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:36.608
that we pounded, so you
wanna actually taste

00:14:36.608 --> 00:14:38.957
that liquid first before you add any salt.

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:42.290
And then you can add salt to your taste.

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:47.822
- [Mark] Okay we're gonna
bring this to a boil

00:14:47.822 --> 00:14:49.813
and since the chicken is already cooked,

00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:53.980
we're just gonna make sure
that the eggplant is cooked.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.890
So it doesn't really need
to boil for very long.

00:15:03.117 --> 00:15:05.700
And then the final step once
the curry has come to a boil,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.199
the coconut milk has come to a boil,

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:09.449
you add in the sweet basil.

00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:13.191
Give it kind of a little
stir and then she added in

00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.686
the sliced red Spur chilies
that she chopped up earlier.

00:15:17.686 --> 00:15:20.200
And then you don't really
wanna boil it too much longer

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.012
because you don't want the
sweet basil to lose its flavor

00:15:23.012 --> 00:15:25.612
so you just boil for another minute or so.

00:15:25.612 --> 00:15:28.529
And we are just about ready to eat.

00:15:32.078 --> 00:15:35.745
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:37.794 --> 00:15:42.516
Okay the green curry recipe
is done and Uni is gonna

00:15:42.516 --> 00:15:43.965
dish out a bowl now.

00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:45.734
At this point, so you
have a whole pot of curry,

00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:47.997
you can dish it into a bowl,
you can save some for later.

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:52.733
But you should start a
pot of rice, about well,

00:15:52.733 --> 00:15:54.295
when you start to make the curry,

00:15:54.295 --> 00:15:55.568
maybe after you pound the curry paste.

00:15:55.568 --> 00:15:57.252
Before you start to assemble the curry

00:15:57.252 --> 00:16:01.419
so that you have fresh rice
as soon as the curry is ready.

00:16:04.617 --> 00:16:06.443
I'm sitting down to
immediately eat some of the

00:16:06.443 --> 00:16:08.250
Thai green curry chicken.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.655
You gotta come, come just
take a really close up look

00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:11.671
at this green curry.

00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:14.254
Just look at how thick that is.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.976
From both the coconut cream
as well as the curry paste.

00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:23.639
In Thai you call that kam kom wap.

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:28.404
Meaning it's very thick and rich. (laughs)

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.644
Yes, so I've also got a plate of rice.

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:32.627
This is brown rice.

00:16:32.627 --> 00:16:33.913
I'm gonna go in.

00:16:33.913 --> 00:16:36.682
Chicken, bite sized pieces of chicken.

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:39.765
Basil, put some of this onto my rice.

00:16:41.422 --> 00:16:45.589
Put this on there, get
some of that basil as well.

00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:50.683
Oh yes. (laughs)

00:16:50.683 --> 00:16:54.366
Oh you can smell that
green, like sweet green,

00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:57.708
sweet basil aroma to this as well.

00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:59.316
Alright.

00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:02.472
And so you do have to be careful of bones

00:17:02.472 --> 00:17:05.178
due to our using of a
whole chicken like that.

00:17:05.178 --> 00:17:09.345
But I love the free range
chicken and the texture.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.738
Oh that chili as well.

00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:26.552
That is the way you want
green curry to taste.

00:17:26.552 --> 00:17:27.885
Oh it's so good.

00:17:28.987 --> 00:17:33.346
It has such a like, well you
can taste all of those herbs

00:17:33.346 --> 00:17:36.101
and spices that we pounded
up in the curry paste.

00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:37.585
Every one of them.

00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:38.850
You can taste that
little bit of citrusiness

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.051
from the Kaffir lime peel.

00:17:41.051 --> 00:17:42.593
And also the leaves.

00:17:42.593 --> 00:17:45.843
You can taste those green
chilies, the lemongrass.

00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:48.654
A hint of the cumin in there.

00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:52.744
And then with the sweet
basil, the richness

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:54.577
of that coconut cream.

00:17:59.197 --> 00:18:00.530
Oh it's so good.

00:18:02.055 --> 00:18:06.222
It's so flavorful and one thing
I want to point out is that

00:18:08.764 --> 00:18:12.931
Gaeng Khiao Wan, Thai green
curry chicken is quite a popular

00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:17.031
street food dish in Bangkok
or throughout Thailand.

00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:19.948
But due to cost limitations as well

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:26.696
but they often reduce the
creaminess of the coconut milk

00:18:26.696 --> 00:18:29.995
and add more water and
they also tend to use

00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:32.830
less curry paste to reduce cost.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.182
So that's not a bad thing.

00:18:35.182 --> 00:18:38.066
But oftentimes, green curry,
if you eat green curry

00:18:38.066 --> 00:18:40.741
on the streets of Thailand,
it's kind of sweet

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:43.917
and bland actually and it's not very good.

00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:47.589
So I think the best
way to have green curry

00:18:47.589 --> 00:18:49.503
is to actually make it yourself.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:53.285
So I hope that you have enjoyed
this Thai green curry recipe

00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:55.951
and I hope that you'll
try it out from scratch

00:18:55.951 --> 00:18:58.611
using all the ingredients you get.

00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:01.413
I wanna say a big thank you
to my mother-in-law, May

00:19:01.413 --> 00:19:04.990
