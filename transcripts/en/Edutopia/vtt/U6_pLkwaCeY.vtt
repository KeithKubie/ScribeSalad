00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:05.426
&gt;&gt;Karen: Good morning, Dianelys.

00:00:05.426 --> 00:00:07.086
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: Good morning, Karen.

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:08.106
Good morning, Angell.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:09.616
&gt;&gt;Angel: Good morning, Dianelys.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:12.386
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: I think
before any learning can take place,

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:15.636
the students really need to feel
safe, feel like they're seen,

00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:17.356
and feel like they're cared about.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:23.206
The impact I see from morning meeting
is that classes are true communities.

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:26.326
We're learning from each other's
strengths, we're helping each other.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.836
It's a foundation for
everything that comes after.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:32.336
&gt;&gt;Students: Good morning, Ms. Gallagher.

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:44.246
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Morning
meetings are a really important part

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:45.966
of the responsive classroom model,

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.416
which we use here throughout
Highlander Charter School.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:54.056
It's a chance for the students to make
that transition from home to school.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:59.036
It's a way for everyone to settle in and
feel that they're a part of a community.

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:03.196
&gt;&gt;Monica: It puts me in
a focused and good mood.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.746
It makes me feel ready to learn.

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:06.796
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: So, welcome.

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:08.346
I'm so excited to see you guys today.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:10.926
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: Our morning
meeting lasts about fifteen minutes

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:13.156
and we have four parts
that we do together.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.426
Each classroom might be a little
different the way the teacher runs it.

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:18.216
We start with our greeting.

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:21.566
The kids choose what their
greeting is for that day

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:23.806
that helps them want to participate.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:24.846
&gt;&gt;Student: Good morning, Apple.

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:26.516
&gt;&gt;Student: Good morning, Analise.

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:28.126
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher:
We make eye contact.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:33.246
We're having our ears, our eyes and
our brain on the person who's speaking.

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:34.296
&gt;&gt;Student: Good morning, Benjamin.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:35.836
&gt;&gt;Jane Picciotti: "How
are you feeling today?

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:37.226
Are you ready to learn?"

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.456
If you're not ready to learn,
what can we do to get you there?

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.826
&gt;&gt;Dianelys: After the
greeting, we do share.

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:46.076
I like it when people share because
we get to know them a little better.

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:50.246
&gt;&gt;Jamarie: There's like a
little board and whoever went,

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:56.716
you have to check them off and you have
to say what you did on the weekend.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.526
&gt;&gt;Student: I went to the movie.

00:01:57.526 --> 00:01:58.516
&gt;&gt;Student: What was is in the movie?

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:00.256
&gt;&gt;Student: When they died--

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:02.876
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: We've had
a lot of interesting issues come

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:06.546
up through shares, whether it be
deaths in the family, politics

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:08.816
and people feeling safe or
not safe because of that--

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:13.076
you know, things you might not normally
talk about in a first-grade classroom.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:17.546
Morning meeting gives you the space and
the time to have those conversations.

00:02:17.696 --> 00:02:19.386
&gt;&gt;Students: Today my
grandparents are coming.

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:22.246
I'm ready for questions and comments.

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:23.636
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: They
get to answer questions.

00:02:23.636 --> 00:02:25.076
"Somebody cares about me.

00:02:25.306 --> 00:02:27.926
All these hands are interested in me."

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Didn't they come last time?

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.986
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, but they had to go back

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:32.586
because something happened
in their country.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:38.046
&gt;&gt;Marcella: Morning meeting
makes me feel calm and happy.

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.526
My favorite part is the glitter jar.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:42.896
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: We shake the glitter
jar, we put it in the middle.

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:44.466
The kids have a moment to watch.

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:47.256
&gt;&gt;Adrian: Mr. B puts the
timer on for a minute.

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:50.556
We reflect on what we can do to
get yourself ready for the day.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:56.226
&gt;&gt;Monica: Today we got to think about
how you can be helpful to your friends.

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:00.386
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: So, is there
someone who would like to share?

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:01.116
Chrisana.

00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:04.216
&gt;&gt;Chrisana: If somebody's sad,

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.976
you can help them feel
better by playing with them.

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:09.136
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: Okay, I like that.
Nice job.

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:12.956
Dianelys: After the
share, we get to do a game.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:18.246
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two-- Dianelys:
Someone counts without looking

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:20.996
and people go into corners--

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:22.986
&gt;&gt;Student: -- nine, ten!

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:25.736
Corner number three!

00:03:26.136 --> 00:03:26.406
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Oh!

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.346
&gt;&gt;Student: One, two--

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:31.556
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: It really gives
them a chance to get that last burst

00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:33.816
of energy out before
it's time for them to sit

00:03:33.816 --> 00:03:35.976
down to the serious business
of literacy.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.066
&gt;&gt;Student: Corner number one.

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:39.133
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Ooh!

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.176
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Then after
that I go over the agenda every day,

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.906
knowing what's going to happen
next is really important to kids.

00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:48.396
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: After that is-- ?

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:48.463
&gt;&gt;Students: PE!

00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:50.846
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Then
we get to eat our-- ?

00:03:50.846 --> 00:03:51.116
&gt;&gt;Students: Lunch!

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.586
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: Then
we're going to have some-- ?

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.976
&gt;&gt;Students: Math power!

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:56.416
&gt;&gt;Valerie Gallagher: So
that kind of sets the tone.

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:58.476
We're here together, morning meeting.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.596
We know what's going on with everyone.

00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:03.156
We're ready to go.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.236
&gt;&gt;Dan Baldassi: So, I know fifteen
minutes can sometimes be a hard thing

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.726
to try to put in your schedule,
but students in each classroom know

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:12.356
that they're coming into safe places.

00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:15.696
This is a chance for them to
have voice in their classroom.

00:04:15.996 --> 00:04:19.176
&gt;&gt;Jane Picciotti: It's about respecting
each other, respecting your teacher.

00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:21.516
It's rooted in positive interactions.

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:23.876
It definitely helps set our culture.

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:28.456
&gt;&gt;Adrian: I think it wouldn't be
as easy to do the rest of the day.

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:29.836
It helps me a lot.
