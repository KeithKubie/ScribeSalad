00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.481
The one conversation that uplifted me
more than any other in my life

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:20.925
was with a woman who told me

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.694
how, a few days earlier,

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:26.823
she drove her Jeep Wrangler
to the edge of the Grand Canyon

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:29.604
and sat there, revving the engine,

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:31.365
thinking about driving over.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.377
Even though I had severe social anxiety,

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:38.035
in that conversation,
I was totally at ease.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.560
(Laughter)

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:42.267
She told me what was going on in her life

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:44.593
in the days and months leading up,

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:46.849
what her thoughts were
at that exact moment,

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:48.362
why she wanted to die,

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:49.631
and why she didn't do it.

00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.053
We nodded and half-smiled,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:55.701
and then it was my turn
to talk about my journey

00:00:55.725 --> 00:01:00.371
to a dining table
in the hygienic community area

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.891
of the mental health wing
of a mountain-town hospital.

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:06.020
I took too many sleeping pills,

00:01:06.044 --> 00:01:07.750
and after they treated me for that,

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:13.605
they were like, "Hey, we would love it
if you would be our guest

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.123
in the psych ward."

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:20.020
(Laughter)

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:25.644
We joked that her suicide
would have made a way better postcard.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:26.726
(Laughter)

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.134
We talked shop.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:29.870
(Laughter)

00:01:29.894 --> 00:01:32.353
She allowed me to be deeply depressed

00:01:32.377 --> 00:01:37.170
and have a genuine connection
to another person, simultaneously.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.947
For the first time,

00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:42.145
I identified as somebody
living with depression,

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.877
and I felt good about it --

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:46.019
like I wasn't a bad person for it.

00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:51.069
Now imagine one of the people
at that table was a member of your family

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:53.003
or a close friend.

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:55.003
Would you be comfortable talking to them?

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.526
What if instead of the hospital,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.077
they were at your kitchen table

00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.016
and told you they were really depressed?

00:02:02.295 --> 00:02:04.622
The World Health Organization

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:11.020
says that depression is the leading cause
of ill health and disability worldwide,

00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:14.122
affecting 350 million people.

00:02:14.146 --> 00:02:16.042
The National Institute of Mental Health

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:20.717
reports seven percent of Americans
experiencing depression in a year.

00:02:21.084 --> 00:02:23.822
So depression is super common,

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.523
yet in my experience,

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:29.513
most folks don't want
to talk to depressed people

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.378
unless we pretend to be happy.

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:37.031
A cheerful facade is appropriate
for casual interactions.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:41.769
A depressed person can ask for extra syrup
in their pumpkin spice latte

00:02:41.793 --> 00:02:43.813
without explaining that they need it

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:47.906
because they're trapped
in the infinite darkness of their soul

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.962
and they've lost all hope of escape --

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:50.987
(Laughter)

00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:52.162
again.

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:55.251
(Laughter)

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.405
Depression doesn't diminish
a person's desire

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.271
to connect with other people,

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:01.663
just their ability.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.272
So in spite of what you might think,

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:07.766
talking to friends and family
living with depression

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.257
can be really easy and maybe even fun.

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:17.150
Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga-
at-an-underground-party fun --

00:03:17.174 --> 00:03:19.190
I'm talking about the kind of fun

00:03:19.214 --> 00:03:22.370
where people enjoy
each other's company effortlessly.

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:24.587
Nobody feels awkward,

00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:29.039
and no one accuses the sad person
of ruining the holidays.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:33.971
Why does this chasm even exist?

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:35.228
On the one side,

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:37.260
you have people living with depression

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.545
who may act in off-putting
or confusing ways

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.242
because they're fighting
a war in their head

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.809
that nobody else can see.

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:46.529
On the other side,

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:51.057
the vast majority of people
look across the chasm

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:52.232
and shake their heads,

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:55.272
like, "Why you gotta be so depressed?"

00:03:56.817 --> 00:04:00.457
You may recognize
a divide like this in your life.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:03.055
Do you want to build a bridge across it?

00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:05.856
You may not want to build a bridge --

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.475
and that's a totally valid choice.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.660
Or maybe you'd like to build
a stronger connection,

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:17.134
but you have a lot
of questions and concerns.

00:04:17.158 --> 00:04:20.357
You're what I might call "bridge curious."

00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:24.665
(Laughter)

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:26.123
Here are some possible reasons

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:28.736
why some of you
may avoid depressed people.

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:31.006
You might be afraid

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.724
that if you talk to somebody
while they're depressed,

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:36.410
you're suddenly responsible
for their well-being.

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.519
You're not expected to be Dr. Phil.

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:42.156
Just be friendly --

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.713
more like Ellen.

00:04:43.737 --> 00:04:47.213
(Laughter)

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.540
You may worry that you won't
know what to say,

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:54.984
and every attempt
at conversation will be awkward,

00:04:55.008 --> 00:04:57.404
and the only time you'll feel comfortable

00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.333
is when you both just give up on talking

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.022
and stare at your phones.

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:06.545
Words are not the most important
thing to focus on.

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:12.193
You might fear seeing your shadow.

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:15.583
Hey, if you have been
successfully outrunning

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.070
your personal emotional demons,

00:05:18.094 --> 00:05:19.865
that's awesome.

00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:22.393
May the wind be at your back.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:23.432
(Laughter)

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:27.169
You can be the least
woo-woo person in the world

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.209
and still connect with depressed people.

00:05:30.477 --> 00:05:33.318
Maybe you've heard
that depression is contagious,

00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:35.323
and you're afraid of catching it.

00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:37.359
Bring some hand sanitizer.

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:38.384
(Laughter)

00:05:38.408 --> 00:05:42.896
You're much more likely to catch
the joy of human bonding.

00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:45.663
Maybe you see
depressed people differently.

00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:48.955
You think of them as flawed or defective.

00:05:50.299 --> 00:05:53.307
Multiple university studies have shown

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:57.786
that A students are more likely
to have bipolar condition.

00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:01.618
Our brains aren't broken or damaged,

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:03.593
they just work differently.

00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:09.323
I spent a lot of years thinking
happy people just don't get it.

00:06:09.347 --> 00:06:10.494
(Laughter)

00:06:10.518 --> 00:06:14.143
I did eventually stop
discriminating against happy people --

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:17.271
(Laughter)

00:06:18.433 --> 00:06:21.339
I began battling depression
when I was eight,

00:06:21.363 --> 00:06:23.510
and decades later, to my surprise,

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:25.108
I started winning.

00:06:25.132 --> 00:06:29.097
I shifted from being miserable
much of the time

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.231
to enjoying life.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:34.425
I live pretty well
with my bipolar condition,

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.928
and I've overcome some other
mental health conditions

00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:40.253
like overeating, addiction
and social anxiety.

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:44.297
So I live on both sides of this chasm.

00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:49.692
And I'm offering some guidance

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:52.425
based on my experience

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.758
to help you build a bridge across it

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.224
if you want to.

00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:58.196
It's not hard science,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.721
but I worked with a lot people
I know who've lived with depression

00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:04.968
to refine these suggestions.

00:07:06.086 --> 00:07:08.650
First up, some things
you might want to avoid --

00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:10.016
some "don'ts."

00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:14.714
One of the most off-putting
things you can say is,

00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:16.300
"Just get over it."

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:19.380
Great idea -- love it,

00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.721
it's just we already thought of that.

00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:28.154
(Laughter)

00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:32.455
The absence of the ability
to just get over it is depression.

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.292
(Laughter)

00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:41.162
(Applause)

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:44.925
We feel it in our bodies --

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.354
it's a physical thing for us.

00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.385
And medically it's no different

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:51.791
from telling someone
with a broken ankle or cancer,

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:53.123
"just get over it."

00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:59.589
Don't be hell-bent on fixing us.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:03.968
Like, thank you, but ...

00:08:03.992 --> 00:08:08.327
the pressure can make us depressed people
feel like we're disappointing you.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.791
Also, things that make
some people feel better

00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:13.542
may not work for us.

00:08:13.566 --> 00:08:17.224
You can't cure clinical depression
by getting ice cream ...

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:21.571
which is unfortunate, because
that would be living the dream.

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:24.456
(Laughter)

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:30.731
Don't take a negative response personally.

00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:34.899
So, I have a friend who, about a year ago,

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:38.136
messaged me that he was really
isolated and depressed.

00:08:38.603 --> 00:08:41.104
And I suggested some things for him to do,

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:43.461
and he was like, "No, no and no."

00:08:43.485 --> 00:08:44.636
And I got mad,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.597
like, how dare he not embrace
my brilliant wisdom?

00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:50.337
(Laughter)

00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.827
And then I remembered
times I've been depressed,

00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:58.467
and how I thought I was doomed
in all possible futures,

00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:02.163
or everybody suddenly hated me,
and things like that.

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:06.717
It didn't matter how many people
told me otherwise --

00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:08.144
I didn't believe them.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.308
So I let my friend know I cared,

00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:14.610
and I didn't take it personally.

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:21.242
Don't let a lack of bubbly
happiness freak you out.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.175
It's not a shark attack.

00:09:23.648 --> 00:09:26.592
"Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!"

00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:28.278
(Laughter)

00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:32.055
We can be sad and OK at the same time.

00:09:32.835 --> 00:09:34.169
I'm going to say that again,

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:37.794
because in our society,
we're taught the opposite,

00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:39.933
and so it's counterintuitive.

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:44.834
People can be sad and OK at the same time.

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:48.939
So some of these things may apply
to you personally, some may not.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.113
Take what's useful.

00:09:50.728 --> 00:09:54.105
And remember, you don't have to connect.

00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:57.119
If you want to,

00:09:57.143 --> 00:09:59.229
here are some suggestions that may help --

00:09:59.253 --> 00:10:00.403
some "dos."

00:10:01.484 --> 00:10:04.358
Talk to us in your natural voice, right?

00:10:04.382 --> 00:10:06.813
(Laughter)

00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:12.091
You don't need to put on a sad voice
because we're depressed --

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:15.048
you don't sneeze when you're talking
to somebody with a cold.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:18.282
(Laughter)

00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:20.848
It's not rude to be upbeat.

00:10:20.872 --> 00:10:23.456
You can be you, OK?

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.377
If you make an offer to be there for us,

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:29.162
clearly state what you can and can't do.

00:10:29.907 --> 00:10:32.381
I have told people,
"Hey, call or text any time,

00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:35.391
but I might not be able
to get back to you that same day."

00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:39.465
It's totally cool to not make an offer,

00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:43.776
or to make a narrow offer
with really clear boundaries around it.

00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:47.535
Give us a sense of control.

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.410
Like, get our consent.

00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:55.315
I have a friend who, a while back,

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:57.427
when I was having a depressive episode,

00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:00.130
reached out and said,
"Hey, I want to check in with you.

00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:01.346
Can I call you every day?

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.800
Maybe text you every day
and call later in the week?

00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:05.155
What works for you?"

00:11:06.409 --> 00:11:09.592
By getting my permission,
she earned my complete confidence

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:12.583
and remains one of my best friends today.

00:11:14.189 --> 00:11:16.421
And my last suggestion is:

00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:20.403
interact about not depression,

00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:22.553
aka, normal stuff.

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:26.314
I have a friend who,
when people were worried about him,

00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:29.030
they would call and ask
if he wanted to go shopping

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:31.385
or help them clean out their garage.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.880
Your depressed friends
could be a good source of free labor --

00:11:34.904 --> 00:11:41.904
(Laughter)

00:11:44.132 --> 00:11:47.465
What I'm really getting at is,

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:52.052
invite them to contribute
to your life in some way,

00:11:52.076 --> 00:11:56.607
even if it's as small
as asking you to go see a movie

00:11:56.631 --> 00:11:58.462
that you wanted to see in the theater.

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:03.477
So that's a lot
of dos and don'ts and maybes,

00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:06.635
and it's not by any means
a definitive list.

00:12:08.146 --> 00:12:10.937
The thing to remember
is that they're all grounded

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.273
in one guiding principle.

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:16.439
It's what allowed the woman
in the Jeep Wrangler

00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:21.010
to start me on the path to recovery
without even trying.

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:25.042
She talked to me like I belonged

00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:29.883
and contributed exactly as I was
at that moment.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.878
If you talk to a depressed person
as if their life is just as valuable,

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:38.344
intense and beautiful as yours,

00:12:38.368 --> 00:12:42.298
then there's no need
to build a bridge between you,

00:12:42.322 --> 00:12:44.082
because you've closed the chasm.

00:12:45.684 --> 00:12:49.493
Focus on that instead of your words,

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:55.038
and it may be the most uplifting
conversation of their life.

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:59.528
What could that do
for somebody you care about?

00:13:00.203 --> 00:13:02.528
What could it do for you?

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:04.332
Thank you.

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:09.277
(Applause)
