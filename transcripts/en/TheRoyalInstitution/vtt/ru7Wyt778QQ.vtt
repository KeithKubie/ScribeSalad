00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.840
 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.790
In many cultures, surnames are
passed from father to child.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.970
I'm a McLysaght because my
father, my father's father,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.010
and my father's grandfather
were McLysaghts.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.630
Unfortunately, my many female
ancestors don't get recorded.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.650
And in fact, I don't
even know my

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.490
great-grandmothers' maiden names.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.170
But there does exist a very
important genetic link between

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.480
the women in my family.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.250
And that's found not on the 23
pairs of chromosomes that lie

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.920
within the cell nucleus.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.650
Instead, it's found in another
part of the cell called the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.900
mitochondria.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.700
 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.600
So here it is.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.800
This is a mitochondria.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.510
And this is a component of
cells of eukaryotes.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.110
That's everything
except bacteria.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.970
They're sometimes known as the
powerhouse of the cell.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.330
And that's because they produce
all the chemical

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.100
energy, known as ATP, that's
required for metabolism.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.250
But they do other
things as well.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.380
They're involved in signalling
and in cell

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.130
growth and cell death.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.560
But one really fascinating thing
about mitochondria is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.960
that they've got their own
little circular genome that's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.550
completely separate from the
other chromosomes in the cell.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.940
It's really very short.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.180
It's about 15,000 times shorter
than chromosome 1.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.190
And it only contains 37 genes,
13 of which are involved in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.030
the energy functions.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.660
And in any one given cell, there
are many mitochondria,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.420
ranging from hundreds to
hundreds of thousands.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.210
But the really fascinating thing
is how they got there in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090
the first place.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.900
In 1966, a young biologist
called Lynn Margulis noticed

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.770
similarities between
mitochondria and free-living

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.780
microbes and proposed a theory
on the origins of the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.030
mitochondria.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.420
 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.789
She suggested that about one and
a half billion years ago,

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.380
one bacteria was eaten by
another cell and instead of

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.000
being digested, lived inside
the other cell and formed a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.530
mutually beneficial symbiotic
relationship, eventually

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.780
becoming the mitochondria.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.240
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.250
When Lynn Margulis first
proposed this theory, she

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.480
wasn't believed.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.730
And the idea failed
to gain traction.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970
She showed remarkable
tenacity, however.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.340
And she stuck with it.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.250
Eventually, her perseverance
paid off.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.300
And it was later shown that
the mitochondrial DNA has

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.320
similarities to the DNA of
free-living bacteria.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.170
Her endosymbiotic theory
was proven true.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.774
 

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:06.350
It's disappointing to think that
the reason why this idea

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.030
was slow to gain acceptance
is the fact that it was

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.960
championed by a woman.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.000
These days, however, it's no
longer considered a crazy idea

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.230
and it's in every biology
textbook.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.780
But the mitochondrial DNA
has also helped women be

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.210
remembered in another way.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.140
And that's because of its
special inheritance pattern.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.470
And this is that the
mitochondria are provided by

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.270
the egg cell but
not the sperm.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.830
 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.780
And so, much like surnames are
passed from father to child,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.620
mitochondria are passed
from mother to child.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.330
And more than this, the
mitochondrial DNA doesn't

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.070
undergo the same recombination
as occurs to the other 23

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.770
chromosomes.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.470
So your mitochondrial DNA was
inherited intact from your

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.740
mother, who got it from
her mother and so on.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.460
And so this provides a record
of the maternal line right

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.270
back to the origins of humans.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.270
 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.770
So to me, there is a certain
poetry in the way that the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.000
mitochondria links us to our
female ancestors while at the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.410
same time serves as an important
reminder of the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.450
challenges faced by
women in science.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:36.037
