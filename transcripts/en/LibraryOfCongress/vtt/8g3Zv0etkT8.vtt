00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.270
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.850
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm Dan Turello on staff
at the Kluge Center.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.340
Ted Widmer, our Kluge Center
director is traveling this week,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.290
so he's sorry he cannot
be with us today.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.130
Before we begin today's
program, I want to remind you

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.160
to turn off any cell phones
or other electronic devices

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.550
that might interfere
with the presentation.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.630
I also want to remind you that
we are filming today's program

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.300
for a presentation on our website

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.860
and on our YouTube
and iTune channels.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.550
The Kluge Center was founded in
2000, thanks to a generous donation

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.170
from philanthropist John W Kluge.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.820
The center's a vibrant community
of scholarship on Capitol Hill.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.350
We bring together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.340
to use the Library's rich
collections to interact

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.670
with lawmakers, policymakers
and the public.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.880
We offer opportunities for
scholars at every level.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.180
Senior scholars.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.480
Postdoctoral.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.370
Fellows. The mic is
fading in and out.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.870
And PhD candidates.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.840
We also administer and award
the Kluge Prize for achievement

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.260
in the study of humanity,
which most recently went

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.790
to philosopher Jurgen Habermas
and Charles Taylor in 2015.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.310
Our speaker today is
Bruce Carruthers.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.690
He was here at the Kluge Center
this past summer as the Cary

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.110
and Ann Maguire Chair in
ethics in American history.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.280
The Maguire Chair was created to
enable a distinguished thinker

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.960
to spend a period of residence at
the Library exploring the history

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.730 position:56%
of America with special attention to
the ethical dimensions of economic,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.100
political and social policies.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.830
We're sorry Mr Cary Maguire
couldn't be with us today.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.310
We hold deep gratitude
to Mr Maguire,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.210
a member of the Library's Madison
Council, for his generous donation

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.240
to endow this chair,
which has attracted some

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.490
of the best scholars
at work in the field.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.220
And has been a treasure for
the Library and for the nation.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.310
Today's lecture is titled
The Economy of Promises,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.670
Trust and Credit, in America.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.360
It's a topic that is a culmination
of years of thought and writing

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.580
for Bruce along these themes.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.600
Dr Carruthers has been
investigating how historically,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.970
in an economy that depends on
credit, people manage trust

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.860
and how they reduce
uncertainty and vulnerability.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.510
Dr Carruthers is the John D
MacArthur Chair and professor

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.310
of sociology and director of the
Buffet Institute for Global Studies

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.240
at Northwestern University.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.500
He is the author or coauthor of
five books on markets, business,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.450
the economy, and politics.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.110
His most recent book
is Money and Credit.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.190
A Sociological Approach.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.440
And examined the social
dimensions of money and credit

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.150
at the individual and
corporate levels.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.640
A 2009 book was Bankrupt
to Global Lawmaking

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.900
in Systemic Financial Crisis.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.490
It was coauthored with
Terence Halliday,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.710
and it studied how global actors
have shaped corporate bankruptcy

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.120
laws around the world.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.580
At Northwestern, his areas

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.340
of research include the historical
evolution of credit as a problem

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.200
in the sociology of trust,
regulatory arbitrage,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.150
derivative markets, and
the regulation of credit,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.320
in early 20th century America.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.970
Dr Carruthers has held
visiting fellowships

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.620
at the Russell Sage Foundation,
The Radcliffe Institute

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.100 position:56%
for Advanced Study and the Institute
for Advanced Study in Berlin.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.260
He also received a John
Simon Guggenheim Fellowship

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.840
and received his PhD from
the University of Chicago.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.260
So in addition to all
this [inaudible],

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.540
we can say that we've missed
Bruce's good humor and collegiality

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.680
around the Kluge Center, so we're
glad that he's back with us today.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.510
Welcome Bruce Carruthers.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:29.050
[ Applause ]

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.350
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers: Thank you

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.270
for that kind introduction
and welcome everyone.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.590
I know I'm supposed
to stay in one place

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.130 position:56%
because the camera's right there and
there's this recording equipment,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.740
and so I'm going to
try not to wander.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.160
It's really going to require
some great self-discipline.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.410
I have to admit this is a
bittersweet moment, as I'm reminded

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.750
of the wonderful experience

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.200
that I had this past summer
visiting the Kluge Center.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.390
And I'm also reminded that
that experience is over.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.050
So I flew in from Chicago this
morning and had to extract myself

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.310
from various administrative duties.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.460
I'm grateful to the entire
Kluge staff but especially

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.260 position:56%
to Travis Hensley, Dan Turello, Mary
Lou Recker, and Jason Steinhauer,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.460
for making my visits so
productive and pleasurable.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.820
My fellow visiting
scholars were a lively bunch

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.770
who always provided food for
thought and amicable companionship.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.860
And I would like to congratulate
the new Kluge director.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.670
I'm sure he already knows what a
special institution he now leads.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.290
And I also want to thank
Janice Hyde who's here,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.740
who served as interim
director during my stay.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.820
And I also want to
acknowledge Rachel Linton,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.840
a very smart Georgetown undergrad,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.100
who served as my research
assistant last summer.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.310
And thanks to you, the audience.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.810
You probably have other interesting
things to do on a Friday afternoon,

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.600 position:56%
but you've given me the gift of your
time and attention, so I'm grateful.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.870 position:56%
I promise I'll be done before the
World Series game starts [laughter].

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.670
Not that I'm interested
myself, having lived in Chicago

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.000
for a very long time, but I know
you are eager to get in front

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.640
of the television and
see what happens.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.280
And finally I'd like to thank Cary

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.780
and Ann Maguire whose generosity
created the research chair

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.740
that supported my visit to the
Kluge Center and the visits,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.320
of course, of all my predecessors.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.910
I have a special place
in my heart for people

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.820
who recognize the enduring
importance of libraries as social,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.630
cultural and intellectual
institutions.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.280
So now let me turn to my talk.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.810
So I'm interested in
trust and, of course,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.030
this is one of these master
concepts that is defined variously,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.790
and so I'm going to
give you my definition.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.410
And it is a definition
that makes trust

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.490
to be a fairly particular
kind of thing.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.710
That is, I'm not interested
in trust in the sense

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.270
that I trust everyone
or everyone trusts me.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.980
It's not so generic.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.090
It's not so ambient.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.290
Really I'm interested in a
definition or an understanding

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.190 position:56%
of trust where it makes sense to say

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.520
that person A trusts
person B to do something.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.290
To do X. That is, and
when you do trust someone,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.510
you proceed with the expectation
that that other individual is going

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.740
to do whatever it is X is.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.240
And so this is an ocean of
trust that is relational.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.540
That is, it's about relations

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.180
between two parties
and it's specific.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.610
It's not that I trust
so-and-so, in general.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.760
I trust them to do something
in particular, and, of course,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.490
trust is not the same
thing as trustworthiness.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.090
You could trust someone
who wasn't trustworthy,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.860
in which case you've
made a terrible mistake.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.650
So in pulling apart trust,
there's really two features

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.310
that make it complicated.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.470
And I call these vulnerability
and uncertainty.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.920
And vulnerability stems from the
fact that what B does is going

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.930
to have an impact on A. That is,
A cares about what B will do,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.080
and if B does something nicely or
well, then it's going to help A

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.480
and if they don't,
it's going to hurt A.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.160
So B's actions have an impact on A

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.320
and that's the vulnerability
feature.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.810
But it's also the case, that
because it's all forward-looking

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.270
into the future, A doesn't
know what B is going to do.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.610
That is, there's uncertainty.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.070
If the world were perfectly
predictable, we wouldn't have

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.310
to worry about trust because you
would know what B is going to do.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.610
You wouldn't have to trust them.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.210
And, of course, with this
kind of general definition,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.980
trust matters in politics.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.390
It matters in the economy.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.920
It matters in social
life, generally.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.100
And certainly we're in the midst
of an election, where the issue

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.220
of who trusts whom is
clearly very important.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.380
But I'm going to focus
on the economy.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.610 position:56%
So my definition of trust maps very
nicely onto the situation of credit.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.030
So if we consider that this
party A is called the creditor

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.930
and B is the debtor.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.710
And this activity is
called repay the money.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.270
And the definition
applies very directly

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.060
and very simply to
the issue of credit.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.810
And so does uncertainty
and vulnerability.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.130
A is uncertain about whether
B will keep her promise

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.190
to repay, so you don't know.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.670
You know, you lend the money
and you hope they will repay

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.890
but you aren't entirely sure.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.290
And the lender is vulnerable,
depending upon the size

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.590
and the maturity of the loans.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.650
So if you lend someone
a small amount,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.230
it's not a huge vulnerability.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.820
If you lend them enough to buy a
house, it's a big vulnerability.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.330
And so forth.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.370
And, in moving forward, given
this sort of problem of trust,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.460
there's kind of a simple
recipe forward

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.360
and that is either
address uncertainty.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.720
That is, gather information
to figure

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.850
out well what are they going to do?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.530
Or manage vulnerability.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.480
Find ways to protect yourself
from this behavior if that occurs.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.350
So very straightforward
kind of recipe

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.450
for mitigating the trust problem.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.920
And the real problem is that
you can't run a modern economy

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.330
without credit.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.990
That is, this is an inescapable
problem in the modern world.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.890
Modern economies are
built around promises.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.320
Lots and lots of people are making
lots and lots of promises to lots

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.670
and lots of other people.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.800
And the viability of that
really fuels the economy.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.630
If no one trusted anyone
else, we'd all, you know,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.210
we wouldn't even be
drinking the water

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.170
because we'd be worried
it was poisonous.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.010
And I'm going to have a bit
of the water that Dan gave me

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.370
and I trust him, you know?

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.640
And life would be hard
if I couldn't.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.810
So credit is pervasive and it's
a really practical problem.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.850
That is, if you're in the
business world operating

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.600
without credit makes
your life very miserable,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.130 position:56%
but it's also a theoretical issue in
the sense that people have thought

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.870
for a long time how do
we solve this problem?

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.190
What is the nature of this problem?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.040
How can we build institutions
that will deal with it?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.570
So I've got a nice quote
here from Walter Bagehot,

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.970
who was a very famous 19th
century British Central Banker.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.650
He wrote In Lombard Street.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.580
Credit is a set of promises to pay.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.210
Will those promises be kept?

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:14.380
So, in this talk and in my
project, I'm really focused on,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.270
in the informational side,
not so much on vulnerability,

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.280
which is an important component,
but that would be another talk.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.190
I'm really looking at how do people
gather information about borrowers

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.560
to reduce the uncertainty about
what those folks are going to do?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.280
Will they -- how do you answer the
question will so-and-so repay the

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.580
loan I'm going to make to them?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.270
And I'm going to focus
particularly on the invention

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.710 position:56%
of credit ratings and credit scores.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.200
And, as you'll learn, this is
something that was really invented

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.550
in the United States and now
is quite a pervasive form

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.210
of information.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.160
These, over the time
period, the time period

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400
that I'm examining,
grew in importance.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.380
And they augmented and
partially displaced older forms

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.890
of information, and I'll say
a little bit more about that.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.210
And, as [inaudible] said,
I'm just going to look

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.860
at the informational
side of the problem.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.630
That is, the part that
deals with uncertainty.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:13.090
I'm going to set aside all of
the tricks that lenders have

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.980
for reducing their vulnerability.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.760 position:56%
But just to give you a sense of what

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.920
such a trick might look
like, think about collateral.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.190
Collateral is a way
of saying, you know,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.020
if you don't repay me,
I'll take your house.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.320
Or I'll take your car.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.760
I'll repossess your car.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.790
That's a collateralized loan and
obviously reduces the vulnerability

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.490
because it reduces the losses.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.640
So one of the interesting
things about this is

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.690
that there is some
measure of continuity.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.120
That is, if you think about and
look at how people have thought

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.150 position:56%
about the trustworthiness of debtors
and how to manage the problem

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.800
of lending to them, there
is some folk wisdom --

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.340
and I call these durable
creditor heuristics --

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.590
that have existed for centuries.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.260 position:56%
And on the right-hand side, we have
the title page of a nice little book

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.320
that came out of the
Bank of Philadelphia

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.900
that talk about the four C's.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.530
And, if you were a lender,
here's a nice handy mnemonic.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.630
If you're going to wonder
whether you should lend money

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.900
to some customer, pay
attention to their character.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.200
Their capacity.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.500
Their capital.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.800
And their collateral.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.100
Nice little handy memorable phrase.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.440
Well, going back to the early 19th
century and crossing the Atlantic.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.850
In the London Tradesmen, which is
a sort of a business advice book,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.240
you see a very similar
kind of mnemonic

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.200
which says here are the four
indispensable requisites

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.340
to complete success in business.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.640
Capital. Credit.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.940
Fair character.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.240
And connections.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.700
So it's a different set of
C's but you get the idea.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.350
In particular, there's a lot
of interest in character.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.510
What is the character, that sort
of moral fiber of the borrower?

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.830
So now I'm going to start to
tell you the story of new forms

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.360
of information that came along.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.390
And this very stern-looking man
here is a guy named Lewis Tappan.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:05.170
And he was a part -- if you've
ever been to Overland, Ohio,

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.630
there's a place called
Tappan Square.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.470
It turns out that Lewis
Tappan was a member

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.840
of a very prominent
abolitionist family,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.330
so he was politically active.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.620
But he also invented and founded a
firm called the Mercantile Agency

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.150
in 1841.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.980
And it was a firm that
solved a very simple problem,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.370
and that was there were a bunch
of suppliers in New York City

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:30.280 position:56%
who were shipping goods to customers
increasingly out of the region.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.040
Not just in the boroughs of New
York but up the Hudson, excuse me,

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.740
and into the Midwest
and places like that.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:43.520
And they were being asked
to extend credit to people

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.900 position:56%
who were complete strangers to them.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.320
They had no information about
these individuals, these businesses

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.850
that wanted to buy from them.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.340
They had maximum uncertainty.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.370
And so Tappan basically
founded a firm

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.580
to say I will provide information
to these New York City wholesalers

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.570
and suppliers so that they
can address this issue

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.650
of uncertainty and reduce it.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.230
And so this is the invention
of a kind of a commodified form

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.380
of information processing
and gathering

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.680
or gathering and processing.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.820
The information came from a network

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.460
of correspondents and
branch offices.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.770
So this guy Tappan cultivated a
network all over the United States

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.280
that would gather information
and funnel it

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.360
to the headquarters
in New York City.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.040
And they would process
that information

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.460
and would sell it to
their subscribers.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.460
And they would sell it as credit
reports and credit ratings.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.000
And if you've paid attention to the
global financial crisis of 2008,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.300
you may have heard

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.220
of the issuer-pays
business model for ratings.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.920
This was the user-pays business
model, which is to say the person

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.160
who was paying for this information
was the individual who was going

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.170 position:56%
to use it to make a credit decision.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.630
Either to lend money to someone
or not, depending upon the rating

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.860
that was supplied by
Lewis Tappan and his firm.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:08.340
So here's a page from the New
York Daily Tribune from 1844,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.530
shortly after he's set up
his firm and is running.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.830
And he's based -- you know,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.390
this is just shear
advertising, you know, marketing.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.930
You know, the modern equivalent
would show up, if you go to Google,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.570
you know, an ad would pop up.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.660
But in the old days you would
publish it in a newspaper.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.030
But there's -- I've got
the big arrow there,

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.760
and I don't know whether
you can read it.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.890 position:56%
He's basically telling his customers
here is the proof of the pudding.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.330 position:56%
Here's why you should subscribe to
my business, pay for my information.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.890
He says, no better way has been
thought of this then for such

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.810
to bring a list of the
bad debts they have made,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.750
since the establishment
of the agency in 1841,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.560
and ascertain how the debtor
stood on the books of the agency

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.080
when the goods were sold to them.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.850
He's basically saying bring your
bad debts to me, all the people

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.220
that have defaulted,
and look in my books.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.310
And I will show you
that the information

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.640
that I possess would have allowed
you to anticipate those bad debts.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.630
If you have come to me then,

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.700
you would have saved
yourself all this grief.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.990
That's the kind of test he's
putting to his would-be customers.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.490
So here's a kind of a
stylized network diagram

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.360
of how this business worked.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.770
So, in the middle, we've got
the New York City head office,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.090
and they are still in
that area of the country.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.100 position:56%
They had a growing network of branch
offices, and the branch offices were

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.390
in places like Chicago or
Peoria or San Francisco,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.800
and eventually they went overseas.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.710
And they gathered, the branch
offices gathered information

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.560
from the firms that were
being rated themselves.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.620
So they would send out
people to, you know,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.560
to solicit information
from a business.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.540
They relied on key informants.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.980
That is, there were people
who knew what was going

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.810
on in a particular town.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.540
And they also had a kind
of generalized sentiment

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.460
that they called the
trade, which was sort

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.300
of like what does the market
think of your particular firm?

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.760
Right? So all of those three
sources would funnel information

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.440
to branch offices,
and they would pass it

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.680
on to the headquarters
in New York City.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.420
They also had a network
of direct correspondents.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.200
That is, people who
supplied information courtesy

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.060
of the US Postal system
directly to the head office.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.660
Then they would compile all that
information and turn it really

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.960
into two products that
they would sell

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.030
to their customers
who are at the bottom.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.980
They sold reference books,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.500
and I will show you
what those looked like,

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.520
and they also sold
commissioned reports.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.800
That is, somebody could
commission a report specifically

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.480
about a particular business.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.570
But I'm going to focus
mostly on the reference books

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.840 position:56%
because they were the most important
of the informational products.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.650
So this is a couple of manuscript
pages that give you a sense

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.200
of what this information
looked like.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.680
On the far right, we've got
the Mercantile Agency RG Dun.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.470
That's the precursor
of Dun &amp; Bradstreet,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.850
which you may have heard of.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.650
And in this case, they've
written a letter to a firm

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.640
and said tell us about
your business.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.850
And the person who receives

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.490
that letter presumably would have
submitted some sort of report

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.240
to Dun &amp; Bradstreet
or Dun, excuse me.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.270
And they would have
taken that and coded it

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.980
in a particular kind of way.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.840
And on the left-hand side is
a page of one of the ledgers,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.780
the sort of core proprietary
information that they gathered.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.990
And what's fun about it
and let's see if I can --

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.280
yeah, I can get this
laser thing going.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.420
They liked, as correspondents,
local attorneys because an attorney

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.680
in a small town knew
everyone's business, literally.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.240
Because if you ran a small
business, you would need someone

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.610
to write contracts,
to collect debts.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.670
You know, there'd be
some low-end legal work.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.950
And so local attorneys knew a lot.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.480
They were a fabulous
source of information.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.510
And you can't see this --

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.810
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.460
Now I come back into the camera.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:10.310
I have just indicated for the
camera's benefit a part in the page

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.210 position:56%
where they identify a local attorney

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.540
and this is Sangamon
County, which is in Illinois.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.240
And there's a fellow named Abraham
Lincoln who eventually moved closer

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.600
to where we are today
and did something.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.900
I can't remember what.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.970
But he was when Honest
Abe early on his career.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.990
He was a local attorney,
and he provided information

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.980
to the Mercantile Agency.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.660
It would go to the head office, and
the head office looked like this.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.740
They look like business
offices, with lots of clerks

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.650
and filing cabinets
and people running

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.760
around processing information.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.300
Remember, this is the 19th
century equivalent of big data.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.430
They are gathering information
on a scale that's unprecedented,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.500
and they are processing it and
collating it and preserving it.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.800
And then they're selling it again.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.260
So they're commodifying it.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.940 position:56%
And it happens in offices like this.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.850
The big difference
you'll note between '76

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.950
and '83 is overhead lighting.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.050
It helps when you're in
an office to have lights.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.310
Right? And yeah, you can see that.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.080
Here's a branch office in
Saint Paul, Minnesota, 1895.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.250
One of the things that's
characteristic

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.960
of the Mercantile Agency in
all of these is they were

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.090
on the cutting edge of information
technology 19th century style.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.630
In the 19th century, IT meant
filing cabinets and typewriters

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.440
and secretaries and stuff like that

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.560
and you can see they're amply
provisioned with all of that.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.090
So this is sort of the site of
the work that is being done.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.220
It's informational work.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.850
So they receive a bunch
of information

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.590
from these multiple sources.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.430 position:56%
They come in in the form of letters,

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.210
and the letters are
transcribed into a ledger.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.440
And this is a page from one of the
ledgers, and this is for businesses

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.680
that are in Bristol
County in Massachusetts.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.790
The original letters are
destroyed, partly in order

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:03.060
to protect the confidentiality
of the information sources.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.920
So they didn't want people to know
who their correspondents were.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.130
That always was going
to be a secret thing.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.890
So to accommodate that,
they destroyed the letters,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.870
and they would record the content

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.760
of the information
in ledgers like this.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.710
To give you a closer look, again,
this is going back to Boston.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.010
It's RG Dun.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.310
It's beautiful penmanship.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.410 position:56%
You know, you kind of can appreciate
the decline of penmanship in America

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.490
by looking at these documents.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.620
But they're still kind
of hard to read.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.590
And so what I've done is
transcribed a couple of entries,

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.610
just to give you a sense
of what did they know.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.180
When they were busy trying to
ascertain the trustworthiness

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.790
of a would-be debtor
or a small business,

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.780 position:56%
what did they actually want to know?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.550
Well here is a couple of examples.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.530
So this is the entry
for a dry goods firm

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.250
where the proprietor's
name is Nathan Tiffany.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.400
And his address is 771
West Madison Street.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.860
And, if you know Chicago,
that's actually quite,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.290
you know, just west of the loop.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.530
And I've highlighted in
red a couple of things,

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.620
just to call your attention
to some of the detail here.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.240
The first entry is
from October 13, 1873.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.510
So when somebody kind of
came on their radar screen,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.900
they would receive
information from time to time,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.200
and they would update it.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.500
And every update involved
another entry.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.240
So, in October of 1873, they note

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.150
that Nathan Tiffany has made
the following statement.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.270
And what this means is they
have gone to Nathan Tiffany,

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.550
and they've gathered
information directly from him,

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.240
and he has been cooperative.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.030
He has made a statement.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.780
Sometimes they would go to somebody
and that individual would refuse

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.970
to provide any information,
and they would note that fact.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.640
So-and-so refused to
provide a statement.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.250
And, of course, the thought
there is what are they hiding?

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.230
Why aren't they telling
us what's going on?

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.760
But here Nathan Tiffany
has provided a statement.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.140
He said he was in business
for about four months.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.890
He used to be a clerk for
Field Leiter &amp; Company

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.520
and if you know Chicago, you'll
know that Marshall Field's used

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.210
to be a very big department
and in the 1870s,

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.680
it was called Field Leiter.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.430 position:56%
So here's a guy who's in the dry
goods business whose personal career

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.000
links him to one of the
prominent local firms.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.300
That's a good sign.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.340
That means he may know
what he's doing.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:25.830
He has stock of about
$1,800 to $2,000 worth.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.330
That's the 18c and this [inaudible]
interesting mixture of Roman

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.180
and Arabic numerals here.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.320
So he has stock worth
slightly less than $2,000.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.220
And he has liabilities
worth around $300,

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.880
so it's kind of an informal
balance sheet for the firm.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.430
Assets and liabilities.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:49.690
He owns real estate, city lots
in his own name, that are worth

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.540
about $1,500 and free
of encumbrance.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.600
So this is real estate
that isn't mortgaged.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.410
And then they talked
about some of the property

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.370
that the wife has, and
then we go to 1874.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.390
It turns out he owns
a lot in Hyde Park.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.140
Of course, where University
of Chicago is.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.210 position:56%
And then we go to 1877 at the bottom
-- I'm skipping over some detail --

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.950
and let's stick with the red.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.990
And here is another kind of
telling bit of information.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.850
He is an honest, industrious
Englishman.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.860
Close and conservative
in his business

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.770
and not likely to go
beyond his depth.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.780
His statement is thought to
be substantially correct,

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.570
and he is considered a good
risk for small lines of credit.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.380
So this guy gets a good rating.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.700 position:56%
Right? And he's given a statement,
and they have observed to themselves

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.270
that they believed his statement.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.630
Very frequently they don't
believe somebody's statement

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.930
because they're not idiots.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.480
They know that sometimes somebody
will issue a statement that's

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.720
manifestly an exaggeration.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.980
So they're skeptical about
the information they receive,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.750
but they've drawn their
own conclusions.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.570
And they do this sort of
outrageous national stereotyping.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.650
So here's the honest,
industrious Englishman.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.680
Thank goodness for honest,
industrious Englishmen.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.140
So again, here's another entry, and
I'll go over this one more quickly.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.930
And this is from Peoria, Illinois,

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.650
downstate on a guy named
John Markgroff in 1871.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.600
Again, they talked about his
assets and his liabilities.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.000
He has $1,000 to $1,200 dollars
in stock, owns no other property,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.290
has not a desirable
business location

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.140
and not much is known of him here.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.760
So there's a little bit of a
cloud of a mystery over this guy,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.410
and he doesn't seem to
be in a great location.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.400
Then we go to 1873.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.110
They say not much means.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.840
Honest and considered good
for any bills he may contract.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.360
Is worth about $4,000.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:40.260
So between 1871 and 1873, it seems
that his situation has improved.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:45.350
And then in 1875, we go back to the
outrageous national stereotyping.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.090
He's a good careful German.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.550
Right? So this is one of the things
that you do see in the records,

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.960
is this kind of national
stereotyping

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.490
and it really is a shorthand way of
talking about somebody's character.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.790
Where do they come from?

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.160
What kind of a person are they?

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.730
And on it goes.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:06.790 position:56%
That is not -- I should flip back --
this is the proprietary information

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.170
that they did not share
with their customers.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.490
It's what they accumulated.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.230
It was their sort of knowledge
base, but what they sold

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.220
to their customers was
stuff that looked like this.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.950
A published reference book.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.770
It looks like a phone directory,

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.780
even though this is
before there are phones.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.280
But to blow it up.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.990
What you have is an
alphabetical listing of firms

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.680
by the name of the proprietor.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.990
So we've got James Farrell who
it turns out is an undertaker,

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.480
not someone you want to meet.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.340
And then there's a score, E2.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.760
And so if you wanted to, you know,
sell coffins to James Farrell,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.530
for example, and you wanted
to know if he's going to pay.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.250
If he's good on the coffins.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.410
Then you would look him up,
you know, as a subscriber.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.950
You'd look at the entry
and you'd go E2.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.130
Oh yeah, okay, what does that mean?

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.120
And there would be a key, and
that's the stuff on the right.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:09.500
Let me disappear off camera
[inaudible] would basically

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.210
interpret for the user the
meaning of these categories.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.610
The summary ordered categories.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.910
So the rating process that was
happening inside these firms

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.450
translated ledger information
into an ordinal category system,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.110
which they then made available
to their customers and sold

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.580
in these giant reference books.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.670
What is interesting is that behind
that transformational process,

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:39.230
taking this very narrational
qualitative information

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.900
and turning it into a score or
a rating, there was no method,

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.950
algorithm, protocol, or procedure.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.970
It was an entire opaque mystery.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.160
They sold these ratings
to their clients.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.590
And you know when somebody
subscribed to a reference book.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.740
They got these keys to kind
of tell them what that meant.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.430
And so, in the particular example
that's probably a little too fine

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.060
grained for you to see,
at the top is double A.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.640
And that means the
pecuniary strength

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.140
of the firm is rated
over a million dollars.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.440
That's a big firm.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.380
And so, if you looked up some firm
and it had double A attached to it,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.010
you probably would conclude yeah,
I can lend money to that person.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.910
They're going to be good
for it because double A,

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.110 position:56%
it's like triple A with bonds today.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:28.380 position:56%
It's the highest, most credit-worthy
category you can imagine.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.100
And these things got published.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.120
They were, you know,
constantly being updated.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.300
Originally they were published
annually and then twice

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.750
and then four times a year.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.150
And the wonderful thing
about this method is

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.450
that it was very scaleable.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.220
That is, you could take this and
apply it to a small community

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.250
or to a small part of the country.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.890 position:56%
But you could also blow it up and
just keep on adding new communities,

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.510
gathering more information,

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:57.050
and gradually building an ever-more
encompassing network of information

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.170
that basically captured everyone.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.240 position:56%
So here are two -- this little chart
gives you two pieces of information

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.710
about the growth of
the Mercantile Agency.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:14.140
One on the -- let's see -- it's the
little red purple, I think it looks

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.870
like on the left-hand
scale, gives you the number

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.620
of firms that were being rated.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.370
And when they started to do rating
books at the end of the 1850s,

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.650
they rated about 20,000 firms.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.930
So that's, you know, in this
ink and paper kind of method.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.050
But by the end of the 19th century,
they're well into the millions.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.970
Okay? So it's a giant scale.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.790
They're providing more
information about businesses

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.940
than anyone else in
the United States.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.520
And then their firm itself
grew, and I used the number

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.880
of branch offices to track that.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.850 position:56%
They start, of course, with one
office when they're founded in 1841.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.940
And that's the right-hand scale.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.600
And there are a couple of
periods where they plateau.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.390
That is, they don't expand much.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.010
The Civil War is one.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.300
The recession of the
1890s is another.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.500
But basically they
grow phenomenally.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.510
So this is a wildly
successful business.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.890
Providing information
about the trustworthiness

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.830
of others is a great way to
make a buck in the 19th century.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.810
Because there was such demand for
information that creditors can use

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.200
to resolve this problem
of uncertainty.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.880
And it's not a national story.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.490
They go overseas.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.080
And so this, in 1916, is
from one of their documents

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.030
that gives the branch
offices that are abroad.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.470
They go into Canada.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.780
They go to Europe.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.630
They go to Australia.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.530
Latin, you know, South America.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.090
They're all over the place.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:45.180
And just to give you a sense --
you know, in 1916, let's see.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.370
Perth, Australia, you
know, in Western Australia.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.820
In 1916, there wasn't a
lot going on in Perth.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.460
Right? But whatever was going on
in Perth, you would know about it,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.320
if you were a subscriber
to Dun's Mercantile Agency.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.280
That's how panoptic and
encompassing the scope was.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.410
So the information, as
I said, is gathered,

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.320
and it's kept in these
proprietary ledgers,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.420
but then it gets turned
into a score.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.190
And the key evolves over time,

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:16.990
but one thing that doesn't
change is the fact that the key,

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.200
or the information that
gets sold to the customer,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.890
is always cast as a
ordered category.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.400
It's always a matter
of classifying a firm.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.970
And so the first category system,
the first ordinal category system

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.670
from 1859, has at the top A number
one, then number one, then one

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.230
and a half, two, and so forth.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:38.980
So you can see the order.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.220
And the meaning of A
number one is the following.

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.690
Of longstanding, good antecedents.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.870
Business comparatively
devoid of hazard.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.200
Ample means in and large
wealth out of business.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.500
Credit unlimited.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.540
So that's as good as you
were going to get in 1859.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.690
That was just a way of saying
throw money at this borrower

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.140
because they're going to be fine.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.490
And then, of course, you
work your way down the scale.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:07.610
And, in the early 1850,
excuse me, late 1850s --

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.350
and here's something from
the Banker's magazine.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:15.300 position:56%
It's clear that the larger business
community recognized the value here.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.670
So it wasn't just that they
were promoting themselves

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.570
and saying this is
great information.

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.600
There were authorities like
bankers who also weighed in.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.850
And said, for example, the
valuable services it --

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.670
the Mercantile Agency -- has
rendered to the domestic trade

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.720
of the country as a check upon
our credit system are acknowledged

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.390
by the mercantile community.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:36.790
So this is basically a way
of recognizing the fact

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.020
that this stuff seemed
to really work for those

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.510
who used it, this information.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.620
So one of the interesting
things that happens

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.180
over time is the evolution
of the category system.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.750
So the first one from 1859.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.840
Now we have a two-dimensional
category system,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.480
where we've got A plus on top
and then A, B, C, you know,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.650
all the way down to L. And
then on the right-hand column,

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.560
you've got A1, and this use

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.010
of alphanumeric labels
underscores the fact

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.010
that these are ordered categories.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.430
Here we've got more
ordered categories

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.570
from the Mercantile
Agency in British Columbia

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.850
at the end of the 19th century.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:19.660
And another congratulatory
headline from the Chicago Tribune.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.960
The headline says it all.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.890
The Mercantile Agencies, They Have
Grown Indispensable to Business.

00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:27.970
So this is a thing that really
took off and really locked

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:31.160
in to the American
business community.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.360
And one of the interesting
things about it is that,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.690
although in its origins
it really dealt

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.950
with short-term unsecured
trade credit,

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:45.630
it gained such a powerful hold over
the ways in which people started

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.950
to think about credit
and credit worthiness.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:51.750
That it was very natural for
John Moody, when he started

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.110
to rate railway bonds in 1909,

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.730
that he would adopt essentially
the same kind of system.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.350
So when we get into long-term
bonds, which, as you know,

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.130
is a very different kind of
credit problem, you know,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.020
for capital intensive businesses.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.450 position:56%
Like the railroads or for sovereigns
or for any of this other big stuff.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.070
It was natural to use
the ordered categories.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.830
So here we've got John
Moody who started

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.400
to rate railway bonds in 1909.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.300 position:56%
And I don't happen to have the slide
of the 1909 ordinal categories.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.650
But, in 1912, it's the same setup.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.100
And you can see at the top
is triple A and then double A

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.070
and then A. Very much
like a modern bond rating.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.550
So Moody basically
said this great system

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.700 position:56%
for assessing short-term unsecured
trade credit and the trustworthiness

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.500
of borrowers in that world,
I'm simply going to apply

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.250
to long-term corporate debt,
starting with the railroads.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.550
And it worked.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.660
He succeeded just as well
as the predecessors had.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.540
And we can move forward in time.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.320
And here's Standard &amp; Poor's
and other bond-rating agency

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.550
from the late 1940s, and again,

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.420
you see the same old
ordinal category system.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.500
So this way of thinking
about trustworthiness

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.990
as somehow involving categorization

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.610
into an ordered category
system really gets locked in

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.210
and is reproduced going forward.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.640
Even as, of course, the world

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.190
of business is changing,
this system does not.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.620
And so we have Dun &amp;
Bradstreet categories from 1960

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.630
and ratings are breaking
out all over,

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.660
so you could find a rating book
for a particular firm or excuse me,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.080
for a particular location.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.390
In this case, Cleveland.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.980
And this is -- I just note --

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.550
is around the same time that
the Cubs last won the World

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.850
Series [laughter].

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.150
Isn't that interesting?

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.450
How did that get in there?

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:48.590
Anyway, so this kind of thing
is going on all the time.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.970
If you wanted to sell goods to an
individual in Cleveland in 1909,

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.230
you would be a subscriber
to a volume such as this.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.290
And you would look
up the person's name.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.230
And this is for individuals
now, not for businesses.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.160
And you'd look them up and they
might be given an A rating,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.100
in which case they'd
be a good customer,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.390
or they might be given an F
rating, which means not so good.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.690
And so forth.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.420
There were ratings that
were attached to industries.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.340
And so here's the seafood
industry in 1913.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.640
Same story.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.220
This, as an idiom for
examining or for gathering

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.520
and portraying information

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.130
about trustworthiness
becomes very widespread.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.860
So one of the big issues,
one of the big mysteries

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.080
to this project is how
useful were these ratings?

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:36.270
They obviously succeeded, in the
sense that the business of creating

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.330
and selling ratings spread.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:43.250
But did they actually -- what did
they actually do for the users?

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.870
And here, the credit raters
themselves made very strong --

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:50.010
but I would say ambiguous
claims -- about their ratings.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.100
Which is to say they would insist

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.660
that their customers will do very
well to pay for the information

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.190
that they were going to sell.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.680
But they were a little canny about
saying, by the way, you'll be able

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.820
to predict who's going
to fail and who not,

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.810 position:56%
if you subscribe to our information.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:09.240
They kind of fudged and hedged
when it came to that kind of stuff.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.410
So one -- in another
stage of my project,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.160
what I did was gather a data set

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.230
of 247 Chicago dry
goods firms from 1879.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.530
And what I've done is --

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:24.610 position:56%
and I picked dry goods firms because
these were sort of the predecessors

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.470
of the modern department store,

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.490
and they were very heavily
embedded in credit networks.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.420
That is, they obtained
credit from their suppliers.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.190
They extended credit
to their customers.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:39.200
And so they -- for them, in
particular, good management

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.260
of credit was absolutely
critical to their success.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.030
And, of course, Chicago in
the 1870s is a booming place,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.370
with lots of business.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.200
And so the population of dry
goods firms is expanding.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.060
There're new funds being added.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.820
There's old ones going
bankrupt and so forth.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.870 position:56%
And what I did in this project was
to link that proprietary information

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:02.260
that you've seen that was contained

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.600
in the ledgers to the
published rating.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.100
And then to see does
that predict failure

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.040
or distress of the rated firm?

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.750
That is, could you use the rating

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.270
to predict who's going
to fail and who not?

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.510
Who would be a good risk?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.810
And who not?

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.760
And there are multiple rating
agencies working at this time.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.060
There's Dun.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.360
There's Bradstreet.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.400
And then there's another one,
McKillop-Sprague [phonetic].

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.470 position:56%
And they're all rating two different
dimensions of each business.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.780
One dimension called
pecuniary strength

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:39.350
and another one called
general credit.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.990
So this is what dry
goods firms looks like.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.130
As I said, they sort of -- well,
maybe you can't see that too well.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:49.360
They look a little bit like Ye Olde
[phonetic] Department Store, okay?

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.780
And, as I said, it's fair to
hold them up to the standard

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.080
of can they predict failure?

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.110
Because the firms themselves were
deeply interested in failure.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:03.390
In fact, the rating agencies
became definitive sources

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.730
of statistics about failure.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:08.310
And here's something from
Dun's Review in the 1890s,

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.420
where they've published a table
on commercial failures in 1896.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.370
So they are obsessed with
who is going to fail?

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.670
Who has failed?

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.020
Who's going to fail?

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.830
And therefore saying that their
ratings might have something to do

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.540
with failure, if it all
works, I think is a fair test.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.340
They became the definitive
source for failure information.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.720
That is, in the 19th
century, if you wanted to know

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.630
like were there a lot
of failures last year?

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.100
You would turn to Dun or you
would turn to Bradstreet.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.910
There was no independent
government agency -- pardon me --

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.740
that was keeping track
of these things.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.190
And so what I've got here
are two panels of other media

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.380
who reproduced the Dun figures.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.920
So on the left-hand side we've got
the Atlanta Daily Constitution,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.940
which is written -- just a
little fluff piece, you know,

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.190
kind of general business
news on failures in 1878.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:59.490
And when they want to
talk about failures,

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:04.330
they simply reproduce the
statistics created by RG Dun.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.310
And on the right-hand side, we
have the Banker's magazine talking

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.800
about how you could construct
a science of failures.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.200
So there's a real sense
that there's a way

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:20.040
in which analytically we can find
out what lies behind failure.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.720
And Bradstreet's itself, which was
one of the other rating agencies,

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.230
is quite explicit about suggesting

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.040
that you could use their
ratings to predict failure.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.150
And so they offered the
following table from the 1880s

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:35.810
where you are supposed
to notice that the firms

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.640
that fail are the firms
that had low ratings.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.540
You, as the customer, were
invited to make that connection

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.350
and therefore go ahead
and say ah-ha,

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.880
I should subscribe to Bradstreet.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.160
Because that will let me
avoid the failed firms.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.860
Because, as a creditor,
if my customer fails,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.220
I lose money and I don't want that.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.110
So -- but back to my exercise.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.420 position:56%
Here is a massive correlation table,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.080
and I'm sorry to inflict
this on you.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.430
It's late Friday afternoon,
so this is the wakeup.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:09.880
You know, see who's
still paying attention.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.500
And really this is a part
of a correlation matrix

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:20.130
where I've basically taken my 247
dry goods firms and I've looked at,

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.850
for different rating agencies,

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:26.080
what kind of a rating they
attach to the particular firm.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.820
Across the different rating
agencies but also over time.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.020
And there are two features
that are worth noting,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.320
and I've put those in the title.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.350
Convergence and Durability.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.830 position:56%
That is, although we're not entirely
sure what they were measuring

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.480
because there was no algorithm

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.310
that said how you take this
narrational qualitative ledger

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.870
information and turn
it into a score.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.720
There's no formula there.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.940
Nevertheless, they
agreed among themselves.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:43:00.890
That is, Dun, if Dun said such
and such a firm, you know,

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:05.260
has a high rating and
is very credit worthy.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.320
The other rating agencies
would tend to agree.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.800
So you see these are correlations

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.640
in the point nine and
point eight level.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.940
That's a lot of agreement.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.880
So lots of convergence.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.710
People tend to agree on who does
or does not have credit worthiness.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.820
And it's a durable feature,
which is to say a firm

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.280 position:56%
that is credit worthy one year tends

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.950
to be deemed credit
worthy the next year.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:31.640
So this is a durable
feature, whatever it is.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.230
Now I'm going to try
to be gentle here.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:40.370
But this is a kernel
density estimate --

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:43.950
let me provide a little background.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.740
Basically, what we would love

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:50.660 position:56%
or what the Dun &amp; Bradstreet would
love is for their ratings to be able

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.480
to discriminate between the firms
that fail and the firms that don't.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:00.900
And so what I've put on there is
the scale of pecuniary strength,

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.010
which starts at zero
and goes up to 25.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.720
And this is the distribution of
firms that are in the sample.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.300
Okay? So that 247 firms,
they were all given ratings

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.110
of pecuniary strength, and
I've simply drawn a chart

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.930
that shows the distribution
over that dimension.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.350
And you can see that most of them,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.740
they're kind of on the
left-hand side of the axis.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.400
Which is to say a lot of
these were small businesses

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.670
that had low ratings
of pecuniary strength.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.400
No surprise there.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.970
But there's two lines.

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.190
One is red and one is blue.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.830
And that is yes they failed.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:37.130
That's blue.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.430
And red. No they didn't.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.720
And if measures of pecuniary
strength were able to tell

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.620
or detect a difference between
those firms that fail and those

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.570 position:56%
that don't, those two distributions,

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.450
those lines should
not be overlapping.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:52.060
And they do overlap.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.360
It's messy.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.660
There's noise and all
that kind of stuff.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.760
But there is no clear way
in which the Dun rating

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.140
of pecuniary strength is
discriminating between firms

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.910
that failed and firms that
didn't, of these sample of 247.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.940
I did the same exercise
for the other dimension

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.970
of credit worthiness
called general credit.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.430
Same story.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:19.970
There is no way in which this
information is cleanly separating

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:26.470
out firms by their eventual fate
as either solvent or insolvent.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:30.710
So and I've got a table, if anyone
wants to hear more in the Q&amp;A.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:36.020
So the short answer to the question
of did this information work?

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.920
Is no, not much.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.090
Didn't do a lot and
yet it succeeded.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:45.870
So there was widespread agreement
that the ratings were useful.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.500
The agencies were quite
equivocal about their accuracy,

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.310
but it all succeeded despite
their predictive deficiencies.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.230
So people were paying for
information that it turns

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.570
out really wasn't doing
a whole lot for them.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.850
At least in the sense of can
you predict who's going to fail?

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:05.760
Which customers are going, you
know, not repay their debts?

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.330
What was driving it?

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:08.730
Well, here what's interesting.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.830
There's two other features
of this information

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:14.920
that I have noticed really
were shaping what was going

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.580
on in the 19th century.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.330
This is a form of intellectual
property.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.790
Right? These were for-profit
businesses that created information

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.640
and sold it to their customers.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.220 position:56%
It's a form of intellectual property
and naturally they were interested

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.800
to protect their intellectual
property.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.840
So it turns out that a lot
of what they were doing

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.330
in the 19th century was not
in the service of accuracy

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.090
and greater scientific
measurement of credit worthiness

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:41.560
and tracking outcomes and
all that kind of stuff.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.600
What they were mostly doing
was trying to prevent piracy.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.140
They didn't want somebody
to steal their information

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.340
or to pirate their reference books.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.460
So a lot of what they were doing,
in relation to their customers,

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:57.500
wasn't providing information, it
was hiding it and protecting it

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.990
because of this concern for piracy.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:04.360
The other major legal
issue that taxed them was

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.090 position:56%
that when you're selling information

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.720
and when people are making
decisions, consequential decisions,

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.530
on the basis of that information,

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.110
sometimes things don't
work out well.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.720
You know? Somebody lends
money to someone who turns

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.010
out defaults on the loan.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.490
And being good Americans,
in the 19th century,

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.710
one place where you would
seek redress is to go

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:27.400
to court and start suing.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.960
And so the rating agencies
were deeply concerned

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.740
about two classes of lawsuits.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.590
They were worried about
firms that had --

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:42.220
who were their clients and
who'd look at another firm

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.260
that was given a high
rating and loaned the money.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.810
And then they hadn't repaid.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.630
And then they basically
said to Dun you told us

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.370
that this was a great firm.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:53.140
And they're bums, and
now I've lost money.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.130
I relied on you to give
me accurate information,

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.430
so I'm going to sue you.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.310
So there were a bunch of lawsuits
that came out of that path.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:02.070
And the other one was the firms
that were being rated themselves.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.510
Very often somebody would file
a suit and claim, in effect,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:09.510
I had a great little business going
until you gave me that low rating

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.670
and now I'm ruined because
no one will lend me money.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.280
You ruined me.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.580
I'm going to sue you.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.850
Right? So a lot of work was going
on for these two legal concerns

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:25.280
that really shaped the
nature of the business.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.390
So what happens to these ratings
through all their wrinkles

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:30.550
and faults and curiosities?

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.480
Well, as I said, they
succeed wildly.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.350
They spread throughout
the US economy.

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:39.400
They get adopted by other markets
that cared deeply about risk.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.150
In particular, the banks and
the credit insurance companies.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.470
You know, other firms whose
fate relies on their ability

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:50.010
to assess risk and to calibrate
it appropriately and to lend

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.880
to the credit worthy and
not to those who aren't.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.020
They had a great appetite for this.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.760
As I mentioned, the
categories were adopted

00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:02.240 position:56%
by John Moody to rate railway bonds.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.710
The ratings, the bond ratings,
were used by Federal Reserve Banks

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.070
to govern access to the
discount window which,

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.160
in the early 20th century,
was the major thing

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.860
that a Federal Reserve
Bank would do for members.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.120
Bond ratings were adopted
by various regulators,

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.100
starting in the Great Depression,
such as the Comptroller of Currency

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.820
for evaluation of bond holdings.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.060
And so what you see is a spread in
the private use of this information

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.080
and also in the public
regulatory use of this information.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.570
So for all of its warts, this
information gets deeply inscribed

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.280
into the basic decision-making
machinery

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.270
of our modern credit economy.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.900
And going forward to the
end of the 20th century,

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.790
you find bond ratings are used

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.390
in the over-the-counter
derivatives market.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:49.680
You know, which now --
you know when in 2008

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.510
where there were those big scary
numbers about hundreds of trillions

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.230
of dollars of value in the OTC.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:58.040
You know, that OTC market
is built around ratings.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.380 position:56%
If you go deep into the contractual
machinery you find ratings are there

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.340
as well.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.770
So here's just a couple of
slides of credit insurance.

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.110
And then how you would use
it if you were interested.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.170
Here's going to a global
regulatory standards,

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.010
the Basel two bank
capital standards,

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.930
and you can see the risk
weights go directly off

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.420
of the ratings that are given.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:23.220
Triple A to double A and you get a
zero percent risk weight and so on.

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:27.260
So this is just kind of
bearing out what I talked about.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.950
This machinery that was
invented to talk about businesses

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:32.200
and then big businesses
and then banks.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.260
It also was applied to individuals.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.270
Everyone in this room, I'll
wager, has got a FICO score.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:43.870
And that's something that follows
you around and your, you know,

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:46.410
ability to get a new
credit card and the terms

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.250
under which a credit
card would be given you,

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.530
all of this is driven
by your FICO score.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:54.030
It's better to have a high
score than a low score.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:58.580
But that was a way in which
household consumer credit adopted

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.130
effectively the same kind of system

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:04.710
that originally was invented
for small businesses.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:08.320
Which is to say create
a rating system.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.150
And then credit can go to
people who are unknown to you

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:14.440
who are complete strangers.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.460
So I'm winding to the end here.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:22.550
So the bottom line of, you
know, this big historical sweep,

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.090
these strange changes that have
occurred, this form of information

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:31.710 position:56%
that seemed to take over our economy
despite its manifest deficiencies.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.040
What's going on here?

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.440
Well one of the interesting
things for me is

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.360
to witness how soft information
is turned into hard information,

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.250
and this is a term borrowed
from financial economics.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:46.270
The soft information is
what you saw in the ledgers.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.570
You know, it was this sort

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.300
of characterological
assessment of someone.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.980
And he just moved in and he had,
you know, has a good career going

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.070
because he learned from
the best in the trade.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.080
And his wife has got some assets,
and he's a good Englishman.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.350
All of that is very
soft information.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.470
It gets turned into a hard score.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.920
And that process of
turning soft information

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.540
in hard is being reproduced
every day.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:13.380
And when your FICO score
comes out or is revised,

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.120
some algorithm is doing
exactly the same thing.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.570
They're taking the trail of
your engagement in the economy

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.940
and they're turning
it into a number.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.040
And they're using that number
to drive all kinds of decisions

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.520
that are very fateful for you.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.770
So how to characterize that.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:33.690
This is a shift from
idiosyncratic, equivocal,

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.950
qualitative character assessments,

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:39.160
which is sort of the old-fashioned
way, to this more systematic,

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.260
unequivocal quantitative
measurement of trustworthiness.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.870
Now this may sound to you
like a good thing, you know,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.960
because numbers are more accurate,
and numbers have this sort of all

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.540
of the baggage of science
and accuracy and so on.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.990
But, in fact, I want to
remind you that there is a --

00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:02.250
it's much less a happy
story of progress.

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:05.600
So when all of that massive
information gets boiled

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.580
down into a single rating or score,

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:13.000
simplification necessarily
excludes lots of information.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.190
That is, you may think [inaudible]
there's the cloud of noise

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.520
and now we're going
to have the signal.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.610
But, in fact, the signal
ignores a lot

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:22.540
of the information that's
contained in that cloud.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.600
I got to stop waving my hands here.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.910
And so, for example, the
relationality [phonetic] of credit.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.720
The fact that trust is relational.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.630
It's between two individuals.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.400
That gets lost because the score
gets attached to the debtor

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.880
and the fact that how credit worthy
you are always really matters

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.490
in relation to whom.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:43.500
You know, I, as a borrower,
am probably more credit worthy

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.380
in relation to my sister
than I am to my bank.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.950
You know, if my bank
lends me 100 bucks.

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:52.050
Well, you know, I'll try to
repay them, but if my sister,

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.350
you know, lends me 100 bucks.

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:54.860
Well, I'm really going to
take care of my sister.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.230
Right? Because our relation is
very strong unlike the relation

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.850
between myself and my bank.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.140
And that fact is ignored.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.490
That's lost in this scoring.

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:08.840
There's a lot of ambiguous
and conflicting information

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.770
and what you get is a very precise
well-calibrated, unambiguous score.

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.660
You are exactly double A or
triple A or whatever it is.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.920
But, in fact, the real fact
of your life or the real fact

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.220
of the borrower is
much more ambiguous

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.090
and so why do we make
ambiguity go away?

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.070
Right? That's definitely a loss.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:30.260
The information is of
variable provenance.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.910
Some of it comes from very credible
sources and some of it from not.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.250
You know, some of it is
really gossip and hearsay.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:40.460
All of that variable provenance
gets lost in the score.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.600
The measurement process
itself is highly reactive.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.680
That is, when Dun sent a
staff member to a business

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.570
and said tell us about
your business.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:54.660
That business would go,
oh, it's the guys from Dun.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:55.960
I better tell a good story.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.660
I better make myself look good
because what they conclude

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.610
about me is going to affect
my life going forward.

00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:05.210
If they like me, I get a high
score, and I get lots of credit.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.520
And if they don't.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:09.860
Right? So they would try
to game the information.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:13.090
And, of course, Dun was mindful
of that, so they would try

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:15.700
to make adjustments for
whether they were being gamed.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.520
And so the whole thing
was very reactive.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.460
And of course the rating
process itself was very opaque.

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.440
We see a very substantial
increase in the scale and scope

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.760
of this information system.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.090
And one of the reasons
that we use it today is

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:34.040
because it has this strong affinity
with algorithmic decision-making.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.340
And you can see that in
the early 20th century,

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.570
in the way in which
credit insurance is priced.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.810
But the fact that you can go online

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:45.050
and enter your social
security number.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.590
And someone can link
that to your FICO score,

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:49.650
and in 30 seconds give you a loan.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:58.980
That only works because there
is a background of algorithms

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.630
and databases that can
construct a simple rule.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:06.900
You know? That the algorithm
will spit out a yes or a no,

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.630
depending upon your score.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.350
And they'll do it very
quickly at computer speed.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.080
And it's not that there's a loan
officer at the other end of that.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.030
It's completely outside
of human hands.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.650 position:56%
Right? So when you have quantitative
information about trustworthiness,

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:25.830 position:56%
you can build a computer program to
make the lending decisions that used

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.520
to be made by individuals.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.820
And that, of course, allows you

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.970
to make decisions on
a much bigger scale.

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.090
To do so much more
cheaply but not necessarily

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:35.670
to make better decisions.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:38.480 position:56%
These numbers are portable, and
they are used in different contexts.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.780
And so now what we've started

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.850
to realize is how much FICO scores
not only govern access to credit

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:46.090
but also govern access
to employment.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:48.970
Employers pay attention
to FICO scores.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:51.370
Insurance companies pay
attention to FICO scores.

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.200
Your auto insurance may be
priced depending upon your score.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.560
Landlords pay attention
to your FICO score.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.370
It's hard to rent an apartment
if you have a low score

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.720
because the landlord
will say no, no, no.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.150
I don't want you as a tenant.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:05.760
Right? So your fate in
many, many different parts

00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.680
of life are suddenly --
is going to get driven

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.990
by this one piece of information.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:14.030
And, as I said, these
measures have been commodified.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.430
And their legal status.

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.300
You know what sort of liabilities

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:22.430
and obligations are attended upon
them often drive what's going

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:25.550
on with that information much
more than their veracity.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.280
It's not simply a story of good
science and getting it right.

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.990
It's much more what
are my obligations?

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.900
And what are my vulnerabilities?

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.130
And, of course, credit itself
remains a very interesting

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:39.430
and contentious issue.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:41.160
And so I'm almost done here.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.840
Just think very briefly about
the politics of student loans.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.930
We know that student
debt is accumulating.

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:54.330
The top right-hand chart shows you
the various forms of debt going

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.790
through the financial
crisis of 2008.

00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.740
And what happened in 2008 is
that home equity loans went down.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.530
Credit card debt went down.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:04.900
Auto loans went down.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:10.380 position:56%
Student loans kept on rising and now
the burden, the aggregate burden,

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.280 position:56%
of student debt is very substantial.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.110
And there's people that are --
there's the politics of that.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:19.760
And so, in the bottom charts,
we've got some pictures

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.240
from some of the demonstrations.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:25.110
I love the you are not
a loan banner there.

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:27.020
And education should
not be a debt sentence.

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.200
So we know that someone
has a good sense of humor,

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.690
or at least they learned
how to have puns

00:58:31.690 --> 00:58:34.120
in college these days [laughter].

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:37.010
And finally it's not
just an American story.

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:41.430
So although in its origins
it is very much a US story.

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:44.320
This method is now going global.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.880
We know that the bond rating
agencies operate globally.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.150
So if you issue Greek
sovereign debt, you are beholden

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:55.460
to what Moody's and S&amp;P think of
your, you know, credit worthiness.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.790
But this is -- and I'm sorry
you can't really read it.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.090
It's legible here.

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:04.300
This is a couple of recent news
items that are basically reporting

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.320
on the fact that the Chinese
government is building a credit

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:12.260
system for the people of China that
is very much like our FICO scores.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.440
Right? So they are, you
know, as they move forward

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.920
in their socialist market
economy, they're trying

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.870
to construct a credit system
where every single individual

00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:23.990
in China is given a score
akin to a FICO score

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.500
and that will be used
in the same way.

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:26.800
To govern access to credit.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:32.540
But could be used like FICO scores
in lots of other contexts, as well,

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:35.100
and so it could be
extraordinarily fateful

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.700 position:56%
for the lives of individual Chinese.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.510
And that is it.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.310
Thank you very much.

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:49.510
[ Applause ]

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:53.190
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:56.280
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers: He's got
a mic there, so [inaudible].

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.840
Yep.

00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for
a wonderful presentation.

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:02.990
I learned a great deal
about the history of credit,

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:05.840
but I'm going to ask
a librarian question

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.110
about the sources that you used.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.470
I know the Library probably
has all these reference books

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:13.350
that are done printed.

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:16.840
But what about the
beautiful handwriting?

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:22.500
And I know the [inaudible] division
has Lewis Tappan personal papers.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:28.600
How much is business activity
mentioned in the Tappan papers?

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.370
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers: So the
main source for those ledgers,

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.580
the main repository
of those ledgers.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.350
I think there's around
1,200 of them.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.130
They're all massive bound volumes.

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:41.340
It's the Harvard Business School
library, the Baker Library.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:44.230
And what happened was that, at
the end of the 19th century,

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:47.900
Dun basically transitioned
from their old style

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:52.330
of keeping all their
information in ledgers to files.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.640
You know, in file cabinets.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.390
And I don't know who, but someone
had the great idea that instead

01:00:57.390 --> 01:01:00.740
of throwing all those old
ledgers out or burning them,

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.850
somebody decided to
give them to a library.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:06.750
And so historically-minded
economists and economic historians

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:10.070
and people like me have been
feasting off these things forever.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.420
So that sadly it didn't come
to the Library of Congress.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.000
But, as you noted, plenty
of other good stuff came

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.300
to the Library of Congress.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.710
So I had lots to do when I
was here this past summer.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:23.300
It's just that for the
core proprietary ledgers,

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.970
those are sitting in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:36.080
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering if you
-- if I could get your thoughts.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.010
I don't mean to go
in this direction,

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.840
but you brought up
politics at the end.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.750
On like the lead -- you mentioned
the lead up to the crisis.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:48.980 position:56%
If you thought there was any sort of
mismatch or weird dynamic going on,

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.570
whereby, you know, S&amp;P, Moody's,

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:55.710
and Fitch were all basically
kind of an oligopoly, right?

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.810
Granted by the government
through [inaudible] status.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:02.550
So I think it was like in
the [inaudible], you know,

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.390
where the banks were
basically paying.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:09.750
So I think it also goes back to
your point about who's paying

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.970
for the rating, and then,
as you know, in [inaudible].

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:17.160
So if you could talk a little bit
about the issues going on there.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.620
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers: How many
hours do you have [laughter]?

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.860
So I'll just say a couple of things

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.280
because really you've opened
up a giant can of worms.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:29.040 position:56%
I did mention that the original
business model was called user-pays.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.880
In the 1970s, the business
model changed.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.310
So for the bond rating agencies,
they also started with a user pays.

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.220 position:56%
And so, if you subscribe to Moody's,

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.790
Moody's would send
you a reference book.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.570
And you would use that, you know,
to decide which bonds you wanted

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:45.520
to buy, if you were
managing a pension fund

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.820
or some sort of portfolio.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:52.020
But starting in the 1970s, you
know, for a number of reasons,

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.180
one of which was the growing
use of the photocopier,

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.590
piracy really became a problem
for the bond rating agencies.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.210
Which is to say they -- anyone

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.190
with a photocopy machine could take
their reference books and start

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:05.540
to make multiple copies and
share them with their friends.

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.380
And so they were losing
money on that front.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:15.280 position:56%
But also the failure of Penn Central
was a real shock to bond markets,

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.270 position:56%
and Penn Central was a big railroad,
very blue chip, very unexpected.

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.250
And because they'd been given a
high rating and because they failed

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.120 position:56%
so spectacularly, a lot of investors
basically started to wonder well,

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.510
can we really trust
any of these ratings?

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.520
And so what happened
was a lot of issuers.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.370
That is, a lot of companies that
had issued bonds basically paid the

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:40.450
rating agencies to
rerate their bonds.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.970
And the rating agencies
realized oh my gosh,

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:45.610
we could have an issuer-pays
business model.

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:49.380
And then the piracy stuff doesn't
matter as much because the person,

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.600
you know, the cash now
comes from the firm

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.360
that wants to sell the bonds.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.920
But that, as we saw in
the lead up to 2008,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.430 position:56%
creates a real conflict of interest.

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:03.630
Which is to say the rating
agency, their customers,

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:07.210
not the person that's using the
information and who therefore would

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.290
like to have information
that was accurate.

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:14.390
It's the entity that is trying to
borrow money and therefore would

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:17.140
like as high a rating as possible.

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.260
Because if you have a high
rating, it's lower interest rates.

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.030
You borrow more money more cheaply.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:23.340
There's a better market.

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.910
All that kind of stuff.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:29.450
And so that conflict of interest
really reared its ugly head leading

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:30.750
up to 2008.

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:33.730
And I guess the other thing
that happened in the runup

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:38.860
and that really, you know,
worried people was the fact

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.780
that this is an apparatus, and
I'm going to stick with bonds

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.340
and securities like that.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.540
This is an apparatus
that was developed

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.350
around fairly straightforward
issuers.

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.700
Corporations, municipal
governments, sovereign governments,

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.490
utilities, railroads, and so forth.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:58.390
You know? But structured
finance, you know,

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:00.570
all that kind of big short stuff?

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.410
You know, the CDOs [phonetic],
the mortgage-backed securities.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:06.360 position:56%
That financial engineering
produces securities that are really,

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.820
really complicated, and there's
tranches [phonetic], and there's,

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:11.500
you know, modeling going on.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.650
And basically it's so
complicated that the only people

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:15.950
that can really understand
what's going

01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.430
on there are the mathematicians
and businesses who were hired

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.020
to create them in the first place.

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.810
Which is to say they
had a problem of how

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.140
to market a security
that is so complicated.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.880
Unlike a GM bond, where you
kind of go like how's GM doing?

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:32.700 position:56%
Right? But these new securities were
extremely complicated and opaque.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.540
And one of the tricks to selling
them was to classify them as if --

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.840
you know to use the
same category system

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.590
that had been traditionally
developed

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.550
for these much more
[inaudible] securities.

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:48.020
So a triple A mortgage-backed
security.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:52.500
The invitation to an investor was a
triple A mortgage-backed security,

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.230
well it's triple A. It's kind of
like a triple A, you know GE bond.

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:59.010
So all you need to know
is it's triple A. Right?

01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:00.700
It's going to be a good investment.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.710
So a lot of the financial
shenanigans and the complexity kind

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:08.200
of got masked by the use of
this very familiar label.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.940
And that, of course,
masked an enormous amount

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:17.830
of heterogeneity and,
you know, bad, bad risks.

01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:22.750
So you know, as 2008 went forward,

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:28.510
especially the subprime-backed
mortgage-backed securities

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:29.810
just plummeted.

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.080
They, a bunch of them had
been given triple A ratings,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.550
which were obviously was
wildly inappropriate.

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:39.770
And, as the real estate markets
in Florida and Southern California

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:45.010 position:56%
and Arizona caved, those things
started to experience defaults rates

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:48.170 position:56%
that were far, many orders of
magnitude higher than you should get

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.950
with triple A. So I think
-- and you know with --

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:56.610
and then people realized, as
you finally put your finger on,

01:06:56.610 --> 01:07:01.000
that this NRSRO [phonetic] status
was a kind of a special status.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.440
It was bestowed on a
small number of firms.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.860
And so leading up to [inaudible],

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.330
there was a very interesting
conversation

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.790
of whether this was a market

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.530
in which we should have
more competition or less.

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.140 position:56%
Right? More competition means we
allow other firms to kind of join in

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.310
and compete with them
maybe to do a better a job.

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:20.840
But here that intuition
runs up against the fact

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.400
that with issuer-pays business
model, they're competing

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.350
for the business of the issuers.

01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:30.360
And so, in fact, the competition
could drive them to be even laxer

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.370
and more non-rigorous
than the other way around.

01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:36.750
Because they all want
the issuer to use them,

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.570
to hire them to rate the bonds.

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:41.710
And the way in which you get
the issuer to use your service

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.080
as opposed to Moody's,
if you're S&amp;P,

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.780
is to come up with a nicer
rating, a higher rating

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.740
for the same set of securities.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.390
Which is going to push you in
the direction of making mistakes

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:53.720
and being overly optimistic
and all that kind of stuff.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.690
So I think it turned out
that the matter of, you know,

01:07:57.690 --> 01:08:00.330
do we want more competition
in this market or less?

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:03.230
It actually turned out to
be a little more complicated

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:05.880
than people thought.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.180
&gt;&gt; You have time for
one more question.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] mentioned towards the
end that this was a US origin story.

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:17.890
And I was wondering --
there was a -- I mean --

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.200
there's been colonial trade

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.090
and colonial trade
must have had some kind

01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:22.910
of credit rating system
of some sort.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.270
And so I'm wondering
what they did instead.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.630
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers: So I
didn't really emphasize this,

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:30.590
but before ratings
came along, of course,

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:34.200
credit pervades Colonial
and early America.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.940
But there are no ratings.

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.850
But what you have is reliance

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:41.200
on very old-fashioned
social network-based.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.890
You know, are we part
of the same community?

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:44.340
What's your reputation?

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.690
If I don't know who you are
directly, I know someone

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.710
who knows you, so direct ties.

01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.010
Indirect ties.

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:53.580
You know, kind of very
much a kind of the reliance

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.770
on existing social
networks, friendship,

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.070
kinship, acquaintanceship.

01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:58.420
You know, however they're styled.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.870 position:56%
To circulate the kind of
information about who's trustworthy.

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:05.690
And it turns out that does
characterize the United States

01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:07.780
before, and it also
actually characterizes a lot

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.080
of colonial trade.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.100
There were a few more network
businesses than the colonial trade,

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.610
so it was a small number,
you know, of major firms

01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:19.760
who mediated trade between, you
know, England and Colonial America.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.850
And within that, you know,
geographically dispersed

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:26.780
but socially compact group,

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.960
you could actually do quite a
good job circulating reputations.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.340
And so they really
didn't need ratings.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.270
It's when you start to deal
with a high volume of people

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:40.390
who are really true strangers
to you that you need to look

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:41.690
for a different solution.

01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:46.870 position:56%
And that, it turns out, broke out
mostly with a growing domestic trade

01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:51.830
in the US where, you know, if you
were a New York City supplier.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:55.740
The New York area, you could find
out what's going on pretty easily.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:59.090
But somebody from the Midwest,
in a city like Chicago,

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.730
you have no idea what's
going on there.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.520
You don't know any of those people.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.820
They're all strangers to you.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.190
And you don't have any direct
or indirect network ties

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.280
into that community, so
you're really looking

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.580
for someone to help you out.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.480
And that's why they stepped up.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.140
So, if you look at the
establishment of the railroads

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.670
and denser distribution

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.000
and transportation
linkages domestically.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.370 position:56%
That really opened up an
opportunity for the rating agencies.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:23.410
But, you know, the
question's a good one.

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:26.410
I think the old-fashioned
solution of, you know,

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:28.850
rely on social networks, you know.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.210
And because I know
you're a sociologist

01:10:30.210 --> 01:10:33.530
that probably doesn't
make you too mad.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.470
That actually works
with colonial trade

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:38.690
and a surprising amount
of long distance trade.

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:43.510
&gt;&gt; Daniele Turello: We hope
you'll continue the conversation

01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.070
over some refreshments.

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:48.590
Please join me in wishing good luck
to the Cubs, I think [laughter].

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:54.260
And thank you to Bruce Carruthers.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.830
&gt;&gt; Bruce Carruthers:
Thank you all [applause].

01:10:56.830 --> 01:11:00.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
