00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.290
Born into acting, by the age of five Jackie
Coogan, Jr. was a veteran stage performer

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.540
when Charlie Chaplin first spotted him in
1919.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.110
Immediately cast in Chaplin’s A Day’s
Pleasure, the hard-working Coogan went on

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:29.050
to star in The Kid (1919), Daddy (1923), Long
Live the King (1923), Tom Sawyer (1930) and

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.160
Huckleberry Finn (1931).

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.370
As a child, he was one of the highest paid
actors in Hollywood, but at the age of 21,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.370
when he tried to get access to the approximately
$4 million (about $67 million today) he had

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.309
earned up to that point, he learned that his
mother and stepfather had spent most of it.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
He was only able to garner $126,000 of the
remaining $250,000 or so they hadn’t spent

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.410
after suing the two.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.670
His mother, Lillian Coogan, argued during
the case that Jackie had been having fun anyway

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.460
while acting and that, “No promises were
ever made to give Jackie anything.”

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.080
His stepfather, Arthur Bernstein, added, “Every
dollar a kid earns before he is 21 belongs

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.210
to his parents.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.220
Jackie will not get a cent of his earnings.”

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.800
One notes even Bernstein used the word “his,”
as in Jackie’s, in describing the money.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.210
The resulting inequity outraged the public
and led to passage of the Child Actors Bill

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.970
(aka the Coogan Act or Coogan Law).

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.140
When established in 1938, the Coogan Law provided
that a portion of the minor performer’s

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.750
earnings should be set aside in a trust account
for the minor’s use when he or she reached

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.850
majority.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.570
This was designed to address one of the major
problems Jackie had in recovering his lost

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.020
money from his mother; as a community property
state, under California law, all of Coogan’s

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.070
earnings as a child legally belonged to the
family – meaning his mother was entitled

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.500
to spend it (or at least some of it).

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.360
Even with provisions to set-aside earnings,
greedy parents found many loopholes over the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.670
intervening years.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.780
As a result, amendments were passed in 1999
and 2003 to strengthen the law.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.380
Under today’s version, employers are required
to set aside 15% of a minor’s earnings into

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.341
a trust account, or, if the parent fails to
set up the trust account, to deposit it with

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:17.280
the Actors Fund of America (AFA).

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.570
Also under current law, all of the minor’s
earnings belong to the minor – no longer

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.020
is it community property, shared with the
parents.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.951
Today, other states including New Mexico,
New York and Louisiana have laws that require,

00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:34.670
in certain circumstances, the opening of special
trust accounts to hold the earnings of child

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.670
performers.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.020
Note, however, that California recently amended
Coogan’s law again, this time to provide

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.380
an exception to the 15% withholding and trust
account requirements for those minors who

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.370
“contract to provide services as an extra,
background performer, or in another similar

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.370
capacity.”

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.820
I’m sure no one will find a way to exploit
the “other similar capacity” loophole…

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.180
In any event, today when a child performer
is employed in a relatively de minimis role,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.010
employers are exempt from the withholding
requirements.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.100
The bill’s stated purpose is to eliminate
“unnecessary and inefficient” procedures

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.970
for those young actors who only work once
or twice a year in a very small role, as well

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.940
as to give these kids back their “summer
fun money.”

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.530
Notably, according to the legislative analysis,
by 2013 the AFA had over 38,000 unclaimed

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.850
individual deposits, over 80% of which were
for less than $99.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.090
Jackie Coogan went on to lead an interesting
life.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.020
He married actress and World War II pin-up
girl Betty Grable in 1938 (they divorced three

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.020
years later).

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.180
He served in the army during that war, including
flying British soldiers 100 miles behind Japanese

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.930
lines in December of 1943 as a member of the
1st Air Commando Group, and returned to Hollywood

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.910
where he was gainfully employed (even if not
in critically acclaimed movies) for the next

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.069
four decades.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.040
Although during the 1950s, he was stuck with
B movies like Outlaw Women and Escape from

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.849
Terror, he became a television mainstay during
the 1960s, guest starring on staples like

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.960
Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Andy Griffith
Show, The Red Skelton Hour and Perry Mason

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.630
before landing the role of Uncle Fester in
The Addams Family in 1964.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.160
Jackie continued to guest-star in dozens of
series in the late 60s and early 70s, including

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.940
The Wild Wild West, I Dream of Jeannie, The
Brady Bunch, The New Scooby Doo Movies, Love

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.490
American Style, Hawaii Five-O (the first one),
and Adam-12, as well as land roles in a few

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:46.389
movies including Dr. Heckyl and Mr. Hype and
Human Experiments.
