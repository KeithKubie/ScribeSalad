so my optimism is rooted in the fact

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
so my optimism is rooted in the fact
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.980
so my optimism is rooted in the fact
that for over almost 200 years every

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
that for over almost 200 years every
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.959
that for over almost 200 years every
year has gotten a little bit better when

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
year has gotten a little bit better when
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.520
year has gotten a little bit better when
we look at the scientific evidence and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
we look at the scientific evidence and
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.650
we look at the scientific evidence and
that while it's possible that next year

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
that while it's possible that next year
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840
that while it's possible that next year
everything could change everything could

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
everything could change everything could
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.439
everything could change everything could
collapse and fall to the ground

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449
collapse and fall to the ground
 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.509
collapse and fall to the ground
statistically probabilistically it won't

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
statistically probabilistically it won't
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460
statistically probabilistically it won't
it will continue because 200 years is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
it will continue because 200 years is
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.500
it will continue because 200 years is
gone and next year it probably will

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
gone and next year it probably will
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.110
gone and next year it probably will
continue but if you look at the kind of

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
continue but if you look at the kind of
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.270
continue but if you look at the kind of
current political regime around the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
current political regime around the
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.310
current political regime around the
world and the factors of of pressures

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
world and the factors of of pressures
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.700
world and the factors of of pressures
environmental pressures the pressures of

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710
environmental pressures the pressures of
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.720
environmental pressures the pressures of
distraction that we have from the new

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
distraction that we have from the new
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.810
distraction that we have from the new
media then I think you have to resort to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
media then I think you have to resort to
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.279
media then I think you have to resort to
hope in the long term optimists decide

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
hope in the long term optimists decide
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.840
hope in the long term optimists decide
the future it's the optimist who create

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
the future it's the optimist who create
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880
the future it's the optimist who create
all the things are gonna be most

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
all the things are gonna be most
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.040
all the things are gonna be most
important in our lives because it was

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050
important in our lives because it was
 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.830
important in our lives because it was
optimists who built and invented all the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
optimists who built and invented all the
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.270
optimists who built and invented all the
things that are now important in our

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
things that are now important in our
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.060
things that are now important in our
current lives and I think people behave

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
current lives and I think people behave
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.140
current lives and I think people behave
better when they're optimistic there's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
better when they're optimistic there's
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.240
better when they're optimistic there's
absolutely a need to be critical and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250
absolutely a need to be critical and
 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
absolutely a need to be critical and
doubtful and skeptical and even

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
doubtful and skeptical and even
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.970
doubtful and skeptical and even
pessimistic just like if you have a car

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980
pessimistic just like if you have a car
 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.420
pessimistic just like if you have a car
you have to have brakes you can't have a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
you have to have brakes you can't have a
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.020
you have to have brakes you can't have a
car no matter where it is without brakes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030
car no matter where it is without brakes
 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.150
car no matter where it is without brakes
but it's the engine the optimistic

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160
but it's the engine the optimistic
 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.770
but it's the engine the optimistic
engine that keeps going and going and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
engine that keeps going and going and
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380
engine that keeps going and going and
refuses to stop and it's only concerned

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
refuses to stop and it's only concerned
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.150
refuses to stop and it's only concerned
about going forward that really drives a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160
about going forward that really drives a
 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.940
about going forward that really drives a
car but you certainly need brakes to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
car but you certainly need brakes to
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.540
car but you certainly need brakes to
steer it and I think if you have only

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550
steer it and I think if you have only
 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.910
steer it and I think if you have only
brakes you don't go anywhere and I think

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
brakes you don't go anywhere and I think
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.520
brakes you don't go anywhere and I think
what we have right now is we have an

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
what we have right now is we have an
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920
what we have right now is we have an
imbalance between pessimism and optimism

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
imbalance between pessimism and optimism
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.470
imbalance between pessimism and optimism
and we really need a lot more optimism

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480
and we really need a lot more optimism
 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.270
and we really need a lot more optimism
about the future in order to have that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
about the future in order to have that
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000
about the future in order to have that
engine keep going and I think that one

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010
engine keep going and I think that one
 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.010
engine keep going and I think that one
of the reasons why we maybe have an

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
of the reasons why we maybe have an
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.529
of the reasons why we maybe have an
imbalance right now is because we have

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
imbalance right now is because we have
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.580
imbalance right now is because we have
been burned so often by the promises of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
been burned so often by the promises of
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.770
been burned so often by the promises of
the optimists

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
the optimists
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.110
the optimists
about how technology is going to bring

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120
about how technology is going to bring
 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.970
about how technology is going to bring
us a kind of utopia and I think nobody

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
us a kind of utopia and I think nobody
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.850
us a kind of utopia and I think nobody
believes in utopia anymore I certainly

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
believes in utopia anymore I certainly
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.040
believes in utopia anymore I certainly
don't

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
don't
 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.320
don't
but dystopia is actually not any better

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330
but dystopia is actually not any better
 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.300
but dystopia is actually not any better
and that's actually the only vision that

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
and that's actually the only vision that
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.400
and that's actually the only vision that
we have of the future which is really

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410
we have of the future which is really
 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.620
we have of the future which is really
sort of made by Hollywood and some

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
sort of made by Hollywood and some
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.809
sort of made by Hollywood and some
science fiction which is of a dystopia

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
science fiction which is of a dystopia
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.280
science fiction which is of a dystopia
that collapses and I think that while we

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290
that collapses and I think that while we
 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320
that collapses and I think that while we
can't believe in a utopia I think a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330
can't believe in a utopia I think a
 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.900
can't believe in a utopia I think a
better vision of the future is proto Pia

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
better vision of the future is proto Pia
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.699
better vision of the future is proto Pia
this idea that we have incremental

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
this idea that we have incremental
 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.710
this idea that we have incremental
progress that were working in creeping

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720
progress that were working in creeping
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.070
progress that were working in creeping
very very steadily but slowly towards

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080
very very steadily but slowly towards
 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.759
very very steadily but slowly towards
betterment so every year is a little

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769
betterment so every year is a little
 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.229
betterment so every year is a little
tiny better than the year before

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239
tiny better than the year before
 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.449
tiny better than the year before
not much but a little tiny better and

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459
not much but a little tiny better and
 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.000
not much but a little tiny better and
that kind of incremental progress is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010
that kind of incremental progress is
 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.280
that kind of incremental progress is
really only visible when you turn around

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
really only visible when you turn around
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.370
really only visible when you turn around
and look back behind you because a half

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
and look back behind you because a half
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.160
and look back behind you because a half
or even a 1% difference is really

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
or even a 1% difference is really
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.110
or even a 1% difference is really
something we can't see every year and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120
something we can't see every year and
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.050
something we can't see every year and
it's not gonna be seen in the news if

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060
it's not gonna be seen in the news if
 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.890
it's not gonna be seen in the news if
you look at the news and news is about

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
you look at the news and news is about
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.080
you look at the news and news is about
outliers about unusual things it's not

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
outliers about unusual things it's not
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.800
outliers about unusual things it's not
about the slow evidence of progress

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810
about the slow evidence of progress
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.830
about the slow evidence of progress
which is not seen in the news so if you

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840
which is not seen in the news so if you
 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.330
which is not seen in the news so if you
want to see what's really happening the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
want to see what's really happening the
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.890
want to see what's really happening the
world you can't look at the news you

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900
world you can't look at the news you
 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.590
world you can't look at the news you
have to look at the scientific evidence

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600
have to look at the scientific evidence
 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.140
have to look at the scientific evidence
which is going to register a very small

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
which is going to register a very small
 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.509
which is going to register a very small
Delta that is really not visible unless

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
Delta that is really not visible unless
 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.160
Delta that is really not visible unless
you turn around and look behind you and

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170
you turn around and look behind you and
 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.729
you turn around and look behind you and
then you can see oh 20 years this is

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739
then you can see oh 20 years this is
 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.740
then you can see oh 20 years this is
real and so that sense of proto PIA of a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750
real and so that sense of proto PIA of a
 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.199
real and so that sense of proto PIA of a
small incremental creep towards

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
small incremental creep towards
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.300
small incremental creep towards
betterment that next year will be a

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310
betterment that next year will be a
 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.920
betterment that next year will be a
little tiny better than this year is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
little tiny better than this year is
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.140
little tiny better than this year is
really the best that we have but it's a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150
really the best that we have but it's a
 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.520
really the best that we have but it's a
very powerful thing because that's what

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530
very powerful thing because that's what
 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.340
very powerful thing because that's what
civilization is civilization is not

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350
civilization is civilization is not
 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.569
civilization is civilization is not
monumental heroic enterprise it's a

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579
monumental heroic enterprise it's a
 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.050
monumental heroic enterprise it's a
small creep of 1% betterment through

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060
small creep of 1% betterment through
 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.229
small creep of 1% betterment through
centuries and I think if we believe that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239
centuries and I think if we believe that
 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.960
centuries and I think if we believe that
progress is real then we can actually

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970
progress is real then we can actually
 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.880
progress is real then we can actually
behave better if we believe that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890
behave better if we believe that
 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.890
behave better if we believe that
progress is real we can still dream

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900
progress is real we can still dream
 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.620
progress is real we can still dream
about making these new things

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630
about making these new things
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.810
about making these new things
because we know that even though the new

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820
because we know that even though the new
 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.300
because we know that even though the new
technologies are going to introduce as

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310
technologies are going to introduce as
 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.440
technologies are going to introduce as
many new problems as a solve and that

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450
many new problems as a solve and that
 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.700
many new problems as a solve and that
most of the problems we'll have in the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710
most of the problems we'll have in the
 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.980
most of the problems we'll have in the
future will come from new technology we

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990
future will come from new technology we
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.520
future will come from new technology we
will still go forward and make invent

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530
will still go forward and make invent
 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.170
will still go forward and make invent
those new things even though they will

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
those new things even though they will
 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.730
those new things even though they will
create new problems because those new

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740
create new problems because those new
 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.910
create new problems because those new
problems themselves will birth new

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920
problems themselves will birth new
 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.830
problems themselves will birth new
solutions which will have new problems

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840
solutions which will have new problems
 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.660
solutions which will have new problems
but that circle and cycle keeps going

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670
but that circle and cycle keeps going
 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.330
but that circle and cycle keeps going
around around and there's a 1% net gain

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340
around around and there's a 1% net gain
 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.450
around around and there's a 1% net gain
for each revolution and that's what we

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460
for each revolution and that's what we
 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.950
for each revolution and that's what we
get out of this

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960
get out of this
 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.930
get out of this
