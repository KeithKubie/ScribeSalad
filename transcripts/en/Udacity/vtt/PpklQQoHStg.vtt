00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.350
Did you notice how when we called
decodeObjectForKey we had to cast

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.410
each of the returned values?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.060
Why do you think we had to do that?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.215
Take a minute to guess and
then continue on.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:12.853

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:16.830
If we Alt+Click on the method
decodeObjectForKey so we can look

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.230
at the documentation, we see that it
returns an object of type AnyObject.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.470
Well, in any object optional that is.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.510
Of course, in Swift, we want our
objects to have specific types.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.280
Compensating for

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.430
differences like this in typing is
a common interoperability challenge.
