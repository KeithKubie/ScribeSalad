HEATHER MINNICH: Working early in the
morning is good.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's nice and quiet,
there is no traffic.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000 position:56%
The only thing that isn't good about
it is getting up in the morning

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because I am not
an early riser.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000 position:63%
BRUCE YEAGLE: I'm usually up around 3:00
to get in here around 4:15.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.170 position:66%
I've been doing it for seventeen years and
still can't get used to getting up

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.440
as early as I have to
to come in here.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.130
KARA KAZIOR: I start at 5:30.


00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.150 position:66%
JAMES LEWIS: It's pretty much a challenge.
Sometimes you don't want to get up

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.320
in the morning at all.
It's too early.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.210 position:69%
BRUCE YEAGLE: I thought it would get easier,
but it really doesn't.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.860 position:59%
HEATHER MINNICH: Otherwise it's great.


00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.000 position:80%
HEATHER MINNICH: We are in the Rockefeller building
and we are in the Bake Shop

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600
It is the very basement
of this building.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.000 position:86%
KARA KAZIOR: When I first applied for the job everybody
was like, "Oh the Bake Shop, it's in the basement."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I didn't know where. I'm wondering
where Rocky-Mathey is,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.800
let alone it's going to
be down in the basement

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.750 position:64%
BRUCE YEAGLE: We're just under the radar,
and they see our products everywhere,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.480
they just really don't know
where they come from.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.120
BRUCE YEAGLE: Everything on campus
that you see dessert-wise

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
I'd have to say ninety-nine percent
comes out of this shop.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
We're a small shop.
We only have seven employees,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.820
but we're providing a great
quantity of desserts

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.000
and all the pizza dough also.


00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.250 position:83%
HEATHER MINNICH: We're going through probably 50 bags
of flour a week for just pizza dough alone...

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.000 position:56%
probably 150 pounds to 250 pounds of
butter per week...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.880 position:61%
40 or 50 of each cake per day
when we say make chocolate chip muffins

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.320 position:67%
for the retail shops, we're making anywhere
from 40 to 50 dozen at a time...

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.570 position:63%
If we're making a cookie for lunch or
for dinner, usually it's around 70 dozen

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.320 position:69%
at a time. We do so many products I probably
don't even have a count of how many we do...

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.110 position:73%
It's a lot...it's like 30 hundred dozen cookies
a week just for contract alone,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.480
which means all the colleges
that we make for.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.030 position:84%
KARA KAZIOR: This is very active, keeps your day going
I love the bakery, the people here are wonderful.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.570
They're just easy to
get along with.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570 position:70%
JOSEPH VELEZ: It's good. We all work together
really well.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.570 position:72%
We get along very well. There's a lot of
different personalities, so it's a lot of fun.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.570 position:75%
HEATHER MINNICH: We basically have become a very
tight-knit family.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.570 position:69%
I consider them my friends. Most of them are
guys so they're kind of like my brothers,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.570
or actually, kind of like my kids.
They all call me "Mom."

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.660 position:64%
JOSEPH VELEZ: I would describe this place
to everybody as basically my second home,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.810 position:67%
my second family. That's how everybody here
feels about each other.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.790
We're like a family outside
of your regular family.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.990 position:80%
JAMES LEWIS: You always are encouraged to come here
because of these people here.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.460 position:66%
BRUCE YEAGLE: I think that the thing I am
most proud of that I'd like people to know

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.280
is how hard
the group of us work.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.090 position:73%
HEATHER MINNICH: We put a lot of love into them
and we're very proud of what we do.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.640 position:78%
and we really do care about what goes out the door
and that it tastes good

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480 position:66%
and it's well received and that people are
happy when they eat our stuff.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000 position:81%
JAMES LEWIS: Hmm, there are so many favorite things.


00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
My favorite thing is the
black and orange cake.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.370
This is very tasty.
