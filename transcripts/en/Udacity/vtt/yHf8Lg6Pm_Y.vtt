00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.237
The slope of line P is one half, and

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:09.726
the slope of line Q is negative 2. Now, I'd like you to take a second right now,

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:13.626
and reflect on what the special relationship between the slopes of perpendicular

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:17.600
lines might be. Now, you don't actually have to know the answer for

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.160
sure right now. But just start mulling it over. We'll talk about it very soon.
