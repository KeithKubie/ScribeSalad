00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.730
We're asked to find the
square root of 100.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.130
Let me write this down bigger.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.060
So the square root is this
big check-looking thing.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.880
The square root of 100.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.650
When you see it like this,
this means the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.120
positive square root.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.850
If you're familiar with negative
numbers, you know

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.490
that there's also a negative
square root, but when you just

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.700
see this symbol, that means
the positive square root.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.570
So let's think about what
this is saying.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.090
This is asking us find the
number, the positive number,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.350
that when I multiply that number
by itself, I get 100.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.700
So what number when I multiply
it by itself do I get 100?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.220
Well, let's see, if I multiply
9 by itself, that's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.580
only going to be 81.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.280
If I multiply 10 by itself,
that is 100.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.800
So this is equal to-- and let
me write it this way.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740
Normally, you could
skip this step.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.470
But you could write this as
the square root of-- and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.610
instead of 100, 100 is the same
thing as 10 times 10.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.960
And then you know, the square
root of something times

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.890
itself, that's just going
to be that something.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.240
This is just equal to 10.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.720
So the square root
of 100 is 10.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.330
Or another way you could write,
I guess, this same

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.520
truth is that 10 squared, which
is equal to 10 times 10,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.000
is equal to 100.
