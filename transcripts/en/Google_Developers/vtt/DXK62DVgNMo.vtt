TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.292
This is your weekly update on
the coolest developer news from

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:12.540
Google and our 150th episode
of "The Dev Show," "TL;DR."

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.690
Android Q beta 1 is now
available for early adopters,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.300
and a preview SDK is
available for developers.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.690
It brings a number of
additional privacy and security

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.500
features for users, as well
as enhancements for foldables,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
new APIs for connectivity,
new media codecs and camera

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
capabilities and NNAPI
extensions, Vulcan 1.1 support,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.400
faster app startup, and more.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.250
To learn more, head on
over to this extensive post

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.980
linked in the description below.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.010
Android app bundles and
Google Play's dynamic delivery

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.520
introduce modular
development, reduce app size,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.860
and streamline the
release process.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.020
We recently announced
some new improvements

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.150
based on your
suggestions, including

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.030
a new API for installing
additional languages,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.540
a streamlined publishing
process for Instant-enabled app

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.709
bundles, a new enrollment option
for app signing by Google Play,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.760
and more.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.910
Details and examples
are on the post.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.700
The stable release of the
Android Jetpack navigation

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.630
component is now available.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.020
Its suite of libraries,
tooling, and guidance

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.240
provides a complete
navigation framework,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.270
freeing you from the challenges
of implementing navigation

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.440
yourself.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.400
A video and links to
resources are on the post.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.770
Last week at the Game Developers
Conference in San Francisco,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.400
we announced Firebase
Crashlytics for Unity,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.150
open sourcing our C++ SDK,
new AI-assisted monkey actions

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.550
for games on Android, and
support for Game Center

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.680
authentication on iOS.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.190
Screenshots and links
are on the post.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.050
With the Google Maps
platform for gaming,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.360
we use the power
of Google Maps and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.030
our real-time global
understanding of the world

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.862
to take mobile gaming
to the next level.

00:01:56.862 --> 00:01:59.070
We're making new features
available to build gameplay

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.340
that's even more contextualized
and more engaging,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.970
including biome,
elevation, and pathfinding.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.699
Example videos are on the post.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.300
Site reliability engineering
uses prescriptive methods

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.200
and principles for building
and running reliable systems,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.300
and there's a new
Coursera course

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.810
that's dedicated to helping
you get started with SRE.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.050
It's called Site Reliability
Engineering, Measuring

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.760
and Managing Reliability.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.580
A link to the course
is on the post.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.130
We recently announced a
new open source project,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.920
the Accessibility
Scanner for iOS.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
It's a developer tool that can
assist in locating and fixing

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.460
accessibility issues while
an app is being developed.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.790
A link to the GitHub
repo is on the post.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.090
In Chrome 73, we added support
for creating portable content

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.900
with signed HTTP
exchanges, dynamically

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.510
changing styles with
constructable style sheets,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.960
support for PWAs on
Mac, and a lot more.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.990
For all the updates,
take a look at the post.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.260
Also, Chrome 74 beta
is now available,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.960
reducing unwanted motion,
introducing private class

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.140
fields, and a new
feature policy API.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.780
Lots more detail on
that post as well linked

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.593

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.310
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:25.610
I'm going to break
something, I think.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.460
Hope not.
