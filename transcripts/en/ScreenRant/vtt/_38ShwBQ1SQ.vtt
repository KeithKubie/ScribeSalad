00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.150
With Hollywood studios looking to make every
successful TV show, video game, comic book,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.600
or even board game into a blockbuster movie,
you'd think they would try to adapt that parts

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.550
that actually, you know, worked.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.630
You would be wrong, since an amazing world
of mythology and characters can be turned

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.279
into absolute garbage pretty easily.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.679
Here are 10 Disappointing Movies That Wasted
Amazing Source Material

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.990
Green Lantern (Warner Bros.)

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.079
By now we don't really need to go into detail
with just how disappointing Green Lantern

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.680
turned out to be, with Ryan Reynolds about
the only part critics and fans didn't tear

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680
apart.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
It's still a prime example of how a story
spanning an entire galaxy, countless alien

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.329
worlds, heroes, and villains can be completely
wasted on a ridiculous villain, horrible action,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.629
and the idea that a superhero doesn't really
NEED a costume.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.370
X-Men 3: The Last Stand (20th Century Fox)
Recent comic book flops have helped the third

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.859
X-Men movie rise by comparison, but even if
The Last Stand delivered some laughs or cool

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.290
action, its treatment of Jean Grey is unforgivable.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.561
"The Phoenix Saga" remains one of Marvel's
most iconic stories, seeing Jean be lost to

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.970
the cosmic force inside of her.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.480
The movie skipped over so much, they didn't
even need to explain how Professor X came

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480
back to life.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.331
Prometheus (20th Century Fox)
In hindsight, nobody connected to the film

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.890
should have ever implied that Prometheus would
actually be a prequel to Ridley Scott's "Alien."

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.560
But that's how the movie began its life, before
re-writes weakened or erased the links between

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.610
the films - and fans noticed.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.400
While the movie may be epic or visually stunning
in its own rite, and explore some unique ideas

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170
about faith and creators, it will always be
remembered as a failure for using the Alien

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.350
brand to build buzz... without actually delivering
on the connection.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.970
Avatar: The Last Airbender (Paramount)
Make no mistake: the Nickelodeon cartoon series

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.070
following rival nations of earth, water, fire
and airbenders is one of the best mythologies

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.760
created in the past few decades.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.730
But even that couldn't save "The Last Airbender"
from writer/director M. Night Shyamalan.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.360
Even without the insane budget and white-washing
controversy, the movie itself completely avoided

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.770
the fun and energy of the series, and failed
at being a decent movie, too.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.489
Wanted (Universal)
A movie doesn't have to be a failure to leave

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.170
fans of the comic book it's based on disappointed.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.799
Wanted ended up a story about bullet-curving
assassins killing targets that fate selected,

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.269
which is pretty cool - until you realize the
original comic was basically set in the DC

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.519
Universe, after the supervillains had won,
and erased heroes from the world's memory.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.930
The movie had the action and comedy to pull
off a story that big, but turned the murder-loving

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.409
villains of the comic into proud heroes - which
missed the point for many.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.379
Prince of Persia (Disney)
Sure, we could pick almost any video game

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.680
movie and fit this list, but Prince of Persia
was a special kind of awful from the moment

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.150
it cast Jake Gyllenhaal as the Persian hero
- and surrounded him with an almost completely

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.150
white cast.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.549
But there's a reason the game series lasted
so long, and it's based on thrilling parkour,

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.189
witty banter, and epic magic and time travel.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.400
Instead, the movie tried to recreate Pirates
of the Caribbean humor and Disney magic - playing

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.439
it safe, and entertaining no one as a result.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.870
Fantastic Four (20th Century Fox)
To be fair, you could probably say the same

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.019
about every movie version of Marvel's First
Family, since directors and the studio are

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.090
clearly hellbent on making the Fantastic Four
goofy, cheesy, or just boring, carbon-copy

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.489
superhero mutants.

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.109
Instead of sticking to the sci-fi spectacle,
the fringe science, or just the family drama

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.400
that's made the team a hit in Marvel Comics,
Fox has been racing to keep up with Marvel's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.499
other hit franchises - a decision that didn't
just kill the franchise, but killed them in

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.170
the comics, too.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.659
Daredevil (Fox)
These days, it's obvious just how good a live-action

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.590
Daredevil story can be - which makes the Ben
Affleck-led movie seem like an even bigger

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.989
missed opportunity.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.189
Even Marvel's own writers have said Affleck
wasn't really the problem, but the story,

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.370
which failed to do justice to either Matt
Murdock the attornee, or the blind crimefighter.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.189
The original, director's cut was actually
a bit better, but when test audiences responded

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.909
most strongly to the romance, the studio edited
accordingly - ramping the cheese factor up

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.079
along with it.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.510
DOOM (Universal)
The movie has become a punchline for video

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.870
game movies in general, but seriously: imagine
a movie starring Karl Urban and The Rock as

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.130
space marines travelling to Mars to fight
demon monsters being announced today, and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.860
the hundreds of millions it could make at
the box office.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.040
Since the "DOOM" mythology is as generic as
it gets, the film could have done ANYTHING

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040
it wanted.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.970
Instead, audiences got a movie that was almost
trying to be bad - and don't even mention

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.390
the first-person sequence.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.290
Iron Man 3 (Marvel)
Iron Man is still going strong in the MCU,

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.520
but after Iron Man 2 took a step down from
Tony Stark's first movie, hopes were high

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.350
for Iron Man 3, with the Avenger taking on
the forces of the evil Mandarin.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.660
Fans were already split when Sir Ben Kingsley
was cast in an American-ized version of the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.710
villain, but when the movie's twist revealed
him to just be an actor, playing the deception

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.790
for laughs, plenty of fans revolted, calling
it a waste, a bait-and-switch, and a massive

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.980
missed opportunity.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:17.240
Since the MCU doesn't have many, we had to
give this one its due.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:26.160
Conclusion
Those are just some of the incredible comics,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.250
games and movies that had their potential
wasted in modern adaptations, but which ones

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.630
are your most despised?
