00:00:02.196 --> 00:00:05.686
&gt;&gt;Erin: There's been a
wonderful real-time change

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:07.936
in the way we're able to
adapt to student needs.

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:16.116
&gt;&gt;Marguerite: What formative
assessment am I using daily,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.796
so that I can measure whether
or not in that class period,

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.846
kids are learning the material?

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:23.606
A good Exit Ticket can tell whether

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.706
or not a kid has a superficial
understanding of the information,

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.846
or has some depth of understanding.

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.746
And then the next day the teacher
can differentiate their lesson based

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:33.656
on student needs.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.606
An Exit Ticket is a formative assessment
linked to the objective of the lessons.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.856
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Typically they're
short, just a few questions

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:42.866
and they're focused on
one particular skill.

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.236
And we design them ourselves.

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:45.836
They're just what I want to know

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:47.626
if the students mastered
that day in the classroom.

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:50.106
It can also be used to kind
of anticipate something

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:52.436
that you might be working on
for the next day's lesson.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.326
Do they already know it, or
do they know parts of it?

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:56.136
Where can you kind of start your lesson?

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:59.036
&gt;&gt;Marguerite: Some teachers
use Poll Anywhere.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.296
Some teachers utilize a Google form

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.496
where kids can enter
in their information.

00:01:03.726 --> 00:01:05.966
Then that Google form will
then organize the data

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.686
for the teacher into
an Excel spreadsheet.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:10.256
And some teachers just
use paper and pencil.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.366
&gt;&gt;Shannon: First thing, what's
our number one Exit Ticket?

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.816
I just want to know, key points.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:17.296
What are the best things
that your group came up with?

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:20.866
Your Connections, so historically,
a current events connection.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:22.376
A connection you made to--

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:24.986
&gt;&gt;Shannon: I just wanted to see
where each group kind of really got

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:26.796
to in their discussion
in terms of depth.

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:31.686
It lets me see which group, if they're
not reaching that level, for example,

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:34.506
that I should spend a lot more time
talking with them and helping them

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:38.626
to develop that, and which groups are
working really well independently.

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:44.256
&gt;&gt;Erin: We use the digital Exit Tickets,
weekly or daily depending on the unit.

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:46.156
&gt;&gt;Shannon: And we purposefully use one,

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.176
so every ninth grade
student, we have that data.

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:50.006
&gt;&gt;Erin: We teach the same course,

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.696
and we co-plan every single
day's lesson together.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:58.676
And that gives us a real opportunity
to discuss what our data is showing,

00:01:58.676 --> 00:02:00.676
and what do we need to change?

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:07.306
We can use Exit Tickets to focus in on
just understanding one small concept.

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:13.076
For instance, today's Exit Ticket asked
them to identify what elements were

00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:15.286
in Persuasion, what elements
were in Argument.

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:19.746
And then we gave them examples
of Pathos, Ethos and Logos.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:23.336
They had to identify which of those
elements were the most prominent.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:24.956
So that gave us an idea of whether

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:26.956
or not they could differentiate
between the three.

00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:32.246
&gt;&gt;Shannon: So let's talk through our
unit, first let's do Persuasion first.

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:36.136
&gt;&gt;Erin: A lot of them understand
that Logos belongs with Argument,

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.436
but they're also lumping
in additional elements.

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:44.426
And I'm definitely seeing that the
entire group needs to review differences

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.296
between Argument and Persuasion.

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:48.656
&gt;&gt;Erin: Argument has Logos only.

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:54.156
Today, you're going to be using Logos,
Pathos and Ethos for Persuasion.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.806
And it's important just so you know
there's a different between them.

00:02:57.206 --> 00:03:00.496
&gt;&gt;Erin: About Persuasion, I think that's
where we're going to be able to pull

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:03.856
out the students that need just
a little bit more reteaching.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:06.716
&gt;&gt;Shannon: So clearly like the
text isn't working for them,

00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:08.156
so let's do that same visual thing.

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:11.916
&gt;&gt;Erin: I think advertisements
that they're already familiar with,

00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:15.436
so that they have a place of
prior knowledge and context.

00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:17.626
&gt;&gt;Erin: Logos, Pathos or Ethos?

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:21.236
We're looking at this beautiful
advertisement of Superman.

00:03:21.476 --> 00:03:23.986
What is the most prominent
persuasive element you see here?

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:26.996
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Let's have our higher level
groups, since they've demonstrated

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:30.576
through this Exit Ticket that they can
definitely identify those three things

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.426
in what they're reading.

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.016
Let's move them up to Author's Purpose.

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:36.826
&gt;&gt;Erin: People on the computers in
the back, you'll be watching a video,

00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:39.166
and writing a one-paragraph response.

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:40.686
You'll turn it in at
the end of the class.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:41.936
&gt;&gt;Marguerite: When you
look around the room,

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:44.646
you would think they're all
working on the same activity,

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.316
but in actuality, it's
at different levels.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.906
&gt;&gt;Trace: They'll sit down with you,
they'll help you learn the material,

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:54.046
to make sure you get the full grasp
of what we're learning in that class.

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:57.466
&gt;&gt;Shannon: Using data driven
instruction in the classroom in the form

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:03.756
of Exit Ticket, really allows a teacher
to identify each student's strengths

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:07.166
and weaknesses as they're walking
into your classroom every day.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.526
There's no one who's
falling through the cracks.
