00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.620
Our minds give us trouble.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.120
And one of the leading ways people nowadays deal with them, is meditation.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.880
Sessions where you quieten thoughts, empty the mind,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.960
and focus on just a few things outside of you

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480
like, the rustle of leaves, or the flow of water.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.100
But, at the School of Life, we want to put forward an alternative,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.820
or, rather a complementary idea.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.600
We've devised a technique, based not on Eastern thought,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.420
but on ideas that come down to us from the Western philosophical tradition.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.640
We call it, a "philosophical meditation"

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.220
The basic premise is that a lot of the trouble in our minds,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.000
comes from thoughts that haven't been untangled, examined, and properly confronted.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.040
And that because life moves so fast, we accumulate a lot of un-thought thoughts

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.480
on a daily basis.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.560
Insomnia, for example,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.180
is chiefly the revenge of thoughts we havent had in the day.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.040
Muddled, unfocused thoughts generate a static of anxious electricity,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.740
or else give rise to clouds of nonspecific gloom.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.980
If we've been out of touch with our thoughts for too long,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.100
we can get snappy or suddenly enraged.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.940
This, is what philosophical meditation is designed to help us with.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
It's a tool for systematically clearing up our minds,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.320
and making sense of our disavowed feelings and ideas.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.440
The first priority, is to set aside a bit of time.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.220
Idealy some twenty minutes at least once every few days.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.940
You should sit, probably in bed, early in the morning,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.700
or late in the evening, with a pad of paper,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.500
and ancher your investigation of yourself around 3 large questions.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.980
Firstly: "What am I currently anxious about?"

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.300
Secondly: "What am I upset about, and with whom?"

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.180
And thirdly: "What am I currently excited and ambitious about?"

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.780
At first, when asked to respond to question like these

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.540
the mind tends to be inarticulate and a bit scared.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.240
Generally, something comes to mind, but often you can't quite tell what it is yet.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.320
It might, just for now, be a word, or a mental image, or a place, or a persons name.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.360
This doesn't matter.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.700
Grab the ideas when they're there without thinking too much, write everything down,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.660
however minor, and don't worry too much about it's ultimate sense.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.320
Philosophical meditation can be compared to cleaning out a large, clogged-up cupboard.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.600
You have to take everything out and pile it up on the bed first

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.100
before starting to sort it out.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.120
So, to kick off, under: "What am I anxious about?"

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.620
You might accumulate a list of concerns you haven't looked at head on,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.360
but have glimpsed in the course of the day.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.380
It'll be nonsense to anyone else,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.940
and perhaps almost to yourself too, but keep going.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.900
With all the thoughts taken out, then past and through the sieve of a set of questions.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.300
Ask: "What is this anxiety really about?"

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.060
Tell the story of the coming anxious period or challenge in great, almost tedious detail.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.400
Then, confront head on everything that could go wrong

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.020
with the worrying situation or idea.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.620
Now tease out how you might still be OK, even if the worst happened.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.160
Don't cheer yourself up with false optimism.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.580
Make yourself at home with the darkest possibilities.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.920
Realize that almost everything is ultimately rather survivable.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.180
Then, it's time to move on to the second part of the philosophical meditation;

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.920
the bit where you ask the second big question:

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.320
"Who am I upset with and why?"

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.900
The theory here, is that we often don't allow ourselves

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.180
to analyze the hurts that we receive from other people

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.720
because we're humiliatingly vulnerable and pretend we're not.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.760
Yet we pay for this false stoicism dearly.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600
For undigested hurts generate bitterness, confusion,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.660
and misdirected aggression.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.860
We might go cold on our partners, with whom we're unknowingly furious.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.700
So, empty the cupboard of the mind of all its multiple hurts.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.600
Take all you've written, and pass it through the following set of questions:

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.880
Retell yourself all of the upsetting incidents you've faced,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.580
in great detail, as if you were telling them to an extremely kind, interested

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.080
and patient friend.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.020
Then ask:

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.820
"How might a nice person have end up doing what this person did to you?"

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.560
If they weren't actively mean,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.340
What other explanations could there be for the hurt they have caused?

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.280
Lastly, if this would happen to a friend, how would you advise them?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.300
Next, it's time to take out of the cupboard of the mind all the thoughts

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.540
that relate to ambition, and excitement.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.740
This needs a range of positive emotions,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.040
tremors of interest, tentative enthusiasm to lights and so on

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.200
that are hovering on the edges of consciousness.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.100
Ask: "What recently made you feel excited, envious or desiring?"

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.760
There's then an another set of questions to sieve these feelings through.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.740
Describe your excitements as if to a sympathetic, interested friend.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.700
You need to change your life in certain ways,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.700
so, what would it be, to change your life in the light of this?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.780
This exciting thing holds clue to whats missing in your life, what might be missing?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.480
If this thing could talk, what might it tell you?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.220
If this thing could try to change your life, what changes might it advise?

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.800
If other parts of your life were more like this, what might they be like?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.940
Answering all these questions starts the vital work

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.840
of decoding the scrambled thoughts, that normally clog up our minds.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.320
The longer we've gone without doing one of these mental audits,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.820
the more there will be to go through.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.440
Philosophical meditation doesn't magically solve problems,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.520
but it huuugely helps us, by creating an occasion

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.440
where we can identify our thoughts, and get them in some kind of order.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.840
Fears, resentments, and hopes become easier to name.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.660
We get less scared of the contents of our own minds

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.780
we grow calmer, less bitter and clearer about our diection in life.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.380
We start, at last on the journey to knowing ourselves properly.
