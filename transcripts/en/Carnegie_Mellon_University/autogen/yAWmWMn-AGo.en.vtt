so we could see if it's the opposite of

that we 3d print it and we can put tubes

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
that we 3d print it and we can put tubes

in the tubes we can put our fish and so

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
in the tubes we can put our fish and so
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.629
in the tubes we can put our fish and so
when the fan is spinning fast enough we

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639
when the fan is spinning fast enough we
 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.610
when the fan is spinning fast enough we
have extra forces on the fish and that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
have extra forces on the fish and that
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.629
have extra forces on the fish and that
adds up with gravity to give more forces

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639
adds up with gravity to give more forces
 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.970
adds up with gravity to give more forces
what we're starting to find is that the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.640

gravity they have more variation they

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650
gravity they have more variation they
 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.949

have more changes it's like having more

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
have more changes it's like having more
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.009

messages that sells send to each other
are less consistent we see just the

are less consistent we see just the
 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.649
are less consistent we see just the
opposite in higher gravity where they're

about this work so far is that we are

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329
about this work so far is that we are
 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.209
about this work so far is that we are
not so different from those fish who

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219
not so different from those fish who
 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.459
not so different from those fish who
didn't realize they were in water they

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469
didn't realize they were in water they
 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.990
didn't realize they were in water they
just took it for granted that they were

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
just took it for granted that they were
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.449
just took it for granted that they were
always in water and we took gravity for

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459
always in water and we took gravity for
 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.089
always in water and we took gravity for
granted it is only by leaving Earth that

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099
granted it is only by leaving Earth that
 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.179
granted it is only by leaving Earth that
we learned more about life on Earth

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189
we learned more about life on Earth
 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.370
we learned more about life on Earth
thank you
