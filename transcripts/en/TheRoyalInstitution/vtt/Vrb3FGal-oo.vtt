00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.160
Loop quantum gravity, the theory on which
I work is a mathematical description of the

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.549
quanta of err space, a quanta of space-time.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:22.980
Um the… err… you can think of the elementary
chunk of space. The Plank size elementary

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
bits out of which space is in their quanta.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.669
Um… They’re linked to one another, and
there are all these links and you follow these

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.120
links and you close and make a loop. That’s
where the name Loop Quantum Gravity comes

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.280
from.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.120
The key point, the crucial point, is that you have
to think of these bits, these quanta of gravity,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.440
not as things immersed in space. It’s not
space and these quanta here and there. They

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.039
are space itself. They made up space themselves.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.579
So what we call space is a collection of these
connected to one another. And what we call

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.970
distance is sort of numbering of how many
of these; what we call time is how they transform

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.390
into one another continuously. The number
of steps in this transformation.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.320
So these are quanta. But they’re not like
particles. They’re not particles in particle

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.240
physics, the quanta of the field. The photons
are the quanta of the electromagnetic field.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.350
But the photons are little chunks of energy
that travel in space. While the quanta of

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.159
gravity are little chunks of gravity, of something,
um which make them, made up themselves of

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.750
space, but they don’t live in space.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:44.000
Like this is the constant, my analogy… if
you look at my t-shirt, it’s not that my

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.881
t-shirt has threads in it, if you take away
the threads, it’s not a t-shirt still there.

00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:55.659
There is nothing. So the t-shirt is just weaved
by the threads.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.860
So space itself is weaved by this interconnected
quanta of gravity. This is the core of loop

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.360
quantum gravity.
