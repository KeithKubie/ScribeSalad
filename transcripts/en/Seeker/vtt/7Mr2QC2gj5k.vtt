00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.380
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.910
Actually, we all are.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.490
Why is that?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.471
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.470
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.300
And over and over,
studies show that humans

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.620
seem to attribute
positive personality

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.170
traits to physically
attractive people.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.330
Integrity,
intelligence, kindness--

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.130
we just think that prettier
people have those things

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.680
by default, whether
we realize it or not.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.260
It seems unfair, and it is.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.000
But is there some sort of
biological reason for it?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.740
A recently published study
from Cambridge University

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.320
wanted to find out just that.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.300
They selectively bred
silver foxes for 20 years

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.770
based on how friendly
they were towards humans.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.990
And with each generation, they
got more and more domesticated.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.590
And as they got
more domesticated

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.850
and as they got
friendlier, they also

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.720
seemed to acquire more
physical traits that would best

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.880
be scientifically described
as-- oh, look at their adorable

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.470
little faces-- rounder skulls,
smaller noses, shorter muzzles,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.500
flatter faces.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.960
It turns out that
friendliness in silver foxes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.140
is connected to genes that
control the hypothalamus,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380
pituitary, and
adrenal glands, which

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.600
all modulate fear
and aggression.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.590
And as those genes
changed, the physical

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.822
features they're responsible
for changed, too.

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:18.780
So what does that mean?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.840
It means that we associate
cuteness or attractiveness

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.274
with physical traits
that also mean

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:25.440
something is less dangerous.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
It is a survival thing.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.290
We know to be
attracted to something

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.990
that is less likely to
tear our throats out.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.790
Handy.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.324
Now in humans,
the idea of beauty

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:36.240
changes from culture to
culture, and everybody

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.660
has their own personal type.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.610
But there are some
traits which have

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.250
been found to be attractive
to the majority of the world.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.810
And it could be
that we're not just

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.707
wired to find those
things attractive,

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.540
we are wired to find
those things attractive

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.945
because we are also
wired to find them safe.

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:52.320
It's one of those left over
survival skills that actually

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.440
hinders us in day to day life
because humans have much more

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.480
complex brains and
thought processes

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.980
than we did in the wild.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.380
Those attractive
traits don't really

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.900
correlate to anything any more.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.180
You know, I basically avert
my eyes from pretty people

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.979
and just give them
whatever they ask

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.900
for as I stammer out a thank
you to them for allowing

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.490
me to be in their presence.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.080
How about you?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.020
Do you automatically think
highly of attractive people?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.240
What is wrong with us?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.048
