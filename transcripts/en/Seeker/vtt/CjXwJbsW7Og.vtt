00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.409
I love jamming out to a good song, it can
totally change my mood.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:07.210
But what if headphones could actually get
you high off your tunes?

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.860
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.089
You know those moments where you put on your
headphones and dive into your own world?

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.439
Where everything just feels great?

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.179
Music is often an external expression of our
emotion, and we use it to guide our own.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.130
But now a Florida startup claims its product
could turn your tunes into mood enhancers.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.759
Called Nervana, these headphones allegedly
trigger the release of additional dopamine

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.900
in your brain.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
How?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.160
According to the company, the headphones work
by adding a low-power electric pulse that’s

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.140
matched to the beat of the music.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.850
They explain that an electrical signal is
sent through the inside of the ear canal and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.080
to the vagus nerve, which causes a release
of brain chemicals that make you feel good.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.080
Supposedly.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.460
Now, there *is* research that shows that stimulating
the vagus nerve does some pretty weird stuff.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.650
The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve
in the body.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.280
It’s name means wandering, and oh boy does
it get around.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.190
It has branches not only in the ear but in
the heart and lungs and gut, and it plays

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.840
a crucial role in regulating our parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.729
When the nerve receives certain signals from
stimuli, the vagus nerve tells the brain to

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.740
release certain neurotransmitters, like calming
GABA, stress inducing norepinephrine, and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.479
mood changing serotonin.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.509
So by “hacking” this system, we could
potentially control it.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.490
Which is the idea behind these headphones.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.070
But they aren’t the only gadget on the block
claiming to hack your body…

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
Another product called “Thync” also claims
to change your mood by tapping into another

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240
nerve.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.530
The smartphone controlled wearable device
includes two strips with electrodes that attach

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.829
to your head and send electrical signals to
nerves in your face, like the trigeminal nerve

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.829
in your forehead.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.569
A study in the journal Epilepsy Behavior found
that stimulating the trigeminal nerve can

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.570
help treat depression and epilepsy, and a
peer-reviewed study conducted by Thync found

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.549
that it can “significantly lower levels
of tension and anxiety.”

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.569
One writer claims that Thync gives him a bit
of a pick-me-up, similar to a cup of coffee

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.639
and helps with relaxation.

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.240
Another interesting piece of tech is a light
called Lucia No.3.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.700
Its makers claim it can induce a kind of meditative
state by combining flashing bright lights

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.780
and music.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.780
They claim it activates the pineal gland.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.940
Which yes, light does seriously affect the
gland because it’s part of our circadian

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.370
rhythm - it’s responsible for the production
of melatonin, the chemical that makes us feel

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.370
sleepy.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.510
And there’s some evidence that maybe the
pineal gland makes DMT, a molecule that can

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.739
trigger some serious psychedelic experiences.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.080
So it’s plausible that the light works.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.530
Anecdotal evidence from BBC and VICE journalists
reveals mixed results.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.980
Some say they see psychedelic images and colors,
kind of like synthesia, others say it’s

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.220
more uncomfortable and makes their eyes twitch.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.590
As for the headphones, well they’re on the
right track.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.799
Vagus nerve stimulation has been around since
the 1990s.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.780
Researchers found that an electrically stimulating
device implanted* in the chest and hooked

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.970
up to the vagus nerve can help ease epilepsy,
treatment resistant depression, and even rheumatoid

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.220
arthritis.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.409
One journalist who tried the headphones said
she felt she had reached a personal high point,

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.640
her happiness was 10 out of 10.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
So who knows.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640
We’ll just have to wait and find out.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640
Dnews labs anyone?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.700
Some people have orgasmic experiences without
gadgets though… for more on brain orgasms

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:28.041
check out Laci’s old school epsisode here
Which, if any, of these devices would you

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.041
want to try?

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.500
And, I’m curious, what do you listen to
when you need a pick me up?
