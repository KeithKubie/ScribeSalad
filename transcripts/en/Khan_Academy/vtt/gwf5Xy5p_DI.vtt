00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.677
- In this video we will
begin to explore the field

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:08.844
of ethology, which is the
study of animal behavior.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.633
Animal

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.466
behavior.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.301
And the word itself, ethology,

00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.301
it has its roots in the Greek ethos,

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:24.463
and you also might be familiar
with the word, ethics.

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:28.920
Ethos, and ethics, you
keep seeing this "eth",

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.258
and it's generally referring
to something's character.

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:33.745
So you could say this is the study

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:35.453
of the character of
animals, or in general,

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:37.453
the behavior of animals.

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:40.765
And so, let's just first
think of a framework,

00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:42.266
and then we're gonna try to apply it

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:46.111
to different types of animal
behaviors that we see.

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.282
So first, what is behavior?

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:53.262
Well, you have some type
of environmental stimulus,

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:56.121
and it evokes some type of a response,

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.038
some type of a response in the animal.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.094
And so that is a pretty good definition

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:06.094
of what behavior, of what
behavior, actually is.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.607
It's some type of response to
stimulus in an environment.

00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:13.585
The stimulus could be another
animal doing something,

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:15.573
it could be the temperature, it could be

00:01:15.573 --> 00:01:20.247
the availability of food,
it might be the sun setting,

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.312
who knows, but it's some type of

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:24.895
response, due to that stimulus.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.138
Now so, that's the first
thing we're gonna look at,

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:32.482
the second thing is, well, how
did this behavior come about?

00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:33.989
Was it learned?

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.359
Was it innate?

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.283
So a learned behavior, that animal saw

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:39.508
something else doing it, and said hey,

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:41.945
that's a good idea, next
time I see that stimulus,

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:43.869
or they might not even be
thinking that much about it,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.109
but somehow they are trained to do it.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.319
Whenever they did that behavior

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.059
they got rewarded
somehow, or whatever else.

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:54.293
And the other option is that it's innate,

00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:57.170
the animal would have done it
even if there was no training,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.227
even if they never had observed it,

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:01.810
it's in their genetics somehow.

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.501
And the third question we're
going to ask ourselves is,

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.825
well, what's the benefit here?

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.417
What's the benefit here,
especially in a case,

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:15.810
or in a context of, natural selection.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.399
Or you know, how did it evolve,
and it should have evolved

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.896
because there's some
benefit, where the members

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:27.063
of a species that have that
behavior, are selected for.

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:29.667
So natural selection.

00:02:30.524 --> 00:02:32.726
So now that we have a
little bit of our framework,

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:35.905
let's think about some animal behaviors.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.481
Well right over here I have a baby crying,

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.279
and yes, we humans, it's
nice to remind ourselves

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.553
that we are animals, we
should feel very proud

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:46.832
to be part of this animal kingdom,

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:50.712
and the behavior here is the child crying,

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.586
and I'll assume this
child is maybe hungry.

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:56.614
There's many reasons why a baby might cry,

00:02:56.614 --> 00:03:00.073
as you might discover when you
have one, I have three now,

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.084
and I think I have most
of the reasons down.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.093
But let's say in this context,

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:07.549
the stimulus is a lack of food.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.716
Lack of food, and it leads
to the response of crying.

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:17.125
My two year old just the other day

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:20.708
was screaming from his
crib, "I want food!"

00:03:21.614 --> 00:03:23.820
And he was kind of crying it out,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.363
and so that type of behavior,

00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:29.461
where you have lack of
food leading to crying,

00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:31.544
well let's think about it, let's actually

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.093
first think about, what's
the benefit of that?

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.451
It's almost obvious, or
it's almost too obvious.

00:03:35.451 --> 00:03:37.633
Well, if a baby didn't do that,

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:40.656
then the parents might not
notice that it's hungry,

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.371
and the baby might not get the food,

00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.746
might get malnourished, or in
an extreme case, might starve.

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:49.163
And so by crying, it allows other people,

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:52.406
say, oh, I need to feed that baby.

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:55.439
Because a baby isn't able to
go hunt down it's own food,

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.085
it isn't able to, you know, get in the car

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.751
and go buy a sandwich, or go the fridge

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.776
and make itself some cereal,
it needs other people to do it.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:07.308
And even the behavior that
I might have as a parent,

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:09.597
to say oh my god, my son is crying,

00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:11.660
I need to go get him some food!

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.218
That itself is a behavior, the stimulus.

00:04:14.218 --> 00:04:16.395
So there's one stimulus,
the child's hungry,

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.991
leading to the response
of the child crying,

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.941
and then that response is then

00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:24.599
a stimulus to me, to say,
to have the response of,

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.336
oh, let me feed my child
so that they stop crying.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.568
And so you can imagine it has a

00:04:30.568 --> 00:04:33.184
significant benefit in natural selection.

00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:36.551
You could imagine, and I think
it would be, you wouldn't--

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.197
This probably happened in
our evolutionary history

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:43.395
far before humans came about, but whatever

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:46.566
organism you're talking
about, or some animal,

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:50.471
if the offspring that are
better at making it known

00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:53.497
that they are hungry,
especially if these offspring

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:56.247
are dependent on their
parents, or something else

00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:59.467
to get them food, well, the ones that cry

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:01.642
are more likely to get the food,

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:03.557
and are more likely to survive,

00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:07.834
and pass their DNA on
to future generations.

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:10.648
And so it makes sense, this
is almost an obvious one,

00:05:10.648 --> 00:05:11.956
why this is favorable from a

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.130
natural selection point of view.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.341
Another interesting question, and this is,

00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.834
you should even ask this
about your own behavior,

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:20.592
anything that you observe, is,

00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:23.878
is that behavior learned versus innate?

00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:26.168
I haven't run any experiments here,

00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:29.501
but I would guess, my hypothesis is that

00:05:30.348 --> 00:05:33.571
the baby crying in response
to not having food,

00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:37.062
that this is innate, that a baby,

00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:39.566
no one has to teach baby to do this.

00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:42.443
It's somehow programmed into their DNA,

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:45.232
it's programmed into their brain.

00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:48.073
They don't have to be trained to cry.

00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:50.326
Now, when my five year old cries

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:52.500
because I didn't give her dessert,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.296
even though she has
just eaten a full meal,

00:05:55.296 --> 00:05:56.472
I think that might be learned.

00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:58.003
She might be seeing that hey,

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:00.847
her younger brother tends to
get his way when he cries,

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:03.720
maybe at five years old,
I should still do that

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.125
even though I really don't have to,

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.229
because I really don't need that dessert,

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:08.760
that might be learned.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.865
So once again, it depends on the context,

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:13.378
and it's a really interesting
thing to think about.

00:06:13.378 --> 00:06:17.028
But lets move on to other
members of the animal world,

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:21.918
this right here is Pippy,
who works at Khan Academy,

00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:25.251
so Pippy, and when there is food around,

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.031
Pippy acts extra cute, and needy.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.024
So let's, so the stimulus here is food,

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:33.807
I guess there's a food theme here,

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:36.328
maybe I need to be eating some food.

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:39.525
So maybe when I have a lack of food

00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:41.830
my response is making a video about it,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.563
but anyway (laughs) when
Pippy is around food,

00:06:45.563 --> 00:06:47.480
acts extra, extra cute,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.713
and needy.

00:06:51.713 --> 00:06:53.169
And I think all of us have seen

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.490
dogs behave this way,
and it might just seem

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.621
like a simple thing, but this is actually,

00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:01.492
could be a very important
behavior for a dog.

00:07:01.492 --> 00:07:02.583
That, you know, we know what the stimulus,

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.642
and what the response is,
learned versus innate?

00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:07.575
Well, it might be a little bit of both,

00:07:07.575 --> 00:07:08.619
and that's something you'll see

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.580
as you try to analyze more
and more animal behaviors

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.146
is that, well, it's sometimes a continuum.

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:16.729
Maybe there's an inclination to

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:21.161
do that behavior, but by learning
it, they get better at it.

00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:22.958
So maybe Pippy would have always

00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.170
been somewhat needy around food,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.802
but when it sees other dogs do it,

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:31.135
then more likely to learn that behavior.

00:07:31.998 --> 00:07:33.949
And a good example of something that's

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.801
between learned and innate
for human beings is language.

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:39.646
Now we could do a whole series,

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:43.559
people dedicate their lives
to studying human language,

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:46.044
but we think, we have a
lot of reason to believe,

00:07:46.044 --> 00:07:48.602
that humans have an innate bias to

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:52.225
wanting to communicate, and
having this structured language,

00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:55.335
but you clearly learn
your particular language.

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:57.684
If human beings were to just,

00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:00.581
if you threw a bunch
of babies on an island,

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.958
which sounds like a very-- it
is a very cruel experiment,

00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.261
at some point, they, if they survived,

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.695
they would develop their own language.

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.444
But we also know that if you put a baby

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:12.078
in the context of someone
speaking English, or French,

00:08:12.078 --> 00:08:13.753
or Hindi, or whatever else, that they

00:08:13.753 --> 00:08:15.449
will actually learn the language.

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:18.637
So these two things are not
always one way or the other,

00:08:18.637 --> 00:08:21.102
in fact, in most cases,
it's some place in between,

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:24.128
or it's a combination
of learned, and innate.

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.922
But let's go back to Pippy, why is that a,

00:08:26.922 --> 00:08:28.452
what's the benefit there?

00:08:28.452 --> 00:08:29.925
What's a way of getting food?

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.285
Why would that be selected for?

00:08:31.285 --> 00:08:34.214
Well, the wolves, thousands of years ago,

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.810
that were better at kind
of getting close to humans,

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.894
and acting extra cute, and needy,

00:08:38.894 --> 00:08:41.114
well, they were able to get food,

00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:42.797
they didn't have to
hunt it down themselves.

00:08:42.797 --> 00:08:45.442
And that's actually how dogs came about.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.089
And we can think of many,
many other examples,

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:52.908
so this right over here, this
is an opossum playing dead,

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.566
kind of a famous behavior.

00:08:54.566 --> 00:08:58.711
So when there is a threat,
when there is a threat,

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.408
maybe a predator around,
this opossum plays dead.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:04.815
Plays dead.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.198
I would guess, it's
interesting to think about,

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:09.930
whether it's innate, or
learned, that this is innate.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.163
That they didn't have
to see another opossum

00:09:12.163 --> 00:09:14.656
do this behavior, in fact, it might,

00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:15.962
they might not even be able to help it

00:09:15.962 --> 00:09:18.006
when their stress hormones
go up high enough,

00:09:18.006 --> 00:09:21.020
they might just turn into
this looking dead state.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.008
And a lot of times, just to, you know,

00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:24.521
when people say, that's instinct,

00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:27.694
they're often talking
about an innate behavior.

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:29.128
Instinct.

00:09:29.128 --> 00:09:31.518
It's not saying, oh, well,
maybe if I played dead

00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:33.909
and act really well, that
predator might not come,

00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:35.593
it just can't help it, maybe you know,

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:37.617
it's hormones go up, and it
just gets into this state.

00:09:37.617 --> 00:09:39.558
And you might say, well,
what's the benefit there?

00:09:39.558 --> 00:09:41.023
It seems like it's easy to catch.

00:09:41.023 --> 00:09:42.993
Well, other animals might not

00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.771
like eating things that are dead,

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:47.264
maybe it has a disease, or whatever else,

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:49.550
and it doesn't wanna catch it, and so,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.766
something about the
evolutionary past of opossums,

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:55.080
or pre-possums, they were selected for,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.988
the ones that were able to do this

00:09:55.988 --> 00:09:58.230
had a higher chance of not being killed,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.885
and then passing on their offspring,

00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:02.242
and so we now see this in opossums.

00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:04.078
And once again, we could go through

00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:07.147
a whole range of behaviors,
from hibernation,

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:09.794
there's also a phenomenon actually that,

00:10:09.794 --> 00:10:11.715
so there's things like hibernation,

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:15.297
where bears famously
hibernate for the winter.

00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:16.817
Why is that useful?

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:18.730
Well the stimulus is it's getting cold,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.322
or in a different part of the season,

00:10:20.322 --> 00:10:22.110
and so they all hibernate.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.275
Why is that useful?

00:10:23.275 --> 00:10:25.367
Well, it's, they lower
their metabolic rate,

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:29.100
their need for food when there's
less availability of food.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.514
And so that also can give you clues

00:10:31.514 --> 00:10:33.615
about why it might have been selected for.

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:37.157
There's actually a similar,
or form of hibernation,

00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:39.573
I guess you could say, called aestivation,

00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:42.555
aestivation, which I actually
didn't know this word

00:10:42.555 --> 00:10:44.293
until I started looking into this,

00:10:44.293 --> 00:10:46.335
and this is a, and sometimes in the US

00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:48.791
they don't put the "A" in
front, it's just estivation,

00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:51.597
with the "E", but this is a form of

00:10:51.597 --> 00:10:54.130
going into a lower metabolic state

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.566
when things are really hot, or very dry,

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:00.257
when you don't have availability of water.

00:11:00.257 --> 00:11:04.247
So it's less familiar than
hibernating for the winter,

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:05.878
but it's another form of getting into

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:07.035
a lower metabolic state.

00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:08.303
And you might say, well
why does that happen?

00:11:08.303 --> 00:11:09.574
Why would that be selected for?

00:11:09.574 --> 00:11:10.704
Which animals do that?

00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:13.135
And is it innate, is it learned?

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:16.483
I would propose that
both of these are innate,

00:11:16.483 --> 00:11:18.942
that the animal, most of
the animals that do this

00:11:18.942 --> 00:11:21.128
would do it regardless of
whether they somehow got trained,

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:24.378
or observed some other animal doing it.
