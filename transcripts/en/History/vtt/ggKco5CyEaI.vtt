00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.380
[music playing]

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.830
NARRATOR: Tell Abu Habbah, Iraq.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.620
In the Iraqi desert, just 18
miles southwest of Baghdad,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.540
lie the ruins of
ancient Babylonia.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.670
In 1881, archaeologists
digging at the ancient site

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.080
unearthed tens of thousands
of stone tablets dating

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.170
back to the sixth century BC.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.540
Amongst the finds
was a bass-relief

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.830
carving depicting the
Mesopotamian sun-god Shamash.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.830
This here is the
Babylonian tablet

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.580
of Shamash, which
has the central disc

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.920
right here with god
Shamash right here

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.250
and human beings right here.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.380
What's so cool in
this depiction is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.250
that Shamash is shown as if
he was some type of a giant

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.460
because he's much, much bigger
than the rest of the people

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.750
here.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.290
The enclosure has this type
of a connection to the cosmos,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.540
because you've a depiction of
the moon, the sun, and Venus.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.790
Now, what I think is really
cool is that up here you

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.710
have the celestial
being that is sort

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.380
of holding on to this disc.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
The fact that this celestial
being has these two ropes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
attached to this disc
leads me to think

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.920
about misunderstood technology.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.920
The sun disc in
the tablet of Shamash

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420
is described in the
below text as such:

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.000
The disc was sent there
or put there to be

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.830
worshipped in place of Shamash.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.750
It was the access point
for the ancient Babylonians

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.920
to communicate
with their gods, in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.330
particular the sun-god Shamash.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.250
This could actually be
some method of communicating

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.170
with the god himself.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.750
It is some form of a technology.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.620
Think of it as sort
of a god button

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.330
that the ancient Babylonians
or Sumerians could push

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.500
and be able to
connect with Shamash.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.420
NARRATOR: If the actual sun
disc depicted on the tablet

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380
is ever found among the
ruins of ancient Babylonia,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.040
will we discover that it is some
sort of technological device?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.710
Perhaps further
clues can be found

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.380
by examining the story
of an Incan ruler

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.330
who wore a disc
which allowed him

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.670
to wield the power of the gods.
