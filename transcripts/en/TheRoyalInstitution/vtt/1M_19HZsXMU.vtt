00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.480
Hello, Lloyd, hello.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.680
Hello, Bran.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.600
Now Lloyd, do you get the feeling that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.190
Bran uses information

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.230
about where you're looking?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.230
Yes, very much so.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.250
Can we see an example of that, Lloyd?

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.250
We certainly can.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.520
Now Bran has a special stone,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.410
he knows that word,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.250
and it's hidden somewhere in this room.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.390
So if I let him eat that piece of food

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.079
and say "Where's your stone, Bran, where is
it?"

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.999
And he's looking. And then if I look.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.280
Where's your stone, Bran?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.840
No, he did, he was really looking at...

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
He looked around and then

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.929
looked where you were looking.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:50.929
Yes.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:51.929
- And now...

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:52.929
Let's just, Bran!

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.440
That's a good boy, thank you very much.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.000
Luckily Bran chose the person in the room

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.670
we know is most easily scared. So that was
good.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.120
You going to be OK?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.119
That's amazing. But why would ravens be

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.670
particularly good at this ability to understand

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
what it means when

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.049
something is looking somewhere?

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.070
Well it could be because it's a very useful
way of helping them solve problems.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.759
And these are birds that have to solve a lot
of problems in the world, aren't they?

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.259
Before we actually go into an example of this,
we're just going to show you

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.760
how good Bran is at solving problems.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.280
And we've got here a puzzle box Bran hasn't
seen before.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.560
It's got some food in it that Bran's going
to want.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.509
And what we're going to do is show it to him
and he's going to work out

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.659
how to solve the problem of getting through
to the stuff he wants in the middle.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.223
Is that OK? Are we alright to begin?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.223
- We certainly are

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.310
Go on Bran, go there.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
So he's got to work out how to get into that.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.120
Unbelievable.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.480
That's it.
- Yes!

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400
I've made it hard for him. This is not an
easy one.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.600
He just gave us a right look, like ugh, come
on.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.440
So he's got to pull the string?
- Yep.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
This is an emotional rollercoaster.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.000
He got it.
- Oh, there we go! Fantastic.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.040
Well done, Bran.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.240
Now in the wild, a bird like Bran has got
to solve puzzles and problems all the time,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.060
and one of them is - there are lots of other
birds like Bran out there

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.590
who are also very clever so when Bran wants
to hide his food,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.380
he has got to find some way of tricking other
birds, if they're looking at him.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.840
Now I've got a clip of a bird doing some deception.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.640
The bird's using communication to lie to other
birds

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.400
but Bran really dislikes videos so we're going
to say

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510
thank you to Lloyd and thank you to the extremely
clever Bran before we show that.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.840
Thank you.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.280
This is a bird that is being watched by other
birds who all saw her bury her food earlier.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.360
Now she knows they're no longer watching,
she's hiding the food elsewhere.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.690
This is typical of raven and crow behaviour.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.890
So this is an example of the ravens using
their understanding of eye gaze

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.400
to help them solve the problem of how they
stop other ravens from stealing all their food.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.960
And it's an interesting point that what you're
seeing is them using deception

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.580
as a way of covering up what they really want
to do.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.400
And of course deception is still a form of
communication.
