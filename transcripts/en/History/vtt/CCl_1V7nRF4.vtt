00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.671
NARRATOR: On Alaska's wild

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.373
the hunt is on.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.843
We're going to head over here
and see if we can find a fox.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.378
NARRATOR: Bear
tracker, Mike Horstman

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.247
makes his living guiding
outlanders who come to hunt

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.316
the island's giant predators.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:20.220
My guiding and the hunts
that I do here basically

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.624
makes up my yearly income,
subsidized by some fishing,

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:25.925
trapping.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.360
NARRATOR: The
40-year veteran knows

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.262
the secrets of this island.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.098
And today, he and
his hunting dog Adele

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.367
are chasing down a rare quarry.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.903
The foxes are bigger
here because they

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.738
just have so much food.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:42.675
There's red fox, cross
fox, but the silver fox

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.912
is what brings the most money.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:46.813
Get over here.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:47.647
Get over here.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.715
[rabbit call]

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.551
I'm using a call that
imitates a rabbit

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.053
that a fox, a hawk, an eagle--

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.722
that something is killing--

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.357
and it's a distress call.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:01.127
[rabbit call]

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.729
NARRATOR: But
seven-year-old Adele

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.864
is Mike's true secret weapon.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:07.267
You see anything
out there, honey?

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.935
NARRATOR: He's
trained her from a pup

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.806
to retrieve kills on a hunt.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.942
Sometimes you can sit
here and call all day,

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:17.744
and it wouldn't
make any difference.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.147
There's none within
earshot of here.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.650
Let's go down-- We're just going
to sneak along through here

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.518
and just be quiet,
pay attention,

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:26.786
and see what we've can up with.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.891
There's a fox track right there.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.227
Is that a fresh one?

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:38.264
Yeah, there's fox
tracks all over.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:42.535
See if there's any fox out
here in these fields mousing.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:50.310
[rabbit call]

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.780
There's one right there.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.787
[gunshot]

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.654
Get him!

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.995
Nah, I don't know.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.030
Nah, I don't see any blood.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.601
NARRATOR: Mike narrowly misses
his shot at a Kodiak cross fox.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.071
There's no blood, there's
no hair, there's no fox.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.140
NARRATOR: But a rare fur
comes with a promise of a $200

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.010
pay day, so he's not
ready to quit yet.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.412
So we'll set it up again.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.548
See if we can find another one.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:32.719
Hopefully, we'll have a little
more luck closer to the river.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.053
NARRATOR: And with
nearly 40 years

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.823
of surviving on this
island under his belt,

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.891
he knows where to look.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.495
Get down here, honey.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.496
Get down.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.965
Get down.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.903
[rabbit call]

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:51.771
There he is, right there.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.279
[gunshot]

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.179
Go ahead!

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.514
Get him!

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.483
NARRATOR: Mike Horstman has
a silver fox in his sights.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.217
Go ahead!

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.552
I got him!

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.654
NARRATOR: And his hunting
partner, seven-year-old Adele,

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:10.189
races in to seal the deal.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.558
Nice job!

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.761
Adele, as long as she's been
with me-- like seven years

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.663
now-- she's caught lots of fox.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.332
If that fox is wounded,
she's going to grab him,

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.534
dispatch him, and it's over.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:22.936
You got him?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.104
Good girl!

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.506
That's good.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.241
That's a beauty.
Beauty, yeah.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.678
This is the one everybody wants.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.113
So, now we'll take
this one, and we're

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.114
going to go back towards
camp and skin it accordingly.
