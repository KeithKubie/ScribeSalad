00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.450
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer:
Today's lecture is presented

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.450
by the John W Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.690
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capital Hill

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.980
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.270
to simulate and energize
one another.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.110
To distill with them from
the Libraries rich resources

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130
and to interact with policy
makers and the public.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.940
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.960
postdoctoral fellows and PhD
candidates to conduct research

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.110
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.600
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences and symposium

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.160
and other programs and we
administer the Kluge Prize.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.480
Which recognizes outstanding
achievement

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.010
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.930
For more information about the
Kluge Center, I encourage you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.560
to visit our website loc.gov slash
kluge and I invite you to sign

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.810
up for our RSS email list to
learn about future programs

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.830
and opportunities for you to
conduct your own research here

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.510
at the Library.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.100
Today's program is titled,
It from Bit, Cross-cultural

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.370
and Interdisciplinary
links in Modern Computing.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.080
It features senior
librarian at the Library

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.520
of Congress Jennifer Baum Sevec.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.440
Who is this years Kluge
Staff Fellow.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.470
While at the Kluge Center Baum
Sevec has been using items

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.880
from the Library of
Congress collections in order

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.710
to identify cross-cultural

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.940
and interdisciplinary
contributions to modern computing.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.350
Her work at the Library
primarily focuses on the areas

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.710
of access medidata, special
collections acquisitions, strategic

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.370
and digital initiatives,
business systems analysis

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.160
and web development.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.410 position:56%
She holds an MA in religion cultural
studies and is an MS candidate

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.640
in information technology
and informatics

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.750
at the University of Maryland.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.260
Her work on the art exhibit,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.010
the holy art of imperial
Russia continues to travel

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.190
as an art installment at
various museums throughout the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.740
United States.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.060
Jennifer's research is the
latest example of the work

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.450
that Kluge staff fellows
do in helping us

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.890
to understand the world around us.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.250
The Library staff is full of
brilliant and esteemed colleagues

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.850
who are passionate about
the areas of expertise

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.270
and the staff fellowship
allows one or sometimes two

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.980
such staff members the
opportunity each year

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820
to conduct independent research
using the Libraries collections

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.100
in pursuit of their scholarship.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.130
Funded by the gift left
by the late John W Kluge

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.140
to found the Kluge Center,
the staff fellow is one

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.250
of the nearly 100 scholars who pass

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.740
through our walls each year
creating the vibrant scholar center

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.970
on Capital Hill that we know
as the John W Kluge Center.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.730
It is been our great privilege
to have Jennifer with us

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.800
as this years Kluge Staff
Fellow for the past six months.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.510 position:56%
So without further ado please join
me in welcoming Jennifer Baum Sevec.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.270
[ Applause ]

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.470
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Baum Sevec: Thank you
Jason for that very warm welcome.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.570
This is an excellent crowd, I'm
pleased to see so many familiar

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.270
and some new faces as well,
so thank you for coming on a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.580
such a gorgeous day in Washington.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.280
I would be remiss to not
thank the [inaudible] people

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.620
who made this fellowship possible.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.380
I'm very grateful to Mister John
W Kluge for his generous gift

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.680
and vision to ensure a staff
fellowship at the center,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.120
the Kluge Center staff
welcomed me from the outset

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.920
and they have been wonderful.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.450
I thank you all, inter director
Bob Gallucci, Mary Lou Reker,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.960
Travis Hensley, Jason Steinhauer,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.970
Joann Anastasia Dan [assumed
spelling], Emily, Denise,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.610
all of you thank you
for your support.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.930
The EB Director Beacher Wiggins,
USNC Chief Linda Geisler,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.280
Associate Librarian of
Library Services Mark Sweeney

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.830
and the division staff particularly
of the US Anglo Division

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.650
and I would be absolutely remiss

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.530
if I did not thank
the US Monograph team

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.000
for carrying the load
while I was gone.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.890
So I very much appreciate
your support.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.900
I also need to thank Doctor Katrin
Weller she was a former digital

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.070
studies fellow at the center
and two of our former Library

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.030
of Congress colleagues
Doctor Trevor Owens

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.640
and Miss Bridgetta Jenkins whose
support provided me sufficient

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.230 position:56%
courage to apply for the fellowship.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.450
There's also unfailing
support from all

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.340 position:56%
of the colleagues throughout the
Library, there's just to many of you

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.890
to name any of you are here right
now, it's been extraordinary.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.970
To the Kluge Fellows, your
inspiring work, collegiality,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.780
marvelous interdisciplinary
engagement has been incredibly

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.140
rewarding both professionally and
personally so thank you very much.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.270
And last at the risk
of being braggadocios

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.160
and since you gave me a
podium I'm going to say it.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.920 position:56%
I'm clearly biased here, the Library
of Congress arguably has some

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.540
of the best, most resourceful
dedicated staff in the world.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.080
The collections are unparalleled

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.300
to new acquisitions including
digital materials are continuously

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.370
being added for greater
public access.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.300
The extensive work done out
front and behind the scenes,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.210
provides an incredible
experience that's incomparable.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.460
To engage in knowledge spanning
millennial and all formats

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.820
in nearly all subject matters
and over 470 languages.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.220 position:56%
For those of you who are considering
a fellowship here or are interested

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.670
in research at this great
Library, the worlds largest.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.150
Consider this your
personal invitation.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.450
We're open.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.300
I have the great pleasure
today, to showcase some

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.980
of the Library's collections as
one of the really unique things

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.930
about these staff fellowship, cause
you really get to dig into the maze

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.700
of goodies here and feature
some of the treasures.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.140
Some of these I helped acquire
and make accessible and I get

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.990
to do all this while
sharing a remarkable story.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.500
So without further
ado let's get to it.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.040
The title of the talk today as you
see is, It from Bit, Cross-cultural

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.250
and Interdisciplinary
links in modern computing.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.230
Looking at modern cultural
isn't known

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.090
or well understood how our
digital world was created.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.870
Do we understand how
various theories, practices,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.390
innovations from different
cultures and disciplines informed

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.510
and helped others to flourish?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.400
What does it mean to be
technically inspired?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.770 position:56%
Fields of research tend to be rather
isolated, mathematics, physics,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.730
computer science, similar areas of
study are thought to be independent

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.420
of and not reliant on
other fields of study,

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.640
particularly the humanities.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.300
While the Renaissance is
known for thinkers and doers,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.460
adept in multiple fields
of research.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.450
Mono scholarship has distanced
itself from such an approach.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.310
Although some scholarship
addresses digital history

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:25.250
and interdisciplinary work, the
body of this scholarship is focused

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.100
on technological advancements in
the 20th and 21st centuries rather

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.530
than cultural and multiple
discipline contributions

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.560
to the understanding of how
our digital world formed prior

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.830
to and during this time.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.200
The problem with this
difference is two-fold.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.500
First.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.580 position:56%
Sorry about that, that was my fault.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.110
Thank you, I'll stop
touching the knobs.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.670
Okay. So first bits and bites have
ancient interdisciplinary roots

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.340
that are part of multiple
fields of study

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.160
and that story must inform
our present and future.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.710
I didn't touch it, I swear.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:15.020
Okay. So I'll just
keep going all right.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.010
Second, the humanistic inquiry and
[inaudible] innovation may appear

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.100
to be independent of one
discipline to another.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.610
Yet they weave a more
interconnected story as well

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.080
as demonstrate the pervasiveness

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.150
of digital technologies
in modern culture.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.660
I'm going to stop reading here very
soon, but I wanted to get right.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.680
Rather than shying away from the
interdisciplinary and intertwining

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.600
of ideas and interests of great
inspirations and innovations

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.040
over time, the research
celebrates the breath and depth

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.760 position:56%
of their formulation in a story that
navigates from ancient foundations

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.370
to modern day technology.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.350
The importance of this
study is more,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.910
to more fully address the
how did we get here question.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.930
Using Wheeler's observe a
participant concept is a lens

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.840
to examine It from Bit.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.270
Which I'll explain momentarily.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.060
The use of computers and other
digital technologies is growing

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.360
into a maturity,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.080
while simultaneously catapulting
inter realms of advanced research

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.600
and use previously not encountered.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.520
Misconceptions abound
and the complexity scale

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.140
and following information
add to the confusion.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.650 position:56%
We wouldn't know anything about that
here at the Library of Congress.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.910
This research looks deeply
at the creative thinking

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.750
that enabled innovation for
calculation, storage, communication

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.950
and information with
digital technologies

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.900
that has substantive implications
for the present and the future.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.330
For learning discovery, cultural
dynamics and human understanding.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.600
The modern primary
research sources of today,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.120
which range from podcasting
on social media to email

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.050
and satellite radio
must be understood

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.610
in the context of their
larger history.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.360
The existing discourse and research
on digital history tends to leap

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.740
from the AdvoCast to Leibniz to
bull and Babbage and to Shannon

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.370
and Turing among many others.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.290
I need to say that today,
you really need to take note

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.270
that there are going to be
key people and innovations

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.380
and contributions to computing

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.980
that will be missing
from the lecture today.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.950
In fact, it was a little painful
to cut out so much due to time,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.030
the point was not to cover
history comprehensively but to add

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.370
to the scholarly discourse in ways

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:35.270
that had not been well studied
beyond the known history.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.270
The exploration of how these
ideas developed is demonstrated

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.750
by three themes.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.220
Which is new research on
that lens of It from Bit.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.810
First they're were, galvanizing
ideas from cross-cultural

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.710
and interdisciplinary
links at pivotal moments,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.090
which we'll talk about
some of those.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.390
That people from various cultures

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.450
and disciplines ask
similar questions

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.020
and actively observed those
questions and participated in work

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.900
for understanding what
those questions meant.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.200
That these ideas in the work

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.370
on understandings form
a foundational concept

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.770
in modern computing.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.610
So went about this asking
two research questions.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.500
One, what cultural and topical
developments laid the ground work

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.250
for digital technology
is in the 20th

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.090
and 21st century, centuries
excuse me?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.560
And what are some of the
pivotal theories, practices,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.930
innovations from various
cultures and disciplines

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.390
that enable digital
technologies to flourish?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.600
I'll eventually be able to speak.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.280
Okay. So, getting into Wheeler.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.500
In February 1990, there
was a preprint issued

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.750
from the physics department
of Princeton

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.380
at the University of Texas.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.120
And John Archibald Wheeler wrote,
the title of it was, information,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.840
physics, quantum and
search for links.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.280
The phrase It from Bits
stems from this work,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.410
asking the age old metaphysical
question, how come existence.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.690
Wheeler offered an
information theory based

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.860
on Claude Elwood Shannon's work.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.150
Which we'll get to in
a bit, pun intended.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.760
So Wheeler theorized that
every it, every particle,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.780 position:56%
every field of force, even the space
time continuum itself derives it's

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.260
function, it's meaning, it's
very existence entirely.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.280
Even if it's some context
indirectly,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.210
from the apparatus
solicited answers to yes

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.550
or no questions, binary
choices or bits.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.110
So you may be asking yourself
what is the apparatus solicited?

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.230
The way I'm interpreting that
is, this whole concept of binary,

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.500
the whole choice of yes or
no, zero, one it is or isn't.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.800
Okay.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:53.070
Now, I was struggling a little
bit to try to figure out a way

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.700
to graphically represent this
and I used the smart graphics

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.650
from PowerPoint which
may or may not work here

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.990
but in a way I think it does work.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.750
When you look at Wheeler's theory,
the bit is sort of everything

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.410
in one thing, all at once.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.770
But it's comprised
of all of its parts.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.460 position:56%
So you have all these cross-cultural

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.410
and interdisciplinary
influences that lead to this bit.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.640
That is both its simultaneously
physical,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.780
philosophical and cultural.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.670
It'll make more sense as
we go through, hopefully.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.760
The cross-cultural links that
I discovered in this research,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.310
kind of surprised me, some of
these I really knew and then some

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.800
of them I didn't, you'll see here
that there's a lot of countries

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.500
and peoples that are involved,
these are just some that touch

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:47.920
on my research, but there are
others that I just didn't get to.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.420
As far as the interdisciplinary
links,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.420
you'll see it's pretty expansive

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.360
and some I even learned just a
few weeks ago, so it was kind

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.690
of interesting to have those
pop up towards the end.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.890
And I think what's also
compelling here is that,

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.120
when all of these disciplines
work together,

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.420
sometimes they work together,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.220
sometimes they were
working separately,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.930
but they were informing one
another sometimes directly,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.230
sometimes indirectly and then
it led to new disciplines.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.390
Things like chaos theory,
computer science itself,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.270
computer generated art with CGI in
many of you are familiar with that

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.790
with film, genetics,
information science and more.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.190
So everyday for the past almost
six months when I would come

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.940
into this great building I would
look up at the Jefferson Building

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.580
and I would notice the architecture
and I just had to throw this

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.150
in cause it made me laugh every
single day I came to work.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.570
And I did look for Carol High Smith
photo of this, I did not find one

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.460
to my surprise cause we have
almost every other picture

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.830
from her other than this.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.790
I still didn't touch the button.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.070
Okay. So, what made me laugh
at this picture I kept thinking

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.470
when I give this presentation
everyone is going to stare

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.510
at me going, what are
you talking about?

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.680
And as I would go to the cafeteria
people would say well make sure

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.660
whatever you're talking about
is something I can understand

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.960
and so this was sort

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.230 position:56%
of the expression I thought people
would have out there in the audience

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.790
as I was talking, like
what is she saying.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:19.810
So, if this very idea of binaries
and bits and bites gives you sort

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:21.970
of a glazed or dazed
facial expression,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.680
just know you're not alone.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.500
A lot of people who have that
thought, we're not really going

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.230
to go into the weeds so
to speak on some of that,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.300
but there's some fundamental
concepts that are pretty easy

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.330
to understand and just
remember that you use binary

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.700
and bits every single day
if you have one of these,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.100
one of your cell phones if you use
one of these, if you use a barcode

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.150
of any kind, there are
no librarians in here

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.920
that would be using barcodes I'm
sure, we use bits every single day.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.470
Okay. So, moving on.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.080
Because we're talking about bits
and we're talking about zero's

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.120
and ones I feel a little
obligated to go back in time here.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.540
This is a really fantastic writeup
if you haven't had a chance to look

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.590
at it from the World
Digital Library,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.130
which a lot of that
great work is done here

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.170
at the Library of Congress.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.420
And there is a wonderful
description here

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.400 position:56%
from a former distinguished visiting
scholar of the Kluge Center.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.750
And here you'll see just there's
so markers here of understanding

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.230
when the zero came into being,

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.980
you have the 300 BCE
Mesopotamia you can see

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.440
where that is if you're
not familiar.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.640
And the understanding when the
zero marker comes into place.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:44.240
The idea of number shift and the
idea that one following zero,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.880
really beginning in India.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.340
And their number system and the
whole idea of one through nine,

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.530
being able, with the zero, being
able to represent any number,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.790
infinite number combinations.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.630
So then we move into around 846 and
I'm not going to attempt this name

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.830
because this not my
language of expertise

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.220
but it was Russian I'd have a
better shot at it, but I don't.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:14.170
But it's important to
understand that this individual,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.950
whose work was translated into
Latin at about that same time,

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.560
is really well understood to
have coined the terms algebra

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.000
and algorithm, which again we
use in everything with computing

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.270
but in almost everything else also.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:36.930
So we jump then to 952 and I'm
going to attempt this one out,

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.960
Uqlidisi's invents the decimal
point in Damascus and that's a take

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.800
on basically what they think is
someone who was teaching Euclid

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.590
at the time so this
is the adopted name

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.970
of someone who was teaching Euclid.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.620
Okay, so that's just getting
a little bit of our bearings.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.350
But going back even
further, it was interesting

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.940
for me especially someone who
taught religion at the University

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.660
of Florida for several years
and taught religions of Asia.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.610
Where you would learn about
the, about Yin Yang and Daoism

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.580
and you would talk about the
I Ching, the book of changes.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.060
I was always taken with the
idea of trigrams, hexagrams

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:27.000
and then you can imagine my delight
when and during research I came

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.410
across something that was
in Scientific American

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.920
and it's dated 1885, excuse me
this is Popular Science Monthly.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:42.010
Where they're looking at those
trigrams and basically any of the

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.470
on the lower part of your screen

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.080
where you have the lines going
either all the way across or part

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.380
of the way across, the ones

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.090
that go all the way
across, stand for the zero.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.860
And then the ones that go
just part way across are ones

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.310
and it may be a little blurry on
yours but underneath each of those,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:04.690
are actually the binary equivalent,
so it should say something like,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.820
you know zero, zero, zero and then
zero, zero, zero, I actually said

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.380
that backwards, so the
short ones are zero

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.710
and then the long ones are one.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.050
And then it goes and so on
so they're in binary order.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.760
So even in 1885 people were
looking at this type of connection,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.000
19th century well before
the 20th, 21st century.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.860
I'm going to make just a
passing mention of this just

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.770
because it comes up a
lot in the literature.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.800
And I don't know if our very
own John Hessler is here,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.130
if he is he can tell you a lot
more about this than I can,

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.640
but I kept coming across
this concept of the Khipu,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.220
during the Incan empire, the idea

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.510
of recording information
with strings and knots.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.040 position:56%
And there's a lot of discussion
particularly by Professor Gary Urton

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.420
of Harvard, he's got a
whole database on these.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.450
See some knotting from our very
own anthropologist you know.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:08.490
It's, it's tough to say
that this is a binary system

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.790
and I'll tell you why.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.220
One we don't have what's the
equivalent of the Rosetta Stone,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.960
we don't have something that
say's this is what this means,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.640
there's no translation of
correlation necessarily set.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.490
I think what we can say is that
whatever this ends up being,

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.110
we hope to find out one day.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.130
It is clear that it
has binary opposition.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.750
Kind of calling in a little
bit of Levie Strauss here.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.840
But you know you have
different colors of string,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.160
you either have a white string

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.910
or you have a colored
string, binary opposition.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.540 position:56%
You either have a knot or you don't.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.630
The knot goes one direction or
it goes the other direction.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.600
But because you have all of these
different parts it's not exactly

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.600
binary because it's
a lot of extra stuff.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.430
So I throw it in there
because it's a concept

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.080
that was happening very early.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.830
That is very similar to again
what we use in modern computing.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:06.090
And one of the other ones I'll
talk about is from an Island

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.510
in French Polynesia, Mangareva.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.700
I got a clap on that
one that's fantastic.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.410
So it's really not imperative
to understand the math here

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.460
and I won't, I won't bore
you to death with that.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.830
Not sure one would be
excited about that but,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.400
what I think was compelling
for me about this was

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.650
that the population of people here.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.880
Came in three different waves
and well before colonialism came.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.060
And the research is pretty
clear that during the 2nd wave,

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.150
when you had people coming
from the southeast Marquesas.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:47.050
That there was an interesting
mathematical system

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.610 position:56%
that had a super position situation.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.930
So you'd have a binary system
and you'd have a decimal system.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.790
We need both of those in
order to use computers.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.800
In order to make calculations
more efficient, to do addition

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.530
and not have to go in
depth with multiplication.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.840
This system would allow you
to do that without notation,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.340
without having to write
it down, without having

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.670
to have a calculating machine.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.440
Very early, very complicated
and the concepts were there.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.340
And these were all things

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.070
that Leibniz noted much
later, centuries later.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.370
Okay so, speaking of Leibniz.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.460 position:56%
I thought it was really interesting
too to learn a little bit about him,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.550
you know we hear a lot
about him if you study math

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.330
or if you study computer
science but I didn't know

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.570
that he was once a librarian.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.500
And I learned that he was a
historian, he was a whole lot

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.490
of different things besides
philosopher and mathematician.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.360
But, when you look at what's
next to his image here,

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:59.000 position:56%
you'll see that this, a version of
his calculator, calculating machine.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.160
And it's going to look very
reminiscent to what we fast forward

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.860
to in the 20th century with Claude
Elwood Shannon at Bell Labs.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:15.020
What we find later on is that the
people who were most influential

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.350
in information theory, kept going
back to some of these greats

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.790
in mathematics and other fields,
they were going back to Bull,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.070
they were going back to Babbage,
they were going back to Leibniz,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:30.060
not necessarily in historical
order but you get the idea.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.160
Another area where we have a real
connection and I'm kind of jumping

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.330
around just slightly,
but I wanted to make sure

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.750
that the I Ching got
it's due historically.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:45.550 position:56%
Leibniz was in contact with a lot of
people, he was traveling all around,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:53.270
he was trying to defend the
claim to political structure

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.200
in his home country of Germany.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.830
And he was in contact with a French
Jesuit Bouvet and one of the things

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:09.680
that this priest brought back was
this brilliant view of the I Ching.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.810
And again the trigrams and then the
understanding of binary notation

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.780
and I don't know if you
can see it in the corners

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.800
but there are Arabic numbers,
there's I think it's 28 inverted

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.530
and then 27 down at
the bottom right.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.180
Those are in Leibniz's
hands and his hand.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.290
And basically what it did was allow
him to kind of have this concept

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.650
of universality with
binary number systems,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.910
became a very important
concept for this understanding

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.700 position:56%
of having a universal communication,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.050
which is eventually what
happens with a computer.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.480
So some of you may be
surprised to see Louis,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.590
most of us in this country know it
as a Braille but I've been educated

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.470 position:56%
to learn that it's actually Braille.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.400
And I found this fascinating
to understand this is

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.070
yet another binary system,
you either have raised dots

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.250
or you don't have raised dots.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:10.270
And that's kind of evident when
you look at it but as you think

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.510
about these systems and wonder
geez I don't really understand,

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.600
just think about how very straight
forward some of this really is.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.210
There's a raised dot or there
isn't, there's a one or a zero.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.990 position:56%
Okay so moving into Charles Babbage.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.430
Babbage is important for a lot of
different reasons and I'm not going

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.450 position:56%
to go into all of this because
again the literature is pretty clear

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:36.510
on his contributions.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.310
But, he kept trying to figure
out ways to improve calculation

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:46.630 position:56%
and to do it faster, you had so many
people trying to memorize tables

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.970
of information, data tables and
it just seemed like there had

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.590
to be a way to automate this.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:57.960
His collaboration with, she's
really well known as Ada Lovelace

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.430
but her full name is
there as you can read.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:05.120
She was the daughter of Lord
Byron and her mother was terrified

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.680
that she would follow in
her fathers footsteps.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.460
So she received a very astute
mathematical education,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.610
something that was
very rare at the time.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.090
Ada was a programer, before
programming was a thing.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.750
In fact there's actually
programming language named for her.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.060
It's very similar to Pascal for
any of those who like to program.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:31.260
But she was able to articulate
Babbage's work in a way

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.760
that he wouldn't be able to do.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.910
She was able to have people
understand that the algebra

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:41.330
that he was using, could
weave patterns as she says

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.250
so eloquently here, just like
the Jacquard-loom weaves,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.080
flowers and leaves.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.890
So it's the idea of taking this
processing, programming something

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:57.200
to record and transmit to
even calculate and share it.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.740
Not just a process it but to
share it, it was something

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.220
that she only recently,
only in the last ten years

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.790
or so has really gotten credit for.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.330
But really why I had to put all
of this in here was because I had

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.600
to get to this whole
concept of the Jacquard-loom.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.580
So this is sort of
selfish on my part.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.530
So here you, not a very
attractive photo or I mean image

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.740
of Mister Jacquard but what he
is important is his loom was the

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.970
beginning of where you really
started to see automation,

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:30.870
where you'd see punch
cards, automating a process

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.950
that was once a very manual
skilled craft work here,

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.770
there's no doubt about it.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:44.070
And jumping further this is why
those three size proceeding are

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.780
there is to get to this.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:52.210
The Library of Congress acquired
a book, this book, a few years ago

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.980
and it is one of the only,
it's actually the first book

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.650
to ever have been produced
with and I say automated,

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.650
automated in quotes
algorithm on a Jacquard-loom.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.460
It's really a very unassuming
book, it's relatively small,

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.110
it's woven entirely out of silk

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.660
and it was programed
entirely using punch cards.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.950
And you would never know it
when you look at it, the weave

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.480
and the weft is so tight it's,
it looks perfect even all

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.700
of these centuries later.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:33.700
This was also presented to a
worlds fair shortly thereafter.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.690
And this is important
because you're starting

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.760 position:56%
to spread information globally in
ways that people hadn't really seen,

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.640
the idea that you could have a
book printed this way was just

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.430
unheard of.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.540
So we're skipping ahead a
little bit here to Mister Morse,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.150
Samuel Finley Breese Morse.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.140
And some of the manuscript division
staff here we've had several

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.420
conversations about Mister Morse.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.550
But I found it really interesting
that he was an accomplished artist.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.500 position:56%
He was actually, his parents really
wanted him to go into the book trade

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.980
and really just wasn't interested.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.780
And there were a lot of
seminal moments in his career

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.890
but I think a few things
just to mention in passing,

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.790
since we are talking about
interdisciplinary kind

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.160
of contributions is that, you
know he was trained as a painter,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.570
he was relatively good at it
because he received commissions,

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.630
the Marquis de Lafayette
would be one,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.410
Noah Webster, there were others.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.090
But he couldn't make
any money at it.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.360
And so he had to come up
with something else to do.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.270
Also interestingly enough,

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.790
he on a trip to France
I think actually going

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.360
to meet the Marquis de
Lafayette, met Louise Daguerre

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.570
and was the first person
essentially in the US

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.010
to learn about the daguerreotype.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.620
Come back write it up,
about how do you do it

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.600
and then he taught Mathew Brady

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.510
who is probably the
most well known person

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.490
to have created daguerreotypes
in this country,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.070
especially for his work
with the Civil War.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.050
And so this is actually
daguerreotype,

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:17.350
the larger image is a daguerreotype
of Morse taken by Mathew Brady.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.980
And then that's just an
example of one of his paintings.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.860
But really what I'm
here to talk to you

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:30.010
about with Morse is just
his technical creations.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.760
He had a unfortunate tragedy,
his wife died relatively young,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.970
I mean by today standards anyway.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.270
And he didn't know, he didn't
know until after he went back home

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.280
to visit and she not only had died
but they had already buried her,

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.620
it was kind of sad and so
there was really no way

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.230
to communicate information faster.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.490 position:56%
Whether or not this was the empatice
[assumed spelling] for his creation,

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.610
I'm not sure we know exactly but
I think that's pretty good cause.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.380
So he started looking at ways
of doing it and there were a lot

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.580
of different innovations that led

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:08.710
up to him creating the
electromagnetic telegraph.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.820 position:56%
And it was a single wire system,
but I think what's really remarkable

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.500
about what he did was,
his system for Morse Code.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.880 position:56%
When you look at this image, what's
going to come back, what we're going

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.650
to back to here is, where
you see this yellow arrow.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.910
It looks remarkably
like pulse modulation,

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:35.610 position:56%
for anybody who studied
communications and again we're going

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.510
to get into Shannon
a little bit later

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:44.220 position:56%
but you know how you communicate a
message across an electrical system,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.800
you have to be able
to quantify that time.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:53.230
In order to make that information
be communicated, keep it together

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.670
so you go from one point to the
other and have it received it

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.270
and have it all make sense.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.340
For anybody who's familiar with
packet switching it's the same kind

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.760
of concept, you need to
keep it all together.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.020
You have to control that
time and that speed.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.130
And he was on to something
here, very early.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:15.550
Again well before the 20th century,
well before the 21st century.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.430
So, also just to give
you a sense one

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.400
of our resident experts
who's now retired,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.770
Lynn Bruno did a really
interesting video that you can find

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.620
on the libraries website talking
about that first transmission

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:36.840
by telegraph, where he sent What
Had God Wrought, is that right?

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.790
Looking at the manuscript people.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.860
From Washington to Baltimore.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.200
But it's not just having
done the transmission,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.640
it's also just how quickly
and how widely the ability

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:53.780
to transmit communication
through telegraph happened.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.920
It was within ten years
that you had 50

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:03.410
or more different companies
putting up new poles and trying

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.960
to get the communications

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.550
to you know really reach
all across the country.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.420
But then it gets really interesting
when he starts looking at the idea

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.960
of going across the Atlantic.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.250
So here is Morse's sketch for
an Atlantic cable stretch.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.810
And it's kind of ingenious again
when you start looking at it,

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:30.120 position:56%
it looks a lot like a relay, it
starts to have aspects of a circuit.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:36.070
You know it's pretty advanced for
the time of, for the time period.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.360
And again you'll some examples
that are somewhat similar later.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.020
Another thing that's
kind of compelling

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.010
with the telegraph
is it really starts

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.300
to take the imagination of people.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:56.000
You know they, here you're seeing a
really beautiful image of a march,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.660
that is the postal telegraph.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.610
I mean, who regularly has an
invention that people want to set

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.590
to music, it's pretty incredible.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.090
But there were a lot of them and a
lot of newspapers took their name,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.580
the something or other telegraph.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.100
We have the former chief

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.920 position:56%
of the [inaudible] government
documents division is nodding saying

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.060
yes we really do, we
had tons of those.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.950
So what really started to take
root in popular culture in the way

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.630
that we thought about
our communications.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.450
So we're, in the same
kind of time period

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:34.360
and we have the worlds
Columbian Exposition

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.530
in Chicago Illinois in 1893.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:43.090
So many people are familiar
with this but the thing that,

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.390
there's several things

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:47.720
that I thought were just
really interesting about this.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.760 position:56%
It was huge, I don't know of anybody
in here has studied this very much

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.710
but it was absolutely enormous,
they basically remade not only all

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:01.080
of the area close to the
shore, to Lake Michigan

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.740
but it was really suppose to create
this ideal city, this white city.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.630
And the white city was not only
the idea of urban development

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:17.080
that hadn't quite managed to create
its social constructs the way

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.470
that people would like it to be but
it's also the idea of electricity.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.670
Which we'll see in a few minutes
but one of other things you see,

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:29.400
especially with official guide to
the Midway Plaisance is this idea

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.090
of a highway through the nation, so
you don't just have this exposition

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:37.850 position:56%
of hey here's our cool new invention
and here's what we're doing today

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.630
and aren't we a great country.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:45.370 position:56%
But it was to share cultures
throughout the world and you can see

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.270
in the next graphic
you have Uncle Sam

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.210 position:56%
and Lady Liberty basically
welcoming everyone to the great city

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:57.700
of Chicago so that they could have
this kind of cultural exchange.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.840
There were 46 nations that
participated in the exposition,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.370
the cost was around 28
million, so it wasn't cheap.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.470
They were for the admissions, they
were about 21 million and change

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.690
and the admission was 50 cents,
children under 12 paid 25 cents

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:21.000
and those who were under
six were admitted for free.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.180
Prior to the opening there was
72,000 tons of exhibit materials

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.320
that were shipped to the grounds
and over 250,000 displays ranging

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:33.130
from milk sterilization
machines to works of art.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:37.950
And there were over 70,000
individual exhibitors.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.960
So it gives you a sense of the
magnitude and the grandeur.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.910
It wasn't all fantastic
from the cultural standpoint

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.830
if we take our cultural
awareness of today.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.690
And you can see this in the park
illustration here you have a very

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:59.840
tall Uncle Sam who was towering
over all of the other nations.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.580
Who've been characterized in a way

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.000
that isn't maybe nice
by today's standards.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.570
But it was, for its day the
idea was that we're trying

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:16.470
to you know be together
here and understand

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.250
where we are in the world, okay.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.070
So moving on the electricity
building

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.580 position:56%
which is again why I was really
getting you to this whole exposition

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:31.030
in the first place was it was
really amazing when I started to go

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.900
through the photographs and trying
to understand again what are some

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.830
of these seminal moments,
what are some of these themes

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.520
that are coming together.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.060
You can see that this
is not a small building.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.360
It's enormous, so the image on
the top was an artist rendering

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.360
from Harper's of what the
plan was suppose to be.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.570 position:56%
And then the image on the bottom was
an actual picture of what it looked

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.950
like once it had been built.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.580
And they're just from
slightly different angles,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.580
so that's one of the reasons
why they look so different but,

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.270
it was a grand and huge building.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:04.520
And then what was also interesting
was that the entire place was lit

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.540
up at night with electricity.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.090 position:56%
For those of you who are familiar
the library has acquired a major PPS

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:17.570
collection WGBH and they did
a really great series on sort

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:24.060
of the waring battle of
electricity with Edison and Tesla.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.060
And it was Westinghouse and Tesla
who lit the entire exposition,

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.210
it was really incredible.

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.080
But to give you an idea of the
competition and I laugh just

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.700
because branding was everywhere,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.470
I mean I don't know how they
understood marketing as well

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:42.920
as they did back then,
but they nailed it.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.500
You have, it's a little blurry
cause it's a lantern image,

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.630
but down in the front kind of
where you see the triangle you have

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:56.240
Westinghouse and Tesla and
polyphase system which was one

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.760
of the motors he was creating.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.870
Behind that you have Edison.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:08.110
And you see that it's so,
with GE and they have banners

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.970
and they have you know huge
signs and all the way at the back

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.140
of the building you have
the Westinghouse building

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.080
and so this was the 400th
anniversary of Columbus's discovery

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.920
of America, I mean it
was just everywhere.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.490
You know here we are, we're
Westinghouse and we're Tesla,

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.140
here we are we're GE
and we're Edison.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.380
It was just everywhere, so the
idea of these ideas being kept

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.780
between the two of these
gentlemen, battling it out

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.790
and their business supporters
really was not the case at all,

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.920
it was a global phenomenon that
a lot of people were aware of.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.780
And I just had to talk
on to the side there,

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.550
the little flag, it's
kind of sad almost.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:49.530
For Gray's telautograph.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:54.860
You know by now we have the
telegraph has been kind of global

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.960
at this point and they didn't stop
with the inventions at that point,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.080
it's not just looking
at the telegraph,

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.480
it's how do we make it better,
how do we make it print.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.780
Well one of the annoying things

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.850
about the telegraph is you
either have to be there

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:12.540
to listen it do dots and dashes
or to sit there and write it down.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.190
Gray's idea was to actually
have it do it for you,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.300
so again it's gets it
this idea of automation.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:23.240
Also at this time so we're looking
Tesla here again and I'm going

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.220
to read a little bit of this
newspaper article that's

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.660
from the Chronicling America site,
also supported here at the Library

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.350
of Congress program here.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.970
And I really think it's important
even though it came a little bit

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.260
later, it was in 1915.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.350
Because Tesla had some vision
that a lot of people just sort

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.210 position:56%
of thought he was a little crazy and
there were some good reasons why.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.440 position:56%
I mean he would stand there and let
electricity radiate through his body

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.410
and it would go all over the place,
it was really kind of a site.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:57.340
But he was arguably a genius
and ahead of his time in many,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.070
many topics and many thoughts.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.670
So, from this article.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.170
Published in the Leavenworth Echo,

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.850
this is Leavenworth
Washington by the way.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.870
It says wireless vision seen

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.930
by Tesla thinks world system
will allow many to talk

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.600
at once, end static disturbance.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.960
We're going to come
back to disturbance here

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.510
in a just a little while.

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.680
The inventor also hopes to
transmit pictures by same medium

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.250
which carries the voice,
declares it will be possible

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.230
to hold secret conversation too.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.500
In perfecting the devices
there are two kinds.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.150
First, those serving to
control transmissions.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.560
Second those magnifying
the received impulses,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.080
so this should start
to sound familiar.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.740
It is claimed that static
disturbances will fatally interfere

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.480 position:56%
with the transmission, meaning that
it won't happen, it'll just cut off.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.060
While as a matter of fact there's
no static disturbance possible

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.940
in properly designed transmission
and receiving circuits.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.200
Another contingent is that
there can be no secrecy

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.680
in wireless telephone
conversation, I say that's absurd

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.700
and this is quoting Tesla here.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.410
It is absurd to raise
this contingent

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.960
when it is positively
demonstrated by experiments

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.300
that the Earth is more
suitable for transmission

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.380
than any wire could ever
be, so he's referring

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.730
to the electromagnetic
qualities of the Earth.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:19.140
A wireless telephone conversation
may be made a secret as a thought,

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.900
by the same means I've proposed
also to transmit pictures

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.220
and project images so that the
subscriber will not only hear the

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.430
voice but see the person
to whom he is talking.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:35.180 position:56%
Pictures transmitted over wires is a
perfectly simple art practice today,

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.270
many inventors have labored on it.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:39.780
But the chief credit is due
to Professor Korn of Munich.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:45.070
So again we have this
intercultural exchange.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.260
Around this same time
you have a Yale alumnus

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.470
and Bell labs physicists Harry
Nyquist beginning to work

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.650
on a method for transmitting
pictures by wire.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:58.370
Telephotography as early as 1918,
so this is only three years later.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:03.140
And the company had a
working prototype by 1924.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.400
So now we're getting into the,
into the heart of the matter,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.860
information theory, I forgot my
little friends so sorry about that.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.420
And really what this is, is we're
moving from the idea of digits,

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.220
how early cultures would
count on your fingers

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.850
and hands while we have a bait you
know, counting base ten as opposed

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:30.130
to base two it's just easier,
I mean if we use, we are crabs

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.250
or something, I live in Maryland.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.140
We know about crabs.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.280
Then there would be, two
would be easier but it's not,

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.130
we have five fingers on
each hand and you know kind

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:41.430
of seems to work pretty well.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:46.900
But the idea of getting into
what we really considered digital

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.870
of today really starts to shape,
take shape in this period,

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.050
so it's just at the very
beginning of the 20th century.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.650
But again keeping in mind
there was a lot of sea laying,

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:59.470
a lot of ground work that had been
laid leading up to this point.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.430
So, I'm not going to go,

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.470
all of these things could
be their own research topic

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.800 position:56%
and I just can't go into all of them
today but, I want you to have sort

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.730
of a mental picture, imagine
you're walking around places

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.900
like Princeton, at their
advanced institute.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.790
And then not to long after
you're walking around Bell Labs

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:22.050
and you see the following
people in the hallway.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.900
People who were the founding
faculty, you know you see Einstein,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.390
you see Shannon, you see Turing.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.800
I mean all of these names
that you come to mind,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.380
you know Nyquist just incredible
people who were contributing to all

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:48.830
of these thoughts and
ideas over time.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:54.970
When Shannon was at Bell, you
know it's not like in today,

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.260
where if you're research
candidate somewhere,

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.160
unless you're established
you're not getting published.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:07.080
And Nyquist was in the same boat
as was Ralph Hartley and one

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.710
of the really cool things that
Bell Labs did is they had their

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.010
own journal.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.160
Where there own staff
could publish in it.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.940
It was called the Bell Systems
Technical Journal and it was there

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.870
that Claude Shannon learned
of Harry Nyquist work

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.520
to understanding the amount of data
and speed transmitted by telegraph.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.560 position:56%
So again we're having people of 20th
century going back to the telegraph,

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.310
going back to Bull and
understanding logic aides.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.480
Going back to Babbage
and understanding all

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.840
of the calculations there.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.770
He converted the continuous waves
into data, that was discreet.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:43.870
It was digital, so a discreet
system, you have to contain it

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.690
to understand how it's going
to move through electricity.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:50.790
Nyquist had devised a formula
for the speed transmission

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.830 position:56%
of intelligence and a circuits
carried varying waves of frequencies

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:57.790
and their engineers, they
were referring to it as bands.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.220
The range of frequency was
understood as bandwidth.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.250
And would turn that measure in,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.730
basically create a measure
for circuit capacity.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.970
So, to transmit intelligence
at a certain speed,

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.230
a measurable channel was needed.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:19.470 position:56%
So again we're in the same period as
around 1927 and there's the sentinel

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.890
of volt is death and Ralph
Hartley who was known

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:29.010
for his engineering work with
radio and he was also at Bell,

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.260
wrote that information
is a very elastic term

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:36.620 position:56%
and what was needed was a measure in
terms of purely physical quantities.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.460
He wrote the equation as h
equals n log s or h is the amount

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.010
of information, n is the
number of symbols transmitted

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:47.230
and s is the size of the alphabet.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:52.640 position:56%
In 1945 Shannon wrote a report, a
mathematical theory of cryptography,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.240
which was classified practical
immediately thereafter and is part

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.240
of the collection we
have here at the library

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.630
in the manuscript division.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:06.090
But in that he makes several what
I think are astounding points,

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:10.130
that a secrecy system is almost
identical to a noisy system.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.360
That information theory which
is a new phrase hadn't been used

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.230
until now.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.410
And that term was needed in order

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.420
to get beyond the elastic
use of information.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:27.800 position:56%
And to define it physically and
that information is basically binary

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.160
digits or bits.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.750
It's closely associated with
uncertainty which can be measured

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.410
by counting the possibility
of messages.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:38.630
So again we get back into
like things packet switching

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.910
and understanding how to
measure a circuit and bandwidth

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:44.010
and all of those goodies.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.900
It implies this surprise in
the sense of probabilities

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.010
so how do you work
all of that unknown,

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.730
you start looking at probabilities.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:57.650 position:56%
What is significant is and this is
again a quote from Shannon, is that,

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.220
the difficulty in transmitting
the messages from one point

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.760
to the other it's not
so much the message,

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.670
while the message eventually
becomes important in a lot of ways,

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.670
it's really how do you get
it there, how do you get

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.740
from one point to the other?

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.430
And this leads us to the idea of
entropy, which was his fourth point

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.280
that a measure, it's basically
information is a measure

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.480
of disorder, particularly with
heat and energy and thermodynamics,

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.370
so this then looks
forward to Wheeler

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.570
and this is why their ideas work
together, is how do you handle

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.830
that disorder, that
disruption, that noise,

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.080
that complexity, that entropy?

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:40.570
So, without going into a
ton of things about Shannon,

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.940
one of the things, Shannon was
kind of left alone at Bell to kind

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.420
of do research and development
in a lot of different ways,

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.360
occasionally the CIA would come
over and say, we need you to work

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.660
on this, your work is classified,

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.710
don't talk to anybody
including Turing.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:54.970
But you know, you do good things.

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.960
But one of the things that I
felt was really funny when I came

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.000
across this in the manuscript
division in the Shannon papers

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.810
and I don't know if you can
really see it very well,

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.620
but right where the yellow
is pointing, this is a patent

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.360
for Warren Shannon, that was
patented and they were trying

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.850
to figure out how do you work
out all of this, this switching

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.510
with the circuits in the
logic aides and everything.

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:23.670
So in between you have closed and
open, so a circuit is either open

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.410
or closed, there is no in between.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:29.330
So right in between is don't care.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.210
He really didn't, he really didn't
care it had to be either opened

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.890
or closed, zero one
that's what it was.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.560
So, I want you to think
back now just a little bit

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:47.040
to when we were looking
at Morse and Morse Code.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.490
And if you look really hard it
needs to be a little bit bigger,

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.550
you can see that here
Shannon was really starting

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:58.150 position:56%
to understand modulation, how do
you start to control that wavelength

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.800
which is the very top figure.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.530
How do you break it down and then
how do you handle the slow down?

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.570
And what do you with
entropy, so what do you do

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:11.340
with that dissipation
of heat and energy?

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:15.460 position:56%
You basically have it kick back
into the message which is what make,

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.810
part of what makes
packet switching work.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:21.430
And so it was interesting to
see some of these things here.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:27.490 position:56%
I just threw this in mostly because,

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:31.290
well one we have the Lorenz papers
here at the library and I was dying

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:33.570
to get more into these
but time didn't permit.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:36.630
But one of the things that Lorenz
is really well known for other

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.800
than being a meteorologist
is, chaos theory.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.090
And information theory made chaos
theory possible, for those of you

00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.460
who aren't really familiar with
chaos theory, Lorenz was known

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.870
for this idea of the
butterfly affect,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:55.500
it basically there would be
one thing that would happen

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.800
and it would be really small

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.020
and it could have great
impact on a larger scale.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.430
So if you think about a
butterfly flapping its wings,

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:07.110
could it cause a major storm
somewhere halfway around the world.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:10.850
And at first that seemed
absolutely ridiculous.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:14.150
But as he kept doing his work
as a meteorologist and trying

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.440
to understand climate and
patterns in climate he kept coming

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.380 position:56%
into these things that reaped of
the uncertainty principle and trying

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.970
to understand patterns,

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.400
it just started coming
up with these patterns.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.860
And that's really what ended
up happening with chaos theory,

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.890
is that you started to understand
patterns within something

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:38.870
that looked absolutely chaotic.

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.460
So, again kind of in this
same time period and now we're

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.520
in the 21st century obviously.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.480
Again I just feel obligated to make
a mention of here of Mandelbrot.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.620
Who is well known for
his fractal geometry

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:56.140
but also was an icon at IBM.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.830
I'm going to explain this just
really in a brief way which is not

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.770
at all going to do it justice
but basically the idea is

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:08.340
that if you look at this graphic
here which is, paying homage to IBM

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.870
with the stripes, many
of us remember

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.040
that graphic from years ago.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.740
In the middle you see fractals.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.970
And you see this in biology
and botany and chemistry

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.170
and all different types
of things but,

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:24.840
the Mandelbrot set is visualized
in that thing that almost looks

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.940
like a heart but a really
fat heart turned on its side.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.390
But what's really interesting
about that is, you can take this

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:36.650
which is a discreet finite set,
that whole image right there

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:40.050
and have infinite versions
of that all around the edges,

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:43.470
all the way to the middle
and it will never touch.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:48.590
So you have basically
infinity within a finite set,

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:52.040
it's really incredible how
this would work but in order

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.940
to really understand that
and to make that known

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.840
and to make it understood, how
do you process all that data,

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:03.350
which in a way kind of fast
forwards to big data of today.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:08.040
You needed to understand this type
of mathematics and it was done

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:12.960
in a place where computers thrived.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.180
And we'll get back to
him in just a minute.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.960
So if your brain is
starting to glaze

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.570
over because we've been talking
about a lot math and we talked

00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:24.900
about circuits and
electricity and all this stuff

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.890
and I don't know what they'll say,

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.080
we'll look at something that's
kind of different from that.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:36.940
So, Vasarely really was basically
the father of op art, optical art.

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:44.420
And the image you have that
is gray and white, we'll say.

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:49.170
Is here in the libraries
collections and this book is also

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:51.850
in the libraries collections,
actually a French poet

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:56.480
and he wrote an entire book on,
an entire book of poetry on code

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.320
and he choose Vasarely to
do the cover art for it

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.110
because you can see how
the mathematics lent itself

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.380
to a codification of art.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.490
So again it's starting to
cross over to into disciplines,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:14.970
it's starting to really
resonate in popular culture.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.240
And I couldn't do this without
just talking a little bit

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.100
about the R Eames collection.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:26.560
The image at the bottom is Ray
Eames, she's part of a design pair

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.200
of Charles and Ray Eames,
Charles was her husband.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.630
The library did a really
wonderful exhibit,

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.140
I think predated my tenure here.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.090
On them but we are
essentially they're archived

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:45.270
and while I can't prove correlation
here I think there is compelling

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:50.770
visual interest , between the
image you see up at the top there,

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.630
that has sort of the golden
background that's basically a

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:56.460
circuit board and it
was in the Eames's,

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.630
what they called the curiosity
cabinet, they would take pictures

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.570 position:56%
and they were slides and just things
that would be inspiring to them,

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.800
things that they found interesting.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.190
And then the larger image you
see is Ray's abstract drawing

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:16.580
for dot pattern and it is one
of her most famous works of art

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:23.490
and you see the fabric design
of it down at the bottom.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.160
The Eames's were also known for
their, for a lot different things

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.930
and again we couldn't really
cover all of that today

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:33.370
but they were instrumental in
the IBM's world fair pavilion

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:36.820
in New York in 1964,
they designed it.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.410
And so you see that there is
again this sort of crossover

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:43.310 position:56%
of understanding of computer is art.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:49.200 position:56%
They also did a historical computer,
history of computers and computing

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.830
and really calculating machines
in IBM's headquarters as well.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:56.630
And then they did some
fantastic exhibits

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:59.290
on mathematica throughout
the country

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.480
and I think their most
famous one was in California.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:07.840
And then just one last
point about the Eames's

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.070
and I cut off their last name with
that big image, sorry about that.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:17.810
Is just the understanding of
scale and again the idea of this.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:23.070
In the Shannon papers, Shannon
takes out a pencil and paper,

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:28.790
starts to sketch out the idea
of measures of information

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.670 position:56%
and so it forms this pyramid, right.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:35.380
And so he starts form tens of
bits to then goes to trillions,

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.710
at the top of the pyramid was
his estimate for the Library

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:43.500
of Congress, it was ten to
the 14 or 100 trillion bits.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.950
Whether or not that's correct
today I don't know I didn't want

00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:49.870
to go there but, I thought it
was interesting that he thought

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:54.380 position:56%
about it, that was largest container
storehouse he could think of.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.880
If you compare that with the
Eames's work they were doing film,

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.290
they were doing all sorts of
things, photography, original art

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:12.510
and this is their poster
that has all of the stills

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.830
of what was called powers of ten
and dealing with the relative size

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.450
of things in the universe.

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:21.070
And the affect of adding in
another zero, powers of ten.

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.410
It was then put into motion
picture and it was used

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:27.810
for educational purposes, in
this country and elsewhere.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:33.830
Okay home stretch, so just to
fast forward a little bit more,

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:39.560
we really can't omit the University
of Utah here and the Library

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:43.860
of Congress periodically announces
the National Film Registry

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:49.210 position:56%
and I was excited, in fact
ecstatic when they announced the one

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.690
for a computer animated hand.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:58.780
The image you see there
of the hand is a very,

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.460
it really is a short short,

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:04.840
but it was the first three
dimensional computer animated

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:08.400
graphic ever created and
what's particularly interesting

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.120
about this is that the people
who did it, Edwin Catmull

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:16.500
and Jeff Parke went
on to co-found Pixar.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.570
Anybody know what Pixar is?

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:21.020
Yeah I see some people nodding.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:27.350
So, you know they were backed by
George Lucas and Lucas Film and ILM

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:32.990 position:56%
and then they eventually partnered
with Steve Jobs again to form Pixar.

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:35.010
And then around the same time,

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:39.450
only three years later you
had Martin Newell do the math

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:43.150
essentially for what's
called the Utah teapot,

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:47.040
which almost anybody doing graphic
design has to learn how to do.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.750
It is painful and yet
educational all the same time.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:57.030
So why I have the next two
movies on this slide is,

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:02.610
twofold again the Toy
Story is a nod to Catmull

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:09.460
because Pixar's very first full
length feature completely CGI,

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.450
completely computer generated
imagery was Toy Story and that was

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:17.780
in 1995, so it was you
know almost 20 years later.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:22.660
But, more recently after
that short was Futureworld

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.890
and that was a series and I watched

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:27.490
over in the [inaudible]
reading room.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:29.760
You know it's kind of like a
cult flick I would just say,

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.300
kind of have to be die hard to
sit through the whole thing,

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.260
really wasn't that
bad, it was Peter Fonda

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.050
and Blythe Danner and Yul Brynner.

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:39.330
Yul Byrnner had no speaking
parts in it whatsoever.

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:43.050
But this short film of the
computer animated hand,

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:48.990
was featured in that
full length feature film.

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:52.370 position:56%
And it was kind of creepy and eerie
and kind of got into this whole idea

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.130
of robotics taking over
the world and I'm proud

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.900
to say the people eventually
saved the day

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.960
but you know you're
really seeing the advances,

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.990
even though they're slow, they're
also fast at the same time,

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:07.930
it's kind of it's own binary
opposition if you will.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:12.460
Okay. So, where do this leave us?

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.810
Oh actually let me just make one
more mention of something here.

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:20.530 position:56%
I would be remiss if I didn't
mention one other thing about Pixar.

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.940
So, you saw what Catmull
did with Parke in creating

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.260
that computer animated hand.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.830 position:56%
And he saw what they did with Pixar,

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:33.360
what we didn't show here was their
work in creating a new software

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.620
for computers that is, I
wasn't going to use the word,

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.830
but I basically have to at
this point, it's ubiquitous.

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.600
Most of the major films that
you see that have CGI involved

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.320
in them now, are utilizing
RenderMan.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:53.090
RenderMan was created by Pixar and
all of those really great graphics

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.750
that looks so real, anybody
you know watch the Hobbit

01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:00.460
and Gollum you know precious.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.960
When you look at the mountains

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.540
and how realistic they
are, anybody Star Wars fan?

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.430
You know saw the graphics in that?

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.110
All of those graphics that looks

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:17.030
so detailed were using the fractal
geometry that Mandelbrot used.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:22.800 position:56%
So it comes full circle, you know it
really, what was originally created

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.940
as math and physics inspired art,

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:30.910
the art then inspired the
computer engineering essentially,

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:33.320
software engineering.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.350
So where does this leave us?

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:41.410
I think that's up to you to decide
in many ways, from It from Bit

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:45.320
but I'm going to leave with
this note and sort of nod

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.780
and I don't know if our esteemed
chair Nathaniel Comfort [assumed

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.300
spelling] is here but not

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.000 position:56%
to long ago we had a really
interesting presentation about the r

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.460
and a world and it was there some
of the, you know seminal people

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:06.490
who understood r and a mentioned
that DNA wasn't very interesting.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.490
They might find that
this was interesting,

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.640
Francis Crick who left
physics for biology

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.810 position:56%
and James Watson were the people
essentially discovered DNA and wrote

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:23.270
to Schroder and Gamow and
Hofstetter and others.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.540
Making the connection that genetic
code was the information system

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.810
from which all continuity
of life stems.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:32.560
So I thank you very much.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.510
You have any questions,
I'd be happy to take them.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:41.050
[ Applause ]

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:44.020 position:56%
The question is about whether or not
the universe is essentially analog

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:49.470
or digital and what about fuzzy
logic and how it fits in there?

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:53.070
Fuzzy logic is weird, it's what
I can tell you about fuzzy logic.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:57.430
I think you can do a lot of
different things with fuzzy logic

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:04.090
that would allow you to argue
both sides of this theory.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:11.040
Whether it's analog or digital, I
don't think it's, if I answer this

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.420
from a Wheeler perspective, what I
think he might say is it's neither.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.510
Because it's been most
granular for lack

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:23.210 position:56%
of a better word, part of existence.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:30.880
It is the very essence of the
whole and the part, so it can't be

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.670
because it's binary, because it's
two halves of a whole essentially.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:43.170
It can't be analog and it can't
just be digital, it's It from Bit.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:47.890
So the question was about you know
basically how information was being

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:51.910 position:56%
shared at different parts throughout
their research project and if I look

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.730
at it back it's sort of the earlier
points where we had the I Ching

01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:03.000
and we had you know the Mangarevan
Islands and those type of things.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.330
You know, part of it is how
people move around the Earth,

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:13.320
right so you have people who
immigrated to a place and they had

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.790
to come up with a scheme, the
Mangarevans came up with their own

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.370
and it was kind of unique.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:21.800
Even among French Polynesian
Islands.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.030
And this predated colonialism,

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.680
but then when you had colonialism
coming, you had often times

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.010
in the cases that I was using,

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:34.040
priests that were sent
out to convert people.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.090
But also were informed
of ideas of the cultures

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.980
in which they were living.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:44.240
And so we saw that with
Bouvet, with Leibniz.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.870
Then you know I think things change

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:54.210
because the world became more
globally aware and so I think one

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.730
of the things that we
saw with the telegraph is

01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:00.800
that you had not just
your local town crier

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.490
and you didn't have
somebody on a horse back

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.630
and you didn't have lanterns,
one if by land, two if by sea.

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:07.860
You had something that
was much more immediate

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:12.750
and the definitely
became transcontinental.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.630
And leading up to that and after

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:22.720
that you had these really fantastic
planned events, these world fairs

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.210
that really drew hoards of people.

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:29.620
And were fantastic
in their inspiration

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.490 position:56%
of innovation and cultural exchange.

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:37.070
When you get into the
electronic time period,

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:39.560 position:56%
you know moving a little bit forward
and where computers really start

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.580
to be connected, where
you have [inaudible]

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.880
and you actually have an internet.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.480
It becomes a much different animal

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.880
about how information
is communicated

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.980
because it's much more immediate.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.050
We all see it, we're all checking
our phones you know every five

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.740
seconds to see what little
ping was on our phone.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.810
You have the advent of motion
pictures and that kind of thing,

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:04.150
so it's a very different type
of communication of information.

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.030
Thank you for your question.

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:10.060 position:56%
So the question is, basically wonder
whether or not if there were sort

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.420
of dissenters about
this idea of binary

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.310
and whether it is impoverished in.

01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:16.880
It really just didn't seem
like a good idea at all,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.440 position:56%
maybe a way characterize a skeptics.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.430
Yeah I think you always have them,
you know you always have people

01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:26.270
who say, this is not at
all the way we want to go

01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:29.870
and frankly you saw the
writing Tesla was arguing

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:32.990
that in the newspaper
article saying, this is crazy,

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.160
people saying that this is
not possible, it's possible,

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.350
we've demonstrated it, we're
you know building examples of it

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:42.660
and three years later there was
another person working on it

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.680
and few years after that
there was a working prototype.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.740
So, you know the proof was
in the pudding so to speak,

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.580
people were able to
create their inventions,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.200
they were inspired by
some of these ideas.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.830
And they were able to demonstrate
that they worked and they were able

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:04.110 position:56%
to overcome the challenges of things
like entropy, complexity, noise,

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:09.670
you know the whole dynamical
system kind of concepts so.

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.950
Yeah I think you always
have those dissenters

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:16.110
but if you can prove it,
then more power to you.

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:19.230
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: I think
with that I'll stop there,

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.510
so please join me again
in thanking Jennifer.

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:26.620
[ Applause ]

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.280
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
