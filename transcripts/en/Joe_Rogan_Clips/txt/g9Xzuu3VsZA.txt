Speaker 1:          00:00          It's so, you know, you know, you do Jujitsu, it's fun. So everybody wants to just slap hands, punching knuckles and start rolling. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun. It's like a fun game you're doing. It's a good release. Yeah. But the best way to get better at it is to constantly drill. And then you develop these pathways that are just ingrained in your subconscious. And so when you're in that half guard position, you immediately go for that under hook immediately. You know the path, you know where to go instead of ad libbing and thinking while you're in the middle of a role. And when you see guys that come from camps where they don't drill, they only do like one technique at the beginning of the class, you'll notice a technical deficiency as opposed to like someone who comes from Hixson school or someone who comes from a school that's very technical or you know, the Mendez brothers or something.

Speaker 1:          00:45          You know, it's just, it's so important to look at this, look at the sport, whether it's MMA or kickboxing or Jujitsu, whatever it is, but to look at it like a, like a puzzle, like you're trying to figure out what's the best way to solve this and you know what Duane is done for you. It's been pretty remarkable as far as like giving you footwork skills and tools to move around and angles and I, you know, I've watched you guys dry drill and train together. I mean it's really amazing stuff. Yeah. Stuff that we think is simple and then we'd go and teach it to the gym and they're like, wait, what? Can you guys do that like 10 more times? When you see that again, it's like, oh right. All right. So we've just been doing like the full work I've created with Dwayne the, he wasn't a full word guy when he fought.

Speaker 1:          01:29          He was trained that crunchies are natives and then like he's the one that's creating all these angles with me and now we've created a whole new style. It's so funny that he saw that kind of while he was fighting and then after he was fighting, he's implementing and on new fighters and didn't do it himself. And he laughs about it. Yeah. He, he wishes he probably would have had someone like himself. Coach him obviously walked in for sure. Yeah, everybody does. Yeah. He's a fucking wizard man. Yes. Cause he didn't stop thinking about it either to, he's like the same Kalvia for strike. I'ms I'm telling you like I have all the best coaches in the world around me. Like he's like same Kalvia of striking and MMA. Um, and I'm trying to convince him to come to southern California and started professional fight team so that we can help recreate what we do for everyone because trying to get them to move out here, but he loves Colorado.

Speaker 1:          02:14          He does. But he also loves being the best coach in the world. Any anyhow, so I'm hoping that I can convince him enough that he, he'll do that. You know, closely think you are to convince them. I think I'm close. [inaudible] I know you're, listen brother, I know you want to come to California. I've never seen anybody with this detailed, um, uh, an instruction manual, like the way he breaks down his system, no matter for striking. I mean, it's really remarkable. Even when he comes into here to talk to you, he'll have a system that you need to tell him what he wants to talk about, what he wants to do. Like the guy doesn't stop thinking he is, he's on top of his stuff. He's OCD in a good way. Yeah. And the best way, the best way. Absolutely. Well, it's like you were saying about being competitive.

Speaker 1:          02:53          I mean, I think it's you, the idea that you're going to be this balance chilled out person and still be a fucking world. Smasher good luck with that. I'm the farthest thing from relaxed and chill, you know, I tried to learn it now, but yeah, but when you're training and when you look you, there's a mindset that's required to beat the best guys and it's not the same mindset that's required to get good to get, you could get good and be a chilled out, relaxed person. Like say you want to be a black belt in Jujitsu, that's totally possible. You can be really good people and go, Hey, look at Mike Mann. Mike has got a great triangle. Watch them roll. Wow, he's really good. But if Mike wants to be the motherfucker have motherfuckers, you better be crazy. You know, you better be God damn crazy. You better be like Mike Tyson when he was young and be those Michael Jordan's yet talking about, they're always thinking about it. [inaudible] Jones Jr yes. All of those guys. You've got to be a fucking crazy person. Absolutely. Everyone's Roy Jones Jr played a professional basketball game the day of his fight. Played a guy named basketball games do and he's just an athlete. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I just don't think there's any other way, you know? I mean, I think if you're going to win a race, you're going to red line the engine.
