Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So when, when you first start rapping, like, uh, you wrap them with kids in your neighborhood or you like aspiring to be a rapper and, right and shut down and try and things on your friends, like how do you get started? Well, the way that I started, I was writing, you know, like poetry first. Really? Yeah. But what kind of poetry? Just like, you know, like hoods, stuff, you know, just stuff that rhymed, but like, just sort of writing it down. Like it was a, it was almost like writing raps, but it just, you know, it's without saying it right is you read it and shit like that, whatever. But I would just write poetry about, you know, everyday shit. You know what I mean? Nothing, you know, it wasn't like doing like the, I dunno if there's like categories of poetry, but it, you know, it was just stuff that, that would happen from day to day, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And uh, I had a knack for writing. I realize that now is wanting to be a journalist. That's, you know what really the thing that I thought I was going to be at school. Right. Do you right now, uh, I was for a while, but I, I looked at kind of stuff just again, everyday stuff or you know, I'd like randomly pick something to write about. So if it was Ken about the cannabis industry, I'd write something about that. If it was about the music industry, I'd write something about that. Like I, that every now and then I would, uh, there was, uh, back in the early two thousands, there was a magazine called industry insider magazine. And occasionally I would write articles for that. I wasn't really that great because, you know, I was so spotty in school that, you know, my, you know, it needed work, you know, but they left it raw the way that, that I would put it out there and people got my point and that, that was cool.

Speaker 1:          01:49          But I looked at it, uh, in the way that the, the music that I've done in a lot of the songs serve as a certain form of journalists, journalism for me, you know, like, you know, bringing up certain issues that people don't necessarily hear. Like throw your set in the air as a song on temple's boom. And it's a song about how you would get, you know, in inducted into again, how you get put into a gang, how you fall into it. And some people might think, you know, by hearing it that it was glorifying it and praising it, but it wasn't, it was basically this is how it is. This is so, you know, the signs to look for if your kids are, you know, fucking around with the wrong people, you know? And that's, you know, I took it like, okay, you know, maybe I'm not a journalist like I intended to be, but this is my way of it.

Speaker 1:          02:41          You know, I can enlighten people with certain things and uh, you know, like anything, somebody's going to read something or hear something and maybe misinterpret what you say. But you know, it's all about who's who's listening and who's reading and who's watching and stuff like that and their interpretation of it. And some get it, some don't. And that's just the nature of it. But like most people get it. And I've, I've come across people that have come to me and come and said, hey man, your your, your songs on temple of boom men. You know, they, they help to get me through these times or these songs raised me, they taught me this, this and that. That's awesome. And to me, you know, that, that's, that's the impact right there. That's the shit that means more than anything. Because I'm sure you remember songs that got you through, right?

Speaker 1:          03:28          Oh yeah, for sure. You know, there was songs from Krs one public enemy that, you know, got me through and fired me up, you know, and inspired and stuff like that. Era's ones. Another one people forget about, man, I'll be in my car. Just gone. Ooh, that's nice. Yeah. I mean he, he taught, he taught me how to be a bull horn, you know what I mean? Like tell you know, like yeah, tell the truth, you know, yours get the word out and, and, and not be fearful of what might happen because he could have been one of the biggest stars in, in hip hop. He chose not to be, he chose to be a voice. And sometimes in being that voice, you know, you get objects put in front of you and uh, certain opportunities don't, you know, get put on your table because he says some great shit, man.

Speaker 1:          04:16          He's talking about getting mad at the president. It's like being mad at the manager at McDonald's. Yeah. You know, for the way the corporations being run. Yeah. It's, it's, he, he is a very insightful in, in the shit that he says and he is very unafraid to state it in state. His opinion, if for you to get like people coming up to you when they first started coming up to you, telling you that your music got them through things, that it means so much to them when that first started happening, that must've been surreal, you know? Yeah, it could because as a artist, as especially as a young artist you, that's not something you think about. All of these songs are going to, well it depends on, on the artist you are right guys hit. How old were you? Like 23 or something like that.

Speaker 1:          04:59          And how old were you when that was like a, we released in 91 and it really started going for us in [inaudible] 90 2022 kid. He had so crazy there goes the baby fro. Wow. Wow. Look at the baby fro. Yeah, but I mean think about that man. That is so crazy for you to go from the guy who yo MTV raps. Who remembers that? I did a bungee jump at this spring break with a trench from naughty by nature. Was that the one that was in Cancun? None of that was Daytona beach right there. Okay. When MTV was still, when MTV was still allowed over there, it was back when MTV had music. Yeah. When they had music format empty was MTV was music videos. Yeah. Good luck finding a fucking music video now. They still got to go to youtube. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Wow. That's wild.

Speaker 1:          05:54          What was it like when it first started popping off and you were 22 years old? Was it, did it feel real? It was a, it was a crazy thing because it's not something that I had ever envisioned happening. You know, I didn't think that, you know, the music would blow up like that, you know, we were doing it to obviously try and make a name for ourselves and, and uh, make music that people like, but fuck, we didn't see that coming at all, especially with insane in the brain when they told me, uh, when like when killer man started going, it was like surreal because, you know, we didn't think that song would take, just because you know, of, of the chorus itself, you know, fuck what the song is about. You know, we knew that the chorus was, you know what, they were going to hear more than anything.

Speaker 1:          06:41          And so I, you know, we, we thought, Nah, we're going to have a good underground album. We didn't realize it would blow up. We didn't think they were going to put killer man in the juice movie and that would blow that song up even more so than it was it was getting, um, because we had released funky feelings ones first and it was a double Aa side, single funky filling and kill a man on the other side, which means, um, at that time that Dj's had the option of which song they wanted to go. Whereas most of the time you had a side B side and the a side is most definitely the one that the record company wants you to push. We gave it a Aa side because we thought maybe the djs would like kill a man more. They went with funky fill when the record company because they figured it would be easier to market.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Right. And then the DJ started flipping the record course and we started getting traction behind that. Our record was out, like six months had dropped off the chart and they flip the record. Our shit slowly starts to go back up the chart. We got back on the chart and started climbing and we were getting a whole lot of mixed show play. And uh, then we started doing a lot of promotional shows that being one of them. And it started going and kill a man. Started getting us going. And uh, I mean we toured for probably a year and a half, like a lot of just a lot of promotional shows, you know, not getting paid, you know, just, you know, Sony having us out there promoting the record and by the time, uh, you know, our record got back back up into the middle of the charts. I mean, it was still rising and they saw that.

Speaker 1:          08:18          They're like, we got to get them off the road and making a new record. So that's when we got up there with black Sunday and a with black Sunday and insane coming out again. That's not a song I thought would blow up when they've chose that for the single. I'm like, well, all right, there's better songs but fuck it. That's the one. Okay. So it comes out, boom, it explodes. And now we have our black Sunday charting it, number one coming in. And our, our first album had come all the way from the bottom to hit number five. So we had to two albums in the top 10 to hunt or top 10 of the 200 songs, you know, on the chart, which no one had ever done in hip hop before. We had one in five slot. And uh, you know, fuck, we definitely didn't think that was going to happen.

Speaker 1:          09:09          I mean, you know, it was all a surprise and it went from one minute you could go to a mall and be, you know, an assuming and nobody even knows who the fuck you are and you know, you're getting about your day to now you go to the mall and the whole fucking mall is swarming on you. Like fucking, you're like, you know, Paul Mccartney or something. It was the craziest shit. They, they would ask us to leave the mall's like, really? Yeah. Like, uh, we used to, I used to go to this one called the Montebello Mo. It was in Montebello. I can't remember what the name of the mall was, but it was in Montebello, the only one down there at the time. And we knew everybody there, you know, as we're coming up because that's where we'd go shop. So, you know, you make friends and people in the shop and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          09:54          And uh, when we come back off the tour this time and go try to go to that mall, you know, one of our friends fucked up in war Cypress Hill jacket. Oh, and that's like a fucking billboard when you're standing next to one of us. Right. So before you know it, boom, we get swooped in and you know, as a pre cell phone too. Yeah. In the mall security. Cause I, Hey man, you know, I know it's fucked up. You guys got to go really? Like, yeah man, it's a commotion. You guys gotta go, they're telling me, I'm like, they think someone's going to fight. I'm like, wow. All right. I never went back to that mall after that. I was like, all right, cool. Because you know what, I didn't want to cause them problems too. It was now it was tough to go somewhere at that time and not get, you know, swarmed and get swarmed.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Yeah. It was, it was, uh, it was quite, quite, uh, an experienced man like, you know, cause you only ever hear about it until it happens and you might, you know, if you have friends in the industry and it's happening for them, you might see it in directly, you know, like through the, through their shit. And uh, you know, we had friends in the business, you know, for cred. Kid for us was one of my friends, um, before we got out there and cause he's still around. Yeah. Yeah. He still does stuff, you know. Um, I don't know if he's putting out so much new music these days, but he's still here and there. He's doing some of the cannabis industry stuff too, because he is a big kind of sore. I've got to tell you, my man smokes used to smoke like a train man, like him.

Speaker 1:          11:29          And I would trade joints off left and right, but you know, for a time, you know, I would go hang with him and his gigs, I'd be his bodyguard cause I was the one that was not afraid to carry the hammer, meaning the magnum in my waistline. You know, I was, we were cowboys, man. We, we were always armed at that time, from 89 to probably 97 or 98, we were holding pistols on our hip, like cowboys. And you know, he knew that. So yes. But he would ask me to go to the gigs, you know, t, you know, double as his body guard. I was in his body guard, but I was his bodyguard. Do you know what I mean? Right, right. And, um, I'd see the way he handled it and let's see the way, you know, people crowded around him and, and uh, you know, so I learned how to deal with it.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Watching, you know, how he would do it in a negative way or a positive way. Cause you know, use some times, embrace the crowds. Sometimes it's like fuck off of me. You know, like a lot a lot of artists are, you know, and uh, that sort of prepared me so that when, you know, we got an RF lane, you know, I knew how to sort of deal with it and I, you know, was always courteous and, and cool and respectful and never the guy that is like, Nah man, fuck that. Get out of here. Cause I see it in some of my homies were like that, you know, and I didn't, I hated the feeling that when the fans would walk away, just totally fucking wind out of their sails and shit like that. Now they don't like this artist ever again. You know? And I saw that and I never wanted to have anyone walk away with that experience. So I always embraced it, even when it was a pain in the ass, you know? So.
