[BACKGROUND VOICES]

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.390
RICK GOINGS &gt;&gt; Hi, Rick Goings, I'm Chairman
and CEO of Tupperware brands and part of the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.380
Diversity Group here in-in Davos.
We just had a terrific meeting. I want to

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.420
comment on the President of the Philippines'
ah-glorious, wonderful message about diversity.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.920
And we've learned in our company that-ah-diversity
and this whole thiing about gender parity

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.880
isn't just something that's altruistic and
nice to do. It's a source of competitive advantage.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.250
So we've spent the last year kind of educating
as many people as we can across the world

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.370
on the differences between men and women-how
to leverage that very strong difference and

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.210
the challenge that-ah-each brings to the party.
Anyway, ah-we think we'll make more progress

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.980
this next year. Take care. Bye.
