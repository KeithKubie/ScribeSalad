00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.223
 I would like to stop the video 

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:06.286
 and think about how much it does 64 minus 31. 

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:09.456
 Now let's think about it together. 

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:13.650
 So what exactly does 64 mean? 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.188
 We can think of 64 from the point of view of the numbers. 

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.280
 The figure 6 is in the order of the decimal, 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.828
 and the figure 4 is in the order of the units. 

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:25.826
 Hence, 6 here means six tenths. 

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.927
 These are 6 groups of 10. 

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.596
 We can illustrate it here. 

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:35.393
 6 tens, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:36.997
 groups of 10. 

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:38.260
 In other words, 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.650
 6 tens, here are those 60 squares here, 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.125
 in groups of 10. 

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.994
 And then we have 4 units. 

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:49.893
 Here are 4 units here. 

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:51.484
 4 units. 

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.352
 So that's 64. 

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:55.907
 6 tenths, 4 units. 

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:58.357
 I have 64 squares in total. 

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.284
 60 blue 

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.887
 and another 4 yellow. 

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:03.884
 4 units. 

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.519
 Now I want to get 31. 

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.226
 So, what is 31? 

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.384
 31 is 3 decimal and 1 unit. 

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:14.646
 So let's get 1 unit first. 

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:15.761
 We will draw this, 

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:16.550
 we remove it. 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.850
 We remove 3 tens 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.790
 and 1 unit. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.728
 Let's cross this unit. 

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:24.920
 How many units do we have? 

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.545
 Now we have 3 units. 

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.354
 We have 4 units minus 1 unit 

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.583
 is 3 units. 

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:37.483
 Now look at the dozens. 

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.116
 I have six decades. 

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:42.243
 And I'll get 3 of them. 

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:43.949
 I scratch 3 out of the titles. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.938
 Let me do that. 

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.176
 Let me scratch this one-tenth, 

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:49.923
 then two decades and finally three decades. 

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:52.240
 So how much do they stay? 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.452
 I'm left 

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:55.540
 only 3 decades. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.653
 Only those 3, these 3 here. 

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:03.193
 We have 6 decades minus 3 tens is 3 tens. 

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:07.686
 Therefore, 64 minus 31 is 33. 

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.787
 3 tenths and 3 units. 

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:12.860
 3 tenths, this is a group of 10, 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.777
 another group of 10 and a third group of 10. 

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.219
 3 tenths and 3 units. 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.267
 1, 2, 3.
