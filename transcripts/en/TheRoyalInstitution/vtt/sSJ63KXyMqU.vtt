00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.220
- So hi Dallas!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.060
- Hi there!

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.880
- Hi! We've given you a lollipop too.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.420
- I have it here yes. It doesn't look

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.860
very appetizing I' ve got to say.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.720
-Yes I think Zara feels the same here as well.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.310
Now, okay, I want you both to place your
tongue between the prongs here. Okay?

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.640
-Really?
-Yes now of course like I said you don't

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.555
do this at home this is being specially
designed for this.

00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:33.660
Okay are you ready?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.940
You take it off me. Okay?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.080
-Zara you go first I'm gonna wait to see what happens

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.633
Okay you ready Dallas?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.140
-Okay

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.660
-Now you should be able to taste the flavour.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.420
Just put it on your tongue.
- Oh God that is strong! Wow! Oh!

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.420
-Is it strong?
-Oh it tastes sour, yeah.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.480
-You get sour as well?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.384
- Mhm
- Is it very sour?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.620
- Yeah it's quite sour.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.660
- So what's happening is that device is sending small

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.560
electric currents through those prongs.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.640
So it's stimulating the taste buds on the tongue.
So by varying that current we can vary

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.380
which of the taste buds are being
stimulated and what flavour they can

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.720
taste as well.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.540
What do you both think of
that experience?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.280
- I don't think the inventors are gonna win MasterChef just yet but I think it's a really interesting technology.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.180
- Well they might not be winning it

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.120
because it's well known that we rely
heavily on our smells to help us

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.540
distinguish between tastes. So we have
another device for you to try.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.240
Are you ready for this Zara?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.020
There is a device called a "Scentee" which attaches to your smartphone just using the headphone jack here.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.250
So the idea is people can send you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.120
smells over the Internet.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.700
Now I know what you're thinking. Do I
really want to be able to smell my friends?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.580
Probably not. Well it's okay for
the moment because we don't have that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.660
many smells, we only have a choice of ten
so you're gonna have no nasty surprises.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.760
Okay.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.040
Now Dallas you should have one as well.
- I've got mine here yeah.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.560
- Okay so what we're going to do is
I'm going to try releasing a lemon smell

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.700
to you as you have the lemon taste on
your tongue. Okay?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.540
And this is really cool, we need to see this coming out here.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.740
Are we ready?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.840
Okay let's try this! Lollipops at the
ready and...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.600
Sniff.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.400
Can you sniff it?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.040
Yeah? Can you smell that? 
- Yeah.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.000
- What does that smell like now then?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.760
- It makes it more like lemony.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.360
- It does make it more lemony yeah. Do you get that sort
of lemon sherbet sort of taste?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.060
- Oh wow, wow!
- Dallas, what do you think?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.760
- I think it's amazing you get proper little jets of scent and yeah it is very sherbety but

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.900
it also makes the taste a lot more vivid I suppose if

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
that's the right word, a lot more obvious.
- Does it feel more real when you have the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.602
taste and the smell there?
- Yeah I think it's more sharp.

00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:19.690
- Yes it's more sour isn't it when it's just the lemons

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.590
where now it it's a bit more like a
lemon cake or lemon sherbet isn't it?

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.380
- I think sherbet is exactly the right word
because this actually gives you that

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.747
almost that kind of fizzing
sensation on your tongue.

00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:31.480
- Brilliant!

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.120
Okay, well thank you very much I hope you
enjoyed sharing a meal together.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.720
A feast of lemons! Thank you very much!

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.920
[APPLAUSE]
