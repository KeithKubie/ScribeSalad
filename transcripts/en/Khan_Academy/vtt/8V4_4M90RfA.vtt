00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.731
- [Voiceover] So continuing
on with where we were

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:04.031
in the last video, we're looking for this

00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:08.095
unit tangent vector function
given the parameterization.

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:10.603
So the specific example
that I have is a function

00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:14.434
that parameterizes a circle
with radius capital R,

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:16.384
but I also wanna show in parallel

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.358
what this looks like more abstractly.

00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:21.121
So here, I'll just write
down in the abstract half

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.627
what we did here, what we did
for the unit tangent vector.

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:27.692
So we actually have the
same thing over here

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:29.690
where the unit tangent vector

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.607
should be

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.582
the derivative function,

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:38.043
which we know gives a tangent.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:39.633
It's just it might not be unit.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:40.847
But then we normalize it.

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:45.769
We take the magnitude of
that tangent vector function.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.720
And in our specific case with the circle,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.878
once we did this and we kinda
took the x-components squared,

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:52.991
y-components squared, and
simplified it all out,

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:54.686
we got the function R.

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:57.844
But in general case, we
might not be so lucky.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:01.977
Because the magnitude of this derivative

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:04.229
is gonna be the square root

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.229
of x-prime of t-squared.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.894
Right? This is the
x-component of the derivative.

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:13.540
Plus y-prime of t-squared.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.653
Just taking the magnitude
of a vector here.

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:19.392
So when we take the entire
function and divide it by that,

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:21.505
what we get doesn't simplify as it did

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.362
in the case of a circle.

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:26.752
Instead, we have that x-prime
of t, which is the x-component

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.749
of our s-prime of t, and we have to

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.118
divide it by that entire magnitude,

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:33.161
which was this whole expression, right?

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.971
You have to divide it by that
whole square root expression,

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.084
and I'm just gonna write
"..." with the understanding

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.708
that this square root expression
is what goes up there.

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.585
And similarly, over here, we
have y-prime of t, divided by

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:47.767
that entire expression again, right?

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.042
So simplification doesn't always happen.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.364
That was just kind of a lucky happenstance

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:53.827
of our circle example.

00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:55.244
Now what we want,

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:59.168
once we have the unit tangent vector

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:01.490
as a function of that same parameter,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.974
what we're hoping to
find is the derivative

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:07.689
of that unit tangent vector
with respect to arc length,

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.870
the arc length s, and
to find its magnitude.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.867
That's gonna be what curvature is.

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:14.700
But the way to do this

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.753
is to take the derivative

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:24.036
with respect to the parameter
t; so d big T, d little t,

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:25.953
and then divided out by

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:31.931
the derivative of our function s

00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.971
with respect to t, which we already found.

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.270
And the reason I'm doing this,
you know, loosely if you're

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.617
just thinking of the
notation, you might say,

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.333
oh, you can kinda cancel
out the dt's from each one.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.632
But another way to think
about this is to say,

00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:48.138
when we have our tangent vector
function as a function of t,

00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:51.157
the parameter t, we're not
sure of what it changes

00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:53.317
with respect to s, right?

00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:55.012
That's something we don't know directly.

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:57.752
But we do directly know
its change with respect

00:02:57.752 --> 00:02:59.888
to a tiny change in that parameter.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.187
So then if we just kind
of correct that by saying,

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:04.764
hey, how much does the
length of the curve change?

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:06.831
How far do you move along the curve

00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:08.595
as you change that parameter?

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.544
And maybe if I go back
up to the picture here,

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:16.425
this ds/dt is saying for a
tiny nudge in time, right,

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.880
what is the ratio of the
size of the movement there

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.761
with respect to that tiny time?

00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.997
So the reason that this comes
out to be a very large vector,

00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:26.850
it's not a tiny thing, is
because you're taking the ratio.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.842
Maybe this tiny change was just
an itty-bitty smidgen vector

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.581
but your dividing it by 1/1,000,000

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.089
or whatever the size of
dt that you're thinking.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.863
And in this specific case for our circle,

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:39.176
we saw that the magnitude of this guy,

00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:40.878
if we took the magnitude of that guy,

00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:42.155
it's gonna be equal to R.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.455
Which is a little bit poetic, right?

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:45.615
That the magnitude of the derivative

00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:49.307
is the same as the
distance from the center.

00:03:49.307 --> 00:03:52.604
And what this means in our specific case,

00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:55.042
if we want to apply this
to our circle example,

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:58.075
we take dT, the tangent vector fuction,

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:00.852
and i'll go ahead and write it here,

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:02.872
we have the derivative
of our tangent vector

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:05.449
with respect to the parameter,

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.191
and we go up and look
here and we say okay,

00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:09.768
the unit tangent vector

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:12.578
has the formula -sin(t) and cos(t).

00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:17.222
So the derivative of -sin(t) is -cos.

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:21.389
So over here, this guy
should look like -cos(t).

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:27.230
The other component, the y component,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.621
the derivative of cos(t),
as we're differentiating

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:33.788
our unit tangent vector
function, is -sin, -sin(t).

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:42.817
And what this implies
is that the magnitude

00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:46.409
of that derivative of the
tangent vector with respect to t,

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.802
well what's the magnitude of this vector?

00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:49.219
you've got a cosine, you've got a sine.

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:50.287
There's nothing else in there.

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:53.120
You're going to end up with
cosine squared plus sin squared.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.906
So this magnitude just equals one.

00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:57.625
And when we do what we're
supposed to do over here

00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.180
and divide by the magnitude
of the derivative.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.013
We take this and we
divide it by the magnitude

00:05:04.428 --> 00:05:07.888
of the derivative ds/dt.

00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:10.697
Well we've already computed the
magnitude of the derivative.

00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:11.882
That was R.

00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:15.457
That's how we got this R, is
we took the derivative here

00:05:15.457 --> 00:05:18.624
and took it's magnitude and found it.

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:22.098
So we find that in the
specific case of the circle

00:05:22.098 --> 00:05:23.979
the curvature function that we want

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.346
is just constantly equal to 1/R.

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:29.436
Which is good and
helpful, because I said in

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:30.899
the original video on curvature

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.101
that it's defined by one divided
by the radius of the circle

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.687
that hugs the curve most closely.

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:39.008
And if your curve is actually a circle,

00:05:39.008 --> 00:05:40.262
it's literally a circle.

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:43.048
Then the curve that hugs it
most closely is its self.

00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:44.766
So I should hope that its curvature

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:47.204
ends up being one divided by R.

00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:48.737
And in the more general case,

00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:52.731
if we take a look at what this ought to be

00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:56.121
you can maybe imagine just how
horrifying it's going to be

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.166
to compute this.

00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:59.279
We've got our tangent vector function,

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.878
which itself is almost too
long for me to write down.

00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:05.293
I just put these dot dot
dots where you're filling in

00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:07.174
x prime of t squared
plus y prime of t squared

00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:08.985
and you're gonna have to take this,

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.992
take it's derivative with respect to t.

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:13.197
It's not going to get any simpler

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:14.417
when you take it's derivative.

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:17.622
Take the magnitude of that
and divide all of that

00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:19.642
by the magnitude of the derivative

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:21.894
of your original function.

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:22.916
And I think what I'll do,

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.820
I'm not going to do all of that here.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.213
It's a little bit much and
I'm not sure how helpful

00:06:26.213 --> 00:06:28.256
it is to walk through all those steps.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.486
But for the sake of having
it, for anyone whose curious,

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:32.784
I think I'll put that into an article,

00:06:32.784 --> 00:06:34.921
and you can go through
the steps at your own pace

00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:37.336
and see what the formula comes out to be.

00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:39.007
And I'll just tell you right now,

00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:40.795
maybe kind of a spoiler alert,

00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:42.862
what that formula comes out to be

00:06:42.862 --> 00:06:46.716
is x prime, the derivative
of that first component,

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:50.687
multiplied by y double prime,
the second derivative of

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.659
that second component, minus y prime,

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.376
the first derivative of
that second component,

00:06:56.376 --> 00:06:59.673
multiplied by x double prime.

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.090
And all of that is divided by

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:04.681
the

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:08.600
the magnitude component,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.267
the x prime squared plus y prime squared.

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:17.181
That whole thing to the three halves.

00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.247
And you can maybe see why you're going

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:20.846
to get terms like this, right,

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:24.482
cause when you're taking the derivative,

00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:26.573
when you're taking the derivative of

00:07:26.573 --> 00:07:27.978
the unit tangent vector function

00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:29.603
you have the square root term in it,

00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:31.600
the square root that has
x primes and y primes,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.761
so that's where you're going

00:07:32.761 --> 00:07:33.829
to get your x double
prime, y double prime.

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:36.546
As the chain rule takes you down there.

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:38.450
And you can maybe see why this whole

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.168
x prime squared, y prime squared term

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.258
is going to maintain
itself and it turns out

00:07:42.258 --> 00:07:45.881
it comes in here as a three halves power.

00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:48.272
And what I'm going to do in the next video

00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:51.430
I'm going to go ahead and
describe kind of an intuition

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.450
for why this formula isn't random.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.711
Why if you break down what this is saying

00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:59.401
it really does give a
feeling for the curvature.

00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.445
The amount that the curve curves

00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:03.511
that we want to try to measure.

00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:05.160
So it's almost like this is a third way

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.019
of thinking about it.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.830
The first one, I said you have

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.036
whatever circle most
closely hugs your curve

00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:12.567
and you take 1 divided by its radius.

00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:15.237
And then the second way
you're thinking of this dt/ds,

00:08:15.237 --> 00:08:18.186
the change in the unit tangent vector

00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:20.880
with respect to arc length
and taking its magnitude.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.784
And of course all of these are the same,

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:24.897
they're just kind of three different ways

00:08:24.897 --> 00:08:26.592
to think about it or things
that you might plug in

00:08:26.592 --> 00:08:28.055
when you come across a function.

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:29.169
And I'll go through an example,
