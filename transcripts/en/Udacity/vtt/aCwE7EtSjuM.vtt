00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.440
Payments, or exchanges, have been around for a long time.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.310
And digital payments, or wallet's, are becoming increasingly popular. We're

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.190
going to take this idea of a digital wallet, and give

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.460
it a twist. You're going to be designing the user interface

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.330
for a new time bank, mobile device. So what's a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.110
time bank? Well, that's our challenge. What if people could exchange

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.570
their time, and expertise, for others' time, and expertise, all

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.900
hours being equal? We'll create a portable time bank that enables

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.290
you to exchange your hours with someone else's. In

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.920
this case, the time bank is a credit card size

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.330
touch interface, and it will fit in the wallet,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.590
like this. So you can carry it around with you.
