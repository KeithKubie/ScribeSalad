00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.770
The games people have a definite constraint. Like if it goes less than 30

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.600
frames per second then they have to cut back somehow. They have to get rid of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.940
polygons or they have to go beat their artists to go put you know, less content

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.240
in the scene. but since your selling to who knows who, you know, the guy could

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.480
say, I wanted 50 oil derricks or, you know, 50 whatevers. You know, in my scene

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.110
and so what, what kind of technique are used to sort of control that, so I want

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.980
as much as I want, you know.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.258
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Some of those are sort of reducing geometric complexity, where if you have, you

00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:34.164
have a complex model so as you start to orbit if it's too slow, we can desimate

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:39.971
some triangles from that. So again, there, there are a lot of techniques that

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:43.910
are similar between games and CAD in those situations. We tend to let the user

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.700
have more control over that, where, again, they, they may care more about it.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.552
Some customers maybe fine you know, if they need to orbit something, we can

00:00:50.552 --> 00:00:53.450
turn it into a wireframe object, because that will get them to the point they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.435
need, and then we go back to the, to the full resolution. And lighting is

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:03.648
another one where we can have some effect. We have a landscape lighter who has

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:07.491
a thousand lights in their scene and you can't necessarily do that in real

00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:12.180
time. So sometimes we, we'll cut out some of the lights that will have a lesser

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.602
effect on the scene. So instead of getting 100% fidelity with the real world,

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:21.397
we, it may only look 80% correct. While they're moving around, but then once

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:26.253
they stop, then we can, we can go back to showing the full scene.
