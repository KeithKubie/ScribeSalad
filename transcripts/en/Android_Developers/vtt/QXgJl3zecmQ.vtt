00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.970
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Hangout during Oktoberfest by some
amazing, amazing coincidence of timing.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
Every single sales organization across all
of Google has to have an offsite meeting in

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.940
the Munich office this week.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.970
Who knows?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.690
I don't know.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.800
The stars must have come in into an alignment.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.260
But anyways, those of us who arenít in sales
are here to talk to you about anything and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.960
everything having to do with Android Development.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.400
So I'm Sparky coming to you from Munich, Germany.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.010
And I'm also joined by Nick and Rich in London,
UK.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.309
So, hello everyone.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.309
Welcome.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.470
It's a Wednesday afternoon.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.760
Let's talk Android.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.460
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, it's Nick, Rich and Matt
is at--Matt?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
What happened to Matt?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.210
[INDISTINCT] Android, damn it as always.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.210
Hi.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
How are you doing?

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.720
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And he seems to also be at Al's
house at the same time.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.260
He'sÖ
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: He gets everywhere.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.440
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And sat between us two.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And Al's--and Matt's been out
to another shift for the week so he's guesting

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.750
in Mountainview so he's fast asleep right
now unless he joins the Hangout.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.920
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thatís a poor excuse but anyway.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.470
He could be working out.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.710
We should pity him.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.030
So as usual, today we will be talking about
anything that previously has not been announced.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
Thatís something has recently being announced
that we can talk about.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.189
What time did that go live that blogpost?

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.189
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Midday.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.189
It's been out today.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.189
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Midday today, couple of hours
ago.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.949
We announced the Google Play Store has now
had 25 billion installs.

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:30.679
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Widget and thunder.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:37.319
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: But the Google Play has had 25
billion--we--I'll doing it again so we could

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.319
synchronize--installs.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.030
And as part of that, we're having a promotion.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.539
We have 25 apps, games, books, movies if those
books were launched in your country.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.539
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.630
Keep an eye on the Google Play Store and later
today we'll be announcing which apps is going

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.039
to be on sale and books and other content
as well so keep an eye out for some celebrations

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.039
and some bargains.

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.679
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It should be like [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Oh, my goodness.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.670
I can feel the numbers melting of my credit
card already.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.320
When we had our--when we had our 10 billion
promotion last fall--when was it, November?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.760
I bought I think 56 apps during that promotion.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.709
Now, what I'm going to do this time?

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I spent $5.60 on apps.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.730
Jeez.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.209
Do you remember about your weather?

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.290
I was in an airport with someone using FlightTrack.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.290
And they go, "Wow.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.769
That app's amazing, I should get that."

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.010
Then they checked the Play Store.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.470
It turns out that they bought it during the
10/10/10 promotion.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.969
They didn't quite remember that they bought
it so they were quite happy to see it as a

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.170
purchased application.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.170
Yeah.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.170
I'll also be buying.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.120
I think every single application during the
next promotion which is going to be a bargain

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.910
this weekÖ
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I have FlightTrack but honestly

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.419
I've gotten a lot more used out of Flight
Control.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.639
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: The game?

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.639
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.019
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think this is more about your
travel habits and then it's [INDISTINCT] Sparky.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.580
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I must apologize for the quality
of our video today.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.580
We seem quite pixilated.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.830
We'll try to sit really still.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.459
And hope you don't...

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.690
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Dumdidum didum.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.410
I'll be taking an hour okay?

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.459
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Sparky's got control.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] before we hit the
[INDISTINCT] I jumped [INDISTINCT]

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:13.769
&gt;&gt; RHODE: There you go.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:14.769
First Nick, now me.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.650
But also we hit the [INDISTINCT] jump out
of my seat and smashed my Nexus 7 so it's

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.650
no longer responding.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.969
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thatís glass sticking out.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.419
I can make extreme close-up.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.800
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Nick, we know it's just the way
you want to get some more credit for the Play

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.599
Store Sale.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.900
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thatís every single app like
four times over at least.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
Excellent.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.780
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So Al, I've been seeing some posts
of you on Google+ about AOSP.tv.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.780
What is that?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.780
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.349
It's a little project that started at the
[INDISTINCT] on about a week and a half ago.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.180
I'm taking the Android Open Source Project
which is basically the way that you guys make

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.780
Android available to the rest of the world
and making it more suitable for a TV.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.029
And one of the first steps was being able
to use another device to control it.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:05.849
So what I'm showing is a Galaxy Nexus and
the Nexus S, both being the main gaming machine,

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.560
both running Quake and sitting back with an
Xperia Play, and using that as the controller.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Nice.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.749
So you're connecting that for standard Android
like phone device using--and then using HDMI

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.609
out to play this content into the TV?

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.680
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yup, thatís exactly it.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.690
Thatís all I'm doing on that side.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.200
AndÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, on a second Android device

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200
to control it?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.160
So, you can set your phone in front of your
TV and connect to app and then it uses Bluetooth

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.580
to connect to anybody else if anyone wants
to sit around and play games.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.580
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: : Nice.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.340
Even an old--and old Android device with HDMI
out sitting in a drawer somewhere, why not

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.660
in your TV and connect to the TV?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.090
?
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.090
Absolutely.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.409
Well, my Nexus S is probably going to live
for awhile now.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.370
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: To the Nexus S, thanks to you
now.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.990
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Al, how are you doing that?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.770
It's a Nexus S [INDISTINCT] HDMI did?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.870
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There was a--I thought there was
a connector you could get for it.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.169
I've got one for the Galaxy Nexus which is
HDMI [INDISTINCT] connector but I thought

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.180
that goes back which is compatible with the
Nexus S.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.180
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I don't think the Nexus S [INDISTINCT]
becauseÖ

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.310
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Not that I recall.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.310
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Ödocumentations.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.750
We have these [INDISTINCT] together [INDISTINCT]
problems with them [INDISTINCT] things sold

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.569
into the back of it.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.139
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Looks like I'm going to have to
go device hunting in my box for another one

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.770
who's got the HDMI out.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.860
Maybe my Optimus 2X will find--see the light
of day again.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.050
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I think I'm--I think we got a couple
of tablets that might be a good candidate

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.480
for hooking up to a TV.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.770
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.969
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] to you, Rick and
Paul [INDISTINCT]

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:34.969
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Nick.

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:35.969
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:36.969
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:37.969
Thatís right.

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.379
What I'm doing is the Nexus S and the Galaxy
Nexus are both supported in the Android Open

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.430
Source Project but so as the WiFi zone and
might try to release the boot later unlocker

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.460
that we're keeping at the UK WiFi 1.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.449
So I should be able to get it running on that.

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.270
And given the amount of change is that I've
made a quite minimal.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.479
I could probably also draft it onto [INDISTINCT]
mod and opens up a whole world of extra devices

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.560
that it could run up.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Nice.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.849
Excellent, excellent work.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.250
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Thank you.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.660
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] myself.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.550
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, who else has joined us who
I have just muted?

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.750
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Paul Hanson has joined us in Hangout.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.639
I seem to recall, did--Paul, did you warn
us ahead of time that you're going to ask

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.419
us a standard question?

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.419
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yes.

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.479
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Radical.

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.710
&gt;&gt; RHODE: We're stunned.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.949
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] No.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:26.949
Go ahead.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.660
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Did he say yes?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.720
I heard him say yes.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.430
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I heard that too.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.570
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Question, Paul?

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.460
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Let me see if I can try at the moderator.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.259
I think it's this one.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.030
Well, this is--this is sort of coming from
Pablo in Central England but I thought this

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.840
was Paul's question.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.659
We read smart cards fits with fixed power
on self [INDISTINCT] time.

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.099
Most need a second to complete.

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.720
Android default NFC, ISO depth time out of
0.3 seconds is too short.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.199
Gingerbread, we can overwrite this to two
seconds, works well.

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.789
ICS and Jelly Bean does not work, any ideas?

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.309
If I had any expertise in NFC, I would share
it with you.

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:20.259
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: How do we need to get Trevor on
the line?

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:24.129
You need to ask this in the Mountainview office
hours in eight hours time.

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:28.479
Because Trevor did a whole lot of work with
NFC and wrote a superb app for scanning mobile

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:29.659
or congress badges.

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:46.580
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Interestingly, I went on a vacation
recently and they gave us NFC room key.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.849
I did not do as Trevor did.

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:51.500
I didn't reverse engineer it or turned my
phone into a virtual room key or anything

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.939
but it was--it was pretty cool to be able
to read the data out of my room key using

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:56.969
that phone.

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:02.870
Give me a really warm fuzzy feeling about
the security of this hotel room.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.380
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Can you hear me?

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.340
Can you hear me too on thisÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup, we can hear you.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.340
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] now.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.389
&gt;&gt; HANSON: I work--my sound [INDISTINCT] through
okay?

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.389
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup, great.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.389
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yeah.

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:17.000
So, it's just the NFC question was a timer
issue between the different OS's of Android

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
with Gingerbread.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.419
We were able to overwrite it.

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:27.190
But the way it launches in Ice Cream Sandwich
is it decides to time out it informs the application.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:33.630
So the 0.3 seconds would not over allow the
certain types of card to be read and pass

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.630
through.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.690
So I just want to do this--I'm stuck overplaying
this and you can't adjust this.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:44.060
But I just wanted also to for forward warning
for future versions of Android whether we

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.000
can increase the default to one second?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.560
And that sounds like a pretty specific question
which I'm not really familiar with.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.510
Like have you gone to the [INDISTINCT] code
base and found where thatís [INDISTINCT]

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:02.020
&gt;&gt; HANSON: What you can do is on the ISO depth
you can call .settime outs and you can change

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.380
it to any value.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.730
But the problem is the way that the NFC life
cycle is in Ice Cream Sandwich is it never

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.910
gets called because it doesnít launch the
app.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:19.830
So I can't--when it says on tag it says in
the documentation that also since you close

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.450
the tag, it reverts back to its default time
out of 0.3 seconds.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.160
But if you set it, you have to be in a code
to set it so you have to have launched the

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.700
application so thatís the problem.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.130
The problem is Android won't launch the application
for those kind of cards.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.090
The other cards will work, but the problem
is all of the new cards are going to be on

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.520
the 1.3 seconds so you can't change the cards.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.030
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: How are you treating into your
app?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.810
You're doing it on in depth discover or you
doing on [INDISTINCT]

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.810
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Both.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.340
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And even on [INDISTINCT] it isn't
long enough [INDISTINCT]

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.340
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Basically I've got the code here.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:03.480
Look, I'm doing [INDISTINCT] on action discovered
or on action tech discovered or on action

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.800
tag discovered, it goes--calls the same function.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.021
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Then I'll get the tag--I'll get
the tag object and then I immediately try

00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:16.680
to call the set time out but in Ice Cream
Sandwich I can't even debug--I can't even

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.760
step into that code at all.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.440
But on Gingerbread, you will get there.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.120
Allow me to set the time out and then which
we allow the rest of the process to continue.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.170
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Uh-hmm.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:31.770
I wonder if thatís due to the lack of higher
level APIs like Android Beam.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:38.280
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I don't know but it's quite interesting
that Gingerbread lets you do that.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.570
And the problem is theyíve been debugging
some of the phones and obviously you want

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.590
to try the Galaxy Note and the S3 and things
like that.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.060
And I keep having to dig out in all characters
to try and get it to work.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.450
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So, does it work if you pre-launch
the application?

00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:00.210
&gt;&gt; HANSON: It doesnít appear to work if you
pre-launch or if it's launched from the tag

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.390
event.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:07.260
I tried some tricks like making a static tag
object and try to hang on to the reference

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.100
to set the time out from a previous time but
I couldn't seem to get that to work either.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.990
And it sounds a bit like a bad piece of engineering
as well.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.270
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.790
Well, there's a difference between just make
this work and go to production with it.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.790
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yeah.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.440
&gt;&gt; RHODE: At least, I hope there's a difference.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.830
&gt;&gt; HANSON: So, defining this--defining a short
translation I'd like to make it--I'd like

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.280
you to reconsider for the future, Android
version.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.800
I could print out the default log.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, the right way...

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.190
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Time out.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.250
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ...the right way to voice that
feature is, would be to file a feature quest

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.250
on a AOSP.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.350
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Okay.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.800
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So you go to dev.android.com,
which is both [INDISTINCT] bugs.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.920
So there's a section there about fighting
bugs.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.970
One of the types of bug, you can find in the
feature request.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.970
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Okay.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.240
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, might as well report that
to us and you'll get logged and catalogued

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.210
and prioritized in that opinion and this day
on.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.850
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yes, because I think this problem
will affect the U.S. primary, the U.S. cards

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.610
will be like that as--and increasing in Europe,
so it will--it will kind of stop.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.490
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Does this need static kind of
cards?

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.290
I've never heard of this.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.410
&gt;&gt; HANSON: This is a cargo security on it.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:25.010
So, it's basically, what happens is, when
the NFC event happens, it's pairing up, doing

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.010
a self check.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.270
So, this--I think it's fragmented at the moment
but I think it's increasing.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.050
This type of cards increasing nuisance it
was nowhere around.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.890
We can't sort of change what cards people
are using, so over across the countries sort

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.940
of thing, so...

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.340
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It sounds interesting.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.340
Could you...

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.670
&gt;&gt; HANSON: It's a current standard, sorry.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.070
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah [INDISTINCT] and send us
a link.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.170
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Sorry?

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You write out this issue if you
posted just to step over for already.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yes.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.230
So, I got it on stuff--stuck overflow.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.580
There's a guy called NFC.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.690
NFC guy is quite good.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.670
And he knows this stuff because he works with
Android.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.670
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.740
&gt;&gt; HANSON: And his--had a few guys but, he
said--you said you can't do anything about

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.740
an Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.680
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And you think there's a link to...

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.399
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yes, sort of, yeah, he went to
paste in this window here.

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:10.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, because it will just go away
with in this Hangout.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.940
He posted as a comment on the G+ event--of
the G+...

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.940
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Okay.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.100
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: This Hangout.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.400
That'd be awesome.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.700
&gt;&gt; HANSON: No problem.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.250
&gt;&gt; RHODE: You can also post it in the chat.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.290
I usually copy those and save them to a text
file at the end.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.290
&gt;&gt; HANSON: All right.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.290
I'll do both.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.870
I have to look it up, but yeah, I mean, at
the very least, it would be good if the default

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.870
is at least one second.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.770
We work with all kinds of cards because this
will be an issue in the U.S. as well.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:41.000
But, yeah unless anyone short ideas.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.970
I donít think it's that easy to sort it out,
to try a bit everything from stock overflows.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.940
So, it's been--so, I've been looking out for
a few weeks.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.110
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I'm not sure if any on that you
dug into the Sourcescape.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.620
There is a service which controls the time
out for reading tags and things like that.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.620
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Okay.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.480
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: If you can paste a link as Rich
and Nick asked for.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yeah.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.250
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I'll have to dig in to that and
see if there's a way to set it from a third

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.170
party application.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.353
&gt;&gt; HANSON: That would be brilliant.

00:14:06.353 --> 00:14:09.200
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Because there seems to be methods
to set it but I'm not sure what restrictions

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.110
are placed on those methods whether they're
exposed to third party apps or not.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.300
So, it may or may not work.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.500
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Yes, because it's sort of put in
our custom [INDISTINCT] is only good for internal

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.080
but since we go out to other people, we won't
hesitate up but yeah, if the app can overwrite

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.210
something that would be fantastic to look
out...

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.710
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Cool.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.450
&gt;&gt; HANSON: Thank you very much.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.950
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:38.930
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You have a start to have to look
at the moderator this weekend?

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.380
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Well, we've got a couple of people
in the Hangout.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.820
We've got, Sebastian, is that right?

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.850
And Richard Thompson.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:51.220
Do you guys have anything you want to talk
about before we go into the moderator content?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.720
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Richard is typing.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.340
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes, please.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.840
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Matt's typing.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.460
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: What's that?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:09.360
It's [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: While they're typing, maybe we can

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.630
get a moderator question.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.390
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT] all the way.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.800
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Let's see how you guys are doing.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.430
So, Crystal in Estonia wants to know.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.110
He says, I have a web-based game that includes
purchase of digital goods.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.340
Do I still have to use Google Wallet for purchases?

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.910
Sorry, yes.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:39.660
We understand that Estonia is not a Google
Wallet emergent country.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.880
But that still doesnít excuse you from the
terms of the Play Store, which is--if you're

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.200
hosted in Play Store you need to use Google
Wallet as your payment method mechanism.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.831
There is the multi-platform work around but
we've discussed before where if you have a

00:15:53.831 --> 00:15:58.990
piece of digital content that's an equally
useable in several different places like say

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:04.560
in, you know, the Amazon Music Player, the
Apple iTunes player or Google Music.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.060
And the same digital purchase confers rates
to all these different platforms, then we

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:14.650
don't require you to use wallet, but otherwise,
basically our store, our payment method.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.650
Sorry.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.650
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:22.360
We have commented on this before, there are
some applications that are great [INDISTINCT]

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.200
that are looked up by the [INDISTINCT] probably
abused it.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.350
Which I'm glad is and their making a decision
on it.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:33.790
Generally, you know, just stick to the guidelines.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.980
Unfortunately, when it's not in your country,
then it's not possible to use, you cannot

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.070
pay all the paid app systems.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:46.890
You could choose to partner with a publisher
in another country or do something else, which

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.920
enables you to have an account from another
country.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.830
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah, we got that we can't be everywhere
at once.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.660
You know, we're working on it.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.680
I also like to point out, we're not forcing
you to distribute your app through Google

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
Play.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.440
You can choose another market if that's the
way you want monetize your app.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.970
We have an open eco system and you're free
to do that.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.050
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, I know.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:16.730
I know that's the ideal answer, but the ideal
answer would be [INDISTINCT]

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.949
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:22.319
So, we have a question aside from Richard
Thompson.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:30.570
So, Richard and [INDISTINCT] Android design
guidelines, recommends a 16-depth margin on

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.429
the sides of your screen.

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:38.840
But he asks, what is the recommended padding
to the top and bottom as demonstrated by Rich.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.629
Thank you for that.

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:46.790
[INDISTINCT] And so, I would probably say,
it depends on what you're showing, is commonly

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.790
the answer.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.320
So, if you're showing like a list view for
example, I think that same screen on the--on

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.039
metrics [INDISTINCT] recommend, you know the
recommended like height, width 8 depths, above

00:17:57.039 --> 00:17:58.039
and below.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:01.640
So, you fall into the standard 48 depth ribbon.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.220
So, that's, you know, one thing.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.940
If you're not kind of going for context, straight
away, you might want to echo the 16-depth

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.600
margin, over the left and right to get an
even feel.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.129
It kind of really depends on your content.

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:13.129
So, let's say...

00:18:13.129 --> 00:18:16.950
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah personally I'd say if you
got an action bar at the top and the top is

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.950
well-defined.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.950
You have to zero margin above that.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.990
And the list is going to drill straight through
the bottom of the screen.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.063
If you have any or whatever it is the content,
we'll be stretching to the bottom of the screen.

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.679
So, if you have any margins there, it might
be slightly confusing to the user, the UI's

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:29.679
ending.

00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:30.679
Before...

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:33.529
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, because list item it cells
includes padding with in [INDISTINCT] on the

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:37.799
action bar, you wouldn't put a [INDISTINCT]
up against the action bar.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:39.579
I probably go the 16-depths.

00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:41.360
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, [INDISTINCT] that.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.029
You want it--must have it consistent.

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:47.951
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Well, if you're the designer on
it.

00:18:47.951 --> 00:18:49.309
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It seems, Sebastian jumped in.

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:50.309
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Great.

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:51.830
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Richard says thank you.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:57.500
And Sebastian says, I live in Venezuela and
we have had restrictions to use foreign currencies.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.500
We have high restrictions.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.899
Is there a possibility for us to sell our
apps in local currency in Play?

00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:08.130
Would we go on and create a local market?

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:13.669
&gt;&gt; RHODE: We'll sort of just adjust that.

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:15.340
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Sort of what, Sparky?

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.299
&gt;&gt; RHODE: We kind of just talked through that
one...

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:20.690
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, Venezuela going to be a
merging country either, so can't sell your

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:26.590
apps in Google Play until we support Venezuela
as a merging country.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:32.700
Unless that's not the case, if it is, then
the case [INDISTINCT] yes, you can create

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.039
a local market.

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:37.590
You potentially said it through the operator
stores if there are any.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.600
Well, you can put it on Google Play and monetize
your different means.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.110
Maybe, advertising, but the monetization option,
direct monetization of Google Play isn't open

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.740
to [INDISTINCT] countries.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.659
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think one of the other problems
in Venezuela is actually lifted as a Play

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:55.519
Store, able to sell paid applications.

00:19:55.519 --> 00:20:00.700
I donít know if he's having issues with the
fact of foreign exchange rules in Venezuela

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.440
or selling in things like U.S. dollars and
stuff like that may cause legal problems.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.919
I think what we read around that is to developer
to just to select Venezuela is the only country

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:09.919
they sell to, as well.

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:13.970
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes, Venezuela is listed as a
merging country and you have restrictions

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.409
on selling in foreign countries then, yeah.

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:25.960
Yes, they're also obeyed by your countries,
laws and regulations.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.440
I donít know about tapping.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.669
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We have another person joining
us whose name I cannot pronounce.

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:38.639
But he's got a [INDISTINCT] I looked it up.

00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:41.610
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Hey Nikola, yeah.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.320
If you have any questions that would be a
good time to ask them.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.030
In the meantime, thanks for posting those
links out and Paul.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:54.059
Paul just posted a link to stock overflow
issue on Galaxy.

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:56.909
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:20:56.909 --> 00:21:01.690
Do you have any more moderator questions?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.999
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: We do.

00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:05.389
Live in the room.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:08.870
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I'm trying to get back to you guys.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.490
I sort of lost your window.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.559
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You lost us.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:12.640
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Sparky, come back.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.250
&gt;&gt; RHODE: There you are--there you are.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:21.419
This is the link to the emerging countries
of which I regret to say, Venezuela is not

00:21:21.419 --> 00:21:22.470
one.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.559
And for the record, neither is India.

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:28.740
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Is the link that you posted are
the links of countries that you can sell out

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.399
as oppose the links you can sell them from?

00:21:30.399 --> 00:21:31.879
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: [INDISTINCT] way you can sell it
from.

00:21:31.879 --> 00:21:36.950
It's the Google Play for developers supported
locations for distributing applications.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.779
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's where you can sell them
to, not sell them from.

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:43.529
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: What the last section says the
developers' needs locations may also sell

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:46.809
paid applications to use and the rest of the
world.

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:53.070
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Look at the two links [INDISTINCT]
come take a look at the screen to that window

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.070
up there.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.679
But I know there's only three different sections
in that document.

00:21:57.679 --> 00:22:02.190
If it's one about 31 countries, then that's
the emerging [INDISTINCT].

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:08.320
If it's one of the 130 countries, then that's
the countries you can sell apps into and then

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320
everything else is.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.061
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It looked--it looks like the 31
list, but if you have a look and to let us

00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:14.061
know that'd be cool.

00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:15.061
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:22:15.061 --> 00:22:17.980
Not that I--if I can get it work.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:23.340
Do you want to run to the next question, Sparky.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.340
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Sure.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.220
We looked at that one.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:35.220
Yohan Pilgrim in the Netherlands says, "Let's
say I add some stake to an activity being

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.240
an [INDISTINCT] and the activity is destroyed.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.190
When to user navigates back to my activity
can I depend on the framework to reuse the

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.600
original attempt to start it?

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.440
I [INDISTINCT] the intent acts to be to there."

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.389
And it says, "To Labiridge, can I depend on
the original intent extra or do I need to

00:22:53.389 --> 00:22:57.700
save it using on Stevens--on Stevens or something
like that.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.929
Which of course would mean trying to retrieve
it from the extra etcetera."

00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:05.769
So--and he can't be in the Hangout, so we're
free to talk about it without him.

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:11.400
We can say nasty things about him and he'll
never know until he watches the replay.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:18.649
So my answer to him, at least the moderator
was it depends on how the activity was exited.

00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:22.360
If it's--if it just got pushed down to the
stack by some other activities being open

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.580
on top of it, then I think the original intent
is still there.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.740
But if the user presses the back button, then
the activity is destroyed and I think it's

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.540
going to take a whole new intent to get it
back again.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.729
Does that sound right to you guys?

00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:34.729
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:23:34.729 --> 00:23:39.370
If you want things to be like saves and passed
in when it recreated, then use on savings

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.640
mistakes because that's what it's for.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.240
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And orientation change will also
kill off any extra swelter.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.019
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yup.

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:56.270
Tear it all down and create again.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.270
Okay then.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.799
I think our new joiner is--we got Jeff has
joined us.

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:00.190
AndÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, it's just seven.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.849
Oh, so it's Jeff [INDISTINCT], that would
be amazing.

00:24:01.849 --> 00:24:03.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, Jeff also is on in the sidebar
there.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.690
Can we add the information about padding?

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.870
I don't know, because it's really a "it depends"
answer.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:13.179
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So the one that's fixed the side
padding would put that in the design guidelines

00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:14.429
for the top and bottom.

00:24:14.429 --> 00:24:15.589
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:24:15.589 --> 00:24:19.020
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Does it meanÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It would.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.309
&gt;&gt; RHODE: It seems to me like we have kind
of sort of precedent of having a eighth-dps

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:24.600
design rule.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.309
So you should, I mean, at the very least try
to separate things by eight-depths.

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:30.470
That kind of feels right to me.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:36.340
It really takes me back to when we were designing
computer chips, you know, you get your minimum

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.330
feature size and everything's in multiples
of that.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.839
I think our minimum feature size here is eight-dps.

00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:46.719
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think at least.

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:48.759
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I can't wait.

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:53.929
I just--I just can't wait for the future when
we start using VLSI design tools for running

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:54.929
software.

00:24:54.929 --> 00:25:00.179
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Other tools are [INDISTINCT] if
not from a question.

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:01.179
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:07.200
I've got--I've got a question about the wallet,
just for our people talking, just talk.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:13.730
Is there a provision for like storing tickets
on the wallet, or how does that thing work.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.970
If you--if you want to sell to that party
ticket or something.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.970
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Nope.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.320
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; It's just purely payments, is it?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.510
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: As I understand that.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:28.250
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And a tiny pigments from a groove,
card approvers it's not sort of payments anyone

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.409
can add anything to.

00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:30.409
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:34.529
So if you-if you're making a payment, let's
say sell a ticket to an event, it's up to

00:25:34.529 --> 00:25:37.629
you what you do with that ticket and how you
do it, if it's not tossed in the wallet in

00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:38.629
any way.

00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:39.709
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Right.

00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:40.709
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:47.679
There's no sort of encryption or authentication
or need in three persons purchase of that

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.919
stage tied to that.

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:49.919
So, okay.

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:52.980
So it's completely open.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.559
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yup.

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:58.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.821
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Any other questions for the room
or should we crack on with the moderator?

00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:05.110
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I see that we've been joined by
Jetendra.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:13.140
Does Jentendra have anything to ask?

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.330
No Android client for the Google+ video in
Hangout.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.330
Yeah.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.549
This is--it's, I mean, it's not a purely Hangout,
right.

00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:26.129
It's this Google live, it's at--a YouTube
live stream.

00:26:26.129 --> 00:26:31.029
I thought--I thought I heard from one of our
developers that he could see it.

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:32.029
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, he can.

00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:33.029
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, yes.

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:34.029
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:35.029
He can see that.

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:36.769
That's probably--there's not likely [INDISTINCT]
inÖ

00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:37.779
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:38.779
You should probablyÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: ÖGoogle passed for you.

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:39.779
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:40.779
I've had it running.

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:43.779
I had some issues with sounds but that's probably
my network bandwidth than anything else.

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:46.150
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hey, is this YouTube, is this
live, right?

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.059
You just open YouTube and go to the live section
and we should be right there.

00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:50.059
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: That's that.

00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:54.700
And there's also you can join him with the
Hangouts on air from the Google+ client on

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.700
Android.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.700
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.700
Yeah.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.700
It should work on Hangout on handsets.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So, yeah.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.360
Jeff says it works on his tablet, but not
on his HTC Evo 4G.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.249
So I guess it's going to depend upon which
version of YouTube application you're running.

00:27:09.249 --> 00:27:10.639
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Unsupportive data format.

00:27:10.639 --> 00:27:12.739
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So I guessÖ
&gt;&gt; RHODE: SoÖ

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:14.840
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: We've never seen that before.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.820
Basically, YouTube spits out a live stream
in a variety of formats.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.423
And it can take a little while before it spits
out the mobile friendly one, which is why

00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:25.250
we're trying to start out the Hangout a little
bit before--we're actually going to start

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.250
broadcasting.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.470
And then you turn on live.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.110
So it might just be a case of checking back
a little bit later.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.110
Sorry about that.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.480
Sometimes it's how YouTube works.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.120
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So you think it's just--it's just
a processing pipeline delay then?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.120
That's interesting.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.799
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That's one of the potential issues
that you can give that and answer.

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:44.840
The other thing I was thinking could be, if
you had an older version [INDISTINCT] for

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.840
some reason.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.499
And you--that might not support the Hangout
[INDISTINCT].

00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:51.929
So check regularly what the latest version.

00:27:51.929 --> 00:27:56.299
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Generally, if you guys follow
the YouTube, comment to Jeff live, we'll chat

00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:57.440
with him afterwards.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.580
We usually follow the comment on the Google+
posting for this like event and also on the

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.580
moderator.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.580
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.649
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And the YouTube comments aren't
quite the same quality.

00:28:07.649 --> 00:28:08.649
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:28:08.649 --> 00:28:12.770
Any places people's post comments in YouTube
Live since to be the lowest [INDISTINCT]

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:17.059
&gt;&gt; RHODE: You know, I could--I could see having
somebody follow the YouTube comment if we

00:28:17.059 --> 00:28:24.500
were able to devote, you know, to devote a
person who monitor the streams as oppose to

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.019
having everybody on camera all the time.

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:34.140
I don't know if our viewers are aware of this,
but when you look at the Hangouts that are

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.869
run by the California team, they've got so
many guys over there that they always got

00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:40.820
one or two people off camera producing the
show.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:46.739
What you get hear in EMEA is the entire Android
Developer Organization on camera talking to

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:47.739
you live.

00:28:47.739 --> 00:28:48.739
Hello.

00:28:48.739 --> 00:28:52.490
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Definitely, it's a good point
there like I had say how as the ask questions,

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:53.490
dude?

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.610
I'd say jump up the stream screen and go into
the G+ client or something.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.289
But it's usually the third point.

00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:00.549
So maybe we should start wondering in somehow.

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:05.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So far, there any one question
in the YouTube screen, and it's fromÖ

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.809
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Jeff.

00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:08.429
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, Jeff.

00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:10.590
Good to hear that.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.750
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Hey to all.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.750
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.309
Sorry for the late join and forgot which time
zones here.

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:18.020
We are all living Winter times.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.010
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Ah, you were [INDISTINCT] pretty
switched.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.929
We can't be far of switching.

00:29:21.929 --> 00:29:24.320
Well, not by here.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.249
Screws up all the calendars.

00:29:27.249 --> 00:29:28.249
Okay.

00:29:28.249 --> 00:29:29.249
Moderator.

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:36.279
&gt;&gt; RHODE: You know, I'm just looking at that
moderator.

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:41.899
Remember a couple of questions keep trickling
in while we are talking.

00:29:41.899 --> 00:29:45.919
And that's [INDISTINCT] let me scroll down
to the right one.

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:51.940
"Any idea if it's possible to change the animation
of a ViewPager to something other than a slide?

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940
I.E.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.090
And after our style overlapping transition."

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.379
All right then.

00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:58.909
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:29:58.909 --> 00:30:01.899
I mean, ViewPager is at the source.

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:06.179
If you've downloaded the [INDISTINCT] it's--the
source is even lying on your computer right

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:10.460
now, on the Android SDK extras compatibility
Google something.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.509
You'll see it down there, support source.

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:17.169
And you can put those words in any order,
and it will just be there.

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:18.169
Manager's magic.

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:20.870
I've read through the source myself and played
around with it.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.190
Yeah, you canÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's incredibly real, right?

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.190
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It is.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think I highly recommend that
one to take a look at the source of ViewPager

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.860
because it's very, very readable, very well-structured.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.070
And you can learn a lot.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.349
Let's say good job Adam Hall.

00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:33.639
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Good job Adam Hall, yeah.

00:30:33.639 --> 00:30:37.340
So you can look into that and play around
with it, change the way it works.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.029
Change animations if you really want to.

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:41.830
It's already got the thing that tracking built
in, just quite nice.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.700
So, yes, you can.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.779
So I'd say you'd probably want to extend the
ViewPager and change it rather than--

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.150
I don't think there's a setting to change
animation on the ViewPagerÖ

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.150
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.160
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Öfor you, looking and creating
your own widget.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.539
But, yeah, I'd say like 95% of the web has
done it for you already, if you start from

00:30:55.539 --> 00:30:56.539
the ViewPager.

00:30:56.539 --> 00:30:58.029
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You can call it draw slider pager
or something.

00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:00.190
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Or if you want it to look the

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.529
apps tray, why don't you look at the source
code of the apps tray.

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:03.529
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's true.

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:04.610
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Which is in Launcher2 [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.159
Where's the [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:10.460
[INDISTINCT] Launcher2.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.059
This is [INDISTINCT] I forget.

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:16.249
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Thank you, unknown for the question.

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:18.440
One of our more, more popular contributors.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.389
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It is still Launcher2.

00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:21.389
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Jeez.

00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:24.190
Well, I was looking back at that link as well,
Al.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.960
And that is listed countries that you can
sell apps in to.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.710
A bit where it says, developers in these countries
may also sell to other countries.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:35.329
That in these countries is a link when you
click on that, you see that there's a countries.

00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:36.329
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: All right.

00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:37.509
So that's not that at least it's below that
sentence.

00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:38.509
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:40.940
And then you get to the--doesn't have Valenzuela
in it.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.940
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: No.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.940
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's good.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.059
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Thanks for checking out, Rich.

00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:48.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Plus the hundred and thirty [INDISTINCT]
I'm looking in to implementing the Android

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.690
Backup Service in my app.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.129
It saysÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yehey.

00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:52.210
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, right.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.919
Well, people should look into doing that.

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:54.919
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I love that service.

00:31:54.919 --> 00:31:59.469
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: But I can't find any examples
on how to use SQLite database.

00:31:59.469 --> 00:32:00.940
&gt;&gt; Any ideas?

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.389
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Is there a sequel helper for the
backup service?

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:08.889
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I kind of thought the point to the
backup service was for restoring devices.

00:32:08.889 --> 00:32:11.769
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Just a little.

00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:14.659
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Wouldn't you want to do it off device?

00:32:14.659 --> 00:32:20.789
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So the other backup service, yes.

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:25.389
I think what he wants to is just want to backup
to a SQLite database, a backup SQLite databaseto

00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:26.389
the Cloud.

00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:28.259
Well, he wantsÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, right.

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:29.269
I interpret it as the backup and restore service.

00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:30.269
Yeah.

00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:31.269
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, the thing when it restores

00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:33.240
your shared preferences and whatnot when you
had logged into a new device.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.239
I'm not going toÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It says I can't find examples

00:32:35.239 --> 00:32:36.970
on how to use with SQLite database.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.110
And that is--it's a--there is a confusion
now.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:44.049
He may be talking about using the backup service
to back up to a database.

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:47.960
We use to backup service to backup SQLite
databaseto the Cloud.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.960
Because that is possible.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.070
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think he means the Cloud service
not the--it could beÖ

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:56.419
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Now that the examples we have
are filed back up and share preferences [INDISTINCT].

00:32:56.419 --> 00:32:57.419
It's the fun.

00:32:57.419 --> 00:33:03.440
I mean, really, he wants us to backup sort
of [INDISTINCT] that would be silly.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.039
Yeah, I think, talking about SQLite databasefor
the Cloud?

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:11.370
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Isn't part of the thing--the issue
that when you synchronize a back up, you got

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.950
no guarantee it's going to just sequel database.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.330
So there's no ability to translate or sequel
database on the device directly to a sequel

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.011
database in the Cloud because you don't know
that's where to be stored.

00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:23.011
So it'sÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:33:23.011 --> 00:33:24.700
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Ögoing to need to write some kind
of translator that puts in the different format

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.700
anyway.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.330
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: SoÖ
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I mean doing a generic model is

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.739
going to be difficult because you need to
make assumptions about the database.

00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:36.269
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You can blob it, but if you just
want to sample and write the database on restore

00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:41.929
which is fine to sequel with the database
is, you can just back up the blob at SQLite

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:42.929
database.

00:33:42.929 --> 00:33:49.669
And then when you restore, just see if it's
going to, just check time grab the latest

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:50.730
format.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.850
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT].

00:33:52.850 --> 00:34:00.929
Yeah, a nice way of doing it would be to synchronize
the database, but then you've got to--yeah,

00:34:00.929 --> 00:34:02.340
do exactly that.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:09.340
Figure out what date has changed, when it
changed and do the synchronizations more like

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.340
Gmail does it.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.350
When you hit the refresh you see something
else, too many things appearing.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.540
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Some [INDISTINCT] everyone else.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.790
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I think there's muting war going
on.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:30.180
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'm just going to look for an
example code for it.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:42.540
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I don't know that if it wonít
runÖ

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.990
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or maybe we should have one.

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.990
Yeah, slightly tricky.

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.660
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I'm mostly curious about what
back data you're trying to back up if it's

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.100
like large SQL database.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.410
I'm not sure that's exactly what it's intended
for.

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:56.910
Nothing is more so like backing up configurations
and settings and so on and so forth.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:01.680
Such that you if you accidentally step on
your device and smash you screen then get

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.200
a new one.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.119
And when you locate and everything is the
same as you left it.

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:08.770
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's a stack-overflow question
which shows a very quick way of backing up

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:14.410
a whole SQLite databases as a blowup or stick
a link to in the comments or just paste.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:19.460
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's definitely going to be
easier that's why anything else, I mean like

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.320
almost--just look at the--that preferences
back up.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:30.113
How close was that it gives you an idea if
what you--if you want to do the synchronization

00:35:30.113 --> 00:35:34.020
as well of each individual database item.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.010
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Okay.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.890
We'll see we've got a couple new people in
Hangout.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:42.830
We got the Armeda Streind and Jodith Streind.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:43.830
So welcome to Hangout guys.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.180
If you have anything that you want to discuss
regarding Android Application Development,

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.180
you just let us know.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:58.710
So they don't know how to skip to particular
point in the YouTube video mobile.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.070
Oh, I understand you can embed that in URL.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.080
I don't know if you can do it.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think theÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It would be otherwiseÖ

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.471
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Öpoint is read between the lines
is anything which broke us on YouTube Live

00:36:08.471 --> 00:36:14.400
infrastructure doesnít let you use the scrubber,
that little progress bar to skip ahead and

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.720
specially if you're actually watching a live
broadcast.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.880
You can't do that.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.150
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I want the future.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.150
Damn it.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.090
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Maybe you can skip back.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.090
It's like early [INDISTINCT} structure.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.090
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, you can't downstream.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.420
There's a limitation to the YouTube Live mobile
just to stream into it.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.800
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think--well, I think after a
period of time, once YouTube processes it

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.340
then it comes a regular video.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.790
That the recording after this will become
a regular YouTube video at some point you'll

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.780
be able to scrub back and forth and not the
first answer.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.780
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780
It's definitely awhile after because I've
checked.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.780
It's been an hour or two after.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.990
It still just has the play through the entire
live show as an option.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:54.000
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: But if you go to the web version,
then you can scrub back and forth.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.750
I was trying to continue to watch some broadcast
on my file but couldn't skip to where I got

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.750
to on my pc.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:03.940
Yeah, that's a current limitation of the watching
a YouTube Live video on the YouTube mobile

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.940
phone.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.590
You have to go back to the--you may be able
to get away with it if you got Flash installed.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.640
You might go to the web browser and go through
that and not let YouTube launch it.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.000
Maybe I'd have to go forward to the right
point of the video, through the browser.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: You Flash it.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.530
&gt;&gt; RHODE: You can add that.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.370
I mean certainly it comes in where you can--where
you can bookmark something on your pc and

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.052
have it show up on your Mac or Google Maps
where you can star something and want to have

00:37:27.052 --> 00:37:28.170
it show on the other.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.170
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.740
&gt;&gt; RHODE: You need to have that with YouTube
too.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.050
Just you know, push my video from my phone
straight to my desktop and keep watching.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.550
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That works very well with theÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That works with phone to tablets

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.550
between, right?

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.640
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And on the Nexus Q, you can just

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.800
bring your tablet, TV tablet up and down and
that's [INDISTINCT].

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.150
&gt;&gt; RHODE: And Ahmad has reposted this question.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:52.930
It doesnít say it wanted the [INDISTINCT]
rate it average.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:58.060
&gt; HYNDMAN: Well, Google App Engine will be
a good option instead of Amazon Web Services.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.100
Good question.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.100
Yes.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.700
Oh, okay, there's more.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.840
For writing, reading data with low latency
when we have thousands of users performing

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.840
read/write to server.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.270
The issue is was when data is shredded and
the response time needs to be very small.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.520
Would Google App Engine handle something like
Instagram?

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.510
Do we have any used cases similar to it.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:18.660
We've got Memcache.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:26.360
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Right, so your default method of
saving things and apprehension is data store

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.780
which of course is, you know, shared by all
the different front ends that are accessed,

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.160
you know, all the different front end instances
that are serving your app.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.480
And then you got Memcache which keeps things
in memory.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.800
It's, you know, like it sounds.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.080
It's small fast, low latency.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.320
So I would say yes.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.710
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, there you go.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.880
I recommend that you go to the office hours
of the Apps team.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Cloud Team.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.080
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: You can go to, yeah, go to developers.google.com/live.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.130
The Cloud team have office hours.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.130
This is the Android office hours.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.440
So we're not going to read any answers to
question on there on their product, but you

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.061
can go to their office hours and ask them
about it.

00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:04.290
And they'll give you some really detailed
answers on exactly that used case.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: They'll tell you yes.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.690
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: They'll say yes, but they'll also
take it.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.690
I hope.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:11.750
So, yeah, I meant, have a littleÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Have a little a reason why.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:18.930
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Developers.google.com/live [INDISTINCT]
houses, big tables do you think?

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.440
We put a lot of things in a big table.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.140
We have 600 on the thread.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.190
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, yeah.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.580
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: They're from Al.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.360
This is for the [INDISTINCT].

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.850
Why from the Google+ [INDISTINCT] to the Hangout.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:33.850
Okay.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.740
They're also being reposted and [INDISTINCT].

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.020
Back to the moderator.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.770
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah, it's one in the moderator.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.840
This is a little bit forward looking.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:49.740
It says, when are you guys going to straighten
out HTML5 video for Android?

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.300
Video opens do not---it was documented methods
do not respond as documented.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.320
Could you make this priority?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320
I can't.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.450
I'm sure the browser team can.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:05.760
My question--my follow up questions to him
were, what version of Android are you on and

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.390
are you seeing it for example in the full
browser or in the web view?

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:15.080
I would say generally speaking, you'll probably
see the correct functionality in the browser

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:21.780
first and if it's not correct now, by all
means please let us know because the full

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.980
browser should be about as good as Chrome.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.440
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: With the Nexus 7 and only can
shift with the Chrome browser.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.060
So Android web browser development ongoing
is from the Chrome team.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.510
I imagine that it's what--confined with Chrome
and Android, but if it's not, then I'm sure

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:44.310
that's it's very important to them to ensure
that it is--Chrome is updated outside of the

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.430
Android cycles.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.540
So you can get an update for it at any point.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And Firefox.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.680
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And Firefox.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.690
Feedback actually that's very good point.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:57.340
If you are using the latest version of Chrome
for Android and you're seeing this issue.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.040
Please do find a bug.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.550
If you're using a previous version of Android
down unfortunately, you have to wait for a

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.780
few more firmware update until because for
Ice Cream Sandwich and then you can install

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.910
Chrome.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.039
Okay.

00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:19.280
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Yeah, in terms of--in terms of development
priorities going forward definitely at Chrome

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.390
on Android is where the activity is and the
pre-Chrome Android browser although also web

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.470
good browser is not going to get as much attention.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:38.080
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I've heard the Chrome is shipping
one of the new Motorola devices as part of

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.320
the Google Apps Week.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.160
SoÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Where on Earth did hear that?

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.200
[INDISTINCT] in the Motorola [INDISTINCT]
the other day.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.320
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah, the--that seems quite interesting
thing to see happened.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.330
Does that mean that future devices are going
to have it or it's a future statement.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:57.020
I know you guys can't comment, butÖ
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, that's an interesting thing.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.720
I don't know when other manufacturers launch,
try making new devices.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.920
Would that be replacing the any present model.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.130
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Okay.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:11.720
&gt;&gt; Well, the annoying thing the Galaxy Nexus
they didn't kill the [INDISTINCT] browser

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.290
same thing in Jelly Bean.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.510
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, Nexus 7 was the first device
to be Chrome memory.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:19.300
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, that's because it was upgrade
for Nexus, not a--yeah, Galaxy--sorry, Nexus

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.450
7, you know the first time out the box.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.740
We could do that, but we don't want to remove
an app from a user's phone because they just

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.000
stole an upgrade that would be a pretty bad
experience.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: [INDISTINCT] delete bookmarks
and everything.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.710
&gt;&gt; Well, but they can add the Google Chrome,
not to remove the browser, but to add the

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:34.710
new browser.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.280
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: That's what they did, yeah.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280
&gt;&gt; They had?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.280
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: If Chrome for Android is still
in beta or is it moved to a production release?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.430
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Let me see.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:51.520
The new--that was about [INDISTINCT] the web,
okay, [INDISTINCT]

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.100
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It says Chrome for mobile, it
doesnít say.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.230
&gt;&gt; It's very good.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Oh, got you.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.510
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:07.040
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, there's nothing.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.000
It's just this [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Cool.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.190
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.190
Yes.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.190
It's very good.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.190
Next question.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.190
Did you read that question?

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, I did.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.490
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Next question, the moderator, yes,
date picker dialog displays correctly in ICS

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:31.860
if Android themes set the Android Theme.Light,
but if it set to Android style/theme.NoTitleBar,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.250
date picker dialog displays as if in a previous
Android versions.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.000
I'm using DialogFragment and Support Live.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That sounds....

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.050
&gt;&gt; RHODE: There's not really a question there.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.550
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: That sounds like it's working
as intended to me.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:49.470
It appears Theme.Light if you're running on
ICS, [INDISTINCT] styling, if you want to

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.990
see the styling where is the theme.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.990
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: NoTitleBar.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.550
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: NoTitleBar, that's a pre-colored
style.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.119
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I wouldÖ
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So I would expect it to look pre-colored.

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:03.610
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'd say you need to go into yeah,
Theme.Holo.Light.NoTitleBar to get what you're

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.610
looking for.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:10.780
&gt;&gt;RHODE: Now, if I remember correctly and
I--I'm sure you guys know if you set a theme

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:15.660
with no title bar, then you lose your hollow
action bar, is that right?

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.900
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: I think so, yeah.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.900
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:18.910
&gt;&gt; RHODE: So don't do that.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.319
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Well maybe you want a full screen
gallery or something.

00:44:23.319 --> 00:44:25.730
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: It's still dialogue though, right?

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.730
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Or a dialogue, yeah.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.730
&gt;&gt; RHODE: It's fine.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:28.770
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, but look for Theme.Holo.Light.NoTitleBar.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.170
I believe it's there, I'm pretty sure.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.960
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, it's just be explicit about
wanting the hollow styling, if you would just

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.420
implicitly getting it by toggling theme.live
before.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:44.700
But the explicit value, and you all get the
expected result.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.381
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I don't know if it's just that I'm
a huge fan of hollow or if I'm lazy, but I

00:44:49.381 --> 00:44:51.540
never set styles on my applications.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.400
I mean, I let them system default all the
time.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.930
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: There's an interesting app in one
of the app review sessions that actually had

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.060
an auction in the overflow menu that allowed
you to change between hollow light and hollow

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.060
dark.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.520
That seems to be quite interesting.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.220
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Which the--oh, that was the--one
of the [INDISTINCT] ones that's recently looked

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.220
at.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.220
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.530
I mean, what are you guys feelings on that?

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.420
Do you like to see it, would you not like
to see it?

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.420
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Personally...

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.109
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: I'd like to be book readers.

00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:27.630
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah, I think there's such cases
where it's useful but I don't generally like

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.710
too many settings.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:35.350
The whole, just make it a setting thing is
a bit, you know, it's like techy, developer

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:36.350
got type people.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.830
We live it, like we love, you know, to tweet
a little notes and change everything.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:45.050
But if you ever watch real users use your
app and look at world on their face when they

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:50.940
see too many options then, I think it's a
good thing to minimize choice to go in sensible

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:51.940
default.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.970
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Sometimes it makes sense for widgets
as well because you don't know what kind of

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.460
cover background or wallpaper the users are
going to have.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.820
So it's quite nice to theme for widget.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.589
I often use the transparent ones or the darker
ones.

00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:05.790
Sometimes I switch it when I have a lighter
background, because it looks nicer.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:09.690
So be aware of, yeah, the context the application
is going to be shown in.

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Or another thing might be, if
you do have a settings page, consider breaking

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.490
out your settings in different--with common
core settings and the more advance section.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:21.440
Something like that so they're not completely
overwhelming for more casual users.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.440
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.820
Personally, for no settings quite possible.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.820
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.790
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, you should make the right
choices on their behalf.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:38.140
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I'm sort of--I've been a believer
for a number of years that offering an excess

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:46.460
of configurations and settings basically is
just abdicating a responsibility as a designer.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:54.080
And that the difference between a really good
system or app and a not so good one is when--is

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.780
when the designers really think things all
the way through and make the best decision

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.010
for most of the people.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:05.980
You know, it's just like you said, and excessively
flexible system is a chaotic one and just

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.400
leaves people looking bewildered.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.660
And you can look to, for example the major
competing desktop platforms and see which

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:20.560
one made the really, really detailed design
decisions and thought things all the way through

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.559
to the end and which ones just said, oh, let's
just make everything an option.

00:47:27.559 --> 00:47:32.560
We can support 17 different ways to shut down
the system because there's different users

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.450
for each one.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:37.260
And instead, it kind of makes nobody happy.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:42.090
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, and Android provides a lot
of facilities for taking that responsibility

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:43.090
away from the user.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:47.610
If you're going to be storing data in your
application, like the [INDISTINCT] decision,

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:52.240
whether you're storing it as cache or data,
locally or data on the SD card and let system

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.270
manage that cache.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:56.060
You need to scrub it if it needs to scrub
it maybe it'll disappear.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:00.100
But something like Google+ I've just checked
on my tablet is using 200 Megs in the cache

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.580
but only about five megs of its SD card data
outside of that.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.230
So if the--if it needs to be recovered, it
can and the app would still work properly.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:13.200
But what you don't want is a little slider
in the app saying how much data you want to

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.290
use as a setting.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:20.490
Just position the data correctly so the system
can deal with it.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.080
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.910
Are we out of questions?

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.110
Anybody, come hit us.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.770
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Didn't some say they were going
to stomp us with questions.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:34.070
&gt;&gt; Well it's not stated development questions,
it's more like from handling system itself.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:40.890
I went a bit--wanted to see the new version,
you know, the Galaxy started getting Jellybean.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.300
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yup.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:53.430
&gt;&gt; And doing the update for the Samsung "KS"
the computer shut it down by the update.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:49:00.380
And now the device is not really one thing
to tell on any ideas though I can get a--how

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.700
I get it backed up and running.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.700
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh no.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:07.760
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So you were flashing your device
through Samsung keys and the computer shutdown

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760
during the flash?

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: How?

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.420
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And it gets a bit later?

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, can you do--probably down
in power or anything.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:20.780
&gt;&gt; Well, I can get to download more data recovery
and to the [INDISTINCT] and others, so yeah.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:21.930
I can get to one of the...

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.680
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Can you connect it to fastboot?

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: So that would be sufficient for
communications and device.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.460
You can get to the boot later.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.490
So you should be able to just re-flash it
again, right?

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.510
&gt;&gt; No, because it came from the case, so I
don't have the actual one.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:38.140
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: No, but you can connect to the
keys in case you'll can be able to see it.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.140
&gt;&gt; I tried, the keys doesn't recognize the
phone.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.690
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh, dear.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:46.550
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Is that when it's in fastboot
or is it when it's on boot loader?

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.970
&gt;&gt; It's--when I turn it on, you know, it tries
to find the device.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.920
It only say loading thing but doesn't actually
find it.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.270
And in boot loader I see it, but the key doesn't
find it.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:01.640
You know, it do the, finds the other devices
and it sees it but not the...

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:05.470
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: In fastboot, you can reboot it
in the boot loader right?

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:11.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, on fastboot I can get to the boot
loader, but I need the actually one in order

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:12.369
to flash it.

00:50:12.369 --> 00:50:15.920
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: So keys doesn't see it from fastboot
or boot loader?

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.030
&gt;&gt; No.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:21.210
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: And you've tried doing a factory
reset, erase data, all that kind of thing?

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:26.280
&gt;&gt; I can't because it doesn't boot up to the--it
doesn't have an OS because it crashed on halfway

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.100
writing the new updates so there's nothing
to erase.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.040
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Have you been on fastboot?

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:39.130
Well I think, you know, the best thing I found--I
thought is to flash it, you know, to go to

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:42.849
Sam mobiles and download the ROM and then
try to flash it and then hope for the best.

00:50:42.849 --> 00:50:44.950
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Managing ROM for it?

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.850
&gt;&gt; Well I can try Sam engine mobile, so yeah.

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:49.059
That might work.

00:50:49.059 --> 00:50:51.190
&gt;&gt; RHODE: I've heard of that before.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:55.839
I mean I've heard of people using--is it clockwork,
is that the boot loader that...

00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:58.609
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Clockwork and tablet.

00:50:58.609 --> 00:51:00.690
&gt;&gt; RHODE: Non-samsung devices.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:04.110
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: If you can get it into odin mode,
keys should report it.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.690
If you have a chat with Samsung support they
should talk you through that because odin

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:11.470
makes their equipment to fastboot and it's
what keys talks to it using.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.800
So I need to practice [INDISTINCT] in a little
bit.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.580
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Either that or Google translate
and post in the forums.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.580
Thank you.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.210
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: It's a shame though.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:25.319
&gt;&gt; It's going to be a fun date.

00:51:25.319 --> 00:51:26.609
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Yeah.

00:51:26.609 --> 00:51:29.300
&gt;&gt; Well but it happens sometimes.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:34.452
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, I probably flash thirty-five
or six times a day.

00:51:34.452 --> 00:51:37.890
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: I always flash from the laptop.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:38.890
&gt;&gt; When?

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.140
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Plugged into the power with a full
battery charged.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.650
I know it's one of those things that everybody
says.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:48.170
Nobody really takes any notice, but I've seen
too many devices break to take the risk.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:53.610
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, the advantage over the
Nexus devices when you flash stop, it's much

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.540
easier to do it than any other devices.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:57.280
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yes, of course.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.830
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And ther are also factory images
quite widely available for the Galaxy Nexus

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:04.830
and next devices from Google.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:07.490
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Nexus.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.810
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.620
There's a lot of--it's very easy.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.500
It's basically one--it's like two commands
I think that flash and then off you go.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:21.620
I've got the [INDISTINCT] 10 on the Galaxy
Nexus and it's quite amazing what they did.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.270
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Good, what you mean?

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.430
Have you got any examples?

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.340
&gt;&gt; You know, the--again as I said, it's more
like for the geek stuff so there's a lot more

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.400
settings and...

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.470
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Relax.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:36.420
I could see Sparky sort of twinging at the
word more settings.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.090
I lot more settings.

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:46.140
But the advantage is it recognizes a lot more
APNs, you know, for mobile data and stuff

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.140
like that.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:51.150
So new mobile companies that started here
in Israel about two months ago and that have

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:56.100
been updated to the Android--to the Android
official OS.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:01.820
And also, you know, the--well it's not an
issue anymore but the Hebrew stuff also is

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.700
there so it's also an advantage.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:09.690
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: It also has an interesting SMS
reply thing using rich notifications, doesn't

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:10.690
it?

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:11.690
&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.183
It shows you and then you can press it.

00:53:14.183 --> 00:53:16.771
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: So you're rich notification tells
you about an SMS and you can use one of the

00:53:16.771 --> 00:53:22.460
buttons to get a dialog box and reply to that
SMS straight away without going into the SMS

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.460
app.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.460
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.270
And also it can actually see since the rich
notification--notifications, you can see the

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.070
message itself which is quite nice.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:31.530
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:36.130
&gt;&gt; And the Google now also which is very nice
thing to have.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.130
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.610
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: All right.

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.850
So if there's no more Android def questions,
maybe we'll wrap up five minutes early and

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.010
give your five minutes back in your day.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:49.820
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Kind of odd, I've seen announced
by Sony, a competition for the UK to develop

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.640
games for the 25,000 pound prize.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.960
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Oh.

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.620
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: So it's, apparently deadline for
submission is the end of October.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:06.360
I'll post the link in the--in the comments
for the--this hangout and maybe some people

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.010
will be able to write some cool games and
let's see what they come up with.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.750
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Richard Thomson just quickly asked
if he's still in, whether if anyone know about

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.920
updates for the IO edition galaxy tabs.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.490
The IO edition Galaxy tabs did get onto the
main update stream at some point and I believe

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.850
Samsung just haven't announced when they're
going to roll out the 3g updates yet.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:28.790
They're only doing the Wi-Fis so when they
do the updates for the 3g variants as well

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:29.790
and it's about the...

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:30.920
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Galaxy tab Wi-fi?

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.980
&gt;&gt; RHODE: They had announced updates for Galaxy
Tab 2, right?

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.980
Is that right?

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Galaxy Tab 1 doesn't get Jellybean.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.920
They said it's...

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.780
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: No, they already started rolling
the Galaxy Tab 1 Jellybean update up.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.200
Oh, Ice Cream Sandwich, sorry, update.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.740
We're still talking about the Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.530
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: yeah, they got [INDISTINCT] Jellybean
Update.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:50.400
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Galaxy Tab 2 got Jellybean Update.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.900
Because they had one, they announced the ICS
update for the Wi-Fi variant.

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.560
And none of my Galaxy Tabs have been updated
yet.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:02.270
But, hopefully they'll announce one for the
rest of the variants at some point.

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.130
&gt;&gt; What about the--I'm getting better at sending
the updates.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:09.070
If you look, for example on Jellybean, it's
been out for what, about two months, something

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.070
like that.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.480
And then they already have it on the Galaxy
S3, they're starting to have it on the Galaxy

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.480
S3.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.480
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Okay.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480
I'm really, really pleased to see that.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.950
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: The migration from Ice Cream Sandwich
to Jellybean I think is much easier for the

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.339
companies as well then it was from.

00:55:20.339 --> 00:55:22.320
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: And so in terms of applying Jellybean
Update, started shipping.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.980
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: And there is also the announcement
of IO about the PDK, the Platform Development

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:33.190
Kit which is shipping to big OEM's ahead of
an actual release so that they get a chance

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:36.200
to run up to speed before it hits--before
release gets out to the public.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.200
&gt;&gt; SUTTON: Just called to say.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.200
That would help the problem.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.200
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.260
Anything we can do to help those update cycles
[INDISTINCT] you know, that's great news.

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.260
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Okay.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:50.200
&gt;&gt; I remember between Gingerbread and ICS,
it was a very big time span between when Google

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.870
actually released it and when the devices
actually got it.

00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.160
&gt;&gt; HYNDMAN: Yeah, this was a massive update.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.180
The final incriminate release dates.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:02.040
All right everyone, thank you very much for
tuning in.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.099
Same time next week, hopefully from our studio.

00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:05.099
&gt;&gt; BUTCHER: Bye guys.

00:56:05.099 --> 00:56:06.099
&gt;&gt; SUTTON Thanks guys.

00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:06.102
&gt;&gt; RHODE: All right.
