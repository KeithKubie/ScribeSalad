but then myself and my teams would go

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900
but then myself and my teams would go
 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.500
but then myself and my teams would go
into companies and the very people that

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
into companies and the very people that
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.119
into companies and the very people that
hired us to come in and help them

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129
hired us to come in and help them
 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.920

innovate were the very people that were

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930
innovate were the very people that were
 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.720
innovate were the very people that were
holding us back from doing it when we

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730
holding us back from doing it when we
 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.640
holding us back from doing it when we
got there and I thought well you know

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650
got there and I thought well you know
 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.130
got there and I thought well you know
why and it was this whole idea of risk

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
why and it was this whole idea of risk
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.310
why and it was this whole idea of risk
fear power control risk aversion and I

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320
fear power control risk aversion and I
 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.800
fear power control risk aversion and I
started to ask everybody that I met a

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810
started to ask everybody that I met a
 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.230
started to ask everybody that I met a
very simple question to get at the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240
very simple question to get at the
 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.510
very simple question to get at the
problem of why people were not able to

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520
problem of why people were not able to
 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.310
problem of why people were not able to
innovate the way that they should

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
innovate the way that they should
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.790
innovate the way that they should
here was the question I asked them what

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800
here was the question I asked them what
 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.729
here was the question I asked them what
do you spend your day doing and you know

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739
do you spend your day doing and you know
 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.220
do you spend your day doing and you know
what the answer was I wasn't surprised

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230
what the answer was I wasn't surprised
 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.020
what the answer was I wasn't surprised
by the uniqueness of the answer I was

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030
by the uniqueness of the answer I was
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.000
by the uniqueness of the answer I was
surprised by the absolute consistency of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010
surprised by the absolute consistency of
 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.369

asked them what did they spend their day

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109
asked them what did they spend their day
 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.619

and emails now I believe that people get

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420
and emails now I believe that people get
 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.630

want to spend their day doing that they

want to work on work that matters so I

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
want to work on work that matters so I
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.999
want to work on work that matters so I
think that getting to work that is

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009
think that getting to work that is
 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.069

simpler and eliminating those

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079
simpler and eliminating those
 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.679
simpler and eliminating those
complexities or mundane tasks are not

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689
complexities or mundane tasks are not
 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.420
complexities or mundane tasks are not
just going to make people more

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430
just going to make people more
 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.490
just going to make people more
productive at work but they're gonna be

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500
productive at work but they're gonna be
 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.870
productive at work but they're gonna be
more satisfied they're gonna have a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880
more satisfied they're gonna have a
 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880
more satisfied they're gonna have a
sense of purpose and our businesses the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890
sense of purpose and our businesses the
 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.859
sense of purpose and our businesses the
results that we have there are going to

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869
results that we have there are going to
 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.719
results that we have there are going to
be dramatically better because of it

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729
be dramatically better because of it
 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.060
be dramatically better because of it
so what I did is I tried to come up with

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
so what I did is I tried to come up with
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.649
so what I did is I tried to come up with
a very succinct definition for

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659
a very succinct definition for
 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.179
a very succinct definition for
simplicity and I realize it's less of a

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
simplicity and I realize it's less of a
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.620
simplicity and I realize it's less of a
definition and more around guidelines

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630
definition and more around guidelines
 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.630
definition and more around guidelines
and I think there's four components to

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640
and I think there's four components to
 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.749
and I think there's four components to
simplicity the first is being as minimal

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759
simplicity the first is being as minimal
 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.109
simplicity the first is being as minimal
as possible second is understandable as

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
as possible second is understandable as
 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:50.859
as possible second is understandable as
possible

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869
possible
 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.950
possible
the third is repeatable as possible and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960
the third is repeatable as possible and
 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.459
the third is repeatable as possible and
the final is accessible as possible now

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469
the final is accessible as possible now
 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.139
the final is accessible as possible now
most people just think of the first part

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149
most people just think of the first part
 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.349
most people just think of the first part
minimal right making it less than and I

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359
minimal right making it less than and I
 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.849
minimal right making it less than and I
think that that's true but there's so

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859
think that that's true but there's so
 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.559
think that that's true but there's so
much more than just that being able to

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569
much more than just that being able to
 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.389
much more than just that being able to
minimize something get rid of parts

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399
minimize something get rid of parts
 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.430
minimize something get rid of parts
that's a good first step with simplicity

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440
that's a good first step with simplicity
 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.490
that's a good first step with simplicity
the second piece is understandable and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500
the second piece is understandable and
 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.550
the second piece is understandable and
that really gets to UM clarity we use so

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
that really gets to UM clarity we use so
 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.280
that really gets to UM clarity we use so
much jargon so many catchphrases

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
much jargon so many catchphrases
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.920
much jargon so many catchphrases
so many more words than we need to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
so many more words than we need to
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.869
so many more words than we need to
making it as understandable as possible

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879
making it as understandable as possible
 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.199
making it as understandable as possible
so we can get time back is key the next

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
so we can get time back is key the next
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.720
so we can get time back is key the next
thing is repeatable and repeatable is

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
thing is repeatable and repeatable is
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.949
thing is repeatable and repeatable is
important so we stopped making

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959
important so we stopped making
 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.009
important so we stopped making
everything so custom so one-off and it

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019
everything so custom so one-off and it
 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.899

also lets us leverage best practices

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909
also lets us leverage best practices
 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.000
also lets us leverage best practices
right you want teachers to make things

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
right you want teachers to make things

because that's about transparency when
 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.270

that's a real benefit when you look at

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670
that's a real benefit when you look at
 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.610
that's a real benefit when you look at
Google when they allowed everyone to use

better that's the benefit of making
 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.160
better that's the benefit of making
something accessible and simple so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
something accessible and simple so
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.809
something accessible and simple so
there's more than just making something

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819
there's more than just making something
 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.809
