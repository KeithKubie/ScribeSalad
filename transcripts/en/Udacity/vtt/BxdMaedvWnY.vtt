00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If his measured weight is 800 N at rest, that must be his true weight,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because at rest, the normal force is equal to the weight and so both are equal to 800 N.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If his target weight is 600 N, that's what he wants the scale to read.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's how hard he wants the scale to be pushing up on him that should be the normal force.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well, now we can do F=ma.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For F, we'll plug in where 800 is 200 bigger than 600, so we have an unbalanced force of 200 N.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
M is going to be 80 and that's because this 800 N. That's equal to m&lt;i&gt;g and g is 10.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If I divide both sides by 10, m is 80, so if 200=80&lt;i&gt;a. a=2.5 m/s².&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And how far will this elevator travel in 5 seconds if this is its acceleration?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Well, we can use this equation, which we know from unit 2.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We assumed it started from rest as soon as your velocity is 0.

00:00:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And that gives us a Δy of about 31 meters. Good job.
