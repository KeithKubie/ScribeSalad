00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 align:start position:0%
all right so let's say you have oriented
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.990 align:start position:0%
all right so let's say you have oriented
yourself<00:00:04.069><c> but</c><00:00:05.069><c> not</c><00:00:05.250><c> perfectly</c><00:00:05.819><c> because</c>
