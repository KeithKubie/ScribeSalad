00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:10.426
&gt;&gt;Alicia: I need my game master
to please retrieve a bin of blocks

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:14.976
and I need my supply master
to retrieve your supplies.

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:19.256
&gt;&gt;Constantly challenging kids in
the classroom affects learning,

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:20.776
depending on the challenge.

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:24.666
And I think at Quest, which is
something that really drew me

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.716
to Quest, and what we do really well,

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:29.686
is that in each class we
challenge them in different ways.

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:33.396
So they don't always know what to
expect, which is totally different

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:34.586
than the traditional classroom,

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:37.976
which I've never seen any
other school do, or do well.

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:41.946
&gt;&gt;My worthless turn.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.606
[ laughs ]

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:47.676
&gt;&gt;You could borrow mine.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:48.976
&gt;&gt;No, we're done,
we're done, we're done.

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:49.806
&gt;&gt;Angus, roll one more time.

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:51.846
&gt;&gt;Get a six, get a six!

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.176
&gt;&gt;Six.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:56.176
&gt;&gt;No, I think
I'm winning because I--

00:00:56.176 --> 00:00:56.976
&gt;&gt;Six is the bomb,Yaaww!

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.276
&gt;&gt;Alicia: Caterpillar
is a board game.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:04.326
It uses dice and it uses colored
blocks and you can play it

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:06.456
with either two, three
or four people.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.986
The goal is to create
the longest caterpillar,

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:13.666
but when you record the
dice rolls, you are looking

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.856
for something called the bomb.

00:01:14.996 --> 00:01:17.746
So the bomb is the most frequently
rolled number and as you play,

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:20.196
you figure out that the most
frequently rolled numbers are towards

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:22.096
the middle, so your five,
six, seven and eight.

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:27.826
And you try to build as
much around it as possible,

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:32.636
so you can get more blocks, but
in the end, if that number blows,

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:34.546
all of your caterpillar
pieces go with it.

00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:38.686
So it's using skill but
it's also using chance.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.046
&gt;&gt;Student: It depends who the
players are you're playing

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:44.696
with because some are really good
and some like, you know, are like me,

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:48.436
are like beginners, because I
usually don't win every round

00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:50.236
of Caterpillar that I play.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:53.366
I usually win like out of
five, only once or twice.

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.616
But yeah, it depends on the person.

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.636
It doesn't depend on the
game, but on the person.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.656
&gt;&gt;Alicia: When you have problems that
are just out of your reach in school

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:06.026
or in life, you learn how to roll
with the punches and figure out,

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:10.246
"Okay, I have this skill
set and I just learned this

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.146
from this past challenge, and now
this past challenge is solved,

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:14.806
but I have this other
challenge over here."

00:02:14.996 --> 00:02:19.026
And if it's constantly changing
and you have these skill sets

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.446
that are also adapting and changing
with you, giving them things

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:24.996
that are just out of
their reach requires them

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:28.656
to build that like mental muscle.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:32.636
It strengthens something, whether
it's your mind or physically,

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:37.206
and if we gave them challenges
that just met where they are,

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:40.466
their toolbox, their mental
toolbox would never grow.

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:42.946
&gt;&gt;Student: It's also fun
building out your caterpillar

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.536
and seeing how much land you
can like preserve for yourself.

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:50.266
Like I always enjoy conquering
the most land and feeling

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:52.026
that I've really accomplished
something.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:55.486
&gt;&gt;Alicia: I can't speak for any
other discipline but I know in math,

00:02:56.566 --> 00:03:02.076
it's allowed me to see really quickly
and easily where my students are

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:04.596
and what their weaknesses are
and what their strengths are

00:03:04.596 --> 00:03:10.206
and what they're being asked to
do and, a lot of times you fail

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:11.926
at giving them the
right challenge problem.

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.396
And it's through that failure
that you learn how to adjust

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.496
and you learn what
you're looking for.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Without challenge,
it would just be like,

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:23.676
in a game for example, it would just
be like, it doesn't really matter

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:25.446
who wins and it won't be as fun.

00:03:25.446 --> 00:03:29.806
&gt;&gt;Student: Caterpillar is fun to
play because the game is challenging

00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:33.496
and you want to have the
longest caterpillar at the end

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.196
of the game, after the bomb explodes.

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:38.566
&gt;&gt;Student: It's always about what
one number will be rolled the most

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:41.386
and which one will be the bomb
and getting away from that area

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:44.846
and getting to an area that will also
be rolled a lot, but not as much.

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:48.206
&gt;&gt;Alicia: The toughest part of
teaching and of doing anything

00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:51.676
where you want anybody to learn, it's
about knowing where your students are

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:55.016
and knowing what their
limits are at the moment,

00:03:55.016 --> 00:03:56.976
and stretching that limitation.

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.506
Because I don't care what end
of the spectrum you're on.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:02.756
I don't care if you know
everything in middle school math,

00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.326
I can find something
to challenge you.

00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:06.966
And I promise you I will,
and it will be tough.
