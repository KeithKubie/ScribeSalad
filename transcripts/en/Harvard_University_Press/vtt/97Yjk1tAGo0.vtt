When we started talking about the Emily Dickinson
Archive, we wanted fans of Dickinson's poetry

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.809
to really see the original manuscripts. There's
something about the handwriting, and the energy,

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.350
that I think conveys to people some of that
passion that she felt. The Emily Dickinson

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.830
Archive will be truly Open Access: no fees
are paid for access to this material. Unlike

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.840
most authors, she did not publish in her own
lifetime. And so, for Dickinson in particular,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.980
to be able to see the manuscripts as she wrote
them is very important. So we're very excited

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.410
about developing new tools to take advantage
of new digital technologies. In addition to

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.739
just having the image of the manuscript, we
have transcriptions that various editors have

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.899
worked on. And so you'll be able to see how
her poetry was presented to her public over

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.140
time. You'll be able to look up a word that
she used, and the context in which she used

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.020
it, and then look at how that word was defined
in her dictionary. A scholar will be able

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.530
to look at all of the variations; make their
own transcription; put notes next to it; and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.409
then save that all in their own workspace.
So there's a nice interrelationship between

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.549
all of these tools within EDA. What I hope
will come out of the Emily Dickinson Archive

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.549
is something that's really a new model for
how we approach making manuscripts and scholarship

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.869
available in an Open Access website.
