00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.856
- [Voiceover] I have an
interesting set up over here.

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.136
I have a magnetic field that is constant,

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:11.136
and it's going straight out
of the surface of this loop.

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.817
The magnitude of the magnetic field

00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:19.817
at any point of the
surface is going to be 'B'.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:23.782
What's interesting here
is this loop that we have,

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:25.838
This right part of the loop is movable.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:27.358
You can imagine it's a cylinder

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:29.613
that can roll to the right,

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.235
and the magnitude of it's velocity,

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.645
we're going to say is lowercase 'v'.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.830
And this cylinder, lets
say it has length 'L'

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.687
Given that, you can see that we're going

00:00:39.687 --> 00:00:41.847
to have a change in magnetic flux.

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:44.052
Why are we gonna have a
change in magnetic flux,

00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:46.235
or a change in magnetic
flux through the surface?

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:51.235
Well if this thing is moving to the right,

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:53.572
when it's speed is 'v'

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:54.945
it can be any units, meters per second,

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.170
or whatever it is.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.926
Even though the magnetic field itself is

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.734
constant, you're actually
going to be changing the area,

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:04.404
the area that is, I guess
you could, contained by

00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:06.563
this loop, and so that is going to

00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:08.073
give us a change in flux

00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:09.582
And if you have a change in flux that is

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:14.582
going to induce an electromotive force,

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:18.405
or it's going to induce
a voltage in this loop

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.083
which will cause a current to flow.

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:23.522
Let's think about what
that electromotive force

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.603
that's going to be induced is going to be.

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:28.552
I'm just gonna rewrite
Faraday's law right over here.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:31.053
Faradays law: negative 'N' times

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:35.378
our change in flux, and we're talking

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:40.168
about our change in flux over change in,

00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:41.689
let me write that a little bit neater,

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.689
our change in flux over change in time.

00:01:49.627 --> 00:01:53.365
The 'N' is the number of
loops we're talking about.

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:56.082
So in this case, 'N'
is just going to be one

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.958
and the negative, I've already complained

00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.774
a little bit about in previous videos.

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.654
This is really just reminding us

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.996
the math, when you're not using
proper vector mathematics,

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:08.628
this just reminds us that this 'Emf'

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.796
is going to cause a current
to go through this loop,

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:14.100
and the magnetic field that is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.840
induced by that current will
go against the direction

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840
of our change in flux. That's
just something to remind us.

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:26.197
What we really care about is

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:29.447
our change in flux over change in time.

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:30.701
What is that going to be?

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:31.630
Let me just write it here,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.630
our change in flux over change in time.

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:39.664
Our change in flux in this case

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.243
is going to be our change in

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:44.442
our, the magnitude of our magnetic field

00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.142
that is going perpendicular to the surface

00:02:46.142 --> 00:02:50.182
times the area of our surface

00:02:50.182 --> 00:02:54.013
over our change in time.

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:55.430
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.355
'B' is constant, it's not going to change

00:02:58.355 --> 00:02:59.679
over the time that we care about.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.304
So the change in 'B' times 'A'

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:05.896
is really going to be 'B'
times our change in area.

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:10.896
'B' times our change in area
over how much time goes by.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.028
So what is our change in area going to be?

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:19.028
Let's say we let delta 't' ,
let's say delta 't' happens,

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.943
what is going to be our change in area?

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:24.796
Let's let delta 't' go on.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.490
If delta 't' goes on, this cylinder,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.731
or if we wait for 't' units of time,

00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:34.711
or if 't' units of time go by,

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:39.711
let me do this in another color,

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:45.446
I'm gonna use this color right over here.

00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:48.781
How far will we go after delta 't'?

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:50.226
We know the magnitude of our velocity

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:52.682
if you multiply the
magnitude of your velocity

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:54.429
times your change in time,

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:58.655
that will give you your distance.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.095
Your change in area is going to be

00:04:00.095 --> 00:04:02.270
the amount of distance it's travelled

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.270
times the length of the
rod, which is just that.

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:12.726
Our change in area, which is
that area right over there,

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:17.039
our change in area over that time

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.825
is going to be the distance this rod goes.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:22.170
Notice this rod is going in a direction

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.002
that is perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic field

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:28.463
that's an important thing to realize.

00:04:28.463 --> 00:04:31.533
We have our change in area is going to be

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:36.468
this dimension which is
how far the rod travels

00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:40.397
times the length of the rod,
that's how much area we gain,

00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:42.812
that's how much our area increases,

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:47.758
times the length of the rod,
that's our change in area.

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:50.503
We can substitute that back over here.

00:04:50.503 --> 00:04:55.503
This is going to be equal to,

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.624
we got our 'B', we have
our change in time,

00:04:58.624 --> 00:05:02.734
and our change in area we
just said is going to be,

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:03.709
Let me just write it this way,

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.774
I could write is as the length of our rod

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:10.048
times the magnitude of
our velocity, or our speed

00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:12.824
times our change in time.

00:05:12.824 --> 00:05:15.226
Well, change in time
divided by change in time,

00:05:15.226 --> 00:05:20.226
those cancel out. Our change
in flux over that time

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.263
or our average rate of change in flux

00:05:24.263 --> 00:05:28.768
we see simplifies to the length of our rod

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:31.304
times the magnitude of our velocity,

00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:35.548
or our speed, times the
magnitude of the magnetic field

00:05:35.548 --> 00:05:38.706
that is going perpendicular
to the surface.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:41.306
This is something that
you will see many times

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:44.116
in your physics class,
this whole notion of

00:05:44.116 --> 00:05:46.711
if your rod going in a
perpendicular direction

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.615
to a magnetic field, it induces

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:51.494
an electromotive force of 'LvB'

00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:52.539
This is where it's coming from,

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.604
it's coming directly from Faraday's law.

00:05:55.604 --> 00:05:57.810
You can say, okay, if that's happening,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.810
what direction is the current
going to actually flow in?

00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:06.408
If the magnetic field isn't changing,

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.015
but since the area is increasing,

00:06:08.015 --> 00:06:12.357
the flux is increasing
in the upward direction.

00:06:12.357 --> 00:06:14.238
You can say the flux is
increasing in that direction.

00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:15.817
The current that gets induced,

00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:17.442
and the magnitude of the
current is going to be,

00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:19.642
based on how much resistance we have,

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:22.916
but the current is going
to induce a magnetic field

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:27.630
that goes against our change in flux.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.630
Let's see, if the current went
that way, what will happen?

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:39.133
I'm going to take my right hand out,

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.213
put my thumb in that direction,

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:45.392
and if I were to loop my fingers around,

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:49.043
this would, if we went that
way, this would describe,

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.738
this would induce a magnetic field

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:54.569
that goes like this.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.030
That actually would enhance

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.004
the flux going through
the, or change in flux,

00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:00.931
going the same direction
of the change in flux,

00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:02.185
We've already talked about this,

00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:04.600
would violate the law of
conservation of energy.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600
The current's gonna go
in the other direction.

00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:14.166
It's gonna go, in this case
is going to go clockwise,

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.395
because the current is going
to induce a magnetic field.

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:18.322
Once again, I could
take my right hand out,

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:21.596
and try to draw my right hand,

00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:22.804
and we can see now, the direction

00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:25.631
my fingers go in are that way.

00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:27.656
Notice we're looking at
the inside of the surface,

00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:31.830
the surface area was increasing the flux

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:35.365
in the upward direction, getting more

00:07:35.365 --> 00:07:38.276
of the magnetic field
in the upward direction,

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:39.907
being contained in the area.

00:07:39.907 --> 00:07:43.854
The magnetic field induced by
the current that is induced,

00:07:43.854 --> 00:07:46.269
or that current that's being caused

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:49.537
by the electromotive
force and the magnitude of

00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:51.232
the force is going to be
dependent on our resistance,

00:07:51.232 --> 00:07:52.788
that's going to go in the other direction,

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.073
it's going to go down that way.

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:56.735
Or it's going to induce a magnetic field

00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:58.709
that is gonna go downwards.

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:00.709
So the current needs
to be going clockwise.
