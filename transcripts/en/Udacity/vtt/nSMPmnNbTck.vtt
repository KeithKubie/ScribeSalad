00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.610
Let's get our feet wet and apply this
concept to an app mock screen by making

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.110
it more material with some surfaces.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.390
The goal of this app,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.560
Walk In, was to replace those
buzzers you receive at restaurants.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.120
Instead of sticking within a short
range, you could scan a QR code,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.860
get on the list, then go off and

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.940
do whatever you wanted until you were
notified that your table is ready.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.170
It was one of those apps
I developed back in 2011.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.980
You can call it a bit vintage,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.490
back when Android specific
design hadn't taken off yet.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.450
So how will we use surfaces to
make this screen more material?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.500
The image and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.170
the restaurant information are related
so they should be on their own surface.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.230
The items in the queue are also related,
that's another surface.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.465
The last surface is
the button bar down here.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.880
It'll be replaced for other reasons,
but for the purpose of this exercise,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.410
it also should be a surface.
