00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.990
On the odd occasion that I do remember my
dreams,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.910
quite often I have a dream where I'm back
in space.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.740
I'm floating down one of the very long Mir
modules

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.710
I'll be going past at this nice, slow
rate.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.780
Really sedate.
And then there's a window approaching,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.079
and as I look out and see the earth,
with some blue sea and brilliant white clouds,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.289
and the curvature of the earth,
my eyes are used to the bright lights inside

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.469
the space station
so I don't see the stars

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.949
it just looks black on top.
Then, floating the opposite direction, coming

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.710
to join me
is first Sergei, and then my other crewmates

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.809
who were up there.
We just stay around this window.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.119
Together, we don't say anything in my dream,
we're just there. I can hear them breathing,

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.450
and I can feel their warmth because we're
really quite close to each other,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.610
and we're all just looking out of the window.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.800
Everybody talks about how beautiful the earth looks.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.579
I always felt in a strange way at once disconnected

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.479
and connected
to the earth, because I really didn't feel

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.430
like I was part of it anymore.
I was looking back at the earth.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.240
And yet, I knew that was my home.
That was where I wanted to return.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.360
I absolutely wanted to go back.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.460
Astronauts just look out and see the physical geography.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.840
We talk about the countries that we can see,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.759
and of course you're seeing them in different
orientations.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.530
Then, after a day or two, you stop talking
about that,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.520
and you start to talk about the things that
you're missing on earth.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.680
It's all to do with the people you remember
back on earth.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.770
Our families, our friends, and when we go
over countries

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.379
we don't think about the geography below us,
we think about the people that are there,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.799
and hopefully future meetings with them.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.120
How does that dream end?

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.129
Usually I gently wake up, and I'm always very
disappointed

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.390
because I wanted to be back in space!
