00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.488
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920
We live in an
increasingly cynical age

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.950
where romantic love
has been distilled

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.500
into algorithms of data.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.440
Where love is reduced to nothing
more than the neurotransmitter,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.240
dopamine.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.920
Biochemically, no different
than an addiction to cocaine.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.020
Imagine that, right?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.910
The romantic passion of the
lover, reduced to a coke head

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.365
on a coke binge.

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.900
There's something kind of
cynical about this resignation,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.650
about letting go of
that ecstasy of love

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.250
that inspired the
Romeo and Juliet story.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.315
The archetype of finding
"The One", that is as God.

00:00:57.315 --> 00:01:01.060
These encounters with
these divine beings.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.290
To put the lover on a
pedestal and lose oneself

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.880
in an ecstatic sexual worship.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.375
A stage-managed
resurrection, an apotheosis.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:12.500
I mean, that's the kind of
love that I still crave.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.215
That's why we still
go to the movies,

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:16.200
and we're moved to
tears by moments

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.910
of tenderness and beauty.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.610
Those in-between times.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.330
You know, those
moments of pillow talk.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.190
An inter-subjectivity.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.640
Those moments of the happy/sad,
where your lover looks at you,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.240
and you look at
them, and you see

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.259
yourself being seen by them.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.300
These moments, these
exchanges, these intimacies,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.190
these moments of
consummation, I think

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.445
they still live in the back
of our psyches, hinting,

00:01:38.445 --> 00:01:41.480
hinting at greater,
greater intimacies.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.990
And greater exchanges, and
deeper, higher fidelities

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.770
of nuance and intimacy
with the other.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.020
And that promise, I
think, keeps us searching,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.420
and keeps us chronically
dissatisfied.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.023
We will not settle.

00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:58.670
We will not let go of
that romantic dream,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.640
of that moment, those
goosebumps, that tenderness.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.580
Hey guys be sure to check out
"The Dictionary of Obscure

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.880
Sorrows", which is literally a
compendium of words we've never

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.210
heard before, used to describe
elusive feelings that we

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.480
can barely ever articulate,
but we will surely recognize.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.370
Check it out.
