00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This type of diagram--called a slope field--helps to understand why everything is determined

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
once we fix a certain initial amount of fish in this case.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The general term would be initial value.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These arrows point in the direction in which our solution curve has to run at every point in time

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and every amount fish we could draw such an arrow.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This arrow specifies the rate of change.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here the rate of change is slightly positive. Here it's approximately zero.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here it's slightly negative and here it is really hugely negative.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
To see what this system is doing, we simply follow these arrows or take this one here as an initial value.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We first have to go down and then move from between here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Once you have specified the initial condition to initial value in this case the initial amount of fish,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you can trace out such a solution curve that describes the dependency of the amount of fish

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
on time or whatever your differential equation is about.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There is such a solution curve and there is no second solution curve. This would not work.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is what mathematicians mean when they speak of existence and uniqueness of the solution.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Once you specified the initial condition, there is a solution curve and there is only one solution curve.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Well, unless I have to say first thing that may happen is that the solution escapes infinity

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in finite time then we don't know how to continue afterward or the solution may fall into a hole

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of the definition set of our equations.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
For instance imagine that we are simulating a machine and we do not have any idea about

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
what's happening to the machine in this region then we can't continue either.

00:01:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The following quiz shows that this escape to infinity in finite time can happen easily.
