00:00:00.193 --> 00:00:01.515
- [Voiceover] Alright,
now let's tackle part c.

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:04.947
Use quantitative reasoning,
including equations as needed,

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:06.571
to develop an expression

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.882
for the new final position of the block.

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:12.027
Express your answer in terms of D.

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:15.546
Alright, I'm gonna set up a
little table here for part c.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.273
Oops, sorry about that.

00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:19.851
Sometimes my pen is not
functioning properly.

00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.187
Alright so part c.

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:24.002
Let me set up two scenarios.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.318
So I have scenario one.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:32.318
Scenario one, where we
compress the spring,

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:34.804
our delta x is equal to d,

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.702
and then we have scenario two,

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:42.702
scenario two, where we
compress the spring by

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.737
twice as much, is equal to two d,

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:48.089
and let me set up my table now,

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.089
so, just like that and like this,

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:54.772
and let's just think about a few things.

00:00:54.772 --> 00:00:56.821
So the first thing I wanna think about is

00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.821
the potential energy,
so the potential energy

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:04.821
when the spring is compressed.

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:09.821
So potential energy
when spring compressed.

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:19.870
When, I'll just write
compressed, when compressed.

00:01:20.972 --> 00:01:24.555
Well in this scenario I'll
call it the potential energy

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.230
for scenario one, it's
equal to one half times

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.264
the spring constant, times how
much we compress it squared.

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:34.163
Now what about scenario two?

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:37.702
This potential energy
is going to be equal to

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:41.246
one half times the spring
constant, times how much

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.446
we compress it, it's now
twice as much, squared,

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:47.758
well this is equal to one half
times the spring constant,

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:51.703
times four d squared,

00:01:52.743 --> 00:01:53.889
and I can out the four up front,

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.854
this is equal to four times
one half, four times one half,

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:03.655
times our spring
constant, times d squared,

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:06.888
which is equal to four
times the potential energy

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:09.904
when we just compress the spring by d.

00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:11.772
So we already see a little
bit of what we talked about

00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:14.888
in part b, you compress
your spring twice as much,

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:18.172
you're going to have four
times the potential energy,

00:02:18.172 --> 00:02:20.551
because the potential energy
doesn't grow proportionately

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.004
with how much you compress
it, it grows with the square

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.855
of how much you compress it.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.738
Alright, now let's think
about kinetic energy

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.546
Kinetic energy when x is equal to zero,

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.696
so right when the spring,
when we lose contact

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:46.447
with the spring, the
spring is no longer pushing

00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:50.114
on the block, well our
kinetic energy is going to be

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:53.647
equal to what our potential
energy was when the spring

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:55.982
was actually compressed.

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.447
Another way of thinking about
it, all that potential energy

00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:00.914
has now been turned into kinetic energy.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.531
Now what about over here?

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.381
Well, the kinetic energy in this scenario,

00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.349
like we just saw before,
that's gonna be equal to the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.169
potential energy when the
spring was compressed.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.682
All of that potential energy
gets turned into kinetic energy

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:17.284
and this is equal to four
times u one, four times

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:19.725
the potential energy in
scenario one, which is the same

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:23.482
thing as four times, which
is equal to four times

00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:26.060
the kinetic energy in scenario one.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.373
So we have four times the kinetic energy.

00:03:28.373 --> 00:03:33.164
Four times kinetic energy,
kinetic, kinetic energy.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:41.435
So then we have stopping
distance, stopping,

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:46.137
stopping distance.

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.862
We know here this is three d and we know,

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.829
and then we can say "What's
this?", this question mark.

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.148
Well let's just think a
little bit about this.

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:59.914
We know that if we have
that kinetic energy

00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:01.692
at x equals zero,

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:06.575
so we know that k one plus
the work done by friction,

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:10.834
so let me make it clear,
this right over here,

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:15.118
that is work done by friction,
work done by friction,

00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.785
and it's gonna be negative work
cause the force of friction

00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:23.986
is acting in the direction
opposite of the change in x,

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:29.202
so the kinetic energy plus
the work done by friction

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.084
is going to be equal to zero.

00:04:32.084 --> 00:04:35.293
This work cancels out all of this energy.

00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:38.569
When we think about it, it's
turning it all into heat.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.120
And so let's think about what
the work done by friction

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.335
is equal to.

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:46.851
Well the work done by friction
is equal to, is equal to,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.536
the coefficient of friction
times the mass of the block,

00:04:53.536 --> 00:04:58.018
times the gravitational
field, times how far,

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.253
over what distance that
force, this right over here

00:05:03.253 --> 00:05:05.600
is the force of friction,
times over what distance

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.260
that force was applied, so times three d.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.428
And to be clear, this force is going in

00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:16.078
the opposite direction of our change in x,

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:20.486
so because of that this
will be a negative,

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:25.034
and so we can say, we can
say that the kinetic energy

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.445
at x equals zero, and now I
can just write it as minus

00:05:30.445 --> 00:05:33.761
mu, the coefficient of
friction, times mass, times

00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:38.515
the gravitational field, times
three d is equal to zero.

00:05:38.515 --> 00:05:41.053
We can add this to both
sides and we can get

00:05:41.053 --> 00:05:45.806
k one is equal to mu times
m times g times three d,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.902
and if you wanted to
solve for distance here,

00:05:49.902 --> 00:05:53.366
you can divide both sides
by the force of friction.

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:56.684
So divide both sides by mu
times m times g, and you get

00:05:56.684 --> 00:05:58.984
three d, and I'm just
swapping the sides here,

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:02.368
is going to be equal to the
amount of kinetic energy we have

00:06:02.368 --> 00:06:06.866
right as x equals zero,
divided by mu times m times g

00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:11.840
and you can just view this
as the force of friction.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.333
The force, I'll just call it

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.602
the force of friction right over there.

00:06:16.602 --> 00:06:18.518
So if you wanna figure
out your stopping distance

00:06:18.518 --> 00:06:20.268
you just figure out your kinetic energy,

00:06:20.268 --> 00:06:23.082
right when you, right at x equals zero,

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:26.365
right when you start entering
into the frictiony part of

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:29.402
your platform and then you divide that by

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:31.226
the force of friction,
and that will give you

00:06:31.226 --> 00:06:32.685
your distance traveled.

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:37.000
So the distance here, distance,
so I can just put some

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:42.350
arrows right over here,
our distance is going to be

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.632
equal to k two divided by the force of,

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.809
the force of friction.

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.050
Well k two is equal to four times k one,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.420
is equal to four times k one.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.854
and our force of friction
is going to be the same

00:06:59.854 --> 00:07:01.755
We have the same coefficient of friction,

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.737
we have the same mass, we have the same

00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:07.937
gravitational field, so
divided by force of friction,

00:07:07.937 --> 00:07:12.303
and this we already know, k one
divided by force of friction

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:19.838
is equal to three d, so this
is all going to be equal to

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:24.534
four, this is going to
be four times three d,

00:07:26.074 --> 00:07:30.814
three d, which is equal to 12 d, 12 d.

00:07:31.807 --> 00:07:34.156
So this is all a
mathematical way of saying

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:36.776
you compress it twice as
much, you're going to have

00:07:36.776 --> 00:07:38.687
four times the potential energy when your

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:40.822
spring is compressed, which
means you're going to have

00:07:40.822 --> 00:07:44.139
four times the kinetic
energy at x equals zero,

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.705
which means it is going to
take, you're going to have

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:49.622
four times the stopping
distance, so instead of stopping

00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:53.822
at three d or in six d as
what the student proposed,

00:07:53.822 --> 00:07:58.822
you are now stopping at 12 d, so that is

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.406
our stopping distance.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:03.838
Did we answer all of, yeah
we answered all of part c.

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:06.572
Use quantitative reasoning,
including equations as needed,

00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:08.906
to develop an expression
for the new final position

00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:09.621
of the block.

00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:12.755
Express your answer in terms of d.

00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:15.068
Yep, feel good about that.
