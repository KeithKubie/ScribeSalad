00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.450
In our last lesson, we discussed various psychological disorders and in this

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.808
lesson we're going to discuss the treatment of those disorders. Now, the bottom

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.752
line is that there many effective treatments for all sorts of psychological

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:11.945
disorders.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.983
&gt;&gt; That's right, and we're going to break this lesson up into three broad areas,

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:18.413
and that includes biological treatments, psychological treatments and combined

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:23.218
treatments. I am going to be discussing the biological treatments. And those

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:27.095
include drug therapy, psychosurgery, and electric and magnetic therapies.

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.852
&gt;&gt; And I'll be discussing the psychological therapies. Which include

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:35.760
psychoanalytic therapy, humanistic positive therapy. Behavioral therapy.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.885
Cognitive behavioral therapy, and group therapies.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:43.078
&gt;&gt; And finally I will be discussing combined therapies. And combined therapies are

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:46.886
when we combine drugs and psychotherapy, integrative therapies, as well as when

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:52.096
we combine mindfulness in psychotherapy. So without further ado let's begin this

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:56.395
last lesson in psychology beginning with the biological treatments. Susan.

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:57.877
&gt;&gt; Alright let's get started.
