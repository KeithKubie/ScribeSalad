1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,201
Hey,

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:05,250
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich
and we are talking on radio lab about

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,540
things stochastic like going
flips in lottery tickets.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,210
Let's just push this whole argument
another step forward if we may,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,260
which mean let's talk about human
beings. Would it surprise you Jen,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,110
if I told you that on the
subject of predictability,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,000
humans and coins are kind of similar.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,620
It wouldn't surprise me
because I wouldn't believe it.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,120
You wouldn't believe it if I made
you an argument. So powerful.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,380
So phishing that you will be falling
back on your buck in surprise and staring

11
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:35,870
at me with a kind of simple admiration
that you rarely have because here it is.

12
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,490
It is. I'm going to talk to you
about basketball, basketball.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,100
That is a sport where people have a,
what do you know about basketball?

14
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,560
I need basketball is a game of skill.

15
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:47,430
Don't even try and pretend is like
random forces like coin flip. Nope, nope,

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,950
nope. Let me make you an argument.
Let me make you an argument.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,170
Let's just take to make
it really interesting.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,130
The most skilled basketball
team ever. For example,

19
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,320
you could take a look at the 82 to 83 76

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,890
no, Philadelphia, 76 years.
Maurice Cheeks. Quiet.

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,470
No regular on our show. It's
one of the best NBA teams home.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,920
All the cheat sheets.

23
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,860
The doctor Jake's whooping
underneath putting it up in here. So,

24
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,600
so during the playoff, isn't it the
76 or it was all incredibly hot.

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,651
Take my man, Andrew,

26
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:22,651
Tony during this run he
was eating sometimes Andrew
tooney would make five shots

27
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,500
in a row. He would be
considered hot. That's the deal.

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,180
Angela hits his mark once. It's his
mark twice. It doesn't like three times.

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,700
Now I'm going to pass them
cause he's obviously hot.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,360
The basket looks to him that it's the
size of a soccer goal. He's golden.

31
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,070
He's got the gods on his.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,200
We're talking about them. We're,

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,310
because in this situation you'd have
to agree to the Andrew. Tony was hot,

34
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:49,780
right? Yes, that's the word. So what
exactly do you mean when you say hot?

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,980
Why are you asking me? [inaudible] he's,
he's making a bunch of shots in a row.

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,050
And if you're on his team and
you're coming down the court,

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,140
you pass the ball to Andrew because he's
on a roll with the fan assumes is that

38
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,630
after five shots you'd be more
likely to make a six shot.

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,380
That to me just seems
like like a common sense.

40
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,150
If he's waking lots of buckets,

41
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:09,520
of course you're going to pass the
to if did the players assume this?

42
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:10,354
Obviously if they're going to pay.

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,530
The players all believe this coaches
believed this too. The coaches believe it,

44
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:16,570
so it actually dictates
the plays they call.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
Everyone assumes it to be true that the
hot end is a real thing and dictates the

46
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:25,090
flow of basketball games. Thank you
Jenna Bat, the hot hand doesn't exist.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,401
You could just get,

48
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:33,190
you just went through this whole rigmarole
about the six years being hot. Yeah.

49
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,390
While they were a great team,

50
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,440
but a lot of scientists have looked at
this question of hotness and sports and

51
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,440
in fact there's a couple of scientists
who actually looked at all the maid shots

52
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,900
and the Ms Shots of this
76 [inaudible] team.

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,610
And when they looked directly at the
numbers, emotions aside, just the data,

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,970
here's what they found. At the very
moment you think you're hottest,

55
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,570
you're actually freezing cold.
Wait, that can't be right.

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,010
Some of these percentages are
pretty damning. Take Andrew. Johnny.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,060
During the regular season,
Tony made 46% of his shot,

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
46% after hitting three shots in a
row, which means he's in the zone.

59
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,980
He's totally there.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,400
His field goal percentage drops
to 34% so that is what I'm saying.

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,650
That's what I'm telling
you Jenn at boom red.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,120
And the reason seems to be is that Andrew
knows he's hot or he thinks he's hot,

63
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,510
so he's taking less responsible
shots. He's taking, you know,

64
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,260
the three-point jumper from way beyond
the art and he assumes his streak will

65
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,094
somehow save him.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Cannot be because Johnny UFCU,
you've been the basketball games.

67
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,180
You see what happens, guy makes three
shots in a row. The crowd gets up.

68
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,900
Suddenly there's an electricity in the
air. Every time the guy gets the ball,

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,880
everyone stands up and anticipation.

70
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,430
You're telling me that's all a
figment of our collective imagination.

71
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,540
It is a figment of our
collective imaginations and it's,

72
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,840
and it's especially a figment of the
way we kind of calculate streaks.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,540
The reason Andrew seems so
hot is because he makes three.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,730
This is the fourth makes the fifth.

75
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,890
This is the sixth makes the seventh
and eighth. It's really rewrite

76
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,160
that essentially random process. This,
this mixture of makes and misses.

77
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,850
We rewrite it in terms of, oh, it's
a street. Once we think he's hot,

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,150
we tend to edit what actually happens
to kind of preserve that sense of the

79
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,250
street. Ah, okay. Don't believe Jonah.

80
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,240
What about Jay Kohler, our statistician
from, uh, Arizona state DV.

81
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,560
I've listened to him. No
reason to think even if,

82
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,710
whether he missed seven in a row or made
seven or o or made three of his last

83
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:28,290
four, I don't really care.
I know that he's a machine.

84
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,860
He's like a 52% shooting machine or
whatever his number is. No, but he's,

85
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,640
and he's a, he's not a machine though.
He's sleazy. He's like person with,

86
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:39,030
with uh, with confidence that ebbs
and flows. There's a different,

87
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:41,550
there's got to be a difference
there. I agree with you. You,

88
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:45,470
you've just described the psychological
theory that makes the hot hand beliefs

89
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:48,780
so compelling and so hard
to get rid of with data,

90
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,140
but it just doesn't matter whether
the player made three or miss three,

91
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:54,150
their probability of
making that fourth shot,

92
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:58,140
that next one is pretty
much the same. This is very,

93
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,310
very depressing.

94
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,620
Essentially what you're saying is that
basketball players are like coins. Coins.

95
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,573
Yes.

96
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,540
[inaudible]

97
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,530
the fact is, Jed,

98
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:17,531
you are Koby Bryant even is more like
a coin than any of us had neared to

99
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:22,610
imagine. Colby now has a
pattern. In his case it's what,

100
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:27,320
50 60 40 on any given night with
Kirby, you think, oh, this is,

101
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,154
he's back.

102
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,290
Tyco always doing because he's just
having another night of his very 60,

103
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,950
40 life. And that's just the way it
plays out. Even on a shot by shot basis,

104
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:41,690
you're saying, yeah, each shot seems
to be kind of a random event. Exactly.

105
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,710
Are you, are you willing to concede
this statistically this is not yet.

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,370
It's so counterintuitive. It,
I still as a basketball fan,

107
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:53,450
I was just watching game of the night
saying pastor cobia cause he's clearly

108
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:58,070
hot. Um, the only exception
to this whole whole

109
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,900
literature of streakiness
is uh, is, is a hockey,

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,913
no, is

111
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,910
this sport no one cared about? Is it,

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,280
is it Joe Dimaggio's hitting streak
where he eats for 42 games in a row?

113
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,480
I've gotten the book somewhere.

114
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,770
Actually Jody Maggio's heady
streak was 56 games. 56. Yeah.

115
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,710
So Joe Dimaggio is just about the only
Adler you can find in professional

116
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,220
sports. Only real hero. Yep.

117
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,780
Well at least I got Joe

118
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,903
[inaudible].

119
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,830
You know what yet one reason you have
trouble, I think more than Trello still,

120
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,630
you're not the only person who
is a person of pattern and habit.

121
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,670
We all are pattern rules.

122
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,400
The brain. Here's another story.
This is again from Joan Alara,

123
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,140
but this one is about a woman,
I believe. Her name is Ann.

124
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,490
Oh, name Khan. Stabber.

125
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,860
I live in a small country town where
most people know that the people

126
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,420
n was a high school English teacher. Yeah.

127
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,110
Tough for 31 years now lives
in West Virginia. Wait,

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,290
can you wait the Smith, there's someone
at my door, I'm sorry. They know that.

129
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,750
And then of course of course,

130
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,250
and most an upstanding citizen went to
church every Sunday was just one of those

131
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:31,180
people who makes the world go
round. It makes the world go round.

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm sorry. Not at all.

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,901
Anyway,

134
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:38,901
in 1991 I would go to the grocery store
and on the occasions I wrote a check for

135
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:45,360
my groceries that was
say, gosh, you're shaky.

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,970
And she says, she began to
notice that her hands would to,

137
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,390
oh, are you all right?

138
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,450
But a this something maybe it was
because of working hard and trying to get

139
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:57,100
everything then

140
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,090
and it got particularly bad when she
said she was just walking in the mall.

141
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:02,030
Doing some shopping

142
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,670
and,

143
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,670
and it was balanced self walking and
I was like a stepped off a staff that

144
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,230
wasn't there you,

145
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,870
it was the first full
body tremor. She fell.

146
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,960
And then my husband was a doctor and they
sent me to a neurologist who day lists

147
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,050
me with Parkinson's.

148
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,440
Well, how old, how old is she by the way?

149
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,800
She was at that point in her early
fifties. What is Parkinson's?

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,970
Parkinson's is the death of dopamine
neurons in the back of your brain,

151
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,370
in the part of your brain
that controls bodily movement.

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,940
And so when these neurons die,

153
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,941
the end result is first a shaking hand
and the loss of feeling and the loss of

154
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:47,410
movement. And then of course the tremors
get worse and worse. Right. Anyway,

155
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,420
well the doctor diagnosed with Parkinson's
and he gives her a drug called the

156
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,530
[inaudible]

157
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,730
quip was a new medicine, 1992.

158
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,250
It's a pseudo dopamine in basically
mimics dopamine and the synapse of the

159
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:01,830
cells.

160
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,060
And it was like a miracle drug for me.

161
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,133
[inaudible]

162
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,710
her tremors disappear,
her symptoms disappeared.

163
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,970
So she's cured or uh,

164
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,190
if you looked at her on Requip
years after she had Parkinson's,

165
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,560
you wouldn't notice anything.
She would seem symptom free.

166
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,370
So about seven or eight
years ago by all the wild,

167
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,890
they're upping the doses to
compensate for the cell loss.

168
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:34,730
It's still taking place in the early years
of 2000 and something sort of unusual

169
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:35,560
happened to Anne.

170
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Some friends of mine had gone to Las
Vegas every year for them basketball

171
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,900
tournament, the Phantom
for type thing. And um,

172
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,940
they asked would a,

173
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,180
I took a with them and I said yes I would.

174
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,420
So she went to watch basketball,
but as often happens in Vegas,

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,270
one afternoon she and her friends
found themselves in a casino.

176
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,760
Had you ever gambled before
this trip to Las Vegas?

177
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,620
Nah,

178
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,620
I was raised in a household
that was fairly religious
and we considered gambling

179
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,450
a sin.

180
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,560
But as she stood there
in the Casino in Vegas,

181
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,860
she had this inexplicably urge
to go to the slot machines,

182
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,090
the frozen quinces and cars
and cherries and the lemon.

183
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,140
The Shubin will span and
see what the pictures did.

184
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,690
I've never taken any drags side
or anything to compared to bit,

185
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,250
it was like a high,

186
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,170
that was sort of the beginning of a

187
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,060
um, and then, and then when she
comes back to West Virginia,

188
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,910
yeah. It can wait to get to a
machine that really want to buy.

189
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,880
She discovers the dog racing tracks. Good
spot that 15 miles away from my house.

190
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,310
Yeah. Seven 30 be there when they

191
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,940
open and that's, and
that's where she would go.

192
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,430
And they had a wider
sort of slot machines.

193
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,313
Are you

194
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,620
if I had the money at play all day

195
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,030
from seven to three 30
in the morning. Wow. Um,

196
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,810
and then she would go home and play
slots. The computer on her computer.

197
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,710
I'm not even sure

198
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,693
for money.

199
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,470
Just for the sheer visceral thrill.

200
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,790
Oh, apply that now. That's the night.
Seven 30 then it's morning. I'll be back

201
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
the joint without any sleep at all.

202
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,030
No sleep. And she could keep it
up for several days in a row.

203
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,720
It's the beginning of my gambling.

204
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,840
I'd wake up in the night and just
screaming out, Oh God, what am I doing?

205
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,670
Help me save me. But
eventually I became too hard.

206
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,970
Our did I guess, see even
pay attention to them.

207
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Her credit cards are all maxed out.

208
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,490
So my mother's silver, so my silverware,

209
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,530
things that should've been my son's
heirlooms though from the safety deposit.

210
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,080
She steals quarters from her grandkids,
steals quarters from her grandkids.

211
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,950
Yeah.

212
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah. Anything like that around the house.

213
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:10,520
I thought I could get money
out of everyone who knows
her as watching her life

214
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,610
fall apart. Right. House was filthy,

215
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:17,900
dirty and math have haven't
take time to even wash dishes.

216
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:21,880
She lives on peanut butter. It doesn't
have any crackers or bread or anything.

217
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,480
This had been a better, um,

218
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,450
because that's all she can afford and
still leave as much money as possible for

219
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:27,110
the slots.

220
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,110
Even when I be at church at thing was
so many more minutes or so many more

221
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,160
hours. I can get gamble. Her husband
eventually leaves her. I mean,

222
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,600
I loved my son, but I got divorced.

223
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,240
There's just no decision.

224
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,030
Everything is gambling.

225
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,760
One of the neat things about gambling
he is, he can do it by yourself.

226
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,100
How much money did you lose during those
years, if, if you don't mind me asking,

227
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,860
I lost at least $300,000.

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,780
300,000 now,

229
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,830
which to her is, is all your life savings
and it's one quarter at a time. Yeah.

230
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,910
That's the surreal part.

231
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,803
Bad

232
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,240
dread. Several things. I
went to a Rehab facility,

233
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,110
uh, father, I told judge rice
in a really, they just, Huh.

234
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,100
So that is, I would say bad days,
but shoot me for bad for the, the,

235
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,450
he wouldn't approve of this.

236
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,290
He wouldn't be so disappointed me

237
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,013
bed.

238
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,200
See at is getting stop.

239
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:44,530
[inaudible]

240
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,430
let me pause here for a second, Jeff. Uh,

241
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,560
I want to just take a moment to try to
figure out what exactly is happening to

242
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,530
and yeah, why can't she stop? Yeah.

243
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,110
It turns out there may be an
explanation if you look into her brain.

244
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,560
Well remember earlier we talked about a
little chemical called dopamine and how

245
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,390
she didn't have enough
dopamine in her brain.

246
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:05,060
So that was giving her some kind of
movement trouble. The Parkinson's. Right.

247
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,270
It also turns out to be the case that
anytime you do something that makes you

248
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,990
feel good, your Brene spurts out dopamine.

249
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:14,791
For years,

250
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,900
that's how scientists saw dope mean as
as the neurotransmitter of pleasure,

251
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,150
the neurotransmitter of sex,
drugs and rock and roll.

252
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,210
But you said earlier that dopamine
has to do with movement. Well,

253
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,150
what is the ultimate purpose of movement?
From the perspective of evolution,

254
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:30,660
it's to get you to food. It's to get
you to sex. It's to get you to a reward.

255
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,040
So that's why the same circuits, the
same chemical that controls motivation,

256
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,850
that controls what you want,
also controls movement.

257
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:43,020
But if it turned out it was a little
more complicated than that. In the,

258
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,440
in the mid 1970s guy named Wolfram Schultz
decided to take a much closer look.

259
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,800
Man, he has subjects. It

260
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,410
was a monkey.

261
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,110
So he would put these very thin
needles that can record the activity of

262
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:56,150
individual Dokeman neurons
in the monkey brain.

263
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,800
And they put the monkey in the room and
then every day they would walk down the

264
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,760
hall to the room. The hunky
was, it opened the door. Hello,

265
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,260
monkey flip on the light. They give
the monkey some juice. You go monkey.

266
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,640
And then when the monkey sip the juice

267
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:14,810
[inaudible]

268
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,560
let me happy monkey. Right.
But then comes a surprise.

269
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,550
He soon discovered something
very odd about these neurons

270
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,080
as the juiced this monkey.
Hey. Hello. Monkey monkey.

271
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,080
Danielle. Monkey. Dannon,
monkey. The squirt dopamine,

272
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,530
which they were always measuring in the
monkey's brain seem to move forward in

273
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,560
time. What do you mean? Well,

274
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,190
at first the dopamine hit when the
monkey took the sip juice. Hello Monkey.

275
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,440
But after awhile the monkey
got the dopamine hit when
they entered the room and

276
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:48,820
switched on the light and a
monkey. After a few more times,

277
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,880
the dopamine hit when the researchers
feet could be heard walking down the hall.

278
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,740
You see what's happening here?
Hello, monkey. Um, not really.

279
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,250
You'd have to bring it home for a
little bit and I'll, I'll do it again.

280
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,540
What the monkey is trying to do is piece
together the sequence of events that

281
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:12,770
inevitably lead to juice. Exactly.
That's what these cells do.

282
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,180
They try to predict reward.

283
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,880
Oh, so this isn't just about
movement or about feeling good.

284
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:22,930
It's about finding the pattern of the
thing that makes you feel good. Yeah,

285
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,720
it's pattern find. Oh, this
is pure pattern recognition.

286
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,980
This is essentially how your brain makes
sense of reality in some very primitive

287
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:33,100
sense. It parses reality
in terms of rewards.

288
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,130
So this is how you get more
food in the wild is you.

289
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,680
You can see the reward
before anyone else can.

290
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,050
So we're talking about like
basic survival stuff here.

291
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,910
There's one other wrinkle though,

292
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,380
method Dokeman system that makes casinos
and slot machines so tantalizing,

293
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,730
which is that these cells
are also programmed to be
very sensitive to surprising

294
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:53,980
rewards. So this seems to be,

295
00:16:53,981 --> 00:16:57,700
most scientists speculate that the seems
to be your brain's way of telling you

296
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,600
pay attention. You just got something
for free. This must be good.

297
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,090
Sit here in this nice comfy velvet
chair and try to figure out this reward.

298
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,180
So now imagine Anne sitting
there at the slot machine.

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,900
She pushes the button
on the machine machine

300
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,300
[inaudible]

301
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,590
and sirens and bells go off
coins claim and inside her head

302
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,090
[inaudible]

303
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,740
her dopamine. You're on there
saying this is wonderful,

304
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,510
but now how did this happen?
Where did this big Roy come from?

305
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,940
What did you do this time? Why
are you so happy? All of a sudden

306
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,260
searching for something they had frozen.

307
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,020
The number of cherries that she had just
before was it that this machine had 13

308
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:45,550
hits and this was the 14th dot. I can
tell you it has all kinds of pattern,

309
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:48,940
like things. It has bells, it has white,

310
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,240
but the problem is is that there is no
pattern defined. There is no pattern.

311
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,640
It's inherently random. It's
inherently unpredictable.

312
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,120
And while the rest of us might just,
you know, give up and walk away, God,

313
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,630
I just wasted a hundred
bucks on this stupid machine.

314
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,420
I should go get lunch
and can't go to lunch.

315
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:09,850
Her dopamine system is
too powerful, too potent,

316
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,780
oh cause of that drug she's taking,
right? It keeps surging and surging,

317
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,170
forcing her neurons to fight,
fight hard to find a pattern.

318
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,070
That's what's gripping her.

319
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Her brain is intoxicated
at the possibility that it
will learn how to succeed,

320
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,870
that it will crack and uncrackable
code thought I was good at soften and

321
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:34,680
machines. In fact, she told me a
story about she would go to buy milk,

322
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,460
um,

323
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,460
and then spend the next 12 hours with
the milk rotting next to her is she puts

324
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,380
quarter after quarter after
quarter into this machine.

325
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,190
Were you surprised when you learn that
the medication might be responsible for

326
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,024
your gambling addiction?

327
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,540
I mean, as some was said to me,

328
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,700
this mezzo causes compulsive
gambling. I thought they're crazy.

329
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,530
It's just at that time where the first
studies come out showing that this is

330
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,840
actually a common side effect of Brexit.

331
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,970
Really. So there were other ans
appearing in other places. Same deal.

332
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,863
Absolutely.

333
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,520
Basically after my neurologist
sent me off the rig, clear,

334
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,200
her compulsion disappeared
instantaneously, almost
immediately. That fast. Well,

335
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,560
within a weekend say wow, it was gone.

336
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,260
Evan gambled for nearly three years.

337
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,560
Did her Parkinson's return. Yeah,

338
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,700
I have dreamers lot worse
recently. Again, like king,

339
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,290
I have trouble walking
and he's so awkward.

340
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,540
So the price of not being a gambling
addict is living with debilitating

341
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:41,650
Parkinsonian symptoms. That last
son, let me finish about my son,

342
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,380
and I told him after the
clique game plan, I said, son,

343
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,940
so the things that belong to you that you,

344
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,170
these said, mom, they're just

345
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,970
this really great debut bag. [inaudible].
