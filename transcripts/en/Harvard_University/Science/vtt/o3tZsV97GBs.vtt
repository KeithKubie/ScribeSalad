00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.570
This the miracle of being able to see what
was not being able to see before.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.120
More like Star Trek, right?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.340
It's the age of exploration again.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.980
It's simply incredible.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.050
So we biologists like to see how things occur
and we like to see a cell.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.780
We like see the interior of a cell.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.140
Cells didn't evolve on a cover slip.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.720
Cells didn't evolve in isolation.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.660
So we want to be able to study these cells
in a more natural, more physiological setting.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.000
Eric Betzig, which is the inventor of these
microscopes, had two brilliant thoughts.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.700
One was to create a form of microscopy where
you have a very thin layer of light

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.170
that you scan through the sample, and that
allows you to minimize the damage to the sample.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.500
And the second problem that he found a solution
for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.090
was he borrowed a trick that astronomers use
today for their telescopes.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.400
Because how you de-blur the perturbations
you get on the atmosphere

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.180
when you're looking at a star.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.580
And we have the same problem when we're looking
inside a tissue.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.840
With this microscope, for the first time, you
can actually observe sub-cellular details

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240
at an unprecedented level.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.909
I started to work on how cells eat, for many
years.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.960
All my life I dreamed to see this happening
in a live organism.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.020
Finally, we've been able to do this.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.080
Being able to observe a neutrophil just crawling
through the ear of a zebrafish,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.540
scooping up all of these food particles that
we've injected, that's just mind blowing.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.430
I actually got goose bumps -- my hair -- I
actually still have goose bumps thinking of

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.470
the moment when we actually first saw that.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.670
Being able to visualize that was just phenomenal.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.940
Cancer cells.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.380
So these are human cancer cells that have
been implanted in the zebrafish,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.930
and you can see now the cells moving along
capillaries, cells crossing the wall of the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.930
capillaries.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.480
But it's not just a blob of the cell, like
other people have seen in the past,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.520
this time we see the details of how the cell
is sending pieces of the cell to explore their

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.040
space.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.060
We've mapped the entire eye of the zebrafish,
and then computationally exploded the cells

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.920
such that you can look at each cell as a unit,
and what you can actually observe is the changes

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.150
in morphology in the context of the tissue.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.060
That's never been done before.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.150
You can look at how all of the intracellular
compartments are dynamically changing.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.140
We can see cell mitosis, cell division, cells
kind of pushing against, beating up their

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.610
neighbors while they're violently dividing.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.670
At least that's the impression I get when
I'm looking at cell division.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.560
Now I cannot sleep anymore.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.890
I'm up every night, trying to figure out how to
do the next thing.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.290
That's like one of the highlights of working
at the forefront of this,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.150
because you're one of the first people to
see these things.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.440
You're the first person to see this, even
before your boss gets to see it.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.060
So, that's amazing.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.500
Up to now, the science that we have been doing
is hypothesis testing.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.739
Now we can do hypothesis generating.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.300
If it were up to me I would spend the next
couple of years just imaging and exploring,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.370
because I fee like there is a lot of unknowns.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.430
We actually start to ask questions that can
push the frontiers in new directions.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.099
And then we can generate our thoughts on how
to next and test.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.540
That's a big, big difference.
