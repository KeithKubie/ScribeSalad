00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, my name is
Anne Savage and I work at the,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.480
in the Education Department
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.560 position:69%
We are thrilled to welcome you to the second
annual Online Conference for Educators.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.500
Our session today, Library
of Congress 101 for Teachers

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.730 position:72%
and now I would like to introduce our speaker.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.110 position:73%
Our speaker for this evening is Cheryl Lederle.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.660
She has worked as an Educational
Resources Specialist at the Library

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.500
of Congress since December of 2003.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.290
In that role, she has advanced
the library's educational mission

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.290 position:58%
by providing professional development
both in person and via webinar.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.260 position:61%
She's also played a significant role in
shaping the library's online repository

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.670 position:56%
of classroom materials and resources
for teachers at loc.gov/teachers,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.320
and she continues to contribute to
the development of those materials.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.650 position:73%
Cheryl has 15 years experience teaching English

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.120
at both the high school and
community college levels.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.670
Welcome, Cheryl.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.850 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Thanks Ann, and welcome to all of
you who I expect have taught a full day,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.800 position:61%
and I appreciate that you are
choosing to spend your evening with us.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.150 position:72%
I want to explore what the Library of Congress
has for teachers, looking particularly

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.160 position:63%
at lesson plans and primary source sets,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.000
webinars and professional
development opportunities.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.010 position:69%
And then I want to spend just a little bit
of time introducing you to what's behind all

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.640 position:56%
of these teacher materials and we'll
explore very briefly ways to tap

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.120
into those vast library collections
to find even more.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.160 position:72%
What I've put up on screen now is Capitol Hill

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280
and you can see the Capitol
there in the foreground.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.450 position:63%
And behind it and just to the right on
the widescreen there's a domed building.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.460 position:58%
That's the very beautiful Thomas
Jefferson building completed in 1897.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.890 position:66%
There are two other buildings on Capitol
Hill in addition to the Jefferson building

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.110 position:66%
that comprise the library on Capitol Hill.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.520
We also have some off-site storage.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.990
That gives you a little bit of
context for where I'm coming from.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.970 position:61%
I've also put some statistics on the
screen just because I like the numbers.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.200 position:69%
The library has more than 160 million items.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.830 position:72%
There are more than 830 miles of book shelves.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.960
The library receives, through
copyright deposit and other means,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.860
approximately 15,000 items a day.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.590 position:58%
And of those it adds to the
collections about 12,000 items a day.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.500 position:61%
That's a big number for any of you, but
I saw several of you were librarians.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.140
Just think for a minute about
the task of processing

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.770
up to 12 million-- excuse
me-- 12,000 items a day.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.200 position:66%
We'd love to have you visit us on Capitol
Hill, but until that time you can visit us

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.520 position:63%
from wherever you have a sturdy internet
connection using this access point,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.930
the library's website, loc.gov.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.270 position:66%
Feel free to explore these links or sit
back and relax and make notes for yourself

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.500 position:56%
about what you want to come back to.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.450
Again this is the home page,
access to all of the collections.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.020 position:70%
My home and Anne's at the library are the
Especially for Teachers section and I'm going

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.550 position:72%
to spend the first part of our time together--

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.110
my professional life is dedicated
to making it easier for you to find

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.220
and use those online collections.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.230
And several of you are saying you
have various levels of experience.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.840
I'm glad that some of you have,
are feeling comfortable with it.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.160 position:61%
Even if you are a very comfortable user
I'm going to guess that time is always

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.140
in short supply for a busy teacher.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.230
That was my experience teaching.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.720
So I'm going to hit some highlights
of shortcuts that you might take.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.930
And the first one highlighted
in the pink box just

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.930 position:72%
under the classroom materials black bar is the
Teaching with the Library of Congress blog.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.860 position:66%
We've been blogging for several years now.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.190 position:66%
In addition to what we publish a couple of
times a week, it's also keyword searchable

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.270 position:75%
so that you can go back and explore the archive.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.650
And I have search results using
the term Informational Text.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.500 position:63%
As a former English teacher I get
pretty excited about informational text.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.720 position:61%
And so I like that as my search result.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:59.380
But you can search by other things,
topics, grade levels, and so forth.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.040
So I would commend this to you.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.410 position:58%
If you'd like to hear from us on a
regular basis, subscribe to the blog.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.710 position:56%
You can see at the top, to the right
there's an orange subscribe link

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.050
and that would have this sent to
your inbox when we publish it.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.910 position:72%
Back to the teacher's home page to orient you.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.670
I'm going to visit next Classroom
Materials and I'm not going

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.030
to spend too much time clicking
around any of these pages.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.490 position:66%
What I'm hoping to do is alert you to the
possibility that they exist and invite you

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.590 position:58%
to come back and explore on your own.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.420 position:70%
So the classroom materials page, the pink
box now is around one of my favorite features

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.680 position:64%
and that is it's searchable by standards.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.100 position:75%
If you can squint a little, you can see that the
radio buttons allow you to search by common core

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.330
or state content or a selection
of national organizations.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.330 position:75%
And clicking into common core or state content
gives you the option to then identify your state

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.320
since different states apply
those standards differently.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.900 position:61%
The first stop on our tour of classroom
materials is primary source sets.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.660 position:58%
And that's just what they sound like.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.720
They're sets of primary sources.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.070
And we started developing those
when in conversation with teachers

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.530 position:61%
about using the lesson plans that we've
been publishing for quite a number

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.080 position:59%
of years we realized that teachers are
taking apart the lesson plans looking

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.340
for primary sources of use
and then for teaching ideas

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.280
and this sounded very familiar
from my days as a teacher.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.890 position:58%
I didn't teach somebody else's lesson
plan but I loved to mine their ideas.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.030 position:73%
And so we put the primary source sets together.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.120 position:75%
It's 18 primary sources on a particular theme or
topic and there are more than 30 of these now.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.350 position:75%
And then each one we wrap in a teacher's guide--
looks about like this, this is the top of it--

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.030
with a brief historical background
about the theme or topic.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.480
And then in additional also
teaching ideas for it.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.660 position:59%
Each primary source set also links to
the teacher's guides an analysis tool.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.720 position:72%
And several of the presentations during the
online conference have made reference to this.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.150 position:66%
The analysis tool looks pretty simple
because the design of it is pretty simple.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.260
It is three columns-- observe,
reflect, and question.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.640
And then an invitation for
students to think about what they'd

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.650 position:63%
like to investigate to learn more about.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:59.930 position:75%
The process itself is way less simple and that's
reflected in the upper right corner of this,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.260
the circular arrow that says
observe, reflect, and question.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.940 position:59%
And we recognize that it is not at all
a linear process but flat paper sort

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.510 position:63%
of limits our ability to represent that.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.930
So we've done what we can.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.580
You'll notice if you look,
that it's available by,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.860 position:72%
for different formats and I've pulled that up.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.820 position:67%
Choosing a format changes the question set.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.780 position:64%
You can see there's a red circle around
select the format of your primary source,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.820 position:72%
and then another red circle around a question.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.830
Clicking on that question
will bring up a question.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.130
Clicking on that question
icon will bring up a question.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:47.640 position:67%
And you can customize that by format or
just as questions that are generally useful

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.030 position:69%
for helping students dig deeper into looking
at and thinking about primary sources.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.160
Here's a sample.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.590 position:64%
This is a set from the more general ones.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.090
There are 10 format specific
teacher guides in addition to this.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:10.240 position:75%
At the bottom of the teacher's guide you can see
that there are some follow up activity ideas--

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.550 position:59%
beginning, intermediate, and advanced.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:19.880 position:70%
And I think of those levels as not only the
complexity for the student but the complexity

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.300
for the teacher to implement them.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.860
And generally speaking, the
beginning ones are a very easy lift

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.630 position:73%
on the teacher and still give rich information.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.090 position:58%
I use a lot of beginning ones when I
do professional development programs.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:40.450 position:64%
So there certainly can still lead to some
rich and deep thinking and information.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.880
A selection of the primary
source sets are also available

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.370 position:64%
as free e-books through the iTunes store.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.740
Those have the same content
from the primary source sets

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.790
but the technology allows
us to embed some tools.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:02.040 position:59%
So if you have iPads available in
your school you might check these out.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.640 position:67%
If you don't you can still get all the same
content through those primary source sets.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.980 position:73%
I return to the classroom materials page-- I'm
not going to take time to tour the lesson plans

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.070
because your teachers and you all
know what a lesson plan looks like.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.910 position:56%
I would invite you to explore those.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.910 position:69%
It's a great way to find some ideas and a
shortcut for finding primary sources as well

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.000
if you find a lesson plan
on something you teach.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.790
I do want to take a look at a
couple of the presentations.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.100 position:56%
We have a fair selection of them and
it struck me as timely to feature

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.600 position:64%
for you today elections the American way.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.930 position:75%
These feature primary sources from the library's
collection-- collections I should say--

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:56.670 position:75%
but also give a little more context and history.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.300 position:69%
So if you're-- if you or your students want
to do a little bit of reading on the process

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.720
or issues from past presidential
elections or the right to vote,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.350 position:72%
this would be for example a resource for that.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.690 position:64%
Back to the teacher's home page, I'd
like to look at professional development.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.310 position:59%
Right now you're all participating in
an example of professional development

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.950 position:56%
that we offer for distance learning.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.250
And there is a link on the
professional development subpage.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:32.080
It's toward the bottom of the
screen boxed in pink for webinars.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.640
We have quite a number of
these that we've been doing,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.010 position:59%
and you may be wondering why is Cheryl
telling me this about past events?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:46.280 position:70%
Well you can see looking at this grid that we
record most of them and make them available

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:53.380 position:69%
after the fact just as we'll be recording
and making available the 15 hours of content

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.380
from this online conference,
we have past events.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:04.210 position:63%
We also do on-site workshops including a
week-long summer teacher institute here

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.700
at the library.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.540 position:69%
If you're interested in that, the best way--

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.140 position:64%
the best way to find out about that is to
subscribe to the blog and watch for it.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:20.660 position:56%
We usually publicize the application
sometime around December-ish.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.840
December, early January.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:29.150 position:75%
And the first notice of that will go out through
the blog and our other social media channels.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.670
Back to the homepage for
the Library of Congress.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.780 position:59%
I want to talk just a little bit about
how to find your way around that.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:44.260 position:72%
Many of you said you have some comfort with
searching on the library so I'm going to guess

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:51.230 position:66%
that if that's true you've met this
homepage search bar and this searches most

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.660 position:56%
of the library's online collections.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:59.050 position:73%
There are two sections that are not included
and I'll talk about those in just a little bit.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.080 position:70%
But this searches more than 30 million files.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.120 position:69%
You can narrow your search by format, if you
know for example that you want a map to fill

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.440
in something in your lesson plan
or you're working with learners

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.580
who respond particularly
well to visual materials--

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:22.010 position:56%
maps or photos, prints, or
drawings-- you can search by format.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:26.950 position:56%
Once you get a search result you can
also search by, narrow your search

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.900 position:67%
by other facets that'll look very familiar.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.550
If you're not sure what I'm
talking about, you'll recognize it.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.380
You can narrow it by date
range for example in addition

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.200 position:69%
to format once you get to that results page.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.010
And so I'd encourage you to explore
that and find your way around.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:52.910 position:59%
I will note that a relatively recent--
as in the last five, six years--

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.940 position:61%
is that any of those search results
that you narrow can be shared as links.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:05.540 position:73%
So if you need-- if you need to support your
students by identifying a body of possibilities

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:11.600 position:59%
for them that they then dig around in,
you can share those search results.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:19.230 position:63%
I want to dig now into two sections that
are not covered in that homepage search.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.690
The first is historic American
newspapers Chronicling America.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.130 position:72%
How many of you have used Chronicling America?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.310 position:73%
And if you've used it and want to talk a
little bit about what your experience has been,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.850
I think it's very valuable
for people to hear from those

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.070 position:61%
of you who are in the field practicing.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.930 position:69%
I know theoretically what it looks like with
students, but my audience now is adults.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.120
I'm going to continue showing
you how to get to this.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.420 position:69%
You can click through from the library site
or directly from that link that Anne put in.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.220
It's also a good search term,
Chronicling America.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.740 position:58%
Chronicling America is a website that
provides free public access to more

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.840
than 11 million pages of
historic U.S. newspapers.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.080 position:56%
I'm going to hit some highlights but
if you want to go deeper into this,

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:19.080 position:73%
several of the folks here today have
mentioned that they watched the earlier session

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.250 position:66%
and that'll be available in the recording.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.780 position:61%
Vicki, yes, it can be difficult to read
and hone in on what they want to need.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.620
Also very exciting.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.560 position:64%
The earlier session did give a little bit
of conversation about that and we also,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.670 position:67%
last year's online conference-- last year's
online conference had a whole session

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.020
and our last year's teacher in
residence had a passion for working

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.720 position:70%
with newspapers and joined that conversation.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.970
So you might look at that if
you're looking for even more tips.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:16:02.140 position:61%
The easiest way to get into Chronicling
America is to do a keyword search.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.120
It can however yield a daunting
number of possibilities.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.910 position:72%
This is the results from the word prohibition.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:17.490 position:75%
You'll notice if you haven't used this you might
be a little surprised to see all the pink boxes.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.200
You can see in some of the
headlines, those pink boxes are

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.670
around the search term--
in this case, prohibition.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:29.920 position:59%
Janelle it is-- let me go back a
couple of slides and bring Janelle up.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:36.450 position:56%
I will also say that it being a
website, expect that it will change.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.490
So I'm certainly happy to show
you the path from the homepage.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.940
You're probably better off if
you remember the name of it

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.850 position:66%
so that you can search for it and find it.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.370
But from the homepage, click
into historic newspapers and then

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.470
from historic newspapers we have
several different collections.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.010
Click into Chronicling America
and we're back to the search term.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.410
If your students or you are
looking for a real great shortcut--

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:13.210 position:72%
I'm going to guess that some of you don't
know this-- go to the recommended topics page.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:19.690 position:58%
These are guides to topics, more than
250 of them, put together by experts

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.310 position:64%
from the newspaper division that provides
background information for well-known

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:32.230 position:70%
and lesser known events with important
dates, search strategies and sample articles.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.780
And I'm going to go-- I'm going
to play with the drawing arrow

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.800 position:63%
and point out to you where I found this.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.860 position:58%
So from Chronicling America homepage,
it's right there in the left nav

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:51.030
and it's called recommended topics.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.930 position:75%
This map shows the scope of Chronicling America.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:18:02.430 position:66%
It's actively adding new states every year
and recently added several new partners.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.860
You can see that it now covers
most of the United States.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:16.270
The states in grey have not applied
or received a grant from the NEH

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.380 position:59%
but they are actively working on that.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.480
I'm going to pause.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.720 position:63%
Any questions about Chronicling America?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.250
Anything you want me to go
back to before I move forward?

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:35.010 position:69%
As I say, I'm hitting the highlights very
quickly knowing that we have a whole session

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:40.210
on Chronicling America and
that you can view the recording

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.750 position:69%
at your leisure and explore at your leisure.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.590
Is it common not to find
what you're looking for?

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.040 position:59%
Man, that's a tough question, Janelle.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.730 position:67%
It's not uncommon because for one thing
you're searching in historical collections.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:19:01.910 position:73%
And they night not use the language that you're
accustomed to which is one of the reasons

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:07.350 position:59%
that those suggested search strategies
in the topics are a real goldmine.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:15.150 position:72%
It is keyword searchable which is a huge boon,
but that's a lot of words for it to search.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.380 position:70%
The advanced search strategies give you a
little more control over how you approach it.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.570
I will say it's pretty common
that you need to take a couple

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.560
of different approaches to
find what you're looking for.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.320 position:61%
And again, I'm just going to sound like
I'm advertising for that other session.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.920 position:56%
She went through a lot of those
more detailed search tips and ideas.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.600 position:61%
I would encourage you to take
different approaches and yes, Jennifer,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.460 position:61%
you're absolutely right, it's much
easier than scanning through microfiche

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.030 position:69%
where you have to really read all the words.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.790 position:67%
This does narrow the searches considerably.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.050
Shifting gears, I want to
show you the last piece--

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.180
the second piece that's not
searched by that homepage bar.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.990 position:66%
And both of these, Chronicling America and
the World Digital Library which I'm going

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.890
to show you next are partnership
collections so they're part of us

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.160 position:61%
but not part of us if that makes sense.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.620 position:64%
And I think that's why so far they're not
incorporated yet into that search box.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.670
How many of you have seen
the world digital library?

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.990
Is this at all familiar?

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:33.230
No. No. Looks like a lot of no's.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.630
Okay, I hope some of you get
as excited about this as I do.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:45.710 position:73%
The World Digital Library is a partnership
under the auspices of UNESCO led by the Library

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:55.200 position:73%
of Congress with international institutions and
the goal of the World Digital Library is to try

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.380
to make available world treasures.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:08.390 position:67%
And each of these items is selected for its
value to the country that is presenting it

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.700
and each of these items comes
with considerable context.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.980 position:58%
Sounds like most of you are pretty
familiar with the Library of Congress

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.080
and so you know sometimes you get
a lot of information about an item,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.270
and sometimes you get very
little information about an item.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.320 position:61%
The World Digital Library is different.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.400
The World Digital Library comes
with considerable information.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.370
This is what that page looks like.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.020
You can see there's a whole
long paragraph of commentary.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.780 position:75%
I'm sure you can't read it on your screen but
you can see the bulk of it and the depths of it.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.910 position:69%
I'm going to hit some highlights of the WDL.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:57.300 position:63%
I'm going to invite you to explore on
your own-- again all of these pages are,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.050 position:69%
most of these pages are hyperlinked as
well-- and that'll be true in the recording.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:08.300
If you look near the top of the
page you'll see the pink box

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.330 position:67%
and that pink box says listen to this page.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:17.880 position:70%
All of these pages have audio casts attached
to them which I think are a fantastic support

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.090
for students who may struggle
decoding the written word.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:29.020 position:58%
They can take in the content but they
might struggle decoding the text.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.460
And there's more.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:38.190 position:67%
These pages can also be translated into all
of the languages of the UN plus Portuguese.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.490
Portuguese because Brazil was
an early strong partner in this.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:50.560 position:70%
So the objects themselves of course don't get
translated but the context around them does.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.480 position:58%
And so now here's the page in Arabic.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:23:03.090 position:67%
And you'll notice at the upper left that
same audio cast button that was on the page

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.630 position:75%
to the right with a pink box around it is there.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.850 position:69%
So there's audio support in seven languages.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:16.830
So I know several of you
said you were librarians.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.300
You might share these with
your world language teachers.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:25.210 position:70%
If you're a classroom teacher, you might talk
to your world language teacher about ways

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:34.760 position:67%
to get some cross-curricular work going on
to study the object as a historical object,

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.130 position:61%
as a cultural artifact in some classes,

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.870
and to study the language in
the world language classes.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.900
That wraps up the highlights
of what I want to show you.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:57.500 position:73%
If you're learning more about the WDL I will
point out that we had last year a whole session

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.630
on that presented by the folks who
work for the World Digital Library.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:07.580 position:66%
And I can't do justice to the zoom
capability through a series of screenshots

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.750
which is what I'm able to do here.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.410
But I would encourage you--
go in, play around, explore.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:18.990
There are many, many ways
to access that information.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:23.570
More than I took the time to show
you because honestly I'm not sure

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.360 position:67%
that there's anything less interesting than
watching somebody click through a screen

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.130 position:75%
so I've really tried to streamline this for you.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:38.450 position:69%
But I want to leave you with this, I'm back
to the library's homepage and the pink boxes

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:45.530 position:72%
at the top, I hope that you can read that it's
around a button that says ask a librarian.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.660
The Library of Congress has
many, many librarians and many

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.340 position:72%
of those librarians are available to help you.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.130 position:70%
So please use this service, clicking on that.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.990 position:75%
And it's at the top of most pages of the
Library of Congress will bring you to this page.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.710
Thank you, I'm really glad to
see that you see value in it.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:16.600 position:66%
Susan and Bonnie talking about the value
of this to your language learner students.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:24.880 position:61%
Jennifer asks the excellent question of
is there a guided tour of the library?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:32.630 position:73%
The library has vast public museum space and
there are docent-led tours several times a day.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:40.470 position:69%
If you're bringing a group, there is a link
from the library's home page about visiting.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:46.080
Clear up here at the top
you can see that it says--

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.560 position:59%
put the green arrow in the right
place-- there's a link that, to visit.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.440 position:67%
And so if you're bringing a group, I forget
the number-- maybe it's either 10 or 20--

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.390
if you're bringing a largish
group I would advise you

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.150 position:72%
to contact them in advance and arrange a tour.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:06.580
Thanks Anne, but absolutely it's a
gorgeous, gorgeous, wonderful space

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.620
and I would encourage you to visit.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.740
Jennifer as an individual you
can come join a public tour.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.870
You can come wander around.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:19.510 position:63%
It's an amazing museum space that
doesn't get as much foot traffic as some

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:26.940 position:70%
of the other beautiful museums in Washington,
D.C. I just want to point out before I forget

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:33.480 position:63%
that I was on Ask a Librarian and I want
you to know that you can see the scope

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.070 position:64%
of the experts available at the library
to help you find what you're looking for.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.220
I direct your attention to
the pink bar at the bottom

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.850
of the page that's around
resources for teachers.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.340
That comes into the office
where Anne and I and Kathy work.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:57.530 position:67%
It's staffed by our amazing colleague
Danna Bell who knows more about the library

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.000
than anybody I know, and
likes to teach about it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.190 position:69%
So if you have a question, use this service.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.700 position:56%
Don't worry too much about directing
it to exactly the right place.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.870 position:61%
Make your best guess and the librarians

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.010
who field these questions know
each other and will forward them.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.340
So if you send it to Dana and she
knows that somebody in another part

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.170
of the library is better qualified
to answer it, she'll forward it on

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.060 position:58%
and that's true for the rest of them.
