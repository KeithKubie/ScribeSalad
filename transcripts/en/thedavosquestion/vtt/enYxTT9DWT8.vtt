00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:07.050
John: Hi I'm John Hope Bryant, founder, chairman
and CEO of operation hope, and a young global

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.190
leader for the World Economic Forum.
I'm here in beautiful Jordan where I had the

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.670
chance to be here two years ago with Queen
Rania doing dignity day in local schools.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.830
And Queen Rania when I saw these young girls
respond to her.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.190
They opened up, they, they became like flowers.
And I was told that they would not talk to

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.419
me, these young girls would not say a word
to me.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.409
But when I accorded them respect and the dignity
they deserved.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:41.609
When I respected their intelligence and assumed
they had good ideas, it took a little bit,

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.079
but after about five minutes, a hand started
going up.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.859
And then once one hand went up a half dozen
hands went up.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.839
And they started engaging and involving in
the conversation.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.549
So the window was Queen Rania -- the door
was Queen Rania, the window though was the

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:05.500
dignity that I accorded them, and then the
opportunity was really the brilliance of their

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.290
mind and their thought and their ideas.
And while I was told these young girls would

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.460
not say a word to me, after an hour and a
half I couldn't shut them up.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.520
And so when they went to bring Queen Rania
in at the end of the session, and you can

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
 -- a lot of this is caught on video.
You can go to Queen Rania's website and I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.109
guess search dignity day Genev -- Jordan.
I asked them why can't -- you know why couldn't

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.070
we shut you up, what was, what was going on.
They said no one ever asked us our opinion.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.650
No one ever asked us what we believed.
They tell us what we are supposed to believe,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.710
and they don't seem genuinely interested in
what we have to say.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.460
You seem genuinely interested in what we have
to say, and we see Queen Rania and we see

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.350
these other women.
They saw my wife who is an amazing woman.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.181
She is a [inaudible] who owns her own business,
and has an incredible reputation and had a

00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.181
business card, about how powerful it is to
have a business card.

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.071
And they, they said well if she can do that
then I can do that.

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.969
Not only Queen Rania, but here is, here is
another woman that we can relate to.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.000
And here is a man that seems to accord us
respect as an equal.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.220
So I think that's an example.
I think this is a universal issue.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.860
I was with [inaudible] who is CEO of a beautiful
company here in the Middle East, Eremats.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.680
And he's doing work in a settlement area here
in Jordan, and we went there.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.800
And he was the only private sector leaders
thatâ€™s gone in this area.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.750
So now he's opening a door and a window for
young people to become entrepreneurs or want

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
to become entrepreneurs.
To dream big dreams.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.670
And to become dreamers with shovels in their
hands.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.040
Shovels of ideas, shovels of ambition, shovels
of desire.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.370
And to open up their horizons, to become entrepreneurs,
small business owners, self employment projects.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.470
Because there's not enough jobs to go around
in Jordan nor the middle east, you'd need

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.170
100 million jobs to fill the void.
You have 60% of the population under 25, that's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.900
not gonna change any time soon.
You've got to inspire a generation of entrepreneurs

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.620
and self employment projects and empowered
people.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.931
You do that by changing the role models.
In changing what these kids see so they see

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:15.310
things differently.
I'll end with this.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.290
This is not a Middle East problem.
I'm from the United States and in the inner

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.280
cities in the Unites States which look a lot
like the settlements, you have young people

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.540
who want to be drug dealers, athletes and
rap stars.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.040
Now these kids aren't dumb and their not stupid,
they're very smart, they're modeling what

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120
they see.
We need to give these kids something different

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.659
to see.
If you can get the role model level to 5%

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.340
 -- The book tipping point by Gladwell says
that 5% role models, all communites stabilize.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.050
The problem is most communities in the urban
areas have 3% role models, 3.7% role models

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.510
or less.
So it's too thin, so they model what they

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.700
see versus what they could be.
We can change in the US, we can change in

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.660
Europe, we can change in Latin America, we
can change it in Asia, we can change it here.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.121
And I'm very hopeful, I'm very positive, I
love Jordan, I love being here and hopefully

00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.620
you I don't know loved this presentation,
or only tolerated me for just a moment.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.629
God bless.
