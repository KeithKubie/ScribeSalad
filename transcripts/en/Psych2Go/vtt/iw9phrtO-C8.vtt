*sniff-sniff*

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.309
Technology has become predominant over everyone's lives in the past 20 years

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.160
People now have smartphones and Smart TV's

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.689
Everything is smart. With people having a cellphone on them 24/7

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.439
It's impossible to not check your social media sites and see what your friends, classmates or family are up to, and we love it

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.029
Staying in touch is so much easier now, and with just a click of a button

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.719
We can see cute animal pictures, recipe videos and every photo our best friends have ever posted

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.329
But with that great power comes great responsibility

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.049
And sometimes it can even cause anxiety

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.879
Let's be clear. It's not the actual sites that can cause that anxious feeling. It's the addiction to checking the site

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.209
I mean, I can put my phone down whenever, right? But wait, I just want to see who that new girl

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.619
Erin is dating now. Ohh! Look at that yummy recipe video, and *oh my goodness!* another cute dog

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.139
It's hard not to get sucked into the social media sinkhole

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.390
It's so easy to say to ourselves

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.380
"One more scroll", while putting off responsibilities like homework, walking your not Instagram-famous dog and

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.959
Doing the dishes

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.309
Unfortunately, the more you let yourself scroll, the harder it is to get back out

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.609
When you're finally in a situation where you can't check or update social media like when you forget your phone

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.669
Or you're in an important lesson, you feel anxious

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:43.749
You keep thinking about checking what everyone's up to and you can't stop reaching for your smart device that may or may not even be there

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.410
That's what we mean by Social media anxiety

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.470
It's almost like an addiction

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.580
Compulsively checking for updates can cause unnecessary anxiety in your life

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.389
Which takes away all the fun of social media. If you aren't sure whether you've

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:05.109
Experienced social media anxiety or not here are some ways to know: Do you compulsively check social media every few minutes?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.009
Do you feel anxious or nervous if you aren't able to check it?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.869
When having a real-life conversation with someone, are you scrolling through social media?

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.908
If you said yes to any of those, you might be experiencing more anxiety than you need to be

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.578
Luckily there are some ways to get rid of it

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.399
Instead of compulsively or habitually reaching for your phone make it a conscious choice

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.059
By saying to yourself: "I am going to check my social media". Then you are staying in control of the scroll

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.470
Keep your phone in your pocket if you're having a face-to-face conversation with someone, unless you're showing each other cool vacation photos

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.010
This is another way to exert control on your social media scrolling by not splitting your attention as you do it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.430
Remind yourself that there will just be more to look through if you don't have access to your social media for a while

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.739
This turns any anxiety you might feel into excitement and will let you get back to focusing on the task at hand

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.529
Social Media is a great resource to use to communicate with friends and family

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.800
It's always nice to see pictures from someone's trip and I'm positive everyone would like to see a picture of your adorable pet

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.999
I love social Media, but I don't like the anxiety that can come with it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.799
We hope that by integrating these tips your social media experience stays fun forever

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.230
We can't wait to see more cute pictures of your pet

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.390
