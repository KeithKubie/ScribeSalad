&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Hello and welcome.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.500
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the Science Technology

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.330
and Business Division.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.620
I want to take the
opportunity today

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.220
to say Happy 60th
Birthday to NASA.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.760
And I only wish that
I were that young.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.950
Today we're going to hear about
eclipses and occultation's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.880
and other shadowy effects.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.740
We are still buzzing about the
eclipse that we had last year,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.960
it was just really
such an amazing kind

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.940
of life changing
event for some people.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.160
And of course we're looking
forward to the next one in 2024.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.900
But in the meantime, we've
got a lot of other shadowy,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.770
what does he call
it shadow science.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.740
We have a lot of other
things to learn about.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.790
Test took off finally,
looking for exoplanets.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.610
And we have the best
person to talk about it

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.550
because Dr. James Green was
the Chief of Planetary Sciences

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.300
and was recently chosen to
be NASA's Chief Scientist;

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.450
so he's got some new duties and
it will be really interesting

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.750
to hear about that too.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.290
But, not today I suppose.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.690
So Dr. Green got his PhD
at the University of Iowa

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.350
and worked there
with Dr. Van Allen.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.270
And then in 1980 he began
his career with NASA

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.460
down at the Marshall Space
Flight in Alabama, and then came

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.740
to Goddard in 1985 as head

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.300
of the National Space
Science Data Center.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.190
And in 2006 he became
Director of Planetary Science.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.370
So that, if you want to
know more you can Google him

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.520
because he has quite a long and
detailed history there at NASA,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.690
with many awards and
many achievements.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.440
And of course as Chief

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.720
of Planetary Sciences he oversaw
some really cool missions

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.130
to Mars and past Pluto, etc. So,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.510
please help me welcome
Dr. Green to the Library.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green:
Thank you very much.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.110
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.280
I know many of you perhaps had
an opportunity last year to go

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.470
to Alex Young's talk prior
to the fabulous eclipse

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.430
that occurred across America.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.360
And so here's a follow-up.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.240
We're going to talk about what
we learned during the eclipse.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.900
Not everything that we
learned during the eclipse,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.060
but at least it gives
you an idea

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.640
that we can actually do
some really new science.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.510
So, we'll be talking
about that great eclipse.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.360
Then I want to change gears
a little bit and we're going

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.500
to be talking about how we use
eclipses to learn new things

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.950
about the solar system, and set
ourselves up to learn even more

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.520
than our originally planned
for many of our missions.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.930
And then of course
eclipses are one

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
of the critical ways we
actually find planets

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.910
in other solar systems,
so we'll talk

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.330
about what we've
learned from that.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.390
So we have a number of
really spectacular sets

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.200
of science that we do.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.020
And of course we'll start with
the great eclipse of 2017.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.520
You know what's really
spectacular

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.670
about these eclipses,
you know you would think

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.990
that we've learned
everything that we need to know

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.570
about the sun and that we
can learn from eclipses.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.180
Since they occur
somewhere on this globe

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.090
about every 18 months, okay?

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.450
But in reality when NASA
goes to eclipse they will go

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.860
to a couple sites, they will set
up several sets of experiments

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.450
and then they will
execute those experiments.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.040
But the 2017 eclipse
provided us an opportunity

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.100
that was just too good to pass
up because we had all kinds

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.290
of things that we did
during this eclipse.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.190
If I could say it this way,
NASA really owned this event

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.450
in the sense that we did
some really great things.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.820
So, here's a little
animation, of course this cut

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.570
across the United States,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.770
what you see are how
the sun would look

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.010
at different locations
along the path of totality.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.190
Path of totality
is that red stripe.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.540
We did a lot of work
in terms of analyzing

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.590
who in America could have seen
the eclipse, and the results

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.550
of that are absolutely
astounding.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.010
154 million America's -
million American adults

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.710
since we couldn't survey
kids watched it live, okay?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.440
20 million traveled to see
it, they were in far reaches

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.780
of the United States, which
couldn't see any part of it,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.560
but then came - many of them
came to the area of totality.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.060
61 million viewed it either over
the internet, which we supported

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.400
or through the TV for which we
had broadcast stations all along

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.910
the eclipse path.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.750
And that results in 88% of the
American adults saw the eclipse

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.400
in some way, shape
or form, all right?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.060
It's truly a phenomenal event.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.550
It's - for NASA it really
started just before we hit the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.620
shadow hit the United States.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.820
We had planes out.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.070
These planes were
carrying instruments

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.570
that will probably end up
on satellites in the future.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.440
And here was a perfect
opportunity

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.890
to test their sensitivity as we
look right at various features

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.450
of the sun because we can black
out the main light of the sun,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.380
we can see these
fine detailed images.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.570
And so here's a little movie
of the eclipse shadow coming

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.090
in over the Pacific as it then
entered the United States.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.010
And then instruments could - to
look at the sun and really look

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.810
at a lot of the fine details
of the lower atmosphere.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.640
We observed this eclipse through
the eyes of many telescopes,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.170
from many satellites, and
in many different ways.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.780
So here's an image shot
of our lunar mission,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.440
the lunar recognizance orbiter,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.100
that's orbiting the moon
looked back at the earth

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.890
and saw the shadow as it was
crossing the United States.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.490
And what it tells you when you
look at this, how lucky we were

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.520
as a nation to be able
to have such a large area

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.570
of the United States clear for
us to be able to really look at,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.610
and enjoy the eclipse.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.490
So how many were
in the clear areas?

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.890
How many actually had an
opportunity to see it?

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.470
So my - my quick look looks
like that's 88% of the audience.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.670
So very - very good.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.450
Nose from spacecraft that were
dedicated to look at the sun,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.670
of course you had to be
along the eclipse path

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.190
to see totality.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.260
But many of them of course,
saw different things,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.060
so here's the moon moving
in front of the sun as seen

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.770
from one of our major
spacecraft that is looking

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.510
at the upper atmosphere
of the sun.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.580
This would be - this
would be the - the Corona.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.610
So this area is really
actually high above the sun.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.870
The surface of the sun,
if you were to put the sun

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.810
in this image it would be a
globe that would be smaller

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.830
than the edges of
this - of this frame

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.000
because this light is coming
from a region that's higher

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.390
up in the atmosphere, okay?

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.220
And so what we want to do of
course is we want to tease

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.400
out what's happening just
above the surface of the sun.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.500
Now from our spacecraft we look
at the atmosphere of the sun,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.390
this is the extended
atmosphere of the sun.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.950
It's called Corona.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:41.090
And the Corona is as shown
here, this is one of the best

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.040
from our spacecraft
that we can do.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.250
So, here's - we have an
occulting disc that we put

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.140
in front of it and we make
measurements all the time.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.490
And we see coronal
mass ejections,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.880
we see all kinds of things.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.640
And the light that you're seeing
is actually material that's

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.940
leaving the sun.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.590
The sun constantly
outgasses in all direction.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.300
And there's all kinds
of dust that is left in

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.950
and around this area
as comets come in

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.060
and are disintegrated
by the sun's light.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.830
Some survive, but many don't.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.310
And so this area is
just full of dust.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.720
And that dust enables
the scattering of light

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.060
that gives us this image.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.220
So this is really very
low light compared

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.550
to the very bright
disc of the sun.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.880
Now if I were to put the actual
globe of the sun on this image,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.580
it would look like that.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:43.500
So, what we're not seeing is
everything that's below the red

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.930
and to the surface of the sun.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.820
And this is really
the atmosphere just

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.540
above its surface.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.130
And then it purges into
that - that corona.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.590
And this area is
called the chromosphere,

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.430
the atmosphere is
called the chromosphere.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.630
So indeed we want to
be able to look at that

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.620
and the eclipses provide the
perfect opportunity to do that.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.580
What we want to do and try to
understand how active the sun is

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:20.890
over time, is to use our massive
compute capability to be able

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.890
to really model this area.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.340
It's full of magnetic fields.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.960
These magnetic fields
are very strong,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.530
and they either allow hot
gasses that come up from the sun

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.220
to return to the sun, or
to come up from the sun,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.530
go into the corona and then get
accelerated and blast it out.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.160
They also - this region
has all sorts of phenomena

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.910
where coronal mass
ejections start.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.420
This is where magnetic fields
close together creating huge

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.710
bubbles of atmosphere and
just like your boiling pot,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.290
they become buoyant and
they pop off the globe

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.320
and move into the solar wind.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.160
And those bubbles will
go all over the place.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.810
And when they come and hit the
earth it really wreaks havoc

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.340
with the earth's magnetic field

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:22.380
and we always receive aurora
during coronal mass ejections.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.020
And so here's our model,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.730
so there's the magnetic field
we modeled before the event.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:33.560
Here is that upper part of the
atmosphere we called the corona,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.310
and what we want to do is look
below that and then here's a -

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.160
here's that brightness
distribution

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.930
and polarized light allowing us
to tease out the kind of gasses

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.830
that are circulating in
these magnetic fields.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.990
And then that produces
these two images.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.210
One is a model done
in a computer

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:03.750
and the other one is
what everyone saw, okay?

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.020
And just to tell you
which one is which,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.990
the lower one is the real one.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.670
And so we're doing quite
well with the modeling.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.290
We're getting there.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.640
If we really have any
hope of understanding

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.250
and predicting space
weather, these are the -

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.700
the coronal mass ejections and
flares that occur to the sun

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.010
that when they are directed

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:34.370
to the earth can actually wreak
havoc on our electronic devices

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.330
and even our power grids.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.670
Then this is a fundamental
thing to do.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.250
So we made major progress
in this particular eclipse.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.270
And then of course there's
the absolute beautiful images

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:53.310
that comes from an event like
this, that everyone enjoys.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.910
That was just one of many things
we learned during the eclipse,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.390
but I want to move on and
talk about how we use eclipses

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.530
to explore the solar
system and do a variety

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.740
of really important
and unique ways.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.600
And if I can start with a
Cassini at Saturn, okay?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:19.700
Cassini was orbiting
Saturn for about 13 years.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.380
The Saturn has the
beautiful rings

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.030
and it was making
unbelievable discoveries.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.390
What we would call
transformational

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.800
science discoveries.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.860
And one of these is the
moon Titan, all right?

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.190
Titan is a fabulous
moon of Saturn.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.110
This particular moon
is - has an atmosphere.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.120
That atmosphere actually
is twice as dense

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.670
as ours on its surface.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.480
It's made mostly of nitrogen and
it has a variety of trace gasses

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.920
of methane and ethane
and other gasses.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.110
This body is so big it's
larger than the planet Mercury.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.050
It's larger than a planet
- the planet Mercury.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.050
And if it wasn't orbiting Saturn
and it was orbiting the sun,

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.020
we would call it a planet.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.570
I mean this is really
a very special object.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.900
It's special also because
it is the only other body

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.070
in the solar system besides
the earth that has liquid

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.990
on its surface, and a lot of it.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:34.480
Okay? But that's not liquid
water; it's liquid methane.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.310
And so water is important
for life.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.250
And the new concept is if
we want to look at places

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:47.630
where there might be alternate
types of life, you need a liquid

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.710
as part of the metabolic
process.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.850
We use water in ingesting
food; it helps the process

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.450
of extracting the
energy from that food.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.630
And then water is used for
eliminating the waste, okay?

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.050
That process is a
fundamental one that's part

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.070
of our definition of life.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.890
And so we want to go to places
where there are liquids.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.620
This one in particular
if there's life

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:22.260
on this moon it's got to be very
different than our life, okay?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.450
And there's a whole field of
study called weird life, okay?

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.180
That's what they call it.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:34.050
Call it weird life where they're
studying these alternate types

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:39.090
of life that would use methane
in substitute for water.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:45.710
So that means that Titan
has a potential for life.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.680
And so we want to protect it.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.600
Another moon that we discovered
which is on the right;

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.160
Enceladus is a small moon,
much smaller than Titan.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.370
It's actually only about 300
kilometers in size, on the order

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.290
of the width of California
for instance.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:10.940
And this particular moon we
found really walls of water.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.240
It looked like geysers,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.080
they looked like individual
events that are occurring.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.530
But when we looked at them
up close it's really from -

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.930
emanating from these
cracks from Enceladus.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:27.510
These are literally walls of
water pouring out of the moon

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.630
and it does it all the time.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.110
Anywhere in its orbit,
these cracks are active

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.590
and the water is pouring out.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:42.510
It turns out 95% of the water
falls back down on the moon,

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.180
but there is a small
percentage that escapes it

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.080
and then ends up
orbiting Saturn.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.960
So, because as I mentioned
the importance of water

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.440
as it's connected to life,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.700
then this is a moon we
need to protect too.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.820
Now Cassini, when we launched it
we did not develop the planetary

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:08.490
protection procedures necessary
to keep it completely clean,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.890
you know, so it's got human
microbes all over it, all right.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.950
Even though we develop
it in clean rooms

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:22.940
and that it's important to keep
what we call this bio-burden.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.060
This - this human cells
and life off of it.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.760
We recognize that if Cassini
were to crash into one

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.480
of these moons it might
affect the potential for life

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.800
on these moons in
important ways,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.640
and we just couldn't
afford to let that happen.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.730
So over time, over time it
was brought to my attention

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:55.620
that we have an opportunity
to dispose of Cassini.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:02.910
Here is a series of
trajectories for Cassini

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.030
as you can see in blue.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.330
They're really wild.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:12.440
Typically we'll orbit
in a plain,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.820
but you can see these
trajectories are

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.040
out of the plain and they're
going in different directions.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.310
And there are certain
nodal areas,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:25.810
there are certain locations
that are like right here

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:30.590
where a whole series of these
orbits cross and that turns

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.420
out to be where Titan
ends up at the right place

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.980
at the right time, giving
us a gravity assist,

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.770
allowing us to change the
orbit, change the velocity

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.960
and therefore, really
make a major difference

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.400
in - in its trajectory.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.680
And surveying a much broader
part of the Saturn system.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.840
We did that very effectively.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.220
A set of orbits were
calculated that clearly

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.500
as shown in the yellow here.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.860
If we could get the
right gravity assist

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.910
from Titan we could just go
on the outside of the rings

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.920
and then another gravity assist
would put us inside the rings.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.440
In other words between the
cloud tops and the lower -

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.030
the first part of the
ring, the lowest part

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.770
of the ring closest to Saturn.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:31.420
This was really exciting
and enabled us then to come

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.580
up with a plan that would
allow Cassini to end its life

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.080
as its fuel was running
out into Saturn.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.070
And not - and not have the
possibility of it after it ran

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.500
out of fuel, hitting
one of these moons,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.680
one of these precious moons.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.300
So that was proposed by the
project and I am the one

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.050
that signed off on it
to end Cassini's life.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.790
The scenario is 42 short orbits

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.240
from November 16
to September 17.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:15.330
And then 20 orbits of that 42
were what we call F ring orbits

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.870
just outside the F ring.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:22.170
And then 22 grand finale
orbits which are inside;

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.080
so the F ring orbits are here.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.300
The yellow and the
blue are the last set

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.610
of the 22 grand finale orbits.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:36.920
All right, so how are we going
to do this and do it safely?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.320
This area is full of
ring material, okay?

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.210
And ring material that you run
into can affect the spacecraft,

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:51.100
can affect it to the point
of even knocking it out.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.910
So we had to be really careful.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.660
So the start of figuring
out how to get in there,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.910
that was the dynamists
that we're using Titan

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.570
to allow us to do that.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.530
But now we had to
be very creative

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.780
to say well exactly where,
okay, can we go where we have -

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.970
where we can minimize
the ring particles

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.680
and then minimize
the opportunity

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.770
to damage the spacecraft
such that it would survive

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.650
because we wanted to be in
complete control to be able

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.770
to ditch it, all right?

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.490
It starts with shadows.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:33.900
The sun in this picture is
behind the planet Saturn, okay?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:40.590
This image is about an
eight or nine hour exposure

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.930
of the faintest light
that's in the Saturn system.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.610
And its light from the sun
that shines on the rings

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.320
that reflect back onto the
planet, that then reflect back

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.130
out and that's what
you're seeing.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:59.680
Now what's really spectacular is
you see all sorts of new things.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.590
Here is the orbit
of Enceladus, okay?

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:09.580
The material that is coming from
the plumes, the walls of water

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.510
that actually escape
that moon end

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.470
up orbiting the planet,
all right?

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.530
So that's not very comforting.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.670
That's just full of material.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.970
Here's the F rings, so the
first set of orbits would be

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.740
in this area right here.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.070
The next set of orbits
would be right below here.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:34.030
So, the first thing we're going
to do is figure out how to close

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.210
to the F ring we can get.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.100
We're going to take
a really good look

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.040
at this particular area
that's shown in red.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.550
Here that area is
blown up and surprise,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.610
we found a couple new rings.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:55.270
The eclipse technique is the
only way to be able to do this.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.390
So this is Janice
and Epimetheus,

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.070
this is a brand new
ring right here we saw.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.000
Pallene ring, this
is the Enceladus ring

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.870
and there's the G ring.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.490
And so we want - we
want to get in here.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.370
So this looks like the
best place right here,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.340
all right based on
scattered light, okay?

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.480
This is all scattered
light, the ring material

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.000
and this looks like the darkest.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.010
That must have the lowest
number of particles.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.780
Now those particles may be the
size of baseballs or bigger,

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.320
and very few of them which would
still give you that dark area.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.530
But we're taking a
chance on that, okay?

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.110
So if we laid out the
rings and distance

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.830
from the cloud tops we
decided then here's the set

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.630
of the first orbits
we want to go to.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.740
This is the clear area.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.540
And then from these images
we also decided okay,

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.070
we got to hug the planet
cloud tops, all right?

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:59.540
So this ring material actually
is falling into the planet.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.900
We're really very lucky
to be living in a time

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.980
where these rings exist.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.900
Because in reality the
ring material is falling

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.010
into Saturn, okay?

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.350
It's dissipating over time.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:18.960
And so this particular area
we decided it was the darkest

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.150
in our images, we could
probably get away with flying

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.930
through here, being hit by
a number of ring particles.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.810
But perhaps the flux
of material raining

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.280
down from the rings
is low enough

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.990
that we could survive that.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.120
So that's the - that's
the process.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:45.600
And of course we executed
that in a spectacular way.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.540
Now what we found when we did
this is from that vantage point

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:56.450
over the pole some spectacular
images of these smaller moons

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.210
that we could only see from
afar, here's what they look

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.540
like from a Ravioli
looking moon,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.350
which this actually
is ring material.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.620
So the orientation of this
image is a little awkward,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.120
but you know the camera takes
it, you use it but the -

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.870
this belly band actually
is in the ring plain.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:25.630
So as ring materials moving
from one part of the ring

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:30.520
into a different ring, it's
crossing this area in pan.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.490
This moon picks it up, okay?

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.430
It will pick it up and
accrete it, all right?

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.440
And so here's another one Atlas,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.560
this also is embedded
in the rings.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.320
And this is a set
of ring material.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:51.660
Atlas has an orbit that's not
quite completely co-plainer

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.890
with the rings, it's
at a slight angle

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.600
and so the ring material has an
opportunity to be sloshed all

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.700
over it as you can see here.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.450
And then several
of these objects,

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.670
like this on in particular
Helena I believe is the name

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.110
of it - can't quite
see it from here.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.210
That looks like a comet.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.380
This looks like what we've seen
before when we fly by comets.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.080
So these big objects
Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.300
Neptune they must also
be capturing comets

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.090
as they have gone
along and orbited.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.940
So those are just
some of the surprises.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.710
And of course, we
flew over the pole.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.500
Here's the north pole of Saturn

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:40.000
and we see this spectacular
hexagon pattern, okay?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.200
This is absolutely spectacular.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.220
Now this is the size
of a couple earth's.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:51.110
So one earth could be like here
and another earth and size here.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.290
So this is just an
enormous region.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.320
We really don't' understand
this hexagon very well.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.860
How come it's set up
in the atmosphere?

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.300
It's a jet stream, okay?

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.120
And in fact, we've
recognized now

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.640
that this is probably
a little higher

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.440
than the surrounding
clouds, okay?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.980
Down here at lower latitudes.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.490
This is of course, what
we would call hurricane.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:23.280
The one that's coming this way
would be itty bitty compared

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.400
to the size of this one, okay?

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.880
Yeah that's comforting.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.150
And then this particular feature

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.990
which is another spectacular
feature we've taken a really

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.340
good look at and you can
see based on the shadows

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.160
that these are beautiful
cloud structures swirling

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.460
around the pole.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.570
This is exactly the
pole of Saturn.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.070
And indeed these cloud
structures like cumulus clouds,

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.030
just reach way up into the sky.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:03.170
And so this is the cloud
dynamists were just really

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:08.770
enjoying the observations that
were made in these dynamics

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.060
that they're seeing now.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.740
Now this is an artist conception
of what happened in pretty much

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.720
in the final orbit and indeed
because we had on the order

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.200
of 22 orbits that we did,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.260
the last orbit was the
last little kiss by Titan

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.760
and it enabled it then to
shorten the orbit well enough

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.280
to begin to enter
the atmosphere.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.520
This is indeed what happens,

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.950
the spacecraft would
burn up on its way in.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.360
But we put in the process,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.740
executed the antenna
hold process such that

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.080
as the spacecraft was going

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.990
in it was communicating back the
data - back the data to earth,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.230
and going through the
atmosphere and being moved

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.540
around in the atmosphere and
would constantly fire it's jet

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.920
and reacquire the earth,

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.200
make sure we got -
we got the data back.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.570
We got some unbelievable
spectacular upper atmospheric,

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:14.450
ionospheric profiles and data
that were really astounding

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.960
and - and some of the
chemistry is quite different

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.360
that we ever expected.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.110
I don't know why we didn't
think of this but indeed

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.810
as the ring materials flowing

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:28.460
into the planet it's
creating a rain

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.890
of organic material that's
falling onto this body.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:37.640
And so the chemistry
is really exotic, okay?

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.030
That we found and so this
is actually a mosaic made

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.510
up of quite a few images,

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:49.560
but the last orbit just
before it went around and then

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.430
into the planet on
the other side.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.810
And as you can see the sun,
the sun is on that far side.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:57.950
And the earth is
not in view here,

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.500
but is definitely would be able

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.090
to see the spacecraft
in that final orbit.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.770
That's how we organized it.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.880
And it was just a
spectacular event.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:14.450
That whole event was
a broadcasted live.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:21.000
And the Cassini outreach
team won an Emmy this weekend

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.040
for that live broadcast.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.720
It was done so well.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.560
It was sprinkled in with
a variety of interviews

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.640
and some emerging science that
was coming out, we were talking

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.500
about that and in and
out of the control room,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:42.120
and it was quite an
emotional event for many of us

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.690
because this spacecraft had
done so much for us to learn

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.950
about these gas giants.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.320
So I'm just thinking
back of course.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.380
New horizons, now here's
another planetary mission,

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.680
flew by Pluto.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.460
Let me go back here.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:09.320
What you may not know is this
mission was launched 2006,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:17.180
January of 2006, encountered
Pluto July 14, 2015, all right?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.540
When it was launched
we didn't really know

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.020
where Pluto was, all right?

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.560
Now that sounds pretty strange;

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.730
what do you mean we didn't
know where it was, okay?

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.470
We used Kepler's Laws.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.970
Kepler's Law tell us
where planets are.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.670
And for Kepler's
Laws to work we have

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:40.070
to watch the body make a
complete orbit, all right?

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:46.370
So one orbit of Pluto is on
the order of you know 248 years

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.140
and we just discovered it
85 years ago, all right?

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.060
So we had a piece of the orbit
and we can draw 1,000 orbits

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.020
between those observations,
all right?

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.480
Now when we flew by
Pluto because it was four

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.540
and a half hours light travel
time from the spacecraft

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:12.490
to us we had to have
everything on automatic pilot.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.090
So, when we said okay point
your camera and take a picture

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.140
of Pluto and we pointed
it, Pluto better be there.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.620
Okay? And if it's off by 1,000
kilometers we'd be looking

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.430
at sky, all right?

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:30.750
So how were we going
to solve that?

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.050
How are we going to solve that?

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.000
We're going to start solving
these things by looking

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.530
at precise measurements
of where it's at, okay?

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.950
And it starts with occultations.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:48.660
An occultation are when as
we see the body you know move

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.990
in the solar system and there
are stars in the background

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:56.140
that are much further away,
they pass in front of that star,

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.880
that star light goes away.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.940
And by timing it we can
get idea of all kinds

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.250
of things whether the body has
an atmosphere, its distances,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:12.480
its size, whether there's
moons, whether there's debris,

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.700
understanding if there's
debris in the way.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.240
We could be flying by Pluto
and get smacked by all sorts

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.420
of smaller debris that you
just can't possibly see.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.240
We can hardly see Pluto itself,
you know which is on the order

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.030
of 2,000 kilometers in size, you
know like the state of Texas.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.750
It's a country of its own right.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:38.070
So, we had an opportunity
using Sophia

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.660
to take an occultation
measurement.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.340
And so what you do in these
measurements is you sit there

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.820
and look at Pluto, study
it, watch it move, okay.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.600
And then have it pass
in front of a star.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.720
And so here's the star light
that we're steadily measuring

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.010
and all of a sudden
Pluto starts to pass

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.610
in front of it, down it goes.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:03.490
And then it comes back.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.900
Now this is what we saw.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.360
If Pluto did not have
an atmosphere at all,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.320
this would be what we
call a square wave.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.800
It would follow that black line,
go right down, go right back up,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.860
that's what - that's
what we should see.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.800
If it didn't' have
an atmosphere.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.220
But it does.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.250
And so that atmosphere starts

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.720
to attenuate what we call reduce
the light from the star, okay?

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.570
As we see it, and in this
configuration so down it goes.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:37.260
And then when that star is
directly behind the planet it

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.760
illuminates the atmosphere,
so the light comes -

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.260
bends around the
atmosphere and we get

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.030
to see this little flash, okay?

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:48.400
So this flash right
here tells us also a lot

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.700
about the atmosphere too,

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.510
and then we get the
compliment on the other side.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.470
These were critically
important observations,

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.130
that plus many other
observations including Hubble,

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:05.710
including New Horizons which
would take navigation images

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.090
as it's moving towards
the target and allowing us

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.990
to triangulate it, gave
us a really good idea

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:12.320
as to where Pluto was.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.050
And of course, this is
the spectacular body.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:21.270
It surprised me and I'm
not easy to surprise

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.900
but this is an active body.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.460
Its atmosphere is
modifying its surface.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:32.380
This heart region that we see,
actually this is an impact

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.080
for which the atmosphere's
collapsed into it.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.280
Pluto's atmosphere
is largely nitrogen

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.510
and so this is nitrogen snow,
ices that end up in this area.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.460
That actually move on the
surface like toothpaste.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.690
You know it's not as solid.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:56.190
And then - and then there's
all sorts of these dark regions

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.160
that we then had an opportunity
to really get a good idea

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.340
as to what the chemistry
of those areas are.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.630
But one of the things that
we absolutely plan to do

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.690
when we flew by Pluto and
got on the other side is

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:18.020
to take this image, okay, this
is Pluto in our rearview mirror

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.330
and the sun is directly
behind it.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.910
And it is illuminating
the atmosphere just

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.110
like the occultation
image from Sophia.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.970
And this enabled us then to
then take a really good look

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.530
and high resolution of what
this atmosphere looked like

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.760
and it's banded, and then
we could get composition

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.280
and all kinds of
information about it.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.930
Now as Evista, when you look at
this you know this is glacial.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.430
These are high mountains.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:57.280
I don't see any craters
in any of this, all right?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.060
You couldn't go any
place on the moon,

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.270
certainly over the scale
length and much smaller even

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.280
without finding craters.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.710
Now that doesn't mean
this body hasn't been hit.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.550
It's been hit plenty of times.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.450
It should look more
moon like than it does.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:19.320
And this is why we know this
body is very active still today.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:25.200
And the atmosphere and land
interactions are quite strong

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.080
and it's modifying the
surface of the planet.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.610
One of the exciting things was
we could look at the atmosphere

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:39.870
and what we found out is
the methane that Pluto has

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.350
from sunlight and
also from hitting -

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.670
being hit by solar wind
creates new molecules, ethaline,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.360
acetylene and these are chains.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.100
And these chains
can come together

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.370
and when they get heavy enough
as they - as they continue

00:37:55.370 --> 00:38:00.020
to combine they will drop
to the surface of the planet

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.070
and that means it will
snow these compounds.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.890
And we call these complex
carbon compounds tholins.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.030
And we can actually go in
laboratory and make them, okay?

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.590
We know - we know
what they consist of.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.880
And in fact, when
- when you look

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:23.160
at Pluto here is the regions

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.710
where tholins continually
snow out.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:32.060
This turns out to be close to
the equatorial band of Pluto.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.530
The pinkish colors now
we're coloring Pluto based

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.870
on composition.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:42.580
The pinkish colors actually
are water, there's a lot

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.890
of water on its surface.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.370
It's frozen.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:49.580
It's frozen so solid it's
harder than granite, okay?

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.890
Harder than granite
here on earth.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.090
We see all kinds
of ammonia snows,

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.850
and then we can see
the carbon monoxide

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.520
and the nitrogen snows too.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.550
So really spectacular and it's

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:06.590
because of the occultation
technique

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.780
that helped us find it, and
the occultation technique

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.730
that helped us even
do more research

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.680
on the atmosphere of Pluto.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.380
Now we're moving on to another
object, New Horizons is going

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:23.300
to fly by a smaller building
block, a Pluto like objects;

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:29.260
it's called - when it was
found in 2014 by Hubble,

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.780
no ground based telescope
can see it.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.680
Only Hubble has been able
to see this object, okay?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.500
And so this is the nomenclature
of anything you find starts

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.260
with the date, the letters

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.090
and numbers are all
about calendar time.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:53.040
And so this was seen in October
of 2014, it's called MU69

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.230
and we had a contest
as to what to name it

00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:00.220
at least provisionally and
it's provisional name is called

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.140
ultima thule, okay?

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:10.590
So what we found is that MU69
is it's moving in its orbit

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.510
because we don't really
know where it is either.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.510
You know this is going to be,
you know 380-400 year orbit

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.890
and we just found it in 2014,
just four years ago, okay?

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:25.090
So we're going to have to
use every trick in the book

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.640
if we're going to repay figure
out where this object is

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.500
so we can fly by
it and not miss it.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.370
Okay? So we found out that there
are with the star back ground,

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.680
opportunities to
do occultation's.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.220
What we know about this region
of space called Kuiper Bet

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.070
for which - for which
Pluto is a member

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.890
of the Kuiper Belt is there's
tens of thousands of objects,

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:55.810
Pluto-like objects and objects
like this building blocks

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.770
of Pluto's and many of them are
binary, are multiple objects.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.670
30% of these are viewed
as multiple objects.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:10.570
And so if this then works out
we can watch an occultation.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.310
Even though we can't see the
object, if we can just look

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.400
at the star and watch the
light go away, that object had

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.080
to be moving in front of it
blocking that light, okay?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.740
Even though we can't
see the object.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.600
Last year 2017 we had
three occultation's.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.550
Here they are as they
are over the globe, okay?

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:39.180
As you can see, we don't have a
lot of land to go to, all right.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.820
So Sophia actually we used
Sophia to go out in the ocean

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.200
and get this one and then we set
up observations in South America

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.060
and South Africa and then
South America for each

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.120
of these occultation's.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.800
And this was really hard to do.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.010
Now how you do this
is you calculate

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.330
where you think this shadow
is going to be as it races

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:09.010
across the country at
53,000 miles an hour, okay?

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:13.320
And you create a picket
fence of telescopes, okay?

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.900
So here's the telescopes
and they're -

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.990
each of these are
looking at the star, okay?

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:23.960
And you're hoping that that
shadow that you're only backing

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.460
out and guessing where
it's going to be based

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.020
on your best calculations
and the knowledge of position

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:34.150
of that star, casting
that shadow

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.720
so you want this picket
fence to be long enough

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.290
so that you actually catch
the winking of the star.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.600
Now here's the telescopes.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.780
The stars are bright
enough that the telescope

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.360
like this works great.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.770
And it's all about timing.

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:53.660
It's all about taking
measurements of star image,

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.260
you know what's it's intensity
over and over and over again,

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.130
many, many, many, many times
per second in the hopes that -

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.380
that it will wink,
it will wink at you.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.140
It will come and go.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.640
And then you get that timing.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.470
So here's from one

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:13.370
of the telescopes
looking at the star field.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:19.510
So has everyone seen
where MU69 is?

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.730
Right here in the center
and it passes right in front

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.030
of that star, and
the star winks.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.530
Okay? That's it.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.830
Now we know where it's at.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.880
And the picket fence you know
many of these telescopes saw it.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.660
When we put the observations
together from these telescopes

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:44.190
so - so here's the set of
observations where it winked,

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.990
so that's one telescope.

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:49.160
Another one, another
one, another one,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.010
if we had a telescope here
sometimes we have operational

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.700
problems, sometimes
they're cloudy,

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.760
sometimes it just
doesn't work for us.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.340
And then we got another one.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.850
So here's the original
data, all right?

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:05.010
Now you're going to try to
figure out what this object is.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.720
Is it - does it look like
this or does it look -

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.330
is it actually two objects.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.850
Is it actually like the rest
of the Kuiper Belt objects

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.310
where they're binaries?

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.820
There's several of them.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.750
Now that's important because
that means this stuff is

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.050
still accreting.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.630
They're still trying
to come together

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.950
and there's probably
debris all over the place.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:29.680
So that's kind of a
tough thing to swallow.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.790
So here's an artist conception
of what they might look like,

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:42.010
but we're flying by Ultima thule
on January 1, 2019, all right?

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.770
And when we observe it, it
will be the first time we will

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:49.060
observe a building
block of Pluto.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.540
This is a very different
building block,

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.260
than a building block
of the earth, all right?

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.900
These will be made
mostly of ices, all right.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:04.640
And this particular object we
believe, if its two as we see,

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.110
we don't quite know the size,
but if it's one object it's

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:11.730
on the order of 30
kilometers in size, all right?

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.770
Okay which is much smaller

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.790
than even Enceladus
at 300 kilometers.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.060
All done by occultation's.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.400
All right.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.850
Other ways we use shadows, we'll
talk about eclipses, all right?

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.810
So we have a telescope
called Kepler.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:35.360
It looks at star light
and it makes a measurement

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.450
of the brightness of that light.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.960
And when it drops like this,

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.860
then an object is
past in front of it.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.820
And the bigger the object,
the bigger the drop, okay?

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:52.210
And it's that technique that
tells us about exoplanets.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:57.040
Tells us about planets
orbiting other stars, all right.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.290
And Kepler does that by
looking at 120,000 stars all

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:06.080
at once, all the time.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.380
And it did it for nearly
two years, all right?

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:15.590
From that data we then started
to call out of that what kind

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.710
of planets are they,
how big are they?

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:19.660
Now as you can see the depth

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:24.700
of that curve tells
us about the size.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:30.700
The orbit can be calculated
based on how long -

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:36.400
how long that reduced
intensity was, all right?

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.490
So the further the planet
is away, the slower it moves

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.930
and therefore the longer
it takes for it to come

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.110
across the disc of the planet.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.070
And so the light will be
low for longer periods

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.870
of time the further
the orbit is away.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:55.400
So we can get size and
we can get orbit, okay?

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.390
And of course we
can also get number.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.130
So if we plot the
number of planets

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.980
that Kepler has been observing
during this time period

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:08.890
and their size, here's
the distribution.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.980
To me this is shocking,
all right?

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.450
It's shocking because I felt

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.460
that what we would see would
be planets that are dominated

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.460
by Jupiter size objects, okay?

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.510
Here's Jupiter, all right?

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.600
Now here are earth size objects.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.670
So at any - any solar system

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:37.410
that you go exo solar system
you know, we are equally likely

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:42.810
to find Jupiter as we are an
earth sized terrestrial planet.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:47.660
But the surprise was this set
of planets right here, okay?

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.640
Huge number of planets that are
terrestrial planets that are

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.940
about one to two times the
size of the earth, okay,

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.070
and that was a shocker.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:03.800
We don't have - we don't
have a planet like that.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.950
There's no planet like
that in our solar system.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.670
These are called super earths.

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:16.340
Now we can see Neptune's -
Neptune make it a little bigger,

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:23.900
now Neptune is - as you can see
three to five times the radius

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.630
of the earth, all right?

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:30.230
You can create these gas planets
that are further away from the -

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.530
further away from Jupiter.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:32.830
We had no problem with that.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.510
We did - suspected there'd
be a range of gas planets.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.220
But super earths are
completely different objects.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:47.180
So we now know that they're
terrestrial planets and the -

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.350
when we follow up with
other observations

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.670
and can find the density

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.100
of these planets then
our models tell us some

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:58.120
of these planets
are water worlds.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.790
That there's huge oceans on
many of these bodies, okay?

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:08.590
So an earth has a core,
mantle and a crust.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.000
In a similar way we expect super
earth's that are made close

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.980
to the parent start be
primarily earth-like all rocky,

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:22.340
and of course even though there
are one to two times the size

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.320
of the earth, the density
might be as much as 10 times

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.240
that of the earth, okay?

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.250
So talk about heavy, all right?

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.350
You know bodies are very heavy -

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:39.170
gravity on the surface is
very much higher than ours.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.710
And then there are those

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.880
for which the density
tells us there has

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.000
to be an extended envelope.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.360
This is an artist conception, so
the ocean isn't really that big

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.700
but it's an ocean atmosphere

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:57.900
because it will be evaporation
going on and an extended region

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.380
but covering the planet.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:03.570
So these super earth's are
generated further from the star

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.950
where water could actually exist

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:09.690
without being boiled
off or frozen out.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:13.640
So pretty - pretty
spectacular planet.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.590
So why won't we have
a super-earth?

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.070
Well we don't know.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:22.030
We don't' know but it's probably
because of Jupiter, all right?

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:27.110
Jupiter has robbed us of
another planet that was forming

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.880
that would have been
in the asteroid belt.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.220
The asteroids that we have that
exist in the region between Mars

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.960
and Jupiter are trying
to become a planet.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.690
But Jupiter robs them
of that opportunity

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:46.100
because as they crash and then
reform into a bigger body,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.000
they crash disperse,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.150
but Jupiter's gravity
pulls these parts away

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.510
and makes them more
difficult to get together.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.780
And that's why they haven't come
together because of Jupiter.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:03.070
It's also because - Mars is
a rut because of Jupiter too.

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:08.010
Mars is a terrestrial planet
much smaller than the earth.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.490
Now if we didn't have Jupiter,

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.250
we may have had a
super-earth there, okay?

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:18.750
And if it's a super-earth there
trying to create a space program

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.670
to go to a super-earth
land, rove, look at it

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:26.360
and for human exploration
to get off of it,

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.760
that would be really difficult.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.380
So in a way thank
goodness for Jupiter

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:36.320
because it's made Mars a runt
and made it accessible to us.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.320
We can land on it, we can walk
around and we can leave it.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.700
We can actually blast
off from that planet

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.690
without having the
infrastructure we have

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.330
at Cape Canaveral.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:58.080
So other - in the future for
eclipses are really shown here.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.290
This is an eclipse in
our own solar system.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:03.060
This is Venus.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.700
This is our sun.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.500
An indeed you can see the
sunlight illuminating the

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.290
atmosphere as it is
bent around the planet.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:17.640
And it's during these times
we want to take a spectra.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.610
It's during these times we want
to tease out what it looks like,

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.840
would it look like Mars,
would it look like Earth,

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.390
would it look like Venus.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:29.380
So our future missions to
really look for exoplanets

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.620
with atmospheres and then
what those atmospheres are

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.680
and whether they
could be habitable

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.460
with life is indeed
going to be done

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.760
in these eclipses,
just like this.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.030
And so here would be a
detailed spectra of earth

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:51.920
in that same position where we
can tease out of it all sorts

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.790
of variations in that
spectra attributed to life.

00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.150
So our future missions are
really going to be moving

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.720
in that particular area.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:08.190
So finally, let me end with
a shameless plug, okay?

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:11.220
This is my podcast, it's
called Gravity Assist,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.330
in its second season
it's pretty popular.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.520
We have an enormous
number of downloads.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.560
It's about 20 minutes long
and I talk to the scientists

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.930
of the day that are deep
into these discoveries.

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.280
They really understand
what's going on

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.540
and can explain it really well.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.500
Things that we talk about
won't be in textbooks

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.060
for perhaps a half a
decade or even a decade.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.510
And it just gives
you a great feeling

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:44.720
for how fast a whole field
is - whole field is moving.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.020
Get it on iTunes.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:48.460
You can also go to
NASA and pull it down.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.750
All right, well thank
you very much

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.780
and I hope you've enjoyed
how we use eclipses

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.510
to do some pretty
spectacular science.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:02.460
[ Applause ]

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.760
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
I'm going to blame all

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.060
of my problems on Jupiter.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.910
We'll have time for some
questions, those of you

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.650
that have to leave, leave.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.570
But a few questions
for the speaker

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:14.620
and he will repeat the question.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.310
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: Yes sir?

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:19.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Green, just curious,
we've seen photographs

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.210
of the earth and [Inaudible]
we've got [Inaudible] liquid

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:22.510
lava and [Inaudible].

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:27.510
For the sun, if we live the
science fiction we're going

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:32.720
to be able to go straight
toward the center of the sun.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.470
Is there a solid
aspect to the center

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.770
or will you pass all the way

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:38.700
through some plasma
radiating out?

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green:
It's all plasma,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.300
all the way through the center.

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.260
Yep. Now it's under
enormous pressure,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.350
and so the density
increases radically.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:51.460
So repeating the question,

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.230
is the sun have any
soli aspects of it?

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:55.530
And the answer is no.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:57.390
It's all plasma, its all gasses.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:02.370
It's just under different
pressure scenarios.

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:04.170
Yes sir.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:08.120
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: We know
the ice on Pluto is harder

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.920
than granite by going
into the laboratory,

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.640
reproducing the conditions.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.420
And freezing it.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.380
In fact, we know
water, H2O as we take it

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.650
down in temperature
it's not like -

00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:27.620
like the ice cube you
put in your drink.

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:32.700
The whole matrix of water
can get closer together

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.200
and making it harder.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.780
It readjusts itself and so we -

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.190
we have actually
several divisions

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.690
of that lattice structure.

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:45.700
We call it ice one, ice two,
ice three, ice four, okay?

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.870
And then so when you find the
temperatures and pressures

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.690
and look at the conditions,

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:55.300
the only way water can
exist is in the structures.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.040
And then reproducing

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.170
in laboratory tells us
how strong they are.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.510
Yeah. Yes sir?

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:08.440
[ Inaudible ]

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green:
The question is how -

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.490
how did we get all the nitrogen?

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.200
Why is that so abundant?

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.270
It's got to be a major part
of our collapsing cloud.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.310
Nitrogen is what we
call an inert gas.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.080
It doesn't react.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:32.110
It doesn't create whole
slew of stuff, it compounds.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.350
And so it's - it's
very important gas.

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:40.380
We have a significant
amount of it here.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.460
Venus has virtually
none, all right?

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.450
Mars has a little but not
a lot and as you go further

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.850
out in the solar
system we see a lot of -

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:51.530
a lot of these places are
dominated by nitrogen.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.890
We've been able to hang onto our
nitrogen and perhaps that's one

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:56.970
of the reasons why
we have life here.

00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:58.840
So it's actually
kind of connected

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.080
to our - to the life question.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.960
But it came from the
original collapsing cloud.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.260
Yes sir?

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.560
&gt;&gt; Kind of a culture question.

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:13.940
What are your thoughts on the
big Pluto, no planet, planet?

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.380

so what do I think

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.420
about Pluto being a planet.

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.500
So I can - I can tell you

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.540
as a NASA employee
that we don't care.

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:30.620
We don't care if the -
I'm a planetary scientist,

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:33.970
so I don't care if astronomers
run around calling it you know,

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:39.580
itty bitty dwarf planet or
whatever they want to call it.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.370
Because this object is well
worth studying in its own right.

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:47.020
But when we flew by
it and you look at it,

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.620
I am absolutely shocked
by what I saw.

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.880
It has an atmosphere.

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.250
It is an active body.

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:59.580
It is modifying its surface.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.560
I can list a gazillion
things about it

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.850
that happen just
like a planet, okay?

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:09.760
And so I think, now I'm going

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.020
to give you my personal
perspective.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.030
That whole definition needs
to be revised, relooked at.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.340
Now that we've flown by
Pluto and taken a good look

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.270
at what these objects are like.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.370
Just because it's small
doesn't mean it's -

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:26.820
it doesn't have planet
like features.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.830
And it's got a bunch of them.

00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:34.900
&gt;&gt; As Chief Scientist, perhaps
you can make that your mission.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: There's
only so much I can do.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:41.880
Yes sir?

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.660
&gt;&gt; Activity implies energy.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:49.790
If there's activity on Pluto is
most of it coming from gravity,

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:51.750
interactions with its moons?

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:54.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: So
activity implies energy;

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.850
so where is the energy on Pluto?

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:57.290
Really great question.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.590
We've been after that.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.660
So part of that is sunlight.

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.830
Another part is that it must
be coming from the interior.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:09.540
This is brought up the idea
that Pluto actually has an

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:15.930
under crust, deep in its
interior a layer of water.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:21.920
And that water is starting
to go from liquid to solid.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.330
That liberates heat and that
creates heat that's moving

00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.840
through the body, okay?

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.190
So that whole concept is
how we get to the place

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:37.110
where we believe Pluto
is a water world, okay?

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:41.690
It's got - it's got a layer
of water underneath it.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.090
Now we also believe
that that's the case

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.610
because that heart region

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:50.560
where the nitrogen ices are
is very depressed, okay?

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.650
It's where the least gravity is.

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.910
And it is exactly
opposite Sharon, okay?

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.540
And so wherever that
impact occurred,

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.940
that whole planet
shell shifted such that

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.220
that least gravity was
exactly opposite Sharon, okay?

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.430
That fits perfectly
well with that idea too.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.420
And those are exactly
the questions we answer

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:23.620
and these are the things that
we come up with to great effect,

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.450
that give us great confidence

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:28.890
that Pluto is indeed
a water world.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:30.690
Yes?

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:44.600
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: Yeah, so
what kind of tools are we using,

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.850
like on the exoplanets when
we look at an atmosphere.

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.570
How are we going to do that?

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.830
We know what to do.

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:57.270
Most of the instruments
that will make those kind

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:59.670
of measurements haven't
been developed.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.220
We have thoughts on
what they need to do

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.800
and what they need to be.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.150
And we're investing in some

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.450
of the instrumentation
in those areas.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:12.160
It's going to take several you
know, many years to be able

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.790
to develop and perfect them
and then figure out a way

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:20.380
to test them, you know
perhaps with other eclipses.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.530
We'll find a way to do that and
then - and then launch a mission

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.500
that has those kind
of instruments on it

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.160
that will really tease it out.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.610
Now we're sort of getting
close with the web telescope.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:37.340
Web telescope can look
at the atmospheres

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:40.190
of bigger planets, okay?

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.460
Because typically the bigger
planets are further away

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.880
from the suns.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.380
And the - the light that -
those planets receive are coming

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.550
from the suns, absorbed
in the atmosphere

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:53.600
and then that's a
perfect wave length regime

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.170
for web to tease out.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.700
So we'll make a huge stride
with web, particularly

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.460
on the larger planets,
but we can't quite get

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:05.120
down to an earth
size atmosphere yet.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.080
That's going to require
some technology development.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.740
&gt;&gt; One more, just one more.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.540
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: Yes sir.

[ Inaudible ]

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.000
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: So
the question is I did talk

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.320
about some pretty spectacular
discoveries, but I didn't talk

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.060
about or dwell on the discovery
of water everywhere, okay?

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.350
That's my other lecture
called the search

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:46.890
for life beyond earth.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:50.520
So perhaps next year I'll
be invited back and we'll -

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.900
then that story is
all about the water.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.000
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Okay start working on it.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.820
Maybe we'll get one
on weird life too.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.120
&gt;&gt; Dr. James Green: Well
that would be part of it.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.230
I'll talk about what we
know about weird life.

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:06.170
Yeah. Yeah that will
draw in an audience.

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:07.470

Thank you again.

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.770
