00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:02.018
Voiceover: We're now gonna talk about

00:00:02.018 --> 00:00:05.069
probably the most famous
formula in all of finance,

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.676
and that's the Black-Scholes Formula,

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.736
sometimes called the
Black-Scholes-Merton Formula,

00:00:10.736 --> 00:00:13.147
and it's named after these gentlemen.

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:14.986
This right over here is Fischer Black.

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:16.780
This is Myron Scholes.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.255
They really laid the
foundation for what led to

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.078
the Black-Scholes Model and
the Black-Scholes Formula

00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:23.526
and that's why it has their name.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:26.984
This is Bob Merton, who really
took what Black-Scholes did

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:28.533
and took it to another level

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.929
to really get to our
modern interpretations

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.254
of the Black-Scholes Model
and the Black-Scholes Formula.

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:37.333
All three of these
gentlemen would have won

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.857
the Nobel Prize in Economics,

00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:40.403
except for the unfortunate fact

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:44.394
that Fischer Black passed away
before the award was given,

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.674
but Myron Scholes and Bob Merton

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:49.256
did get the Nobel Prize for their work.

00:00:49.256 --> 00:00:51.577
The reason why this is such a big deal,

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:53.403
why it is Nobel Prize worthy,

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:54.464
and, actually, there's many reasons.

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:56.463
I could do a whole
series of videos on that,

00:00:56.463 --> 00:00:59.530
is that people have been
trading stock options,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.668
or they've been trading options
for a very, very, very long time.

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:04.370
They had been trading them,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.334
they had been buying them,

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:06.434
they had been selling them.

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:09.074
It was a major part of
financial markets already,

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:11.207
but there was no really good way

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:15.197
of putting our mathematical minds around

00:01:15.197 --> 00:01:18.073
how to value an option.

00:01:18.073 --> 00:01:21.023
People had a sense of the
things that they cared about,

00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.619
and I would assume
especially options traders

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.733
had a sense of the things
that they cared about

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.270
when they were trading options,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.185
but we really didn't have an
analytical framework for it,

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:33.075
and that's what the
Black-Scholes Formula gave us.

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:36.267
Let's just, before we dive into
this seemingly hairy formula,

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:37.468
but the more we talk about it,

00:01:37.468 --> 00:01:39.685
hopefully it'll start
to seem a lot friendlier

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:41.536
than it looks right now.

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:42.685
Let's start to get an intuition

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.020
for the things that we would care about

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.770
if we were thinking about
the price of a stock option.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.273
You would care about the stock price.

00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:53.026
You would care about the exercise price.

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:56.269
You would especially care
about how much higher or lower

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:59.270
the stock price is relative
to the exercise price.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.441
You would care about the
risk-free interest rate.

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.072
The risk-free interest
rate keeps showing up

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:05.768
when we think about taking a
present value of something,

00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:09.368
If we want to discount the value
of something back to today.

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:11.192
You would, of course, think
about how long do I have

00:02:11.192 --> 00:02:14.136
to actually exercise this option?

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:16.871
Finally, this might look a
little bit bizarre at first,

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.363
but we'll talk about it in a second.

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:22.154
You would care about how
volatile that stock is,

00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:25.472
and we measure volatility
as a standard deviation

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:28.541
of log returns for that security.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.611
That seems very fancy,

00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:33.952
and we'll talk about that in
more depth in future videos,

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:36.070
but at just an intuitive level,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.020
just think about 2 stocks.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.079
So let's say that this is
stock 1 right over here,

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.368
and it jumps around,

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:43.536
and I'll make them go flat,

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:44.476
just so we make no judgment

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:45.969
about whether it's a good investment.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.479
You have one stock that kind of does that,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.140
and then you have another stock.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.207
Actually, I'll draw them on the same,

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:54.183
so let's say that is stock 1,

00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:58.469
and then you have a
stock 2 that does this,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.751
it jumps around all over the place.

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:04.001
So this green one right
over here is stock 2.

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.605
You could imagine stock 2

00:03:05.605 --> 00:03:08.069
just in the way we use the word
'volatile' is more volatile.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.766
It's a wilder ride.

00:03:09.766 --> 00:03:13.025
Also, if you were looking at
how dispersed the returns are

00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.439
away from their mean, you see it has,

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.422
the returns have more dispersion.

00:03:17.422 --> 00:03:19.768
It'll have a higher standard deviation.

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:25.696
So, stock 2 will have a higher volatility,

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:28.423
or a higher standard deviation
of logarithmic returns,

00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:29.758
and in a future video, we'll talk about

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:32.606
why we care about log returns,

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:37.850
Stock 1 would have a lower volatility,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.380
so you can imagine,
options are more valuable

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.684
when you're dealing with,

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:45.730
or if you're dealing with a
stock that has higher volatility,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.633
that has higher sigma like this,

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:51.381
this feels like it would drive
the value of an option up.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:53.269
You would rather have an option

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.725
when you have something like this,

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:56.064
because, look, if you're owning the stock,

00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:58.013
man, you have to go after,
this is a wild ride,

00:03:58.013 --> 00:04:01.050
but if you have the option,
you could ignore the wildness,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.678
and then it might actually make,

00:04:02.678 --> 00:04:05.221
and then you could exercise the option

00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.049
if it seems like the right time to do it.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.223
So it feels like, if you
were just trading it,

00:04:10.223 --> 00:04:12.997
that the more volatile something is,

00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:17.381
the more valuable an
option would be on that.

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.431
Now that we've talked about this,

00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:21.753
let's actually look at
the Black-Scholes Formula.

00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:24.474
The variety that I have right over here,

00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:28.742
this is for a European call option.

00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:33.611
We could do something very
similar for a European put option,

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.770
so this is right over here
is a European call option,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.296
and remember, European call option,

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:41.544
it's mathematically simpler
than an American call option

00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:44.376
in that there's only one time
at which you can exercise it

00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:45.854
on the exercise date.

00:04:45.854 --> 00:04:47.177
On an American call option,

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:49.737
you can exercise it an any point.

00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:53.691
With that said, let's try to
at least intuitively dissect

00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:56.062
the Black-Scholes Formula a little bit.

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.965
So the first thing you have here,

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.152
you have this term that involved
the current stock price,

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:03.163
and then you're multiplying
it times this function

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:04.599
that's taking this as an input,

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.656
and this as how we define that input,

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.335
and then you have minus the exercise price

00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:12.655
discounted back, this discounts
back the exercise price,

00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:14.341
times that function again,

00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:16.277
and now that input is slightly different

00:05:16.277 --> 00:05:17.510
into that function.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.245
Just so that we have a
little bit of background

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:22.049
about what this function N is,

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:26.575
N is the cumulative distribution function

00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:29.095
for a standard, normal distribution.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.003
I know that seems, might
seem a little bit daunting,

00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:32.827
but you can look at the
statistics playlist,

00:05:32.827 --> 00:05:34.324
and it shouldn't be that bad.

00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:37.420
This is essentially saying for
a standard, normal distribution,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.796
the probability that your
random variable is less than

00:05:40.796 --> 00:05:43.110
or equal to x,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.486
and another way of thinking about that,

00:05:44.486 --> 00:05:45.611
if that sounds a little,

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.015
and it's all explained in
our statistics play list

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.112
if that was confusing,

00:05:49.112 --> 00:05:51.224
but if you want to think about
it a little bit mathematically,

00:05:51.224 --> 00:05:54.001
you also know that this is going to be,

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:54.991
it's a probability.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.992
It's always going to be greater than zero,

00:05:56.992 --> 00:06:00.868
and it is going to be less than one.

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:01.994
With that out of the way,

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.878
let's think about what
these pieces are telling us.

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:04.923
This, right over here,

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:10.990
is dealing with, it's
the current stock price,

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.248
and it's being weighted by
some type of a probability,

00:06:17.248 --> 00:06:20.128
and so this is, essentially,
one way of thinking about it,

00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:22.662
in very rough terms, is this
is what you're gonna get.

00:06:22.662 --> 00:06:23.702
You're gonna get the stock,

00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:25.936
and it's kind of being
weighted by the probability

00:06:25.936 --> 00:06:27.445
that you're actually
going to do this thing,

00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:29.296
and I'm speaking in very rough terms,

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:32.335
and then this term right
over here is what you pay.

00:06:32.335 --> 00:06:34.039
This is what you pay.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.219
This is your exercise
price discounted back,

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:37.871
somewhat being weighted,

00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:39.082
and I'm speaking, once again,

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.104
I'm hand-weaving a lot of the mathematics,

00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:44.074
by like are we actually
going to do this thing?

00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:47.076
Are we actually going
to exercise our option?

00:06:47.076 --> 00:06:49.186
That makes sense right over there,

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:52.323
and it makes sense if the
stock price is worth a lot more

00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:53.816
than the exercise price,

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:55.294
and if we're definitely going to do this,

00:06:55.294 --> 00:06:58.597
let's say that D1 and D2 are
very, very large numbers,

00:06:58.597 --> 00:07:01.097
we're definitely going to do
this at some point in time,

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:03.253
that it makes sense that
the value of the call option

00:07:03.253 --> 00:07:09.244
would be the value of the
stock minus the exercise price

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.186
discounted back to today.

00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:14.106
This right over here,
this is the discounting,

00:07:14.106 --> 00:07:17.790
kind of giving us the present
value of the exercise price.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.917
We have videos on discounting
and present value,

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:22.065
if you find that a little bit daunting.

00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:24.710
It also makes sense that the more,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.505
the higher the stock price is,

00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:27.542
so we see that right over here,

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:28.794
relative to the exercise price,

00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:30.268
the more that the option would be worth,

00:07:30.268 --> 00:07:33.030
it also makes sense that
the higher the stock price

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.470
relative to the exercise price,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.624
the more likely that we will
actually exercise the option.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.191
You see that in both of
these terms right over here.

00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:43.504
You have the ratio of the stock
price to the exercise price.

00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:45.839
A ratio of the stock price
to the exercise price.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.796
We're taking a natural log of it,

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:52.290
but the higher this ratio
is, the larger D1 or D2 is,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.130
so that means the larger the input

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.507
into the cumulative
distribution function is,

00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:59.609
which means the higher
probabilities we're gonna get,

00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:03.733
and so it's a higher chance
we're gonna exercise this price,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.302
and it makes sense that then

00:08:05.302 --> 00:08:07.955
this is actually going to have some value.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:08.758
So that makes sense,

00:08:08.758 --> 00:08:10.286
the relationship between the stock price

00:08:10.286 --> 00:08:12.130
and the exercise price.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.284
The other thing I will focus on,

00:08:14.284 --> 00:08:16.448
because this tends to be a deep focus

00:08:16.448 --> 00:08:18.698
of people who operate with options,

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.043
is the volatility.

00:08:20.043 --> 00:08:21.996
We already had an intuition,

00:08:21.996 --> 00:08:23.856
that the higher the volatility,

00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:25.167
the higher the option price,

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:27.722
so let's see where this factors
into this equation, here.

00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:29.484
We don't see it at this first level,

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:32.251
but it definitely factors into D1 and D2.

00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:38.185
In D1, the higher your standard
deviation of your log returns,

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.610
so the higher sigma,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.019
we have a sigma in the
numerator and the denominator,

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:43.960
but in the numerator, we're squaring it.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.767
So a higher sigma will make D1 go up,

00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:53.429
so sigma goes up, D1 will go up.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:55.181
Let's think about what's happening here.

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:56.874
Well, here we have a sigma.

00:08:56.874 --> 00:08:58.248
It's still squared. It's in the numerator,

00:08:58.248 --> 00:08:59.863
but we're subtracting it.

00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:02.049
This is going to grow faster than this,

00:09:02.049 --> 00:09:03.497
but we're subtracting it now,

00:09:03.497 --> 00:09:08.321
so for D2, a higher sigma
is going to make D2 go down

00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.739
because we are subtracting it.

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:11.337
This will actually make,

00:09:11.337 --> 00:09:12.869
can we actually say this is going to make,

00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:14.577
a higher sigma's going to make the value

00:09:14.577 --> 00:09:16.756
of our call option higher.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.124
Well, let's look at it.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.576
If the value of our sigma goes up,

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:21.985
then D1 will go up,

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:25.008
then this input, this input goes up.

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:26.260
If that input goes up,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.650
our cumulative distribution
function of that input

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.870
is going to go up, and so this term,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.226
this whole term is gonna
drive this whole term up.

00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:36.489
Now, what's going to happen here.

00:09:36.489 --> 00:09:38.587
Well, if D2 goes down,

00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:41.024
then our cumulative distribution
function evaluated there

00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:42.490
is going to go down,

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.278
and so this whole thing
is going to be lower

00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:47.889
and so we're going to have to pay less.

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:49.159
If we get more and pay less,

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:50.803
and I'm speaking in very hand-wavy terms,

00:09:50.803 --> 00:09:52.293
but this is just to understand

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:55.158
that this is as intuitively
daunting as you might think,

00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:56.957
but it looks definitively,

00:09:56.957 --> 00:09:59.074
that if the standard deviation,

00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:01.298
if the standard deviation
of our log returns

00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:02.803
or if our volatility goes up,

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:05.088
the value of our call option,

00:10:05.088 --> 00:10:08.411
the value of our European
call option goes up.

00:10:08.411 --> 00:10:10.519
Likewise, using the same logic,

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:13.375
if our volatility were to be lower,

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:18.312
then the value of our
call option would go down.

00:10:18.312 --> 00:10:19.419
I'll leave you there.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.298
In future videos, we'll think about this

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:23.250
in a little bit more depth.
