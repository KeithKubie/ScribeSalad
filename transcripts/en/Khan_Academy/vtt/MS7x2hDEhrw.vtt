00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.350
The Earth is now
starting to get closer

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.990
to being hospitable to people
like us or animals like us.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.000
In the last video, we saw
during the Proterozoic Eon,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.550
oxygen began to accumulate
in the atmosphere.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.760
This actually caused
this first snowball Earth

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.210
and this mass extinction of
all the anaerobic species.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.790
But it made conditions
suitable for eukaryotic cells.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.560
And maybe even more important,
these eukaryotic cells

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.460
were able to form
multicellular organisms.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.370
And we see where that starts
right here on this chart,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.820
on this time clock.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.262
Multicellular life
starts right over here.

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:38.220
And I want to be clear.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.180
All of these things are
a bit moving targets.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.620
As we discover more things
in the geological record

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.480
and we get more tools
at our disposal,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.674
these numbers get tweaked.

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:47.090
But they do give
you a good sense,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.980
based on our current
understanding,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.830
of when these things
start to appear.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.506
And coinciding with
multicelluar life,

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.130
and this is interesting
in it's s right

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.760
because it has its own
metalevel effect on evolution,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.565
you actually start also
having sexual reproduction.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.570
And what's interesting
about this,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.540
why this has such a big
impact on evolution--

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.130
and we talk about it a lot
in the biology playlist--

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.950
is before evolution,
variation in DNA

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.290
had to be completely dependent
really on mutations, and just

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.040
random movement around within
DNA, or maybe some viruses.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.210
Now with sexual
reproduction, you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.010
had kind of a
systematic mixing of DNA

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.390
so that you got more variation
in the gene pool, which

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.930
allowed more
selection for-- or I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.360
guess you had more
variance to select for.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.700
And so you kind of
had an acceleration

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.390
in the actual pace of evolution.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.820
So we're talking-- I've
looked at a bunch of sources

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.940
from, they say 1.2
billion, 1.5 billion,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.150
a little bit over a billion,
if you call a little bit

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.220
several million
years ago, you start

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.430
having these multicellular life
forms and sexual reproduction.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.310
The other thing that we talked
about in the Proterozoic Eon

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.590
is the accumulation of
oxygen allowed the ozone

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.460
layer to build up.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.830
Ozone is just
three oxygen atoms.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.490
It is O3.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.150
And by the end of
the Proterozoic Eon--

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.920
so we're talking, I don't know,
maybe 550 million years ago,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.270
give or take tens of,
or hundreds, or maybe

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.360
100 million years--
these are all

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440
moving targets-- the ozone
layer was dense enough

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.300
to protect the
land from UV rays.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.320
We talked about that
in the last video,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.690
that the Earth is being
bombarded with UV rays.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390
And the ozone layer
is the only thing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.430
that really keeps us from being
seriously irradiated by the Sun

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.920
and allows land animals
to actually live.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.520
And so coinciding
with that time period,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.480
around 550 million
years ago, you

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.330
start to have life colonizing,
especially significant life,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.120
colonizing land.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.017
So life colonizes land,
colonizes the land.

00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:02.100
And this was kind of an
interesting-- when I first

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.710
learned it, it was
kind of an aha moment.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.110
You always assume that
kind of trees and grasses

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.880
are kind of part
of the background.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.760
They come part and
parcel with land.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.060
But it turns out that
animals colonized land

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.870
before plants did.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.590
Plants didn't come
into the picture

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.240
until about 450 million
years ago, give or take

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.380
a few tens of millions of years.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.660
And so we're now entering the
end of the Proterozoic Eon.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.740
Life has started
to colonize land.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.275
We now have an ozone layer.

00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:36.900
And what happens--
and actually there's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.490
another snowball glaciation
or a snowball Earth

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.300
near the end of the Proterozoic
Era, Eon, I should say.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.850
And there's a bunch of theories
about why it came about.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.980
And then why disappeared.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.740
Maybe there were volcanoes,
greenhouse gases, who knows.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.730
But as we enter
the end of that, we

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.980
start seeing life
began to flourish.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.190
And it starts to
really flourish as we

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.460
enter the Phaner-- I
always have trouble

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.410
saying this-- the
Phanerozoic Eon.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.120
And it's not even labeled here.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.651
The Phanerozoic Eon is this
chunk of time right over here.

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:13.650
And let me write it out.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:22.170
So this right over here is the
Phanerozoic, the Phanerozoic

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.070
Eon.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.780
And so this chart, these
divisions right here are eons.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.430
And then they jump into,
instead of doing eons here,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.500
they then break into eras.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.446
Eras are subsets of eons.

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:35.070
They are hundreds of
millions of years.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.450
So this is the Paleozoic
Era, the Mesozoic Era,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.920
and the Cenozoic Era.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.220
And that's actually
our current era.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.420
But perhaps the most
interesting-- well,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.920
I don't want to
pick favorites here.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.800
But it's one of the
most interesting times

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.380
in the geologic era--
is the first period

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.070
in the Paleozoic Era,
which is the first era

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.010
in the Phanerozoic Eon.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.869
And that's the Cambrian period.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.160
You might have heard of it
before, the Cambrian period.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.080
That's about this period of
time right over here, Cambrian.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.360
And during this period
of time, the Earth

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.810
experiences what we call
the Cambrian Explosion.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.810
And that's because there's
just this explosion

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.790
in the number of species
and genera that existed,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.225
the biodiversity, on the planet.

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:33.850
And it might just be that we had
the ozone layer protecting us,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.490
things were colonizing land.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.760
It was an oxygen-rich
environment.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.700
We start seeing complex
multicellular organisms.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.400
It's about that time, if
you fast forward maybe

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.900
a few tens of
millions of years, you

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.040
start seeing the first fish,
the first kind of preamphibians

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.220
or protoamphibians.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.550
You fast forward a little bit.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.120
As we get out of
the Cambrian period,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.000
we start seeing the plants.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.290
So they actually draw
it right over here

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.382
on this-- land plants-- or at
this point right over here.

00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:06.090
And, of course, these
are moving targets,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.960
depending on what we discover
in the fossil record.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.170
And for me, the big aha moment
here is so many of these things

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.250
that you consider
fundamental to what

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.930
Earth is are relatively
recent phenomena,

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.330
Plants weren't on land until
about 450 million years ago.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.670
Insects weren't on land-- or did
not even exist until about 400

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.950
million years ago.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.390
Reptiles didn't exist until
about 300 million years ago.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.710
So we are about
right over here now.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.360
Mammals didn't exist until
about 200 million years ago.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.940
Birds didn't exist until
about 150 million years ago.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.380
The whole dinosaur age,
which we kind of consider

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.790
in our distant past, that's
essentially the Mesozoic Era

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.040
right here.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.265
So this is the Age of the
Dinosaurs right over here.

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:57.640
When you look at
your time clock,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.960
you can see it's a relatively
recent time period.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.290
And it actually ends
with, we currently

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.260
believe, a huge rock, a
six-mile in diameter rock,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.150
colliding with what is now the
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
or right off the coast
of the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.630
And it destroyed all
of the large land life

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.170
forms, especially the dinosaurs.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.960
And to put all of
this in perspective--

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.380
and actually the
thing that really

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.790
was an aha moment for
me-- it's, OK, plants

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.400
are 450 million years ago.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.820
Grass, I kind of view as this
fundamental thing in nature.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.690
But grass has only been
around for about-- I've

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.550
seen multiple estimates--
40 to 70 million years.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.670
Grass is a relatively
new thing on the planet.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.730
Flowers have only been
around for 130 million years.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.880
So there was a time
where you had dinosaurs,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.160
but you did not have flowers
and you did not have grass.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.780
And so you fast
forward all the way.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.280
And so when you
look at this scale,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.410
it's kind of funny
to look at this.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.850
This is the time period where
the dinosaurs showed up.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.150
This whole brown line is
where the mammals showed up.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.840
So the dinosaurs started to
show up along with the mammals.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.130
And then, of course, the
dinosaurs died out here.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.720
Our ancestors, when the
giant rock hit the Earth,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.430
must have been
boroughed in holes

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.910
and were able to stash some
food away, or who knows what,

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.190
and didn't get fully affected.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.720
I'm sure most of the large
mammals were destroyed.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.559
But what's almost-- it's
humbling, or almost humorous,

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:27.600
or almost ridiculous, when
you look at this chart

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.224
is they put a little dot--
you can't even see it here,

00:08:31.224 --> 00:08:31.890
a little button.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.860
They say 2 million years
ago, the first humans--

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.679
and even this is being
pretty generous when

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.179
they say first humans.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.070
These are really
the first prehumans.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.520
The first humans that
are the same as us,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.920
if you took one of those
babies and your brought them up

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.920
in the suburbs and gave
them haircuts and stuff,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.960
they would be the
same thing as we are,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.660
those didn't exist until
200,000 years ago, give or take.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.000
200,000 to 400,000 years
ago, I've seen estimates.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.717
So this is actually a very
generous period of time

00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:00.550
to say first humans.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.380
It's actually 200,000 years ago.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.730
And just to give you
an idea of how new

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.895
we are and how new
evolution is, it

00:09:09.895 --> 00:09:12.020
was only 5 million years
ago-- and I mentioned this

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.399
in a previous video-- it was
only 5 million years ago--

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.690
so this is just to get a sense.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.890
This is 0 years.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.060
Homo sapien sapien, only
around for 200,000 years.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.240
The Neanderthals, they
were cousin species.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.664
They weren't our ancestors.

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:26.830
Many people think they were.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.955
They were a cousin species.

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:29.380
We come from the same root.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.500
Although there are
now theories that they

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.140
might have remixed
in with Homo sapiens.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.340
So maybe some of us have
some Neanderthal DNA.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.400
And it shouldn't be
viewed as an insult.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.510
They had big brains.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.900
Well, they didn't
necessarily have big brains.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.720
They had big heads.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.090
But that seems to
imply a big brain.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.070
But who knows?

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.959
We always tend to portray
them as somehow inferior.

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:52.500
But I don't want to get into
the political correctness of how

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.060
to portray Neanderthals.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.440
But anyway, this is a very
small period of time, 200,000.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.020
If you go 2 million
years, then you

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.640
get to kind of the prehuman,
the prehuman ancestors.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.210
And our family tree only
diverged from the chimpanzees

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.640
5 million years ago.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.270
If you draw that on
this clock right here,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.370
it would be like two
pixels or maybe not

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.630
even two pixels as when we
diverged from the chimpanzees.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.400
So hopefully, that gives
you a sense of things.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.064
At least for me, it really
puts things in perspective.
