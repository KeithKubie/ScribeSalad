00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.440
Washington's butt was sufficiently kicked (not licked), winter was here, his troops' morale was low, some just up and left.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.180
Washington needed to do something; anything, to restore faith in the revolution.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.460
The British had spread throughout New Jersey and settled in for a winter of drinking cider and partying hard.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.340
Nobody expected an attack in the winter,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.949
so Washington started making plans for an attack in the winter. (Of course he did, He's George Washington.)

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.619
The British had hired a large force of Hessian mercenaries from the German states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau to fight the rebels.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.680
It was these mercenaries that were stationed across the Delaware River from Washington and his army.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.529
And there were more Hessian reinforcements incoming, but they made an unscheduled stop because their commander got thirsty.

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:44.740
No, not that kind of thirsty,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.020
that kind of thirsty. ;)

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.320
It was Christmas Eve with a blizzard outside when Washington heard the Hessian defenses were down and he decided to attack. (Again, it's George Washington.)

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.200
He made a perilous crossing of the icy Delaware River

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.740
with 2,400 men and marched nine miles to Trenton,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.240
where he caught the Hessian forces completely off-guard.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.250
After a short, but fierce battle the Hessian surrendered in droves.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
It was a much-needed victory that sent a clear message, not only to the British,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.320
but to Americans across the colonies; the war was far from lost.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.980
General Cornwallis led the British forces South to counter-attack the Americans, but in a series of battles,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.600
Washington's defensive positioning and flanking maneuvers defeated the British three times in ten days, (There's a taste of 'Murica for you.)

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.980
and the British decided to abandon Southern New Jersey for the rest of the winter.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.260
Washington finally set up a winter camp in Morristown, but for the Americans, there was much less partying than the British.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.820
Elsewhere, the British had taken Newport, Rhode Island because it was a good naval base.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.760
In the South, they failed to take Charleston, South Carolina,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.800
which left British loyalists unsupported and vulnerable to more harassment, and even mass expulsion.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.460
Congress sent Benjamin Franklin to France on a mission to convince them to join the war.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.720
And while the French generally loved any opportunity to hoodwink the Brits,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.640
they didn't want to join unless it was a sure win. (That coward)

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.660
So, for now, Franklin spent his days chilling out and chasing tail. (Really, Ben?)

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.100
The British Parliament couldn't believe the war wasn't over yet, and the pressure was on to end it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.580
So the British came up with a plan;

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.240
General Burgoyne in MontrÃ©al and General William Howe in New York would advance

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.860
through the Hudson Valley and meet in the middle,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.640
splitting the colonies in two, and thus screwing over the American communication lines.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.100
Burgoyne began his movement South and after taking Fort Ticonderoga quite easily,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.360
he then came across heavy American resistance.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.460
So he sent Howe a dingle-dongle, asking if he'd be showing up anytime soon.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.520
Meanwhile, Howe completely abandoned the plan and gone for all-out personal glory by capturing the American capital, Philadelphia.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.880
He defeated Washington and his army at Brandywine Creek by using the old hit-him-with-a-decoy-and-flank-him-from-behind tactic,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.660
and Philadelphia was now in British hands, forcing Congress to escape to York. (Oof rekt)

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.480
But Burgoyne was left on his own to face the ever-increasing American force in Saratoga.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.939
American General Horatio Gates teamed up with our old friend Benedict Arnold to deal one final blow to Burgoyne's army.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.900
Arnold wanted to take the fight to the British, but Gates wanted to wait for the British to come to them.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.460
After a heated debate, Gates, the senior officer, told Arnold to go to his room,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.800
but Arnold defied his orders and at the Battle of Bemis Heights, he charged at the British, and obliterated them.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.340
Great job, Horatio! By the way, what happened to that other guy who was in Saratoga?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.840
Who?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.660
Benedict Arnold.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.500
Never heard of him.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.260
Ouch. (So sad, Alexa play Despacito)

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.040
Hey, George.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.540
Didn't I do a great job?

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.080
Taking Philadelphia and all?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.260
Hmm?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.340
Didn't I-

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.840
You're fired. (lol)

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.540
Both Burgoyne and Howe returned to Great Britain, leaving British General Henry Clinton to take charge of the war.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.700
And the war was about to take a nasty turn, because with the victory at Saratoga,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.820
the French were finally ready to join the Americans.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.340
Alright Benny, we're in.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.520
Hey, isn't this kind of funny?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.300
You know, 'cause you're a republic trying to overthrow an absolute monarchy,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.970
and I'm an absolute monarchy helping you?

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.540
Like,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.980
like could you imagine if your revolution inspired my people to revolt against me?

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.720
And then they imprison me and all my family?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And they chopped all of our heads off?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.500
(lol shut up)

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.320
Could you imagine?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.560
That's called foreshadowing!

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.400
For now, in America, winter was here once again, which meant yet more disease, more starvation,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.500
and even a little mutiny.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.700
After losing Philadelphia, Washington's job was again on the line.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.540
But suddenly, a Prussian guy with a very fancy name, hired by Benjamin Franklin, showed up out of nowhere and said,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.380
"Hey, I'm here to give your man a European military training."

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.940
And train them, he did! They learned how to shoot accurately, how to march in formation,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.140
where to poop and where not to, and strict punishments were handed out to any who didn't comply.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.980
Washington's army came out of the winter in 1778 a new and improved force,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.060
ready to take Philadelphia back from the British.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.620
In the end though, they didn't have to.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.440
With the French entry into the war, the British ordered General Clinton to evacuate Philadelphia,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.939
and consolidate all of the British forces in New York.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.120
So Washington sent Benedict Arnold to reoccupy and secure the city,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.520
as he pursued the British through New Jersey on land, eventually finding a good opportunity to attack at Monmouth Courthouse.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.920
The battle took place on a sweltering hot summer's day, and as many soldiers died from heatstroke as they did from battle.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.920
In the end, after some incompetent/borderline treason from Washington's second-in-command,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.980
it was a draw, and in this war a draw is kind of a victory for the Americans.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.880
Next up, let's talk about this guy.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.240
This is John Paul Jones. John Paul Jones is handsome, Scottish, and absolutely insane.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.180
When the war first broke out, everyone was like,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.100
"How do the colonies expect to stand up to the might of the British Navy with their meager fleet of converted merchantme-"

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.660
Yep, try telling that to John Paul Jones.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.360
This guy sailed to the British Isles, somehow captured a British ship off the coast of Ireland, and brought it back to France.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.660
Then he returned, attacking more ships, raiding towns, and evading capture the entire time.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.480
These are basically pirate tactics, but hey, if it works, it works.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.560
In one incident, he captured a British ship and returned to a Dutch port without an official ensign, because his was lost during the battle.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.140
That's a big no-no, and can have you arrested as a pirate.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.020
The Dutch helped him out by quickly creating a design based on Benjamin Franklin's description of what the American flag should look like,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.720
and they entered it into their records as an official U.S. flag.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.300
What they came up with looks pretty cool!

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.600
The whole campaign probably played heavily on British morale,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.680
and brought into question their ability to win the war.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.940
And, Fun Fact, he was so cool that one of the towns he raided in 1778 gave him an official honorary pardon in 1999.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.180
Keep rippin' in heaven, John Paul Jones. You're an angel now.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.420
What the Continental Navy was lacking resources, though, the French entry into the war made up for.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.560
The French began with naval skirmishes in the English Channel, and they sent a large fleet to America,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.960
although it sustained a lot of damage in a storm off Rhode Island.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.460
The Americans were hoping for a bigger commitment from the French,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.540
so John Adams went to France to help Benjamin Franklin continue negotiations.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.620
Oh good. You're finally here. Check this out. Hey ladies. I'd like to fight you like a kite, cuz you're electrifying!

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.200
Isn't this great?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.960
Is this...

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.340
Is this what you've been doing?

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.420
Yeah, why?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.160
We were sent here on a diplomatic mission to secure military support from France, not to philander with the locals.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.280
Wait, no, ladies come back! Ugh...

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.660
Worst. Wingman. Ever.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.000
But the Americans would get some more help; the Dutch provided aid, although they never formed an official alliance.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.540
More significantly though, the Spanish, who had already been providing aid officially joined the war in June 1779.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.240
They would provide support in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.360
campaigns that heavily impacted the Native American tribes in those areas.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.780
Both sides actually enlisted the help of Native American tribes throughout the war,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.940
sometimes even pitting those tribes against each other.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.420
In the summer of 1779, after a series of raids against the Americans by the Iroquois,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.860
Washington organized an expedition that burned down more than 40 villages,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.860
forcing the tribes to relocate to Canada for British protection.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.980
And another group that shouldn't go unmentioned were African Americans, both free and enslaved.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.740
They joined both sides of the war, hoping to gain their freedom,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.300
but afterwards, many were simply returned to slavery, particularly those who had fought for the Americans.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.800
Despite owning slaves himself, Jefferson had written a condemnation of slavery in the Declaration of Independence,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.720
but out of fear of offending the southern colonies, this was removed from the final draft.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.080
For the same reason, the American Army stopped enlisting African American men in 1775,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.840
a policy that Washington, a slave owner himself, supported.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.240
But they were forced to reverse the policy after the British promised freedom to any slaves who joined them.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.140
In general, you stood a better chance of gaining freedom if you fought for the British.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:25.480
However, even those that left with the British after the war suffered mistreatment and discrimination in their new lives outside of America.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.880
Our good friend Benedict Arnold is now in charge of Philadelphia, having a good time, partying down with,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.580
and even marrying a member of the Philadelphia elite,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.620
the same elite that had partied down with the British when they controlled the city, and suddenly the people of Philadelphia,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.140
including the state governor, started accusing Arnold of having pro-British sentiments.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.440
To keep the people happy, Washington wrote a letter rebuking Arnold, calling his conduct imprudent and improper,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.300
and that was too many ouchies for Benedict Arnold to handle.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.999
He asked Washington to put him in charge of the fort at West Point,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.420
then he contacted the British, offering to hand the plans of the fort over to them and join their side.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.200
Our good friend Benedict Arnold is our good friend no more.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.300
Luckily, the treasonous plans were discovered on a captured British officer,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.840
but Arnold managed to escape before he was arrested.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.480
As a British Brigadier General, he would go on to lead raids against American cities, most notably his rate of Richmond, Virginia in 1781.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.040
His betrayal shook George Washington, who had once again set up camp at Morristown.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.760
His leadership somehow held the Continental Army together through the harshest winter of the war.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.860
We're entering 1780, and Parliament was hopping mad that the war still wasn't over.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.900
The British debt was soaring, and despite taking parts of Massachusetts in late 1779, the North was in a stalemate.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.640
So the British decided to make a major shift in strategy to the South, an economically rich area with a higher level of support for the British.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.840
Or so the British thought.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.260
A year earlier, they had captured the under-defended city of Savannah, Georgia easily,

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.420
and a joint American French counter-siege failed.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.100
Now, they laid siege to Charleston, South Carolina.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.680
It fell within months, with thousands of American troops surrendering to the British, a costly defeat.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.620
The British quickly moved to take control, and they sent stereotypical Hollywood villain with a British accent Bannister "the Butcher" Tarleton into the back country,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.680
where he hunted down rebels and destroyed them with ruthless brutality.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.940
The British presence also inspired local loyalist militias in the back country to rise up against their persecutors.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.660
The British really seemed to be onto something with their new strategy, and the ball was very much in Washington's court.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.660
I'm gonna send my most loyal general, Nathanael Greene, to the south to stop the British.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.340
Gonna have to overrule you there, George.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.360
We're sending Hero of Saratoga and your biggest rival, Horatio Gates.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.260
Watch this, George. I'm gonna save the day again, everybody will love me, and I'm gonna get your job.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:23.880
Here I go!

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.160
And he got into one battle with Cornwallis, got annihilated, and ran away.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.960
Alrighty. Let's go with your guy.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.140
Nathaniel Greene knew the British outnumbered his own forces, and wouldn't be defeated with conventional tactics.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.540
So he had to think outside the box.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.620
He split his army into two, said "Hey, Big Boy, look at me!"

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.180
and then they went running in two different directions

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.520
Cornwallis sent Tarleton after Morgan, and he caught up with him at Cowpens, where Morgan proceeded to kick Tarleton's butt.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.480
Then the two led Cornwallis on a wild chase through North Carolina,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.520
his bigger and better equipped army, much heavier and slower than Greene's quick and mobile troops.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.320
Greene led Cornwallis further and further from his supply line, then crossed the Dan River into Virginia,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.180
picked up some reinforcements, and turned back to face the now exhausted British.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.940
At the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, the two sides engaged in vicious close combat.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.400
Cornwallis, fearing loss, fired his big guns into the chaotic fighting, cutting down many of his own men.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.280
Greene retreated, giving Cornwallis the victory,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.280
but Cornwallis lost a quarter of his men in the fighting, so it felt much more like a British defeat.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.200
At this point, both sides desperately needed something to happen soon to end the fighting.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.500
The British were running out of money, while the Americans were again facing mutinies,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.280
as the men went without pay or even basic living needs.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.840
Fortunately, the French were now showing up in greater numbers and were ready to fight.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.960
After his encounter with Greene, Cornwallis decided the only way to win the South

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.600
was to first prevent the Southern Continental Army from using Virginia as a supply base.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.100
So he abandoned the Carolina's, moving to Wilmington, and on to Yorktown,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.240
a position the British believed would be easy to supply and support.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.520
On his march to Yorktown, he raided many farms, stealing horses and supplies from the locals,

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.480
but also freeing thousands of slaves, many of whom joined him.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.300
The French saw Cornwallis' new position as an opportunity to land a decisive blow on the British.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.060
Washington wanted to attack Clinton in New York, but the French said it was a really dumb idea,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.360
and, to be fair, it was.

00:10:58.499 --> 00:11:02.358
Instead, Washington sent out fake dispatches to make it look like they would attack Clinton,

00:11:02.359 --> 00:11:05.220
but secretly their combined force marched all the way down to Virginia.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.540
A large French fleet under the command of Compte de Grasse arrived and successfully cleared the British Navy out of the Chesapeake Bay.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.380
The combined land and naval forces then laid siege to Cornwallis' army in Yorktown.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.100
The American and French forces tightened in around the city, raining artillery down on Cornwallis,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.340
who desperately appealed to Clinton for aid, but Clinton was unusually chilled out about the whole thing.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.280
Cornwallis held out for nearly a month before he had no choice but to surrender.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.460
Over 7,000 British troops were captured, a crushing defeat, and with that, Parliament had reached the end of its rope.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.700
The war just wasn't worth it, and it needed to end now. The British still held New York, Charleston, and Savannah,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.640
but fighting between the two sides mostly ceased as peace negotiations opened up in Paris.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.020
The resulting treaty in 1783 saw Great Britain remove its troops from American soil, recognize U.S. independence,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.120
and cede territory up to the Mississippi River.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:56.020
In return, the Americans agreed to pay any debt still owed to Britain, and gave fair treatment to any colonists who remained loyal to the Crown.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.620
The Spanish got Florida, while the French got an economic crisis that led to its own revolution a decade later. (Best reward ever.)

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.060
Washington retired to his home in Mount Vernon, wishing his men farewell by saying,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:09.920
"I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable."

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.060
He hoped to live out the rest of his days in peace, but unfortunately for him,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.760
a number of people wanted him to be the first leader of the new country.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.960
And by a number of people, I mean literally everyone.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.839
The first election campaign in American history was basically a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:30.900
He was sworn in on April 30th, 1789, and he himself established many of the standards and limitations of what the American leaders should be.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.420
First of all, there was debate on what he should be called. Is he a king? Is he our glorious leader?

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.220
In the end, they went for a word that, at the time, was pretty modest; president.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.299
Like the president of your local bowling club, or office bake sale committee.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.200
He set up a cabinet of expert advisors knowing that no president could know everything,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.300
no matter how much of a stable genius they claimed to be.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:52.529
He proposed major legislation to Congress, and gave an annual State of the Union address to keep his own power in check.

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:55.319
He stated that the U.S. should remain neutral in foreign conflicts,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.710
and in the end he voluntarily gave up his power after just two terms.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.240
He could have made the presidency anything he wanted,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.680
but his careful and cautious actions helped set the precedent of an office that is powerful in its limitations,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.380
decisive through its diplomacy, and respected in its humility.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.520
And so the United States was born, and everything was perfect. It had no problems. Not a single one.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.280
Certainly nothing that would, I don't know, cause such an extreme divide that it would lead to a civil war.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.880
Anyway, moving on.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.180
Quick quiz! Name the most American thing you can think of.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.700
Baseball? Bald Eagles? (Orange dude that wants to build a giant wall?)

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.400
Calling the winner of an America-only sports tournament World Champions? (Sounds right.)

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.500
Or maybe math and science?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.340
Wait. Math and science?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.700
That's right. If you didn't know, science is American as combining chicken with waffles.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.380
And don't just take my word for it, ask Thomas Jefferson!

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.860
Of course, to do that, you would need a time machine, and that would take some math and a lot of science.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.980
If you want to deeply understand math and science, say you want to calculate the age of the universe,

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.440
take a crack at special relativity, or just train your critical thinking with some fun logic puzzles,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.010
