And the answer is none of them. Okay, that was a really dirty of me. I'm sorry.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm sorry if you clicked some of them thinking there must be an answer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The truth is that none of these experiments can distinguish between

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
constant speed motion and being at rest.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, the laws of physics are identical from motion in constant speed and motion at rest.

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is such an important concept that we give it it's own name.
