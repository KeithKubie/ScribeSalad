1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,720
Oh, sweet. Jesus. Is this real?
Is this really happening? Yes.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,230
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,550
We go to Joe rogan.net.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,540
Click on the link for the flashlight
and during the code Rogan sent me,

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,420
you will get 15% off.
Number one sex toy for mine.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,020
There's like some sort of 15%
off sale it's going on right now.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,960
So I don't know if it gives you 30% off.
I don't think that works that way.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,730
I think you only allowed
to use one coupon.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,390
I don't want people to go brook to
solid product folks. Go get one.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,940
You know you're going to masturbate.
This is better.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,280
Holla and then save a little money too.
But it's a solid product. And the company,

12
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,240
the good people, uh, were also brought
to you by [inaudible] dot com o n n I t,

13
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:46,200
makers of Alpha brain. I'm going to give
every last mile for brand Lynn today.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,500
Show him what the fuck is up.
You might blow up.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,020
It might change his whole attitude
about life. Um, we also make new mood,

16
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,750
which is a five HTP and l Tryptophan,

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,650
serotonin boosting supplements, good
stuff for you. All healthy stuff.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,940
All of it is a, if you, if you don't
know what nootropics are pleased, Google,

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,190
Google the subject.
It's a fascinating subject.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't just go out and buy some Alpha
brain. Look at all the pros and cons. I,

21
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,130
there's not too many cons,

22
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,330
but we address all of it at
[inaudible] dot com there's um, uh,

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,940
there's a whole page dedicated to the
research behind all the nootropics.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,400
We also have for the first order,
when you buy things,

25
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:27,240
it's a 100% money back guarantee.
You don't have to return anything.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,770
No one's trying to rip you off.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,790
This is all stuff that I use is all stuff
that I use before I was selling it. Um,

28
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:35,880
I'm, I'm a firm believer in
vitamins and nutrition and health.

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,910
It's very important. It's
boring as fuck, man. Right?

30
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,800
I don't want to eat kale
shakes in the morning.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,300
I'd rather have like some leftover
spare ribs or a, a protein shake with,

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,510
you know, some, something
delicious. But I do,

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,080
and I do take vitamins and I do
feel a difference. I've gone, I've,

34
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:56,430
I've experimented, I've tried no
vitamins, eat like shit. This is not good.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,400
There's a big difference
between how your body performs,

36
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,900
how your mind performance.
For me,

37
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,660
that's the big one and this
is where nootropics come in.

38
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,710
Nootropics are really all about
enhancing cognitive function.

39
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,120
There's a bunch of other companies that
do a neutral big besides us. Go Do.

40
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:13,560
There's not, there's no, you know,

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,470
it's not that ours are better
than anybody else's. Ours is very,

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
very complete and very balanced and
very complex and some of them aren't as

43
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,340
aren't as complex, but there's a lot
of great ones out there. So Google it,

44
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,350
check it out.
Remember first order,

45
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,910
if you're not into it 30% off or
rather the first 30 pills rather,

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,460
you get 100% off.
You don't even have to send it in.

47
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:38,160
Just tell us it's sucks and
we'll say, sorry. All right.

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,830
No one's trying to rip you off a checkout.
There's,

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,160
there's also a shroom tech
sport and shroom tech immune,

50
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,490
two different mushroom based
supplements that do different things.

51
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:52,320
Shroom tech sport is great for
endurance and it's great for um, it's a,

52
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,280
it's great for energy.

53
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,360
It's really a crazy drug that was
actually discovered by people live in high

54
00:02:57,361 --> 00:03:00,190
altitudes. It's just crazy.
Mushroom is quarter seps mushroom

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,030
and a bunch of other things that are
in there as well to to enhance, uh,

56
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,220
energy and endurance.
It gives you a little boost,

57
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,160
get a lot of [inaudible] 12 and
[inaudible] as well. And uh, that's it.

58
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:12,520
So go check that shit out.
And soon kettlebells,

59
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,960
kettlebells are almost here
within a couple of weeks.
Dude, I can't, I can't tell,

60
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,160
don't say anything about that one yet.
No. But um, the, uh, the regular ones,

61
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:24,040
we're going to have the cheap, we're
going to have not cheap, high quality,

62
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,770
best quality available,
but they're going to be inexpensive.

63
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,400
We're trying to make kettle
bells as cheap as possible,

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,480
but the best quality possible and only
sell it on the Internet and they see if

65
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,540
you,
if you can work out a deal with shipping,

66
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,740
I think we can make them very reasonable
because I think everybody's trying to

67
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,260
make money. You should make them smell
like blueberries or something. Great.

68
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,710
So that's working out. It smells like
vanilla. Doesn't help dudes, Bro.

69
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:51,160
That only helps you. That would help
you sit down and just start smelling.

70
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,410
All is working out, but it
smelled like vanilla. Come here.

71
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,840
If you'd call your girlfriend, honey,
come here. It smells like vanilla.

72
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,300
Sure. It's relaxing now.
He's in that a real thing. I,

73
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,940
yeah, but I don't think you want to be
relaxed while you're fucking Thrones with

74
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,541
kettle bells around.

75
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,460
Sun might let one go and throw it through
fucking wall or something. Start a cod.

76
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:10,360
Dan Electrical fire. Be careful.
Kettlebells would be very careful.

77
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,970
You have to know what the fuck you're
doing. Start Light. They're tough to do.

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,810
One 35 pounds. I'm a manly
man. Okay. And one 35 pounders.

79
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:18,030
A fucking serious workout.

80
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,550
There's a lot of them is a
extreme kettlebell cardio
workout that this guy put

81
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:21,671
out.

82
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:26,671
I forget who sells a video on dragon
door.com it's a great workout video and

83
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,940
this fucking guy does it all with one
35 pound kettle bell and you're dying by

84
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:35,800
the end of it man. Its brutality. So,
uh, that's, that's the next level.

85
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,290
All right,
bitches ever last is here.

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,940
He's going to play some music when
I have some fun kids. Try my day.

87
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:45,140
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

88
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,010
[inaudible]

89
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,580
what happened was all that speed thing
I was playing around while you're

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,230
experimenting with you fucking freaky.

91
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,490
One of my good friends
in the music business,

92
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:08,390
one of the coolest motherfuckers I know
and one of the dudes that, you know,

93
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,670
when I think about like wow,
I'm friends, whatever the last,

94
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,960
it might not be a big deal to you cause
you're Everlast but when I was a fan of

95
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:18,290
house of pain, you know, when I first
moved to California, you know, it's,

96
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,410
to me it's just cool as fuck to
sit here and carry it with you.

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,670
I appreciate that man. Ay,
Yo, I got to also say, man,

98
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,120
last time I came over here,
we joked around about my Twitter.

99
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,040
There was like 6,000 people on it,
man.

100
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,430
There's like 16,000
now and I swear to God,

101
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,180
at least nine of those 10,000 came
straight from this show. I'm sure.

102
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,120
Well they didn't know. You know,
you're, it's, Oh gee. Everlast folks,

103
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:43,080
if those of you are looking for them,

104
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:46,710
cause I'm sure there's about a fake
mountains. I don't know. I don't, I I,

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,400
there must be, there's, there's a whole
bunch that it's hard finding someone on,

106
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,440
on, on Twitter. That's correct.

107
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,390
It's a real person actually got one of
those little check marks recently. Me.

108
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,250
I'm actually

109
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,320
mean now. Yeah, that's
tricky. You got to get those.

110
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,440
I look for the most positive
munch of people I've ever seen.

111
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,740
The from the Joe Rogan podcast podcasts.
You know, it's crazy, isn't it?

112
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,120
I was waiting for like, you
suck you're in. And I was like,

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,500
you know, I was, inevitably someone asks,
it wasn't none of that. It was crazy.

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,510
Amazingly Nice. It's the craziest
group of people. Uh, you know,

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,900
I had a guy came up to me to this show
this weekend and the dude was actually

116
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:28,160
crying. He had tears in his eyes and
he said that one of our podcasts will,

117
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,240
we're me and Brian Cowen,

118
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,740
we're talking about what's wrong
with you when you're a hater,

119
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,020
what it's really all about.

120
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,810
It's really all about this being
dissatisfied with yourself.

121
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,010
And then you look at someone and you try
to chop them down or you try to attack

122
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,410
the attack their weaknesses
or find their flaws.

123
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,610
But really what most of that
is comes from is a real,

124
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:49,520
a feeling of unease about your own life.
And absolutely it's all of it.

125
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,650
And this guy said that
it changed his life.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,530
He said he literally stopped
behaving that way. He goes,

127
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,880
I realize what I was doing because I
realize what I was doing right there.

128
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,780
Cause I never, he goes,
I was just an asshole.

129
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,650
I didn't even know why I was an asshole.
I couldn't help being an asshole.

130
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,311
He goes,

131
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:08,510
but just spelling that out that it was
really all just me being frustrated about

132
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,270
myself. He goes, I couldn't see
that without you pointing it out.

133
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,020
But now I see it so clear. It's
changed my life. He's like,

134
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:18,170
it just opened the door that I can
never shut again. In any case, Dan,

135
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,360
he gave me a little tongue reached,
even don't realize you're,

136
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:27,470
your brain is extremely kind. Yeah. If
there's something that's bothering it,

137
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:31,810
it'll tuck it behind anything it can and
just tell you to ignore it. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,310
And sometimes it's easy to just moving
a chair out the way and be like, Homey,

139
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,480
look, yeah, that's why you're
upset. The did you wrong? You know,

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,270
are almost always right.

141
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,790
The mind is incredibly complex and
none of us have a guidebook for it.

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,220
That's a real problem.
Nobody really, you know,

143
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,450
you can join a religion or you could join
us, you know, a cult or maybe, you know,

144
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,360
become a monk or something and
they give you some guidelines.

145
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,920
You could do it their way, but that
might not be the way you know, it's the,

146
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,720
the way is your way could be different
than I ways. A lot of Goddamn way.

147
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:05,421
A lot of ways.

148
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,770
But there's principles that you need to
get through like truth and honesty and

149
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,740
kindness. They sound weak. You know,

150
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,620
we talked about this last time that it
takes a lot of strength to be a loving

151
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,970
person, to just be open and loving. You
have to expose yourself and it sounds,

152
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:23,000
you know, the insecure people don't,
don't want to think like that.

153
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,160
They want to think there's something
wrong with them while you fucking queer.

154
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,130
What are you talking love?
You know, that's ridiculous.

155
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:31,370
You don't want more love in your life.
Everybody should want more love.

156
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,360
It doesn't mean you're weak.

157
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,540
It doesn't mean your wife's and usually
more than anybody else. Yeah, I know.

158
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,490
Almost always then they don't know
that everybody can see it. You know?

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,690
Cause I've been that dude.

160
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I've been that angry dude and didn't
know that everybody could see like,

161
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:49,100
what the fuck is wrong with you, man? Why
you so tightly wound? Why? Why? You know,

162
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,800
why are you looking at smack people?
What the fuck is that all about? Well,

163
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,010
it's always some shit that has almost
nothing to do with what's going on right

164
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,160
in front of you. Yeah. I
mean, shit, I'm 42 man,

165
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,320
and I've probably only figured
it out nine months ago.

166
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,540
I think I figured it out last
week. I don't know, man. I
take a, it comes and goes.

167
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,220
I think that, uh, any,

168
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:12,240
any real feeling of
figuring anything out to me,

169
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:16,320
it's always like real fleeting and I
never feel confident enough to even say I

170
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,590
figured out ever. You know, it's
always, to me, it's always just, I'm,

171
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,940
I'm just trying to keep my fucking
head above water like everybody else.

172
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:28,420
Just trying to not only retain,
maintain, be nice and joy.

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,900
There's no mastery of this fucking
thing. This is a ride, right?

174
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,130
We're on top of a fucking
seven mile high wave man.

175
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,330
Just because the boat is turn the correct
direction doesn't mean we have any

176
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:43,770
control of this. Fuck. You know, you get
a good no, no control of this crazy life.

177
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
You just gotta enjoy.

178
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:49,470
Try to ride that wave as best you can
and try to do the best you can to enhance

179
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:53,850
your environment and enjoy what you've
got. Yeah. Enhance your environment.

180
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,270
Hence your friendships, you
know. Right. The absolutely.

181
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,180
That sounds like a Goddamn
Everlast song is, you know,

182
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,150
I'm gonna make you cry today man.
I bet you well,

183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,800
you were making me cry when
you're warming up, man.

184
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,080
I had to go out and take a shit.
I was like,

185
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,390
I might have to drop some weight here.
This is too good.

186
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,110
What do you got for us, ma'am? Um,

187
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,490
I don't you want me to just get down
whatever you want to do. Are we ready?

188
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,230
We ready? Did we have one of my favorite
artists and a guitar in the room, man.

189
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:25,380
Yeah, man, get down. Get down. We can
always talk. It'd be fun. You know

190
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,220

Hey Damn,
that was great.

235
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,500
That's heavy. Wrote that. Uh, uh,

236
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,960
when I went over to play for the boys
and our wreck, that must've been a trip.

237
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,370
I've, uh, I haven't been over there,

238
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,580
but I've hung out with a lot of those
guys on the basis when we do UFC shows,

239
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,500
military shows, man, fucking tough
life, man. Different breed of folk, man.

240
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah. God bless him. And we
wouldn't exist without them. Yeah.

241
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,990
We wouldn't exist without them.

242
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,380
I just don't like the people that are
putting them in places that aren't

243
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,010
absolutely. Well, I

244
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,370
mean,

245
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,520
I was brought over there and like I had
just released an album that was very

246
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,660
vehemently making statements against
like the administration and, and yeah.

247
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,900
And the war. But it, when
I was invited over there,

248
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,673
mmm.

249
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,500
Uh, you know, nope. They
didn't ask me about any written
out. And I, and I really,

250
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:09,810
you know,

251
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,350
I look at is most of these cats was
trying to get some college money and said,

252
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,280
you know,
I believe in something too.

253
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,770
Well that's what it used to be. I mean,
that's when, when Pat Tillman signed up,

254
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,710
that's what he did. He left the NFL.
Yeah. He was like, you know what,

255
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,680
I believe in this. This is real. You
know, our country's being attacked.

256
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,620
Then when he got over there, he was one
of the biggest critics of the war ever.

257
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,530
Once he got over there, him
and his brother, I mean his,

258
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,160
his brother doesn't even believe
it was friendly fire. Yeah. It was,

259
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,430
brother thinks they had him killed, I
believe and own that. And He, I mean,

260
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:41,280
they covered up this whole story
about friendly fire, you know? Yeah.

261
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,240
They pretend to remember died in war,
you know, by the time he was over there,

262
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:49,860
he just, he realized what a cluster fuck
it was. The whole thing is a mess, man.

263
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,870
It's uh, the people behind it though,
the people that you know, are,

264
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,700
we're willing to sign up and beat and
be heroes and really go and fight the

265
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:03,540
enemy in their mind. I mean, that's an
incredibly brave thing. And then this,

266
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,830
which is the most fucked up thing about
it is the idea that brave people get

267
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:08,730
manipulated

268
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,750
in the, in the name of
money. And I was, you know,

269
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,790
what it was shocking to me was how
young these cats were and how much

270
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,510
responsibility,
like carried on their shoulders.

271
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:25,560
And I thought about myself at 22 or 24 in,

272
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:30,090
this guy's running a squad of
tanks and I was like, you know,

273
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,580
you know, probably passed
out drunk in a bar, so sure.

274
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,450
You know what I mean? Triple. It was
like, you know, you've just given do,

275
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,330
I went out there and there they were. I
mean, it was like the most appreciative.

276
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:47,160
Like you, Dave, thank you so much.
Just for going unused. Just bananas.

277
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:50,340
I was like, I was, I was privileged
to going. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

278
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,800
She's so scary to be over there.
Let's go.

279
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,610
So scary to be in such a fucked up
place in the world. It's, you know,

280
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,510
most people that live in this
side live in Nice cities,

281
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:04,840
drive nice cars, you know, exist
in a peaceful state of harmony.

282
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,160
We're barely even aware that there's
some people that mostly financially and

283
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,500
fortunate at this point,

284
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,670
mostly just not a lot of
fucking opportunities where
they live at this point and

285
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:19,330
they're getting shipped off to some crazy
country on the other side of the world

286
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:24,220
is just filled with death and despair.
Like most people don't even know. Like,

287
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:28,570
you know this guy that snapped recently
and kill those people in Afghanistan.

288
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:32,790
You don't have a story. Hey Dude, like
three tours, tours. Not only that,

289
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,170
but he thought he was gonna
get off combat duty. They were,

290
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,960
they were dangling it over his head. He
was losing his house back home. And I'm,

291
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,370
you know, I'm not making any excuses
for this guy, but the day of his,

292
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,360
he watched one of his friends
get his legs blown off. Well,

293
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,370
and then I guess he just snapped. He
doesn't even remember it. He went where?

294
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,100
He says he doesn't remember it. Who
knows? But what did they, they're,

295
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,490
they manipulate the fuck out of these
people, man. I know what do to Ed?

296
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,380
Only 20 days left on a 20 year bid.

297
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,490
What? The Army Reserve and then with
20 days left, he was going to retire.

298
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,300
They sent him to Iraq for a year
and a half. They can just do that.

299
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,850
They send them back again to,
and once they send you once,

300
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:15,150
they can send you again, like you
literally worked for them forever.

301
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,590
You cannot quit. There is no tie.
They somewhere in the day for sure.

302
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,610
Habitation option. That's
insanity. And option B, what out?

303
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,290
The fact that we allow that man, that's
really fucked up. That's, that's uh,

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,120
that's uh, I'll tell you like this, I'm
honestly, you know, and if I was young,

305
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,480
I'd still be saying this,
you know, I ain't saying it
cause I'm past whatever age,

306
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,070
but I think to a certain degree
it should be you turn 18,

307
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,290
you want to like have certain
privileges in this country,

308
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,660
you should go do your two years service.
And you know what I mean?

309
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,200
Change a lot of Shit I'll tell you
which cause yeah, cause every senate,

310
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,560
his kid would be in there,
every,

311
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,650
every governor and the residents kid would
have to do it. It's, you know, you know,

312
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,540
but that'll never happen. You're
right. Yeah. You know, uh,

313
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,790
I think in principle then we'd have
a standing army at all times of what,

314
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,870
15 million people? Christ
more than that. Right.

315
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:10,350
And they know how many young people do we
have of that. Yeah. I would probably be,

316
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,660
what do we have now?
I bet it's probably 15 million now.

317
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,910
How many people are in the army?
Seven.

318
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,560
A number of US military.

319
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,700
How many times have you been over there?
A once,

320
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,470
but I'll go back any day now
while you like me have a daughter,

321
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,440
doesn't that uh, that's when you
see like dudes who have daughters.

322
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,150
My wife wasn't about you being over there
am I believe my wife was pregnant when

323
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:37,620
I went. Wow. Yeah.

324
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,040
You know, it's weird, Joe, that you, uh, I
was listening to some old Howard Stern's.

325
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,710
I don't really have you been listening
to the Kinison and shit and somebody said

326
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:47,290
something on the Howard stern show
and he was like, is that true?

327
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,080
But he didn't have a computer to like
go like how many people in the military?

328
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,560
So I was just thinking like, how weird
is that? Like Howard had no idea.

329
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,230
There was no way for him to check that
at all. So you just pretty much was like,

330
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:57,730
all right,
I guess I have to believe this.

331
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,440
You can talk all kinds of crazy
shit back then. Yeah. Yeah.

332
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,670
That's good shit though.
All Week he's having Sam Kinison on.

333
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,640
Yeah, I listened to it today.
It's crazy. From 1988. It's weird.

334
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,880
You know, it's when I first
started doing comedy. Yeah.

335
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
And because of Sam Kennison too.

336
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,520
There was the first dude that I
ever heard that I was like, Whoa,

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,700
that's comedy too. Yeah. That was crazy.
I remember when the first time I saw him,

338
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,790
it was, it was a shock. It was
like, wow, that's new. Yeah.

339
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,970
That to changed the whole
game. He changed comedy, man.

340
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,180
He went hard on the religious
stuff at a time when that was,

341
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,170
and he got away with it too, because
he was a former preacher that, yeah.

342
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,320
The other way is like crazy.
That was, he was, he was classic.

343
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,940
Does he have a dog? A daughter's
right? Or does he have any

344
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,800
I, yeah. Well he has him with his friend's
wife. Do you know that whole story?

345
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:48,070
Yeah, I don't think so.
You know, story. Um,

346
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,110
he had a good fuck.
I'm blanking on the dude's name now.

347
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,360
The dude with a shaved head.
Oh my goodness. Oh, shut up.

348
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,930
No fuck.
I can't believe I'm Carlo.

349
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,480
Carlo was his buddy and his road partner.

350
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:08,800
He opened for Kennison on the road and
apparently Kinison was banging his wife

351
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,210
and he didn't even know about it.

352
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:12,880
And he had a kid with this chick
and he thought it was his kid.

353
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,960
It's kinnisons kid.

354
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,040
So the whole time he's been raising
this kid thinking it was his,

355
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,410
it was his best friend. His best
friend went up shithead. Wow.

356
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,170
Banging his friend's wife. Wow.
That'll end that without a condom.

357
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:30,700
You fucking dirty bitch.
He was crazy. You know,

358
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:34,000
they said with Kennison it was a head
injury that changed his whole life.

359
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,070
He was a kid.
He got hit by a truck,

360
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,510
said completely changed his personality
by completely became a totally different

361
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:44,050
person. We can reckless and
crazy and loud wild for that.

362
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,410
It was like a regular calm
sort of a peaceful kid.

363
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,500
Maybe he liked, didn't see another side
and just realize, decided it was a,

364
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,370
was he was going ham could be right.
Yeah.

365
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,480
He crossed over for a second or I think
it's just head injuries in general are

366
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:05,290
fucking really bad for you. You know,
getting, getting your head fuck stops.

367
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:09,250
Not good for some people it changes their
personality. I've heard of dudes that,

368
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:10,900
uh, became depressed. They, uh,

369
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,500
they got just knocked out once and
then they started getting like band

370
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,470
depression like all the time. Like real
had a really hard time being happy.

371
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,520
Well just one concussion, you
know, golf ball that ahead.

372
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,120
I know dude was fucked up by a
golf ball that said for six months.

373
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:29,320
He was just a mess. Six months,
man. That's crazy man. Yeah.

374
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,740
Yeah. And that's another thing that's
going on with these soldiers. You know,

375
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,290
the UFC has done, uh, a few of these,

376
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,730
a fight for the troops for the head
injury, traumatic brain injury. Yeah.

377
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:44,620
I did like I'm one of those little essays
for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a,

378
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:47,830
that's some shit that's happening
now. Like last, before it closed,

379
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:52,450
I actually did a visit at Walter Reed
where they have all the cats, you know,

380
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,320
hit got hit with the
IUD. Is that, that, that,

381
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,260
that will change your perspective because
there's dudes there with literally

382
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:04,210
half a body. Yeah. And talking like I
wish I could go back cause I got home,

383
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:07,930
he's there and I need, you
know, like they, it's crazy.

384
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,180
I'm kid got two artificial legs talking
about he's getting ready to, you know,

385
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:16,330
join the DEA. Wow. Like,
you know, some crazy shit.

386
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,570
Don't make your problems seem
real, real small. You know?

387
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,110
I think that sense of comradery that a
lot of those guys have with each other

388
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,930
too. It hits, it hits a
crazy level, you know,

389
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,570
it hits a level that other than
the average person has civilian,

390
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:32,110
it's probably never going to experience
will the level of panic and fear and

391
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,140
emotion in a moment of death is, you
know, and then you're sharing it.

392
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:39,730
So whatever secrets you got it, you
know it's going to come to the service.

393
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,250
Not necessarily like you're going to
yell out your secrets, I'm saying,

394
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,160
but if you're a guy who's gone cry while
you're fighting or were they all that's

395
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,690
coming out and yeah, you know, is going,

396
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,390
you're going to bond
over that kind of shit.

397
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,950
I would imagine that's why fight camps
are always so close to, you know, like a,

398
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,680
an MMA fight, camp shore martial
arts schools. Oh that shit you,

399
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:59,900
you experienced something
really scary together. You know,

400
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,600
it's not as scary as war, but any,
anything. What's the old saying?

401
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,700
There's no atheists in foxholes,
man.

402
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,190
Indeed. Indeed. So what else
you got for us, man? Eight.

403
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:14,860
Somebody put a request in that. I agree
with 100% I love your fucking cover.

404
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,680
A Fulsom prison brews. I'll get
there, I'll kill you. It won't happen.

405
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,730

time so Brian can do it with his mouth.

407

writing from, my dad's got a guitar here.

408
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,720

one. This one's costing you

409
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,943
Okay.

some of us,

Some of us just laugh
at the others who cry.

Broken hearted. Saba who gotcha.
Banking, lacking, renewed.

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,670
Some of us get,
some of us stay

423
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,470
and some of it's just Latin beds.
We made

424
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,750
hops out sounding buster here,
Deb.

425
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,230
Thank near everybody you trust to here.

426
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,180
It can always fix everything.
You bring

427
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,310
some of this guilt.
Some of us take,

428
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,950
some of us pre sell the sand.

429
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,640
Most of us just don't know where to begin.

430
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,120
It's guilty hearted pledges.
Got Bacon,

431
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:58,070
some unorthodox magic.
Can't help it.

432
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,790
Or who's eating if you win

433
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,190
some some sin.

434
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,370
[inaudible] [inaudible]

435
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,103
wow.

436
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,200
First Time I ever done that one
life. Really? Yup. Alright, hold on,

437
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,210
let me turn it again. Okay.
Am I back? There we go.

438
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,820
That's the first time you've ever
done in my life. Really? Yeah. Wow.

439
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,240
That's awesome. I'm monitoring dude.
That's bad ass. I love that song.

440
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,890
Do you sometimes forget like,
uh,

441
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,750
did that lyrics are the thing and you
have to kind of make shit up on the fly.

442
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,630
Like, oh, like, oh, I just
fucked up at Coursera.

443
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,910
I would kind of bring it back like
[inaudible] which, you know, I was still,

444
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:56,630
I was taught by some cats that,
that showed me along the way.

445
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,030
If you mess up on the guitar, you know,
do it again. Oh, just like go do it again.

446
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,300
Okay. I look, make it look like
you're meant to do it kind of thing.

447
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:08,630
You know what I mean? Or just own it.
Own it and keep it moving. You know?

448
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,070
I'll be honest,
if I have a mess up terribly,

449
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,970
I'll stop doing it. I was doing it shows
the whole hold up man. Ah, this, yeah,

450
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:21,500
that sucks right there.
I just really chopped that to hell.

451
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:24,980
So we're going to start over and what they
get right. Is there a time limit? Like,

452
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,130
yeah. If it's like 30 seconds left
in this song, you're obviously,

453
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,570
you're probably not going to do that.
I mean, it would have to be something.

454
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,040
It would have to be something that
disturbed my groove enough. Right.

455
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
Where I couldn't stop thinking
about it, you know? Yeah.

456
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,130
Which after 20 some odd years, it would
take a pretty big bump in the road.

457
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:46,990
You know, you've been on
the road like crazy lately,
right? You've been just doing?

458
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,400
Yeah,
I'm on a new new,

459
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,530
you know, just, I love playing music man.

460
00:28:50,531 --> 00:28:53,800
We've been doing a combo of live
band stuff and I'd just, like I said,

461
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:58,280
I just did a run of acoustic shows
and I really enjoyed it. And you know,

462
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,060
what did you do? Acoustic? You just,
you and the guitar. That's it. Um,

463
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,300
sometimes I'll have another guitar guy
sitting with me to cover like lead parts

464
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:07,420
for the, you know, certain songs
and little counter, you know,

465
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:11,080
picking while I'm strumming kind of thing.
Just to add to the song a little bit,

466
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,420
I was just in Louisville
when we were there.

467
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,770
The University of, of Kentucky is
playing the University of Louisville.

468
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,840
Oh, basketball game. That's like the
worst day ever day. Hate each other.

469
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,680
Apparently they have like a

470
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,130
civil war going on.

I'm Polish it up cause it's ridiculous.

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,630
wired.com Kentucky wins.
But students lose in basketball.

476
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:50,320
Rive photos that got to see this shit.
These stupid mother fuckers, they're all,

477
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,840
their pictures are all on the Internet.

478
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,530
They don't know anymore. This is not
the same world that seventies yeah.

479
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,060
You kept this right. Reflect
on like man, like you.

480
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,440
I used to love shows like
deadwood and I'd be like, man,

487
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,340
Different briefings can suck.

488
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:26,200
It's the university that's America
home. Those aren't white. Right?

489
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,240
So that's America.

Done dog. Look at this. This
guy's got blood all over him.

493

He broke his hands open trying to smash
a windshield with his fucking fists.

494
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,180
He's bleeding off of his hands and they
got a close up. But those dickheads face,

495
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,840

Somewhere in there is a kid that in 20
years is going to be running for Senate.

500
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,880

he's also listening to us, right? Yeah.

502
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,570
That little fucker right there.

503
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,880
He looks kind of like the one

504
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,350
A young said Toro. Yeah. What are
you doing? You playing a commercial.

505
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,130
I just want to talk about
the style and performance.

506
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,680
Is that a Hyundai Hyundai's look
like Mercedes Benz? No, it's amazing.

507
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,210
You see that thing that new Hyundai?

510
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:43,010
They all knew it guys got it was a crazy
there. Kentucky gentleman in his hand.

511
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,310
That's what he's drinking.
He's like,

512
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,300
do your audiences like psycho and
couldn't be better. Couldn't it?

513
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,090
Couldn't have been better audiences
in on earth. It was impossible. They,

514
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,730
Duncan got a round of applause
and a standing ovation,
not just around applause.

515
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,650
Standing ovation,
every show going on stage going on stage.

516
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,460
He was getting standing ovations. They
couldn't have been nicer, friendlier,

517
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:08,270
more fun. Louisville was
the shit. It's a fun place.

518
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,670
That's the beautiful thing
about clubs like the Improv,

519
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:15,620
like look high end clubs is they develop
like people that are like fans of

520
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:16,281
comedy too.

521
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:21,281
Like you know there's not a lot of places
in the country where you can guarantee

522
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,000
you're going to see like national level
comedians but you know all the Improv's

523
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,000
you're going to get like all big
name comics going to come through.

524
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,580
They couldn't have been any better man.
That place was amazing.

525
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,030
Louisville's a shit.
Why I got to get to a show.

526
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:36,320
I haven't been to one in a minute man.

527
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,040
Next time you're in Monday I could
have was about to, I'm about to

528
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,490
uh, lay down a uh, a video I say lay down.

529
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:47,390
Cause I'm [inaudible] over their job
is when I'm talking to musicians, man,

530
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:51,770
I like to use their language. They don't
have video laid down a video though, man.

531
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:56,240
I'm saying that bitch down. You know
some, some uh, comedy on that pitch.

532
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,220
I'm going to put it on Vhs, Joe. Now
Beta, bro. I'm sticking with Beta.

533
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:04,370
So you wouldn't go there. I mean,
are you already going the route?

534
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:08,030
The same one as the, this the recently
as Lucy can't guy just threw it out? No,

535
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,520
his idea. I started totally stolen.
I didn't have that idea first. Yeah,

536
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,820
I was trying to gate and have it
first. Either Radiohead today, music.

537
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,720
It was kind of the same
principle, I think. Yeah,

538
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,790
he's the first guy to deal with comedy.
Um,

539
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,180
and now everybody's going to do it that
way. Comedy Central. Yeah, but your folks,

540
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:27,140
man, I'm gonna tell you something about
your folks, man. Hey, your folks love you.

541
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,070
I love them too. I mean, these twice
catch like it's, you know, it's,

542
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,730
I don't want to say that's why I
don't really know why. So I mean,

543
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:38,030
that happens a lot of folks. That's going
to be hollering at the website, man.

544
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah. You know what, dude,

545
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:43,610
I really firmly believe that when
you put positive energy out there,

546
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,490
you attract like minded people.
You're going to get a few cots in the mix.

547
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,080
It's inevitable, especially on the
Internet. Especially like an in text form.

548
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,830
Like when dudes get to tweet shitty
things to be bullish on our message boards

549
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,690
or something like that.
Like yeah.

550
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:59,330
My thing is like do you really
think that stopped my day?

551
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,300
Did he think that slowed me down in my ra?
Yeah.

552
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,380
It's real simple man.

553
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,110
Don't ever say anything to anybody
that you wouldn't say to their face.

554
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,980
Just don't do it. And if you do say it,
say it as if you had say it to their face.

555
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,450
Otherwise you're a cunt.

556
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,530
It's that pretty much if I say something
I'm going to say it to your face.

557
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:21,050
Like I got a bunch of negative tweets
here that night cause so some dude in

558
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,030
front of the country music awards.
Okay.

559
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,910
Homeboy is standing there with fake
rips in his jeans like you bought.

560
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:29,810
Jeans are already pre ripped and he's
standing in front of a jet and I dunno if

561
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:33,190
the song was any good cause quite honestly
I said the song was, I said, here's,

562
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,531
I go,

563
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:36,920
this is country I dudes wearing fake
ripped jeans standing in front of a jet

564
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:40,160
singing shitty song. And then the
Hashtag was that ain't country. No,

565
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,060
but it's silly jeans. You're a
silly bitch. You're a silly bitch.

566
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:46,010
If you weren't fucking
fake ripped jeans period.

567
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,110
Thousand 12 ever had fake ripped jeans.
Yeah, I might've. I might've. Yeah,

568
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,340
I might have bought some.
Yeah.

569
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,850
Did you ever used to bleach your genes
in the basement where report actual real

570
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:56,840
bleach on your genes in the 80s no,
I didn't

571
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,500
definitely have owned a pair
of jeans with rips in them.

572
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,380
They might've been like given to
me from wardrobe on fear factor,

573
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,710
but I had them in a warm, but it's, I'm,

574
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm old enough now to realize that's
ridiculous. Kind of ridiculous.

575
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,540
Very Nickelback by the way.
Yeah.

576
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,430
But I bet you it's easy to buy him by
mistake nowadays because now they have

577
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:15,530
genes that just look like
they're fucked up a little.

578
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,660
But then you wash them once
and they become ripped jeans,

579
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,850
you know like where the, the the
clothing is like very thin. Yeah.

580
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:24,530
Like you can buy it by mistake going
while those genes and the next thing you

581
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,490
know you have some ripped jeans and
you're at the rainbow room. Yeah.

582
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:31,250
But this dude had brand new five o ones.
If I were a junior, that's my new thing.

583
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:34,820
Man. I just got them. I love all the way
to do it. Crispy. I don't even wash them.

584
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,270
These have not been washed like
cardboard man. No, I'm serious.

585
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,230
This is how we're going.
Then I throw them away.

586
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,730
That's Bala. That's hilarious.
That's it. A Charlie Murphy. I live,

587
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,170
I live at the sergeant supply sergeant
supply over there in Burbank, man.

588
00:35:51,171 --> 00:35:53,820
It really? Yeah. Was Five
Oh ones all day long, man.

589
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,190
Just get a new pair
every week on the road.

590
00:35:56,191 --> 00:36:00,930
I throw up like 14 pairs of no in
the last like three shows. Really?

591
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:04,380
Yeah. You could probably sell those
sits up so much on the bus and stuff.

592
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:06,630
I wear gym shorts and just
kind of lounge around, so,

593
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,150
but do you actually throw them out
and you give them to like goodwill or

594
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:13,350
something nice. Kind of usually
leave him in a hotel. You should.

595
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,970
I really want it. Usually on solar I
sweat so much, like in those things, man,

596
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,900
every, it'd be like, you know,

597
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,210
I don't have time to wash them and I'm
not trying to give him the goodwill,

598
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:24,660
like just loaded with my, you're loaded
with my DNA, you know what I mean?

599
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,500
I bet there's some people out
there that would buy it big, big.

600
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll just start tweeting hotel rooms
across. Yeah. I'm leaving some jeans here.

601
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,320
Ate Taco bell earlier. Might smell
great. Yeah. Yeah. You should just, yeah.

602
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,450
This is going to be dudes who
it'd be jerking off sniffing.

603
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,820
It's a doozy.
I got really real up.

604
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:46,340
I'll never throw another way of

605
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,950
five oh one four the stinky
in my pinky. Okay. What?

606
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,680
I think you need to play a
song, just a curious of what
he does. Right. By the way,

607
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:02,130
that surplus store is really awesome
and I go there to buy like fucking gas

608
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,960
masks and crazy shit all the time.

609
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,580
But then I feel like people actually
wore these and died in Nepal where like

610
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,670
military pants and jeans is what I
wear. So yeah, that's my wardrobe man.

611
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,290
Those are the best. Like
cargo pants fit so much. Shit.

612
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,280
I don't need to carry around my
fanny pack. I've got a fanny pack.

613
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,670
People think I'm bullshitting.
Catch me at the airport.

614
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,160
Ready to sweat my fanny pack.
Yeah. Oh yeah. Here we go.

I'm not going to live with it

621
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:01,680

more time. Oh from the top? Yeah.

644
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,690
[inaudible]

645
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,660
damn. That is so awesome.
That's a beautiful cover man.

646
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,190
God Damn. What a fucking song that is.
Yeah. I remember when I wrote it, man,

647
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:49,120
it was real hard back in
the day and another 59,

648
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,610
man, I'm so stoned with watching this.
[inaudible] it's almost too much. Really?

649
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:57,730
Yeah. It's just, uh, it's, it's
like freaks me out a little,

650
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,390
being able to just see this so close
to me. I don't know. It's weird.

651
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,690
This would be the dopest intimate
concert of all time. Yeah.

652
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,990
My dog's named Johnny Cash. Is that
right? Who did Johnny Cash Fan?

653
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,610
I had a rottweiler named Elvis. Uh,
I had a pit bull named Frank Sinatra.

654
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,670
That's awesome. But that was before
I really got to know Frank Sinatra.

655
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,890
Personality still is frank.
Oh Man.

656
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,560
But better off having a pit bull
named frank. I'll raise you with Tony.

657
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,030
Tony Bennett. I had a cat
named skittles. Skittles. Yeah.

658
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,550
I had a uh,
in Florida shoot him

659
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,480
cat named Jack Dempsey. I should a ride.
I just got to say, and I don't care.

660
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,890
I don't care what the kid did. You can
see they're saying, oh, I'm going there.

661
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,920
Was that all right? Okay, good. Can I go
there on this Trayvon Martin thing? My,

662
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,400
my take on it? Yeah. Yeah, please.
No matter what the kid did.

663
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,740
There's two kinds of 17.
There's Lebron James 17.

664
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:59,300
It looks like a 36 year old man. Right,
right, right. And then there's child 17,

665
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,580
and I haven't seen one picture of this
kid that isn't a child. 17. And this dude,

666
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,670
ways of outweighed him by a hundred
pounds. 100 million. Yeah. Italy. Oh,

667
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,560
it's, you seen the size of the dude
and I pictures from what I'm seeing,

668
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm guessing on that one. On the wait.
Okay. Outweighed him significantly.

669
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,790
Regardless of that. Most he's in
danger of his blood or broken jaw.

670
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:23,930
Maybe a black guy.
His story and I don't know what happened.

671
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:26,090
I'm just saying grown man against a kid.

672
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,610
I'm talking about me against
a 17 year old kid. I need to,

673
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,780
there's no kid on earth that,
that looks like that in the eyes.

674
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,170
Like a baby, like a child.
Not like a grown man,

675
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:38,330
like dude who's been like through the,
you know,

676
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:42,680
the client is going to put me
on my back and kill me. Yeah,

677
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:47,480
but that's you. This guy
might've been kind of a bitch,
you know. I mean this guy,

678
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,850
I'm just saying murder's murder.

679
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,860
He tried to be a cop and
as far as I'm concerned,

680
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:55,400
the one that stood his ground at
night is the one that's dead baby.

681
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,234
But maybe not.

682
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,350
You know his stories that the kid came
back and attacked him and he actually has

683
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,710
supposedly ABC news
was reporting Destinee.

684
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,910
They've enhanced the video and they
found cuts in the back of his head.

685
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,830
Which Shannon on the back of your head.

686
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:12,920
I just don't see it as worth
killing somebody. I agree with you.

687
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,470
But I mean his story is the
kid was trying to get his gun.

688
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,090
His story is told you not to follow.
Dude, police told you stay out of it.

689
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,660
[inaudible] this is a man who thought he
was an authority figure and was itching

690
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:26,950
to use his gun. That's the bottom
line. And I'll leave her to town.

691
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,920
But he did apparently according
to the nine one one call,

692
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,010
they told him to turn around and he
did turn around and his story is,

693
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,650
that's when the kid jumped up.
I don't know what the fuck is true.

694
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,650
I don't know what he could have said to
the kid to piss them off like that if he

695
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,990
did. You know, I,

696
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:45,760
I definitely agree that
dude was into being, uh,

697
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,670
itching uses gun man. But it also
could have been that, you know,

698
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,980
they were in a life and death
struggle. I wasn't mad, man.

699
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,220
I agree that the only reason it was us,
we,

700
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,760
if it was a life and death struggle
though, you'll get grant Munis.

701
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,050
And the only reason it was because one
of them brought a gun and it wasn't the

702
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:04,250
kid. That's true. Yeah. And he, he thought
he now had there not been a gun there.

703
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,730
The worst that could have probably
happened in the situation was one of the

704
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:12,190
others got their ass kicked. Right.
Right. If there hadn't been against,

705
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,510
there was no gun at the scene.

706
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,620
But his deal is that he's trying to be
like neighborhood patrol man with a gun.

707
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,940
Well it would would be wants to somebody,
actually you have a gun,

708
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:26,060
you want to shoot somebody need
when there's bad people out there.

709
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,140
That kid was not what he was looking
for obviously. But I'm saying,

710
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,550
but hold on a second.
You know that in that neighborhood,

711
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,940
a man is in critical condition right
now of 50 year old guy who got beaten

712
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,410
almost to death with hammers and two
to 18 year old kids were arrested.

713
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,870
They robbed him and they beat the
fuck out of this guy with hammers.

714
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,900
So it's not like there's not bad people
in the world that you could use a gun.

715
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,500
There was no, I agree. Are there
wouldn't be a dead person. That is true,

716
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:53,460
but that is this scenario. There
could have been an easily a scenario.

717
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:56,670
This is a very bad area with these people
who live in and there's a lot of break

718
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:59,280
and entries as a lot of robbery.
A lot of us. You're right.

719
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,750
Which is why in the correct manner,
I'm just saying studio, they are.

720
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,140
When I look at decade, well I do
as well, but he's just that kid.

721
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:11,310
That's a terrible situation.
Real mother fucker could sense evil.

722
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,623
You know what I mean?

723
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,620
Like the kind of evil that would
beat up man to death with hammers.

724
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,970
That you could sense that Joe, you can
feel that in the air. I agree. I agree.

725
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,380
But again, if that was his story, I
don't know what the fuck happened Bro.

726
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,950
But his story is that the kid jumped him.
That's his story.

727
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,210
If that's his story yet. Yeah. Well it's
been, it's been out there. It's been,

728
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,960
I ain't heard him tell his with his words.
Yeah, I ain't heard him tell his story.

729
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,390
You know,

730
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,860
I haven't heard anybody else if be sat
here in front of me and told his story

731
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:43,000
and I looked in his eyes and I
believed him. That's a different,

732
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:47,070
but do you understand that? I don't
want no one's talked. No one's talked.

733
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,800
We're getting all Nancy Grayson saying,
I see a little baby.

734
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,910
I'm saying I'm not even talking about
race a race. Nothing else aside.

735
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:58,320
I'm saying had a man that was itching,
itching to be a bad ass with a gun,

736
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:02,040
not brought a gun to a situation
that didn't need it anyways. True.

737
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,910
There wouldn't be a dead person.
If a guy that's wrongful death,

738
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,940
that's murder man. You had some big
John McCarthy type cop out there.

739
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,890
Nothing would ever happened. He would've
said the kid, how are you doing tonight?

740
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,910
And the kid who said, I'm all good, and
they would have said, have a good night.

741
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,350
Be careful in.
That would've been the end of it.

742
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,240
It's a lot of it is people
that are looking for trouble
and a lot of the reason

743
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,150
why they're looking for troubles that
cause they're insecure and this easily

744
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:27,410
could have been with this guy was deal is,
I don't know the dude. I'm just saying,

745
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,800
I see your baby days. That bothers me.
That is the Bob is a fuck out of me.

746
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,640
I'll be honest, if those pictures
had looked like he was a hood,

747
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,050
I would probably feel a lot different.
I'd probably be like, Oh man,

748
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,950
looks like he's kind of a hood,
but I don't.

749
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:45,390
It's just looks like a kind of kid to
me. It's true. It is true. But you know,

750
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,690
I don't bring a gun against a kid man.
I'm just saying,

751
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:51,000
I thought he was going to run
into kids though. You know,

752
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,260
he's patrolling to run into a situation
where he could pull out his gun.

753
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,180
Maybe you might be right or why else
would you carry it if you're not your

754
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:01,230
average police officer?

755
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:05,850
I bet you your average real like
normal personality of a human being,

756
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,511
police officer,

757
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:09,450
Pri does not like the fact that all
that they have a gun all the time.

758
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,000
I would disagree with that heavily.

759
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,060
I have a lot of friends that use of it
would be not a lot of friends that are

760
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:17,190
cops. They don't want to pull that
gun out. That's for God. Damn.

761
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:19,230
That's what I mean. I mean in
a sense that the, you know,

762
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,740
the thought of using it is actually
very foreboding and not something

763
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:23,670
interesting at all.

764
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,880
I have friends that have shot people
before and you talked to them about and

765
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:30,150
then it's not a pleasant memory. It's
not a good thing, you know? Uh, I've,

766
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,220
I've, I've had, that's
the thing on your belt,

767
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,490
the last thing you ever really
want to have to reach for.

768
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,730
I had a conversation with the dude just
a couple of weeks after you had a shoot

769
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,930
dude. And he was, you know,

770
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,470
just start starting to get back into the
swing of things in his head. You know,

771
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:46,840
just dealing with the fact, he's like,
I'm happy I did it. He goes like,

772
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:48,280
I was a piece of shit.
But let me tell you,

773
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,420
it's to fucking tricky thing taking
a man's life. Yeah, it's crazy.

774
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,620
I would like to hear the
dude tell the story. Yeah.

775
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,690
I would tell me I wish I hadn't is
doing more harm than good while his

776
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,930
[inaudible] you know the real issue
though is there's the legal issue.

777
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,530
I mean this guy, if he is
innocent, if you are innocent,

778
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,900
you really should shut the fuck up
until your lawyers get your, you know,

779
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,150
get everything in the proper order.

780
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,470
And this too many channels right
now for prosecutors to go after,

781
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:16,120
people that aren't necessarily guilty.

782
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:19,150
And there's a lot of people behind
bars right now that if they had better

783
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,310
representation,
if they didn't open the fucking mouth.

784
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,580
I'm not saying in this guy's case,
but if the guy is innocent,

785
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:28,150
he really probably should shut the fuck
up until he actually goes to trial or

786
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:32,140
talks to the prom. But him going on, Larry
King, sorry. Can't do anything anymore.

787
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,330
No, him going on Pierce Morgan, here's,

788
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:37,860
you know that ain't got his brother was
on piers Morgan though. Yeah, I didn't.

789
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,900
I missed that. Yeah, his brother
was on. I didn't mean to go there,

790
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,220
but I just know let's man,

791
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:45,010
you went there because it's a part
of my culture kind of bugs me.

792
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:49,630
You know what I mean? It's like God needed
to, you know? I just feel like I said,

793
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,660
there's, there's two different
17 year olds and you know,

794
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:56,790
I don't know if you want, if you, if
you miss doing neighborhood watch, you,

795
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,330
you're supposed to be looking
out for your community.

796
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,340
How do you know that wasn't
a person from your community?

797
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:04,270
You must not approach them
in a manner that was like,
excuse me sir, or excuse me,

798
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:05,380
what's going on?
You know what I mean?

799
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,770
There must've been some real rude
shit and if you didn't bring a gun,

800
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,690
nobody would be dead.
That is true,

801
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,530
but that's my biggest point is that if
the dude that wasn't itching to use his

802
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,360
weapon didn't bring a weapon,

803
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:18,670
there probably wouldn't be
even anything except a kid.

804
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,570
And you know that got scraped up in a
scuffle or a man that got scraped up in a

805
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:25,540
scat. That is true in
this situation, you know?

806
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,670
But against this guy I'm talking about,

807
00:49:27,671 --> 00:49:31,450
that's not necessarily what this guy
was looking for when he's armed doing is

808
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:34,540
neighborhood watch. He's looking
for people like these two kids.

809
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,360
One of them's 18 five foot eight and he
was wearing a blue denim shirt and he

810
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:42,730
beat a fucking 50 year old man with a
hammer. You know, that guy's fucked up.

811
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:46,510
That guy is severely fucked up and we'll
probably never be the same human being

812
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:49,390
again. He might die. I wonder if he dies.

813
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:51,760
They'll pay as much attention
as this kid that got shot.

814
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,890
Cause it's Kinda fascinating man.
You know,

815
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:57,430
there's a lot of people that are real
squeamish about talking about black kids

816
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:00,030
doing something violent to wipe you
out. I ain't got no problem. We were,

817
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,380
you raised him. I know. You know
what I mean? I don't need to,

818
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:05,860
I gotta say I admit it openly.
Like if it looked a lot more hood,

819
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,220
I'd probably would mentally feel
different about it. That's just natural.

820
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,410
What your mind works.
I'm talking about our culture.

821
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm not necessarily talking about you.
I think on our culture it's a,

822
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:17,710
it's interesting. We all have a little
bit of that regardless of all of us on it.

823
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:22,540
We're also looking to catch people in a
Gotcha moment of racism. We love that.

824
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:27,541
We would love to find someone who
especially saw a safe situation like that.

825
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,010
And to

826
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,860
be honest, the real problem
isn't even Ms. Dot. Zimmerman.

827
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,460
The real problem is this law called
the stand your ground law that says,

828
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,400
if me and you are in a place
basically and nobody else is around,

829
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,350
and I say you attack me and make
it look that way, you can shoot,

830
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,220
I can easily kill you
and get away with it.

831
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,170
Cool. And it's just two people, man.

832
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,860
It's fucking hard to figure out
what the hell happened. Exactly.

833
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:52,740
I know there's a lot of crazy fuckers
out there that can just tell lies, man.

834
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,040
You know there's a, there's
a lot of people out there
that are completely socio.

835
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,410
Exactly. So if you give them opportunity
to use their gun in a situation,

836
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:04,790
it's like a lot of people could start
disappearing or falling victim to a,

837
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,770
you know,
a self defense.

838
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,040
Who would you like actually moved to
Florida just so they could shoot people

839
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:13,600
easier. You know, just start some
arguments. I went down here, man.

840
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:18,620
I went down in Florida is one of the
weirdest fucking places in the country.

841
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,070
It really does feel like you're in
another place. I'm there in two weeks.

842
00:51:22,071 --> 00:51:25,220
I'm doing not a Improv in Fort Lauderdale.
I like going down there.

843
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,080
They know how to party.
There are a lot of fun people,

844
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,420
but it really feels like you're on
an island somewhere and you know,

845
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,560
in another country that it's
like subject to us rules.

846
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,830
But no one's really watching. Let's
kind of like to wow. You know,

847
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,730
still the 80s down there in a weird
way. Yeah. In a lot of ways. Yeah.

848
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,120
It's Florida strange kind of
where the whole place is built on

849
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,410
cocaine money,
man.

850
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,320
Literally like literally there's that
whole like you've seen the cocaine cowboys

851
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,860
like, right? Yeah. Like my f downtown.

852
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:55,280
Miami's like literally
built with kilos of cocaine.

853
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,620
They just poured it into the cement.

854
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,490
Yeah. It's amazing. It's
so ridiculous. What I,

855
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,350
there's more banks per capita
apparently in Miami than anywhere.

856
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,980
It's all just money laundering
going down left and right.

857
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:12,300
If you haven't seen cocaine cowboys folks,
we've talked about it before, you must,

858
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,163
you must,

859
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,930
can, you must see it. See? Yes, yes, yes.

860
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,820
To that was to the US and then with
the grant. The godmother. Yeah,

861
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,370
the Godmother who's alive. This bitch
is killed. Who knows how many fucking,

862
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,120
and she's just chilling.

863
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,700
So she made like 500 mil a year in jail
and she was such a bad ass bitch that

864
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:34,790
ain't even tried to kill her

865
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,350
a woman and they just let her run shit.
Oh my God.

866
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:41,300
That's a crazy documentary.
Yeah.

867
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:46,070
I think Miami's the closest to a foreign
country we have in America outside of

868
00:52:46,071 --> 00:52:48,320
Puerto Rico, which is technically
sort of America, right?

869
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,370
Isn't cause I still don't
think debating that recently.

870
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:55,240
Like whether they want to become a
state finally come on, just be a state.

871
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:58,630
What do you give a fuck? But it's cool
to fucks up all the flags though, man.

872
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:03,190
We got everybody's got to get a
new flag. Yeah, right on my harbor.

873
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:05,320
Some resentment.
Where would we put that extra

874
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,030
star? Where the fuck is that
going to go? I don't know. Spit,

875
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:12,810
you know that's going to take like a
some sort of mathematical seamstress type

876
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:17,480
to figure out weird shit like Hawaii.
Five hours in a fucking room

877
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:21,730
lane over the ocean and yet
it's still America, Alaska.

878
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,070
I had some Alaskans come to the last
show and they were telling me like, who

879
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,950
do, how do I tip you? Uh, after
I got off stage and I'm like,

880
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:32,220
what are you talking about? Goes, I'm
well, I want to tip you. And I'm like, no,

881
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:32,971
you don't take, he's like, oh,

882
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:36,180
this is my first comedy show and it's the
most insane thing I've ever seen in my

883
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:38,400
life and it's, I want to
tip you. I'm like, no,

884
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,260
don't tip me what the
fuck you're talking about.

885
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:44,550
But it was so weird talking that he seemed
like he was from a different country.

886
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:47,490
Like he, he, he was talking all
this other things like that.

887
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,050
Well, essentially they are. Yeah. I mean
it really is. It's not attached. Right.

888
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,450
I mean, my joke, if it's not attached,
it's just some shit we stole. Right.

889
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,940
That is what it is. Or Barn. Yeah.

890
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,940
Would you ever go to the Indian bought
from somebody who stole it fucking

891
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:04,830
whiskey and they took
Manhattan for like seven bucks.

892
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:08,120
Would you ever go to Alaska to do comedy
or do you think is like now you people

893
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,260
there for that? Yeah,
it was pretty Douglas.

894
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,000
Stan hope used to go there all the time,

895
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:14,920
but they just got to be too stupid
for him. He bailed after awhile.

896
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,730
He couldn't take it anymore.
Did get pretty nutty up
there. From what I hear, man.

897
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:21,500
Hell yeah. They do six months a day
live six months and night. Yeah.

898
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,300
And there's bears everywhere and you know,
it's fucking crazy.

899
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,700
You live in nutty place.
It's ridiculous.

900
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:31,320
He live in a place where humans,
humans aren't necessarily supposed to be.

901
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,450
It's for fucking for reason. For a good
chunk of the year. Like death freezing,

902
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:40,380
like Antarctic style freezing this,
this, I couldn't do it. Yeah, that's,

903
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:43,020
that's hard. Do you ever see
that movie 30 days of night?

904
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,210
Is it a vampire movie? Yeah, pretty good
vampire movie man. And they, uh, the,

905
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,930
the vampires go to Alaska because they
could just fuck people up for a whole

906
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:55,630
month.
It doesn't get light out for a month.

907
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,200
That's gotta be depressing a shit,

908
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,300
you know? I mean you think say
adol is depressing Seattle.

909
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:09,210
How am I went to Copenhagen and uh,
we land in and we went to this place,

910
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:11,670
we had heard of this legendary
place called Christianity.

911
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,350
I don't know if you're familiar.

912
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,880
It's like a place that squatters took
over apparently in, and they were legally,

913
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,190
they, it's basically a little section
in the middle of the city where they,

914
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,260
they can slang hash
and weed and they just,

915
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,810
government kind of looks the other way.
They're squatters.

916
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:27,150
But every once in a while the government
goes in there and like tries to rate it

917
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:30,180
and they fight him off. It's crazy. This
little section is called Christiania.

918
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,770
How big is it? It's tiny. The Cup.
It's like maybe six blocks of land.

919
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,110
So it was just within
like a gate and it's like,

920
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,060
it looks like a hippie community.

921
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,250
Like looks like little
little gardens in this nap.

922
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:44,740
And then you walk down this road and
they got all these sheds set up and their

923
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:48,630
slang in weed there. Wow. Good weed. Yeah.

924
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,710
So like I remember we
got some real good way.

925
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,270
Went back to the hotel and smoked up and
it was about seven in the evening and

926
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:57,930
the sun was still out. So Bang, let me
smoke weed. This weed knocked me out.

927
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,120
I fell out. I wake up, I look at my
watch and says, three, I look outside,

928
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:06,180
it's light. It's, I was like, man,

929
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:10,470
that shit knock me out from seven last
night, two to three the next afternoon,

930
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,000
Jesus Christ. So I go downstairs
and I'm talking to the lady,

931
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:17,720
something about something at the desk
and I'm like, yeah, I was there. Where's,

932
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,970
where's a good place to eat?
She's like, sir, it's three
in the morning. She's like,

933
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,040
it's not three in the,

934
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,240
that blew my mind. It's short circuited
me. That was one day, right? Like it,

935
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,560
it screwed me on where I went up to the
room and like my brain was having a hard

936
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:35,830
time processing the thought of the sun
being out bright as hell at three in the

937
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:39,640
morning. How long is it bright for? If
he goes down apparently for like an hour,

938
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,060
like between 12 and one every night it
kind of goes down and it doesn't ever go

939
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:45,030
all the way down. It's kind of
dusk and then it comes back up.

940
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,410
It's must be so happy that
certain times of the year,

941
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,030
this is like summertime and um, I bet the
winters, I don't know if it's different,

942
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,370
I don't know if they suffered
the opposite, but it was like,

943
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:55,121
it's short circuiting me.

944
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:58,330
So what my point is is like six months
of something like that. Yeah. Would,

945
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,540
would pry fry your board man,
I'm pretty sure they do in Alaska.

946
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:05,170
I'm pretty sure in Alaska there's moments
where they have like almost perpetual

947
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:05,980
sunlight.

948
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,710
I think they just have like an hour
where it goes down for a little bit and

949
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,810
comes back up.
I think that's the case up there too.

950
00:57:10,811 --> 00:57:12,420
His Copenhagen's pretty far up there,
man.

951
00:57:12,421 --> 00:57:15,220
It's weird that they would just decide
to like not have things open at three in

952
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:18,490
the morning when it's bright out. Just
stay the dead. Come on. It's like,

953
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,050
why are you doing hire somebody
or if you had a data business,

954
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,370
do you know that could be
your option to do? Yeah.

955
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,760
The reason why shit is closed is because
he can't see outside without lights on.

956
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:29,620
That's why shit's closed.
Okay.

957
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,310
Now that he could see how the side
with lights on keep shit open. Yeah.

958
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,680
Why fuck you doing man? What do you need
to sleep or something? What do you hate?

959
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:40,090
Money. I hate money and he'd asleep.
What is your favorite place to tour?

960
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,010
Do you have a favorite country to go to?
Um,

961
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:46,150
I'm really a big vantage of pan just
because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

962
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,050
it's the place where I feel the most
foreign. You know what I mean? It's like,

963
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:53,980
I honestly feel like a foreigner and
I enjoy that feeling like of being the

964
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:57,910
different one. Kind of. Yeah. You know,
even though it's got your two guys in,

965
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:01,840
you know more than I, but I've never
run into anything. Well there's,

966
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,520
there's one Sushi bar they wouldn't
serve me because I was guiding the, yeah.

967
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,210
Then I went to this bar and then died.

968
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:11,170
Apparently the dude just wasn't that did
on serve guys. Gene at this bar. Wow.

969
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,800
Forget the name of it. But how long
ago was this? This recent? No, no,

970
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:17,590
within a decade,
but like eight,

971
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:20,320
nine years ago and probably Brian and
I just want a couple of weeks ago.

972
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,010
First Time you actually longer,
maybe like 15 years ago. Damn. Yeah.

973
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,090
I wonder if it's changed now.

974
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:28,780
Maybe we haven't heard that associated
with old cats that are just like,

975
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:31,550
I'm not giving you my fish.
Yeah.

976
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:36,580
I re I remembered 60 years ago
and you can't have my fish.

977
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:39,580
Yeah. How old was it, dude? Do you think
he was alive back then? I don't know.

978
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:43,270
But you know old the
old enough. Yeah. Yeah,

979
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,490
but don't fucking crazy thing
for a country to go through.

980
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:49,900
Could you imagine if we found out like
Chicago disappeared in the middle of the

981
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,980
night, you know, Chicago and
Phoenix disappeared. Boom.

982
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,600
In like in a second gone.

983
00:58:55,810 --> 00:59:00,070
How would we react to some country
that just took Chicago and Phoenix just

984
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,110
vaporized? It just vaporized
500,000 people, whatever.

985
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:09,970
Fuck it was. We're the only ones I've
ever did it. Woo. That's dark. It's crazy.

986
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,710
It's dark.
It's really crazy.

987
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:16,300
If you ever look at all the different
weapons that are wive like that,

988
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:19,780
the United States has all the different
nuclear warheads you seen like a map of

989
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:22,010
like Russia's nuclear warheads,
United States

990
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,240
doing car warheads. I ran,
supposedly is working on some shit,

991
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:28,430
but Israel's got a ton of shit.

992
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:32,720
Pakistan has nuclear weapons and nuclear
weapons, you know, they're like, hey,

993
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,230
I ran, can't have them. But
everybody's got 'em, you know? Yeah.

994
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:40,040
They shouldn't have them, but nobody
should have, um, North Korea's gone. Um,

995
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,650
it's really amazing when you look
at how many of them there are.

996
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,920
Like if you look at a
map of the United or the,

997
00:59:44,921 --> 00:59:47,510
the entire world rather than all the,
the nuclear arsenal,

998
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,960
we could wipe out the whole planet
completely. Oh, many, many times over.

999
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:54,590
That's insane. And I don't know
how they're ever going to fix that.

1000
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,620
How are they going to stop those
things, you know, from being active.

1001
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,970
Gotcha.
Do trigger that.

1002
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:03,200
The law of averages says sometime whether
it's now or a thousand years from now,

1003
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:04,280
some of that Shit's gonna

1004
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,730
pop off. Yeah. People believe
that that happened in the past.

1005
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,430
There's a lot of people that believed
that there was, at one point in time,

1006
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,720
people had figured out a nuclear
power and we had a, there's,

1007
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,820
there's like evidence of giant, massive
explosions and parts of like, uh,

1008
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,700
the Middle East and stuff like that.
I,

1009
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,340
it'd be able to believe it was Lebanon
or something like that where people

1010
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:23,174
believe this.

1011
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,900
It's one of those old ancient
civilization Atlantis ideas. Yeah.

1012
01:00:27,901 --> 01:00:29,750
We'll bring some along those lines.
You know,

1013
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,110
that they think that at one point in
time we had figured out nuclear power.

1014
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,210
They know, he figured out
batteries. They had batteries.

1015
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:39,500
They found in like the pyramids and Shit,
which is pretty fascinating. You know,

1016
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:42,710
they figured out some shit,
but I doubt they ever had nuclear power.

1017
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:46,760
That's pretty preposterous. The aliens,
man, d aliens do. Aliens did it too.

1018
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,760
If the aliens come,
was that a good thing or bad thing?

1019
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,300
The aliens aren't already here.
Then we,

1020
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:57,030
then we talk about my alien technology
or any your alien, alien technology,

1021
01:00:57,031 --> 01:00:59,470
you know your heart.
Yeah. It's titanium valve.

1022
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:04,250
I firmly believe there's Dalian technology
here, dog be, it's absolutely married.

1023
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,480
How do you think that works?

1024
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,910
They just give us a little
stuff and tell us to evolve,

1025
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,620
you know, or you know, if you know, okay.
Let you know or similar to something of,

1026
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:15,730
you know, some things that got left
behind and just got studied in front,

1027
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,060
properly looked at.
You know what I mean?

1028
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,630
Like some terminator where they got the
little chip and they're like backwards

1029
01:01:20,631 --> 01:01:22,640
engineering every Jane, you
know what I mean? You know?

1030
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,190
Or it's something that we already
have that we just take for granted.

1031
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:28,120
Like birds or something.
Like birds are the aliens the whole time.

1032
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,080
Why did the array of conversation,

1033
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:34,820
I forgot how wide the span of
topics get on it. Yeah. Well I think

1034
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,580
that's, it's just like having a real
conversation, right? Oh yeah. You know,

1035
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:43,750
amongst owners. Yeah. Fuck
yeah. I think, um, if, uh,

1036
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,720
if aliens are here and I don't
think they're giving us anything,

1037
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,040
I don't believe that I did.

1038
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,720
I don't know if we've ever captured
any alien craft and back engineered it.

1039
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,010
It sounds sexy, but it also sounds like
a crock of shit. I know. I don't buy it.

1040
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,890
There's not a big enough leap. You
know, there's some leaps, you know,

1041
01:01:59,891 --> 01:02:02,920
like the transistor, there's a few
things in the fuel look back at like,

1042
01:02:02,921 --> 01:02:06,790
but it's all pretty much documented how
everybody figured out everything and

1043
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:07,870
every step along the way.

1044
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,970
I used to think before I looked into it
that maybe there was some shit that the,

1045
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,410
the army learn from Roswell and you know,
that may be the, they'd figured, Eh,

1046
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,370
now I don't think so. He just shit on our
cars. Yeah. Well, you know what? I think,

1047
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:25,230
man, I think, uh, if we have had
some contact with an alien life form,

1048
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,440
I think there's so fucking far past us
that they can pause the earth and sweep

1049
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:32,940
up and then disappear again.
I mean,

1050
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:36,420
I think we're dealing with some
mother fuckers food. Yeah. Or, yeah,

1051
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:38,700
we could be that. Well, I wish
they would eat some more of us.

1052
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,540
There's too many of us, you
know, too many shitheads.

1053
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,250
There should be a test and if you know,
if you don't pass the test,

1054
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:47,940
you get fucking turned into barbecue.
Like, like Logan's runners. Yeah.

1055
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:51,450
But then you don't want people to miss
their family and their loved ones.

1056
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:52,580
I don't want you to lose your,

1057
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,440
your family cause you're a dumb ass
and the alien came and eight you,

1058
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,250
I would have to be fighting with you
against the aliens was that would probably

1059
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:02,910
turn most douche bags into, you know,
probably more respectable people anyway.

1060
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,380
That's true. Right? Yeah.

1061
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:08,130
If we knew that there was a alien that
was watching there was going to eat you

1062
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:11,530
if you were a client. Yeah. That would
be good incentive to not be a continent.

1063
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:15,030
But then it'd be suicide by alien.
People just caught off.

1064
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:18,360
Just fucking run around breaking windows,
lose it for a day.

1065
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,610
Suicide by alien man.

1066
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,530
Girl breaks up you I'm going fucking to
by alien and people see him running down

1067
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:26,610
the street.
Fuck you.

1068
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:30,150
Fuck you throwing rocks and shit and
everybody watches because they know what's

1069
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:34,200
going to happen. Aliens show up, eat them.

1070
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:39,770
Hey could happen. What was it? What was
the song will make great pets. Yeah,

1071
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:43,380
yeah, yeah, yeah, we will. Well, you know,

1072
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,660
if you look at how we treat
everything that's intelligent,

1073
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:48,660
that we don't understand,
like dolphins and orchestras and,

1074
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,540
and even primates like chimpanzee
would treat them like shit.

1075
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,230
It put them in cages and shit.
You know, we, we don't know.

1076
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,520
We don't necessarily enhanced her life.

1077
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,680
Went out there given chimpanzees laptops
and showing him how to spell in a,

1078
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:04,680
we teach them a few things
to get do tricks for candy
so we could figure out how

1079
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:08,730
smart they are. But that's no different
than studying prisoners. You know,

1080
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:12,090
that's like psychological tests on
prisoners. That's all that shit is.

1081
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,510
It's really funny that we would think that
aliens would be any different than us.

1082
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,230
If you look at every single intelligent
species on this planet, you know,

1083
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:22,680
even semi-intelligent, they all take
advantage of those underneath them.

1084
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:27,660
Killer whales eat dolphins, dolphins
eat their babies. Chimps eat monkeys.

1085
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,220
We were cunts,
all lifeforms on this planet.

1086
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:36,000
It seems like her cunt. So we're,
we're, we're hoping that if there are,

1087
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,650
and you know,
it is

1088
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,840
not an alien life form that's super
intelligent. We're hoping they're not,

1089
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,630
they're better than us. They're
way better than us. We're,

1090
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,620
we're trusting that they've
got their shit together. Oh,

1091
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,710
I'm not trusting anything.

1092
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:53,430
I'm just saying that we might have
learned a few things in the last few years

1093
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:57,720
off or some shit. Yeah. I wouldn't trust
the alien far as I could throw him.

1094
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,560
But you really think we've learned
things from a back engineered alien

1095
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:06,450
technology. I like to
believe it. I believe it to
believe it. I can't prove it.

1096
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,120
I love to believe can prove it.
I wouldn't swear to it.

1097
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:12,060
If you told me like my life depended
on it, would you swear to it? I'd say,

1098
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:15,750
Oh fuck. Now it probably is
bullshit. I have on my wall.

1099
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:19,900
I have a framed the daily Roswell
daily record or whatever the fuck the

1100
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:24,430
newspaper is that the very newspaper where
they reported that they had a crashed

1101
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:26,260
Ufo,
that they've recovered it,

1102
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,250
that they've sent the parts of it
to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

1103
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:31,780
They thought they had something man.

1104
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,810
I mean they put the shit in the
paper that it was a crashed UFO.

1105
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,090
Wonder what it was. You
know, I really wish I had,

1106
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:40,760
I talked to g Gordon Liddy about
this shit. I had g Gordon Liddy.

1107
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:45,380
I mean there is an area 51 out there. You
go knowing that Neil come and kill you,

1108
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,800
they'll kill you. Yeah. They
shoot on sight when I am,

1109
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,240
I ain't romanticizing them and I
just, I just know, look at stars,

1110
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:57,210
there's a billion of them to think
during some other life forms out there is

1111
01:05:57,211 --> 01:06:00,170
just, you know, a little bit
arrogant. Yeah, for sure.

1112
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:04,130
I just don't know if they come here,
maybe not. Might be really hard to do.

1113
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:08,810
It might be too hard even for like if
you want to get real stoner and you know,

1114
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:09,620
we can be like,
well,

1115
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:12,230
maybe if they were that advanced they
wouldn't even need these ships and all

1116
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:15,200
this crap. They'd traveled in
interdimensionally. Well, you know,

1117
01:06:15,201 --> 01:06:16,340
the real theory that

1118
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,540
that trips me out, man,
is that we came from Mars.

1119
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,710
The real theory is that the reason why
human life is different from all the

1120
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:28,270
other primate life on this planet is
that what had happened was there had been

1121
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,910
the development of lower hominids on this,

1122
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:35,911
on this planet that were like reaching
close towards being like a human being,

1123
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,850
but hadn't quite gotten there.
Right.

1124
01:06:37,930 --> 01:06:40,930
But we were existing on a
completely different planet.

1125
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,830
Mars and Mars used to have water.
Mars used to have an atmosphere of faces.

1126
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,430
I don't believe in all that. I think that
most of it looks like bullshit. Yeah.

1127
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:50,020
Most of it looks like tricks and shadows.

1128
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:53,200
If you really pay attention to the high
resolution photos and the experts that

1129
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:55,270
have and that people
want to see some shit,

1130
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,460
but most likely it's
just tricks and shadows.

1131
01:06:57,461 --> 01:07:00,670
There's a few objects up there like the
pyramid looking things that make you go,

1132
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:03,850
Huh, but there's some natural
things that look like this.

1133
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:06,220
Things called the yardangs, you
know, that look like they're,

1134
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,920
they're like a look like
a face carved on a rock.

1135
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,810
But it really is just the
natural stone structure.

1136
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,610
Did you read the book about all that?
Yeah.

1137
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,420
Graham Hancock's book or read
his book about it, right.

1138
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,870
Cause against women are from Venus,
men are from Mars or whatever.

1139
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:21,900
Not that book is, um, it's uh,

1140
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,580
there's a lot of dudes who believed
that there was at one point in time a

1141
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,140
civilization on Mars that made
its way to earth many, many, many,

1142
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:31,680
many thousands of years ago. And it was
like started humping the finer lake.

1143
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,860
Primate chicks think we're them. I think
the idea is that we're them. You know,

1144
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:39,870
the, the, I think the doe guns in, uh,
Africa, a whole tribe and that's their,

1145
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:44,250
their entire mythology there at Tyler
entire mythology is based on the fact that

1146
01:07:44,251 --> 01:07:47,280
we are a tribe from Mars
and that we came here

1147
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,300
fucking fascinating show. Have to Google
that one. I'm going to have to Google.

1148
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,770
That one is fascinating shit,
man.

1149
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:57,040
I don't think it's possible, but yet look
bad. We put a fucking rover on Mars, man.

1150
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,970
We flew a fuck on rover and we're
taking pictures from Mars all day. Yeah,

1151
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,040
I mean they have all kinds
of cool shit going on.

1152
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,900
High resolution closeup photos and we
know that we can put a man in space and we

1153
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:09,790
know we can fucking send an object to,

1154
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,530
to Mars and if we can get someone
in space to stay alive and you know,

1155
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,600
not the cook them with gamma ray bursts
from giant Starks exploding out there in

1156
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:22,250
the galaxy, which is very
possible, you know? But if,

1157
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:25,670
if we can get them all the way to Mars,
like six months and they stay alive,

1158
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,030
they've got enough food, dude, they
can do what's called terraforming,

1159
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,510
where they can build machines that
are big enough to actually create an

1160
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:37,130
artificial atmosphere on Mars.
That's like, that's possible.

1161
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:38,420
Even within our lifetime,

1162
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,840
if they really started
dedicating themselves towards
it. That's some crazy shit,

1163
01:08:41,841 --> 01:08:46,310
man. Maybe spending some of these billions
there. Yeah. Fuck all this watershed.

1164
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:50,330
Could you imagine if they really did
establish a base on the moon and a base on

1165
01:08:50,331 --> 01:08:53,570
Mars? Could you fucking imagine
how crazy that would feel?

1166
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:58,610
Just to know as we are now, that
would have happened. Like as kids,

1167
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:03,530
we were told 2012 oh my God,
it's going to be Jetsons land out there.

1168
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,710
Well, that's the big argument against
the moon landing. You know, there's,

1169
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,530
there's not a whole lot of
arguments against the moon
landing. That makes sense.

1170
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:12,440
And this is coming from someone
as argued it, I've said to people,

1171
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:14,930
I don't believe we landed on
the moon. That's ridiculous. I,

1172
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,780
what the fuck do I know? I have
no idea. It's preposterous.

1173
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,710
But I do know that there hasn't
been anything from 1969 cheaper,

1174
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,580
easier a fastener behind you on
that. But, but the moon landings,

1175
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,400
it's a fascinating subject. You know, I,

1176
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:33,490
I think most likely what happened
is they did put people on the moon,

1177
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:36,530
but they faked a lot of the footage.
There's some of that footage,

1178
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:39,200
some photographs that look fake as fuck.

1179
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:42,170
There's even a guy named Jay Wiener
who made a documentary about it.

1180
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,110
There's something called a,

1181
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:47,870
a front screen projection method of
filming things before they had a green

1182
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:52,871
screen and I'm co Kubrick used it in
2001 and his idea is that that's the same

1183
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:58,430
techniques they use to fake
some of these uh, videos.

1184
01:09:58,431 --> 01:10:02,060
And he doesn't believe that that
the moon landing was a hoax.

1185
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:06,710
But what he believes is that some of
the video is, it's actually faked.

1186
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:11,870
Yeah. Preposterous. Yes. And
uh, it's really, uh, it's a,
it's a fascinating subject,

1187
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:15,510
especially when you consider the fact
that we know that they definitely fake

1188
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,420
some propaganda photos from earlier.

1189
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:22,420
NASA had these pictures of Michael
Collins and he was a attached like by wire

1190
01:10:22,891 --> 01:10:24,740
says thing like doing training exercises.

1191
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,700
And all they did was take that and they
cropped him and put it in the like a

1192
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:32,300
black background and they
said he was on a moonwalk.

1193
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,160
It's the exact photo.

1194
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,880
So we know that that
was a standard practice.

1195
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:41,510
We know that there was at least
some shenanigans going on for sure.

1196
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:44,000
Or someone decided to take
a photo and black it out.

1197
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:49,130
So his idea was that it's much more
likely that they went. But you know,

1198
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:53,840
first of all, your fucking, if they did
go, there's a lot of radiation and shit.

1199
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:55,380
You're dealing with you.
You're telling me your,

1200
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:59,570
your film's going to be Hunky dory out
there at 250 degrees on the moon with all

1201
01:10:59,571 --> 01:11:02,270
the fucking radiation. You can't
even put your, your film through the,

1202
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:04,730
the airport metal detector.
It gets fucked up,

1203
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:10,030
especially back in 1969 and these were
like regular special Hasselblad cameras

1204
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:11,780
that were designed for the moon landing,

1205
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:13,740
but there were no different
than the camera's on earth.

1206
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,020
They weren't like super
insulated or something like that.

1207
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,070
The whole thing is fascinating to me, man.
I could, I could trip on it for hours.

1208
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,080
I wish I knew a dude who is really, really
smart who didn't believe it, you know?

1209
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:28,350
But I don't everybody that I know that
doesn't believe it is only marginally

1210
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:31,650
smart and they're really smart dudes
that I know believe we went to the moon.

1211
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,010
So it's a fucking, it's a
real tough argument, right?

1212
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:39,870
You know everything you think
we went or no, I don't know.

1213
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,230
See this one of them things.
Yeah.

1214
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:46,490
I was convinced days. There's days when
I'm like, my biggest thing is like you,

1215
01:11:46,491 --> 01:11:48,950
it's like, why haven't we been
back? Why haven't you been back

1216
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,010
once in 60? [inaudible] 70 [inaudible]
almost 50 years. Yeah. Apparently there's,

1217
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,070
they were making fun of me about this on
some podcast called the skeptic's guide

1218
01:11:58,071 --> 01:12:00,680
to the universe. I, I haven't heard
it. I heard it's funny though,

1219
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,030
and I would make fun of me too,

1220
01:12:02,031 --> 01:12:06,410
especially if I was a scientist
and I actually knew things,
you know? But there's,

1221
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,090
there's certain things that I find
absolutely fascinating about conspiracy

1222
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:14,390
theory and the moon
landing is my favorite one.

1223
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:18,530
That's my number one one.
Yes. That's a good one too.

1224
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,150
That's a good one. And AIDS is
not real. That's my other one.

1225
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:27,600
That's a good one too.
I never heard that. Oh,

1226
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:30,150
that's a fascinating one.
That's, uh, that's one. Um,

1227
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,550
bye. [inaudible]. This is
a guy named Peter Duesberg,

1228
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:35,700
who's a biologist to do to prove yourself,

1229
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:39,360
like supposedly pricked himself with
the, with who? I don't know about that.

1230
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:42,150
I remember it. I thought, I remember
back in the day like some doctor,

1231
01:12:42,151 --> 01:12:45,900
actually I'd say you had something that
was supposedly aids virus and freaked

1232
01:12:45,901 --> 01:12:49,470
himself with it. Yeah, no, I
don't know if that's the same guy.

1233
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,790
This was a while back though.

1234
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:54,060
I'm going to read you a quote from Bill
Clinton and we can get off the spoon

1235
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:54,600
thing,

1236
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,770
and this is one of my favorite all time
quotes at anybody's ever said in regards

1237
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:02,970
to a conspiracy theory is,
is uh, Bill Clinton. Uh,

1238
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,100
in his book he wrote just a month before
Apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin and

1239
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:12,270
Neil Armstrong had left their colleague
Michael Collins aboard spaceship

1240
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:16,440
Columbia and had walked on the
moon beating by five months.

1241
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:20,640
President Kennedy's goal of putting a man
on the moon before the decade was out.

1242
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,180
The old carpenter asked me if I
believed it happened. I said, sure.

1243
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:27,870
I saw it on television and he disagreed.
He said that he didn't believe it.

1244
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:32,240
For a minute and that them television
fellers could make things look real weird,

1245
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,770
real, that weren't, he goes back then,

1246
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,190
I thought the guy was a crank
during my eight years in Washington.

1247
01:13:38,191 --> 01:13:42,480
I saw some things on TV that made me
wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.

1248
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,150
The fucking president said that,

1249
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,520
don't fucking president said that. And
all they did was leave a real vague open.

1250
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:54,760
Yeah. Being there. You
shouldn't say that Mr. Clinton.

1251
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:59,150
That is not fair at him. He's having
a laugh about that right there.

1252
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,330
Sick in the pits on everybody, man.
He's a troll. Maybe he did that shit.

1253
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,710
Sell records or to sell books.
You know.

1254
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,370
Could you hear about that dude that said
that a Jimi Hendrix manager killed him?

1255
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,280
Have you heard about
that? Yeah, that storm.

1256
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:17,350
I think that's also another buy my
book. You think so? I thought so too,

1257
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:21,940
until I looked into it and uh,
the way he died, he drownded wine,

1258
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:26,190
they said he had nine sleeping pills
in his, in his mouth and uh, you know,

1259
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,530
he had swallowed them. And you know,
when he coughed up a lot of it,

1260
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:34,300
nine sleeping pills and literally drowned
in wine, like that's what killed them.

1261
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:37,840
Like it's almost like he was taking
in wine while he was unconscious.

1262
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,990
It's really kind of fucked up if
the manager really did kill the guy.

1263
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,530
It's absolutely fascinating.
What do,

1264
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:46,480
what does that video of Bill Clinton
dancing? Oh No, it's not. Is it really?

1265
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:49,030
How dare you? Um, this, um,

1266
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:54,030
but this guy who was the singer from
the animals not to do Eric burden.

1267
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:58,450
Now is that as Eric Burdon
the guy who wrote that? Um,

1268
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:03,160
it's Eric Burdon in the animals. The
original animals is always the same guy.

1269
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,960
Pretty sure that's not the guy's name.
Maybe it is something [inaudible] hold on.

1270
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,750
Uh, no tour manager. That's
what you're going go roadie.

1271
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,120
No Rogan and Google me.

1272
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:19,870
You're talking about Kendrick
smart. Oh, there you go.

1273
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:25,840
That's
right.

1274
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,210
How in new woo,

1275
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,180
what do they come?
Oh

1276
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:52,030
No, no. That's all. I just know that Bart
James, right? That's the dude's name.

1277
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:56,230
Really. James Tapi. Right.
Maybe he wasn't the singer.

1278
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:59,620
Maybe he was one of the dudes in
the band. Okay, I might be wrong,

1279
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:03,240
but the video they showed of him, it
looked like he was the singer. Um,

1280
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,350
it's pretty fucking fascinating shit man.

1281
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,850
But a lot of people who are
calling bullshit, a lot of
people calling bullshit.

1282
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,380
But then other people
believe that it happened.

1283
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,410
And one of the reasons they also believe
that happened as because his manager

1284
01:16:14,411 --> 01:16:16,970
was a notorious criminal.
Um,

1285
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:20,320
apparently Hendrix had
a really scary manager.

1286
01:16:20,321 --> 01:16:24,820
This dude named Michael Jeffrey and he
even had Hendricks kidnap once to show

1287
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:27,340
Hendricks how much power he had.

1288
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:30,760
He had these last kidnap him
and hold him for three days.

1289
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:33,400
I wasn't familiar with all this.
He saved Hendricks.

1290
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:36,220
He came in and saved them and they
said like, see, you know, without me,

1291
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:39,460
you're fucked. And Hendrick's
girlfriend apparently hated him. Well,

1292
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,550
Hendricks girlfriend was thrown
off the roof of the Chelsea hotel.

1293
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:47,020
She died and Hendrix died this way.
They're both dead.

1294
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:50,520
And there was a big life insurance policy
apparently on Hendrix. And that's the,

1295
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:52,480
the knock that this guy saying,
he says,

1296
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,340
and this Guy James Wright
wrote a book about it. Yeah.

1297
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,730
It could be just trying to
sell some books. Could be,

1298
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,170
but who the fuck knows who the
manager, Dude's still around. No.

1299
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:05,650
Died in a plane crash, died in a
plane crash on a couple of years.

1300
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:08,290
It makes you wonder though,
if it would've came out of Vinci,

1301
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,760
like he might've stuff told somebody

1302
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,230
or wrote it down and as [inaudible]

1303
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,780
well journal book, apparently the manager
was a scumbag and was always broken,

1304
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:21,550
always owed money and was borrowing
money from the mob. And uh, that was uh,

1305
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:24,790
part of the problem was that the mob was
involved in all this and he was scared

1306
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:29,140
to come out and talk about it.
Who the fuck knows if it's not true,

1307
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:33,910
fuck you in your ass with a broken bottle.
You piece of shit. If you made that up,

1308
01:17:33,911 --> 01:17:37,660
you fuck hat of. That's true.
But you know, you'd have to,

1309
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,350
you'd have to be a really fucked up
dude to make up a story like that.

1310
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,530
Or You could be in a bad situation.
Just needs some cash.

1311
01:17:44,531 --> 01:17:48,490
That's the best way to sell a book or
really had a dislike for the person you're

1312
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:50,830
telling the story around,
even though it's dead.

1313
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,840
He's been dead since like 1970
something. I think, man, I don't know.

1314
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:56,770
Wish I knew and wishes

1315
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:57,510
nearly.
Dude,

1316
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:02,100
I fancy myself a pretty big Jimi Hendrix
fan and I'm totally unfamiliar with any

1317
01:18:02,101 --> 01:18:05,490
of this stuff. Be to girlfriend getting
killed and him die. You know what I mean?

1318
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,670
I was, you know, we heard the
legend of him dying on his own,

1319
01:18:08,671 --> 01:18:10,230
choking on his own vomit and

1320
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:14,810
yeah, yeah, yeah. I, uh, it,
this all started because a,

1321
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,690
I have a thread on my message board where,
um,

1322
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:21,850
it's called the things they got wrong
on the podcast because, you know,

1323
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,300
we're always high talking shit. We're,
we're often incorrect, you know,

1324
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,980
so I like to look at it
every now and then, you know,

1325
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:29,690
to find maybe some shit I didn't know.

1326
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,690
But sometimes people write things
and they don't even bother Google on.

1327
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:37,430
They just say, you're wrong about this.
And like, dude, even research it at all.

1328
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:41,390
Like he said, we were talking
about Hendricks and I'm a
huge Hendrix fan and, uh,

1329
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:43,280
we were talking about
heroin once on the show.

1330
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:47,610
And why is it so many great musicians
love heroin and all these people like

1331
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,560
Hendricks. Do you do here? When
he was arrested for heroin,

1332
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:55,640
it was arrested for heroin. He wasn't
a junkie would start it. But I mean,

1333
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:57,800
the crazy thing is like,
why would you even say that?

1334
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:01,270
All you gotta do is just Google it.
Just Google it first. You short,

1335
01:19:01,271 --> 01:19:05,600
you know Jimmy so well in it.
But that is, that's leftover.

1336
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:08,600
That's the intranet. The intranet
is going to fix that eventually.

1337
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:11,780
But this is like some leftover
legacy shit where people can write.

1338
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,730
It should be like, you
know, there's spell check,

1339
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,630
there should be like [inaudible] you
write something on a message board and

1340
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:20,880
Wikipedia, he goes, go fuck
yourself. Stupid. That's not
true. And it just shows you,

1341
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:25,030
it underlines. This is an incorrect
statement. You know, it's uh,

1342
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,680
the Internet is going to cure it.
Just like those fuck heads and Kentucky,

1343
01:19:27,681 --> 01:19:32,300
the stupid kids or their photos or
blasted across the Internet today the

1344
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:35,010
Internet is going to carry all,
you can't eat.

1345
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,150
They used to do that. So over time in Ohio
though like Ohio state, big Ohio State,

1346
01:19:39,151 --> 01:19:42,630
Michigan Games and shit like that.
They would, yeah they would have,

1347
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,450
you would walk down the street
and cars would just be on fire.

1348
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:49,620
There would be like people would be a
close dumpsters on fire and then they

1349
01:19:49,621 --> 01:19:53,310
would bomb the whole entire
neighborhood with a gas.

1350
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:56,850
And so even in your house you're sitting
there fucking eyes watering and shit

1351
01:19:56,851 --> 01:20:00,510
and you just had to like wrap towels
around your head. It was certain places,

1352
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:04,230
there's a lot of people with some pent
up energy and they need to blow that shit

1353
01:20:04,231 --> 01:20:07,140
out and these dumb fucks had been
doing it for like this for so long.

1354
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,160
But now everybody

1355
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,820
with their cell phone cameras and shit.
Yeah,

1356
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,600
you can't just do, I'd say
did it, it's over. It's over.

1357
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:15,330
Getting away with Shin is just over.
I mean like I don't,

1358
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:16,620
I can't even see like don't,

1359
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:21,630
don't get married if you plan on like
me and like a cheat Eagle worse and

1360
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:24,360
eventually someone's
going to put you on blast.

1361
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:28,590
Somebody going to take care of your
business for you. Yeah. There's no B.

1362
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,633
There's no,

1363
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,160
you gotta be integrated today.
You've got to be integrated with the hive.

1364
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,450
You know,
you know

1365
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,400
when wifey can just Google it up.
Or if Twitter's your who's talking to him,

1366
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:41,310
Twitter and Facebook and look in whatever,
there's no privacy,

1367
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:44,550
no more as best business when you
bought it. I volunteer my information,

1368
01:20:44,551 --> 01:20:46,440
I'm here and I'm doing
this and here's pictures.

1369
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:47,870
Right.
What do you,

1370
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:50,570
what do you think about people that
are having to give up their Facebook

1371
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:53,000
information to get jobs?
Have you heard that?

1372
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,160
I've heard about it again to
give up their Facebook password

1373
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,270
before and even started becoming a
story I used to tell like my nephews and

1374
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:04,890
nieces, like I'd see somebody ignorant
shit they'd post and I'd be like, Yo,

1375
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,620
this shit never goes
away. Yeah. I was like,

1376
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,680
there's going to be a time in a day when
a motherfucker's going to look to hire

1377
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:13,650
you and all of these going to have to
do is Google this and bang all that's

1378
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:17,430
going to be right in a,
in a pre organized section for him.

1379
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,060
I tried to get rid of my, my
space. I try to go with, sorry,

1380
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,620
they're holding on for dear life. You
can't even delete them. I'm serious, man.

1381
01:21:25,621 --> 01:21:28,800
They were supposed to send me email
instructions. I gave him my email address,

1382
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:33,750
send me emails, trucks, and had to leave.
Oh, I must. Oh, it got lost in the email.

1383
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,820
You know what they're like, they're
like your girlfriend from high school.

1384
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:39,240
It's like holding out. She really believes
that this whole wife and kids thing,

1385
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:42,600
that shit ain't gonna work out. She's
mad. She just got to hang in there.

1386
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:46,320
Facebook things not gonna last.
Facebook is nothing. Come on.

1387
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:49,870
My space was huge two years ago
before that not been come out.

1388
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:53,910
My experience coming back, they really
want to believe I logged in the other day.

1389
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:54,900
Did you?
I did too.

1390
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:59,930
I had a it and God knows how
long I had that spat about.

1391
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:01,530
Uh,
the country music thing.

1392
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,320
I think my, my manager's still
deal with it though. Like,

1393
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,810
cause there's parts of the world
where I believe it's still viable.

1394
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:07,880
I don't think so.
Like,

1395
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:12,160
like Russia I think still messes with
my space just to give people viruses.

1396
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,470
It's just a good distribution
method for computer viruses.

1397
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:18,620
I went there the other day to prove
that my dog's name was Johnny Cash.

1398
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:21,530
I had to fight.
I knew there was a photo of him somewhere,

1399
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,440
something about Johnny Cash.
So I had to find it.

1400
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:27,380
And then the only place was on
my mind space. Yeah. I forgot.

1401
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:31,340
I had a fake band on my space and I
found like, like seven songs I wrote.

1402
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:34,850
One was called Jujitsu and it was all
about Jujitsu and all this other bed.

1403
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:38,290
It's called Java lamps. It's
still on there. Remember my space,

1404
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:42,800
remember what we were going to do with my
space for 10 foot screws? Yeah. Did we,

1405
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:43,490
what we,

1406
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:47,870
one time we were in Denver and
it was me and my boy Eddie Bravo.

1407
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:52,820
And my buddy Tate and Duncan and, and
Brian, and we walked by a wig shop.

1408
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,840
We just baked fucking around and
wander through Denver. Great numbers,

1409
01:22:56,841 --> 01:22:59,540
a great town. And we see
this wig shop. So we said,

1410
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,770
let's just go ahead and see what's up.

1411
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:04,640
For whatever reason we decided
to buy these big crazy wigs.

1412
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:09,760
So all of them wore these wigs and we
pretended to be a band and the band was

1413
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:14,761
called 10 foot screws and this is like
after my comedy show we w w Eddie Bravo

1414
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:15,630
went on stage.
We,

1415
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:19,540
we introduced him as the lead singer
from 10 foot screws and he had the audit,

1416
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,450
how, you know, let me
hear some noise over here.

1417
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:26,410
Well like he would go like back and forth
with them and he gave out these flyers

1418
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,070
saying that they were free tickets to
the after party and made up an address

1419
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,620
like 16th street and El
Pollo Loco just made up.

1420
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:37,640
It was like you had to think something
was going on while it's happening because

1421
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:41,460
everybody was like, there,
there's, this is a stem.

1422
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,770
And they wore them for the
whole weekend. Man. It was just,

1423
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:49,660
it was a really ridiculous weekend.
But there's a very funny video about it.

1424
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,400
Is that video out there?

1425
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:55,630
How do you find that Brian Shosha
seven 10 foot skirts. Google,

1426
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:59,680
10 foot screws. I mean they were,
it was re some really funny shit.

1427
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:02,050
They had people auditioning
to be in the band.

1428
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:05,840
I remember that dude that got
them to get on his knees. It was,

1429
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,980
I'm not doing it justice. You have
to see it. You have to see the video.

1430
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:13,000
I'm going to check it out. Probably
won't be so funny to you feel. It's like,

1431
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:13,900
you know,

1432
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,320
if you have a bunch of friends went out
and pretend to be standup comedians and

1433
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:21,170
trans like a stand out. We've got, yeah,
we've done some on the ship and I get it.

1434
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,670
Life on the road, man.
Yeah, it gets weird. Right?

1435
01:24:24,671 --> 01:24:27,440
Do you go like for long periods
you do just weekends and come?

1436
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,510
No, no, that's, I still go out for
a month or two. You know, like,

1437
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:34,260
you know at the time, you
know, if I got to, you know,

1438
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,310
if I can do the weekend thing, it's,
it's why the acoustic thing is,

1439
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,230
has been becoming kind of convenient.

1440
01:24:40,231 --> 01:24:43,600
People are digging on it and
it's easy to do. You know,

1441
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:47,610
I can travel quicker and move faster.
Yeah. When you see a month at a time,

1442
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,170
is there, is there, is there leg,

1443
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,530
is it logistically more effective
to do a month at a time?

1444
01:24:52,531 --> 01:24:55,770
Like once you have the stuff out there,
your equipment, you just keep moving it.

1445
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,730
Is that the idea or you just kind of
move from one town to the next and is it

1446
01:24:59,731 --> 01:25:04,380
because it's too difficult to fly all
the way revolves more around weekends?

1447
01:25:04,381 --> 01:25:07,050
You know what I mean?
Like music Linebough play Wednesday night,

1448
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,220
you know what I mean? Awfully Tuesday
night. Right. In a town if you know it's,

1449
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:14,370
yeah,
most comedy does revolve around weekends,

1450
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:17,490
but there's a lot of dudes
who do like off night gigs.

1451
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:21,450
I do a lot of off night gigs for the UFC
cause sometimes we'll do like a fight

1452
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:25,580
night and somewhere Omaha, Nebraska or
some shit on a Wednesday night. So I'll,

1453
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,460
you know, I'll have a comedy show
on a Tuesday night. But um, yeah,

1454
01:25:29,461 --> 01:25:33,840
music is more of an everyday thing you
think? I guess I've just, you know,

1455
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:36,990
it just seems like, you know, it's,
that's the traveling band man.

1456
01:25:36,991 --> 01:25:38,010
You gotta keep it moving.

1457
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:42,870
I mean they're keep loading in lion like
a whole ton of gear just gets old man

1458
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,840
gets old. You put it in a
trailer, you're going to,

1459
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,340
I mean you gotta still
gotta unload and unpacking.

1460
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,150
So you just drag it around what?

1461
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:53,190
You fly it out there once and then you
drag it around and bring a lot of times I

1462
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,230
just rolled the bus up here to la
and take off from here. You know?

1463
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,550
And so now when you do acoustic, all
you have to do is fly, right? Yeah.

1464
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:04,040
I can fly more, more. I can definitely
get around easier. Are you allowed

1465
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,260
to bring a guitar on the
plane? Oh Man. If not,

1466
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:10,550
these cases are built for underneath.
Really? Yeah. They can take a beating.

1467
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:13,160
Let me take a meeting. Did you
see that? Uh, ever see that video?

1468
01:26:13,161 --> 01:26:17,930
United Airlines breaks guitars, uh,
after check that one out. I've seen it.

1469
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,270
Brian, pull that shit up on
youtube. It's kind of fall.

1470
01:26:20,271 --> 01:26:21,160
You're going to freak me out.

1471
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:25,760
Now fanned that make made a song about
it because they were fucking throwing

1472
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:30,440
shit around thinking I don't know about
this. Yeah. It's actually not a bad song.

1473
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,870
It's not my kind of
music. But when you, uh,

1474
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,620
when you think of the context of how this
guy had to create it and then create a

1475
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:37,460
music video,

1476
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:46,060
air lines on my way to Nebraska,
plane departed.

1477
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,350
Hello fax connecting in Chicago.

1478
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:54,410
[inaudible] on the ground
and passengers said,

1479
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,830
from seeing behind me [inaudible] my God.

1480
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:02,940
[inaudible]

1481
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,010
the abandoned.

1482
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:12,050
I exchanged a look best described as
chair at the action on the tarmac and

1483
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:16,140
knowing who's projectiles these wounds.

1484
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,133
The,

1485
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:22,380
so before I left Chicago,

1486
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:27,650
I alerted three employees who show
complete and difference to boards.

1487
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:31,950
[inaudible]

1488
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:36,380
a,

1489
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,140
you broke my Taylor Guitar.

1490
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:45,810
[inaudible]

1491
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:52,190
you are, you broke. You should fix it.

1492
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:59,680
I should've flown with
someone else or gone by car.

1493
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:04,980
[inaudible] United breaks guitars.

1494
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,970
How many hits video have
11 million.

1495
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:15,740
Suck it United. I think they did.
I think if I remember correctly,

1496
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:18,290
they ended up paying buying new guitars.

1497
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:22,970
Uh Yeah. I think he wouldn't
take it though. I think he
wouldn't take the money.

1498
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,190
I think they offered it to him,
but he said no.

1499
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,120
He was upset that it took so much and
so long for them to pay that they should

1500
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:31,670
have just paid him like a
normal person should get paid.

1501
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,240
What you think of stipulation might've
been take the video down to yeah,

1502
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,270
I bet it was. I bet. I bet
that's exactly what it was.

1503
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,510
Of course I wouldn't have
gone for that one. Yeah.

1504
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:48,560
One Guitar Bass. You know how
much publicity? 11 million
youtube hits gets slowly.

1505
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:53,050
Shit, I keep getting gigs
off of that. Well, yes.

1506
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:55,630
I never heard of the guy and it's a good,
I mean it's like I said,

1507
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:58,480
it's not necessarily my kind of music,
but it's a good version of it.

1508
01:28:58,481 --> 01:29:02,010
That kind of music. It's, he's a good
artist. And then I checked out his

1509
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,600
stuff online. He's likes to sort of like
a folksy story. Carol special.com. Yeah,

1510
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:10,740
he's like a folksy type of a
character. That's funny. If you ever,

1511
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:14,220
you never had your shit get
broken? No, I've, I've had clothes.

1512
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:18,750
I used to run with different cases in
this actual guitar that the case like had

1513
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:20,730
a hole punched through it and like,

1514
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:24,120
luckily it didn't do any damage
to that guitar. Ugh. Damn.

1515
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:26,930
That must've freak you the fuck out.
I was,

1516
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:29,370
that's what initiated my second by,

1517
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:34,890
I've had this probably about 10 12 years.
Mother of Pearl in lays in there.

1518
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:39,150
And this is a John Paul Leora Va.
He's like Canadian company.

1519
01:29:39,151 --> 01:29:43,580
They make handmade guitars and that
dentists love this guitar. So when is it,

1520
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:47,220
how many differently this? I play
Gibson, like doves and hummingbirds too.

1521
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:51,830
Is it special woods? Like how many
different woods are used in a guitar?

1522
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,600
I don't know dude. It's like, you know,
several, but I wouldn't even know.

1523
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:59,910
They're like cars. I don't
know how the hell they work.
I just play him, drive him.

1524
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:02,010
I just play him. I'm, I'm,

1525
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,430
one of the things that facet
mates fascinates me the
most about acoustic guitars

1526
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:06,570
is that it's organic.

1527
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,930
Like if you're looking at that thing
that's just some lacquer or some clear

1528
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:14,550
finish over some beautiful natural
wood, you know, I love that.

1529
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,730
I love that that was created
by a craftsman. You know,

1530
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,820
that's not something you could
really do with just a, you know,

1531
01:30:20,821 --> 01:30:23,970
a machine in a hole, punch
and spit it out. No, that's a,

1532
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:26,250
that's a real piece of craftsmanship,
you know?

1533
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:30,150
And then I'll just write up here if
you're going to get someone to camera. Oh,

1534
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:34,320
Angel right there. A love that
all mother of Pearl. Right?

1535
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:38,550
Is that abalone or mother
of Pearl? Motherhood. Pearl.
Wow. That's fucking dope.

1536
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,470
Yeah, I love it. Yeah, that's,
yeah, that's not just a
musical instrument. I mean,

1537
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:47,880
that's ghetto art. That's a piece of
art or in a lot of my songs on it.

1538
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,600
I bet your house. Let's hear another
one. What do you got? Um, yeah.

1539
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:53,430
Well before I do this next one,

1540
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:57,270
I just want to say one of the reasons I
asked you to come on this week was, um,

1541
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,660
uh, I've made it pretty public now
that my daughters was born with a,

1542
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:04,650
a disorder called cystic
fibrosis. And, um,

1543
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:08,040
I'm starting to get kind of heavy on
the wanting to get involved in the

1544
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,320
fundraising tip,
but,

1545
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:14,810
and I'm actually getting involved with
an organization called the CFF foundation

1546
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,960
or the CF foundation,

1547
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:21,390
cff.org if you need any facts
about what CF is, but it's like,

1548
01:31:21,391 --> 01:31:26,391
basically I'm a pulmonary and respiratory
disorder and we're basically the cells

1549
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:30,750
kind of processed salt wrong.
And I'm no genius with this.

1550
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:33,470
My wife could explain it to you
perfectly, but basically it, uh,

1551
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:34,530
you develop a whip,

1552
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:38,310
much thicker mucus in your lungs
than normal and they have to, like,

1553
01:31:38,311 --> 01:31:42,240
my daughter takes treatments to shake
them loose and whatnot. And essentially,

1554
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:42,570
you know,

1555
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:46,800
that develops over time and kind of
constricts the breathing and leads to,

1556
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:52,110
you know, um, an early demise for
a lot of kids and whatnot. And,

1557
01:31:52,111 --> 01:31:55,680
uh, but they're doing a lot of really
good breakthrough work right now.

1558
01:31:55,710 --> 01:32:00,070
Like seriously that I could within
the next decade a wrap around this

1559
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,990
thing.
It's all privately funded.

1560
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,990
I'm going to be doing concerts and
some other things in the future.

1561
01:32:04,991 --> 01:32:06,220
But right now we have a team.

1562
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,710
I tweeted you about it and
you retweeted it and the link,

1563
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:12,880
I'm sure you can find a link and just
throw it up on a thing one more time.

1564
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:14,170
We're doing a little walk,
you know what I mean?

1565
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:18,580
Just trying to get a little kind of
thing started. And uh, you know, uh,

1566
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,940
this next song is kind of about learning
my wife and myself learning about this

1567
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:26,960
and how we dealt with it.
And um,

1568
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:32,160
it's called 65 roses and it's cost 65
roses because when children try to say

1569
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,180
cystic fibrosis,
it often comes out sounding like 65 roses.

1570
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:40,600
So a lot of the organizations are,
are kind of revolve around that theme.

1571
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:43,720
But this song is just, it
seemed fitting title, you know,

1572
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:49,270
[inaudible]

1573
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,810
men.
A bit of wow.

1574
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:19,800
Census singing and smash
man too long, baby. Who,

1575
01:33:19,801 --> 01:33:23,540
what went wrong to me?
How it got spoiled, Tim,

1576
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,250
when he went back,
had to get back towns we had,

1577
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,780
we were both young,
not spirits were behold.

1578
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:36,530
Now we're just saying
green. We act like, oh,

1579
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:41,270
we can't even talk it out.
That one of us walking way.

1580
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:43,880
[inaudible]

1581
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,310
when you reteach agist turns one in.

1582
01:33:47,311 --> 01:33:51,620
That spreads out the coffin.
Girly. You was so fan.

1583
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,990
Huge was brand new.

1584
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,600
World did see with some other woman,

1585
01:33:57,601 --> 01:34:01,500
but I was thinking you knew how it hurts.

1586
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:05,160
Knew Howard knew how at Aes,

1587
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:09,090
because the hog never heals,
was so busy screaming.

1588
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:11,910
Don't hear the words that we say.

1589
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,560
[inaudible]

1590
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,490
we've taken our lumps,
which took a few blow.

1591
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:23,490
We hit a few bombs had off fair share,
Chad,

1592
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,080
to see through all of the bag,

1593
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,840
but on us smells and rich hair.

1594
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:32,050
We're not saying you got a bit south.

1595
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:35,920
Gotta be strong.
Gotta be right.

1596
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,870
Can't afford to be wrong.

1597
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:42,800
It's hard to shake the
blues when you [inaudible]

1598
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:49,350
worry too much for one cup of the bear.

1599
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,220
Conga so much for one person to care.

1600
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:58,730
We're fooling our families with food now.
Read pain.

1601
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:03,060
Frustration is hope is a chance.

1602
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,670
Who was a journey full drug,

1603
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:10,700
maybe hopes of vaccine
in a race against time.

1604
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:13,730
I can get down on my knees and pray.

1605
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:19,520
Shouted the devil, Matt, Kirsten,

1606
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:24,550
low Rambus them everything I can afford
at sell off mass sold that land to see

1607
01:35:28,650 --> 01:35:32,990
Chad to be righteous.
Tragically very of it.

1608
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,890
You can't call them my outlook.

1609
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,510
I stare with those
beautiful all of my problem.

1610
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,340
Who's seen Milton way?

1611
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:47,120
[inaudible]

1612
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:51,080
the smile on her face,
daddy ever thing is

1613
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,580
[inaudible]

1614
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:59,800
police against him. I get
down home man. And uh,

1615
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:00,813
very

1616
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,670
awesome.
Wow Brian.

1617
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,390
Thank you. Does beautiful man. How did,

1618
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,860
how did you change from being
essentially like a rap guy?

1619
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,380
You know when you came
out with a house of pain,

1620
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:27,630
you were like a rapper and then you
became like this blues dude along the way.

1621
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,270
You know, I think you fucked
a lot of people's heads up,

1622
01:36:30,271 --> 01:36:31,980
but that Whitey Ford Shit,
you know,

1623
01:36:31,981 --> 01:36:34,890
like a lot of people didn't see that
coming when you came out with what it's

1624
01:36:34,891 --> 01:36:37,110
like a lot of people were like,
whoa.

1625
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,040
Um, a lot of it had to
do with, uh, you know,

1626
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,890
a good friend just encouraging
me once he heard me doing it,

1627
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:45,080
like I used to always
play guitar and stuff on,

1628
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:50,150
just kind of on the low and the right
little ditties and I was recording.

1629
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:55,870
I live house of pain and was according
with the homeboy and mine and he was home

1630
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,590
produced a record. This guy, Dante Ross,

1631
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:02,591
and he heard me strumming out what
actually became what it's like just in his

1632
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:06,480
living room. I was playing a guitar and
he was like, what is that? And I, and,

1633
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:07,280
and he was like,

1634
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,190
we're going to record it and not
trusted him enough to believe it. Okay,

1635
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:15,170
let's go for it. Wow. And did you feel
like you were pigeonholed as a rapper?

1636
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:19,280
That people wouldn't accept it or we, we
think of, well, am I remember the label,

1637
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:23,010
the label, Dan, they hated it. They
were, they didn't, they didn't,

1638
01:37:23,011 --> 01:37:26,030
but they thought I was really
fucking up. Really? Yeah.

1639
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:31,040
They thought they thought it was really
doing the wrong thing, but you know, God,

1640
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:35,180
they thought that thank God that I love
when people run like that. I love it.

1641
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:39,230
So it's noetic and then I've just
fallen in love with writing songs.

1642
01:37:39,231 --> 01:37:39,591
You know what I mean?

1643
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:43,460
I think all the time I've spent
as an MC and writing lyrics as a,

1644
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:46,760
as a rapper has helped me learn
how to craft words in a way that,

1645
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:50,960
you know, the song writing
is that much better for it.

1646
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,840
That's true because a lot of rappers,
you know,

1647
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:57,840
that's one things that rappers don't get
enough credit for is the complexity of

1648
01:37:57,841 --> 01:38:01,740
their versus and compared to a lot of
shit that you hear from just singers and

1649
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:03,780
songwriters can tire song.

1650
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:08,280
I just did a rapper might use that
many words in a one verse. Yeah,

1651
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:10,050
we know what I mean. He
can't, not always. Well,

1652
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:14,100
but what I'm saying is you have to learn
s through to use the words and use a

1653
01:38:14,101 --> 01:38:17,910
lot of them. And some not always
well but like look at Nas, you know?

1654
01:38:17,911 --> 01:38:18,690
But you know like,

1655
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:23,690
and when you can be even more selective
about how many words it becomes easier

1656
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:25,620
and no sore in a sense like,
oh,

1657
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:30,330
I can choose less words and say more
because I'm singing and I'm playing this

1658
01:38:30,331 --> 01:38:32,520
tune with it, you know? Yeah. That's a,

1659
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:35,670
that's an interesting place to come from
if you really think about it that way

1660
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:40,290
because yeah, there's so many more words
in a rap song. Like I said, like I said,

1661
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:43,410
especially not in us like a soldier
boy song. Do you consider that rap?

1662
01:38:43,411 --> 01:38:45,150
What is soldier boy so like,
you know,

1663
01:38:45,151 --> 01:38:47,540
and the things I'm familiar
with my hammer are,

1664
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:52,310
are just kinda like chance
more than anything. Yeah.

1665
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,080
It's funny how this shit goes, you know,
like that gets stuck in the rap genre.

1666
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,520
But I mean little John made a career
doing that. He wasn't a rat rapper,

1667
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,520
like come up with good
catch little phrases.

1668
01:39:02,521 --> 01:39:03,990
And have like eight of 'em on a song,

1669
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:07,560
you know and know and people scream out
when they're drunk and a club mother,

1670
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:12,290
fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah,

1671
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:15,150
we'll host song like that.
You know what I mean? Hey,

1672
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:18,390
if you want on soldier boy with, there's
cats that have been doing it before him,

1673
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:21,780
you know? Right. So what did the label
should money. Anybody gets money.

1674
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:26,340
Good for you. Good money,
good money. What did a,

1675
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:29,970
would the labels say?
They couldn't say much?

1676
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:33,000
I was luckily have kind of a big fish
on a small label. You know what I mean?

1677
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:35,730
Anybody pull you aside and go,
you're fucking up kid. No, I didn't.

1678
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,870
They didn't do wound me aside.

1679
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:40,540
He told me blatantly what they
thought the words would they chose.

1680
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:43,920
We don't think we think you need to
choose whether you're a rapper or a singer

1681
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:47,250
or it's two different projects.
They didn't think it was one project.

1682
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:49,370
That's hilarious because
I was doing this like,

1683
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,590
like what had happened was I
went to New York and was doing I,

1684
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:56,280
I quit house of pain basically in
thought I was over. I was just like,

1685
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:59,970
music's over now. What do I mean? I mean
really come on. What am I going to do now?

1686
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:03,690
I just was kind of down and
my buddy called me and said
screw everything to hell

1687
01:40:03,691 --> 01:40:07,110
with labels and what not.
Come to New York and make some music.

1688
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:09,560
And I went out there strictly
to make a hip hop records.

1689
01:40:09,561 --> 01:40:11,040
So I made all these hip hop so every,

1690
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:14,760
all the hip hop songs on that
Whitey force record. We're done.

1691
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:19,230
First they were done and then the other
stuff started happening and we were just

1692
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:23,900
like, just between me and Jonathan,
we kind of were like disco work.

1693
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:27,390
If we piece it together. Right.
It makes kind of sense, you know,

1694
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:32,310
and just made sense to us.
Yeah, I remember I heard why
it's lagging. I went, Whoa,

1695
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,900
I get this mother fucker.
You uh,

1696
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:40,470
took a crazy chance. God, it
was the best shit you did.

1697
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:43,350
Even though my huge house of Payne Fan,
I love that.

1698
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:47,010
But I like your singing better man.
I mean jump around at all time.

1699
01:40:47,011 --> 01:40:50,640
Classic period. Always will be
there. Louie Louie of the 90s.

1700
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,160
When Marcus Davis used to fight in
the UFC. One of the things I loved,

1701
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:56,570
you'd come out to chomp around
with a fucking killed on. Yeah.

1702
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:59,590
Some other dudes need
to come out to that man.

1703
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:04,000
I'd say that's a hype up fight music.
We need some more Irish fighters.

1704
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:11,260
I remember the one that you teamed up
with Santana, I it or what's it called?

1705
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:14,750
Put, put your lights on. Yeah. That was
one of my favorite James back in the day.

1706
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:19,310
And that's what really made me
go, fuck. Yeah. He, you're legit.

1707
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,000
That was, that was a good hookup. How'd
you, I mean, did you, how did you meet?

1708
01:41:23,001 --> 01:41:24,450
How did that ever come across?
It's

1709
01:41:24,450 --> 01:41:25,950
kind of crazy cause uh,

1710
01:41:26,430 --> 01:41:29,430
basically what happened is I recorded
that whole Whitey Ford record than this

1711
01:41:29,431 --> 01:41:32,220
heart thing happened.
And I wound up getting surgery,

1712
01:41:32,221 --> 01:41:36,180
like emergency surgery and
woke up from it. And um,

1713
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:38,820
found out that I,
you know,

1714
01:41:38,821 --> 01:41:42,360
I had canceled my medical insurance
because I have my accountant at the time.

1715
01:41:42,361 --> 01:41:44,940
It ripped me off for like
couple hundred grand in taxes.

1716
01:41:44,941 --> 01:41:48,510
And so like I woke up from heart surgery,
like what my house,

1717
01:41:48,511 --> 01:41:53,190
like basically on the blocks and the
government calling me for money and I was

1718
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:54,024
in my house,

1719
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:59,030
it was in Laurel Canyon
in a Mount Olympus and uh,

1720
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:00,031
it was on the hill.

1721
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:04,500
You could see the whole city and the
house was empty except for me in a chair

1722
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,030
and I was moving into a little apartment
like it was, it was, it was good,

1723
01:42:09,031 --> 01:42:12,300
humble tack. But I was spending
the last night in this house,

1724
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:16,680
like looking out as the sun was going
down and I had a guitar and I started

1725
01:42:16,681 --> 01:42:20,310
writing the song and all,
that's what that's saying is that hey,

1726
01:42:20,311 --> 01:42:22,110
now all you sinners,
the lights were going,

1727
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,990
the sun was going down on the city and
all the lights of the city were coming on

1728
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:30,300
and it was like, Hey, now you soon as,
what's your lights on? The craziest thing.

1729
01:42:30,301 --> 01:42:32,550
As I just told his story at
one of these acoustic things,

1730
01:42:32,551 --> 01:42:33,384
it's something to kind of,

1731
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,470
I realized recently that I
never really talk about much,

1732
01:42:37,471 --> 01:42:40,620
but like when I was in the
hospital after this surgery,

1733
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:45,650
like I think hospitals kill
more people than anything. Um,

1734
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,190
from my experience as much as the surgeon
saved my life in his tent and all that,

1735
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,540
the hospital damn near killed me.
What do you mean they didn't,

1736
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:57,180
you don't rest in a hospital. They tell
you get rest, you know this, but every,

1737
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,180
every other minute somebody coming in
and sticking a needle in you and it's

1738
01:43:00,181 --> 01:43:04,660
never with it's, and even in
a great hospital, you know,

1739
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,980
I was in a great hospital is probably
one of the best hospitals in the world.

1740
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:12,450
It's still like, it's not nurses
that do these things anymore.

1741
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:17,350
There's like sub sub sub nurses,
nurses,

1742
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,970
that's all they do is come and take
blood from everybody who goes around with

1743
01:43:20,971 --> 01:43:22,060
his tray everyday.
And,

1744
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:25,320
but every minute you're always getting
poked and prodded and they're doing

1745
01:43:25,321 --> 01:43:27,000
something to you in that
telling you what it is.

1746
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:30,990
And like I didn't even get explained
about the thing ticking in my chest until

1747
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:33,350
like two days after I woke up.
Like I'm just,

1748
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:35,480
I was going nuts from hearing the sound.
I thought,

1749
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,400
I think I told this story last
time about a telltale heart.

1750
01:43:38,401 --> 01:43:42,720
I was like going nuts. So, but basically
there's, you hear that all day,

1751
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,810
all day. It's like white noise to me
now. But yeah, I could take my pulse.

1752
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:47,340
Just put that shit up to the mic again.

1753
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:51,130
People who haven't heard this
need to hear this. That's

1754
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,430
it's so crazy. Wow. That's,
that's some real shit.

1755
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:06,660
So one of the nights like I was only,
I only stayed there like six days.

1756
01:44:06,661 --> 01:44:08,190
I was supposed to be there
like couple of weeks,

1757
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,040
but like they let me go home
cause I was gonna I was losing it.

1758
01:44:11,041 --> 01:44:13,150
I was going to die. Nobody will
let you sleep. It wouldn't,

1759
01:44:13,151 --> 01:44:15,390
they just wouldn't let me rest and
I was losing, I thought I just,

1760
01:44:15,391 --> 01:44:18,510
I was convinced I was going to die
in the hospital basically. Wow.

1761
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:21,360
But the night before they let me go.
I was losing it.

1762
01:44:21,361 --> 01:44:25,230
I mean like that kind of tears where
they're just coming out of your eyes and a

1763
01:44:25,231 --> 01:44:29,490
woman came in this nurse and like was
the first person actually just such me

1764
01:44:29,491 --> 01:44:32,790
with some just humanity and care and be
like, oh, it's all right. It's all right.

1765
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:36,360
It's all right. And so I was in, it
sued me enough that I fell asleep,

1766
01:44:36,361 --> 01:44:39,390
woke up the next day. I was able to get
out of the hospital. I got home. Wow.

1767
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:42,300
Couple of weeks later when I was feeling
that's what I wasn't. I was like,

1768
01:44:42,301 --> 01:44:45,210
I want to go back and think
this nurse, you know what I
mean? Let's, you know what?

1769
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:45,870
I made my,

1770
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:49,240
my people take me to the hospital because
I was still like walking around freely.

1771
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,150
Can I ask something?
Can I get something?

1772
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,340
This person she didn't exist didn't exist.

1773
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:57,570
Do you, he know that you
are the guy, the angel.

1774
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:01,160
I knew by the way you said it the way
you said it was setting up a ghost story.

1775
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:04,030
Well, I mean it's about
the song. There's an age,

1776
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:05,980
there's a monster lives
sitting under my bed.

1777
01:45:05,981 --> 01:45:10,510
That was the noise of me
of me. Um, what is this?

1778
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:15,520
This is what he's talking.
That was the noise, uh, of,
of the, of the heart of death.

1779
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,150
And then the angel with her
hand on my head was the woman.

1780
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:24,360
Yes.
This is a great fucking song.

1781
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,713
Try that shit up.

1782
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:37,240
[inaudible]

1783
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,960
just say I got nothing
to be a [inaudible].

1784
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:58,530
Still got a purpose to serve.

1785
01:45:59,530 --> 01:46:04,530
[inaudible]

1786
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:11,000
damn. My hair was black. Yeah. Isn't
that crazy? When you see a white man,

1787
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:16,140
it's weird seeing yourself agent that did.

1788
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:20,810
That is a crazy look white now.

1789
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:22,550
Wow.
That's crazy.

1790
01:46:25,910 --> 01:46:27,530
It's nuts.
Seen that song.

1791
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:32,330
Yeah. I constantly have to dye my hair
and my, that's what my kitchen looks like.

1792
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:35,330
Fucking like where you splatter a
little bit on your toilet or on your,

1793
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:38,660
on your wall and sit down. At least it
looks like there's blood everywhere.

1794
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:42,720
And My, my path, I just got to own it,
man. I can't, I can't just, yes. For

1795
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:46,220
mania, man. That's it. I mean, what am I
gonna do with the beard man? It's right.

1796
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:49,470
Yeah. A lot of life. If he likes
it anyway, to me and wife, he it.

1797
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:54,100
A lot of guys get in there with a brush
and do the whole beard. Ah, I'm go, oh my,

1798
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:58,290
Oh, I earned every one of
these man. Indeed. Indeed.

1799
01:46:58,291 --> 01:47:01,920
And I know I'm 42 this is like,
remember I've had heart surgeries.

1800
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:06,360
I've live eight life so far.
Man. I'm good hearing that song.

1801
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:09,300
Knowing that story, it makes it
so much different. It's amazing.

1802
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:13,110
It's amazing how much it fires you
up, dude. You were at that. That's,

1803
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:17,280
that is the root of all fucking brilliance
and creativity is a man with his back

1804
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:21,590
pushed against the wall or just fires
back. That's the best shit. That's the,

1805
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:25,260
that was rough time. That God song is
just one of your best songs ever. I mean,

1806
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:27,750
you've got a lot of great fucking
songs, but that's one of, that's a,

1807
01:47:27,751 --> 01:47:30,540
that's an all timer,
bro. That's an all timer.

1808
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:33,030
And when you think about
where it came from, you know,

1809
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:38,290
do you ever work with Santana anymore?
I, I haven't heard from him, you know,

1810
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:43,070
quite a while. But how Tom is your
old label feel TM, right? Fuck no,

1811
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:46,200
they're not in business anymore.
That's so whoever the asshole was,

1812
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:48,780
it actually said to you as a bad
idea when that song came out,

1813
01:47:48,781 --> 01:47:53,010
boy did that do feel stupid. That
record sold a lot of records, man.

1814
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,930
Is that guy still in the music business?

1815
01:47:54,931 --> 01:47:57,270
That fucking dummy that
gave you shitty advice.

1816
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,310
It's always amazing when
someone who's not up.

1817
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:06,760
He's on some like real Deepak Chopra type
shit now. Oh, he's like turned in one.

1818
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,830
He made, I mean I made him good $40
million, man. So whoa. You know,

1819
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,030
it's a lot of money.
You know,

1820
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:18,200
saw the guy 4 million records and that's
not counting the house of pain records.

1821
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:23,010
That's another car. Three or 4 million
records. That's a lot of records.

1822
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,240
Yeah, that's pretty good. Some people
who sold them out more, but I ain't mad.

1823
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:30,330
I ain't sneeze and that you
don't want to be number one man.

1824
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:35,520
He just want to be able to buy those
Audis and just chill. I like my life.

1825
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:39,330
Like I've always told people I like that
the music is more famous than my face,

1826
01:48:39,331 --> 01:48:43,020
man. I really do. Fuck yeah, that's
what I say about Steve. What's his name?

1827
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:47,040
Cause I'm going to the olive bar like
right at the Ralph's down the street after

1828
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:50,640
this and get me some olives and some
crackers and like nobody will bother me.

1829
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:53,730
Yeah, you could sneak Steve Miller.
Nobody knows who Steve Miller looks like.

1830
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,790
Not a person alive that knows a
Steve Miller. Looks like they've got,

1831
01:48:56,791 --> 01:49:00,300
could be anywhere. Yeah. He, Mick
Jagger can't go anywhere. You know,

1832
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:03,750
not that Steve Miller had ever reached
the status of the rolling stones,

1833
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:07,470
but pretty God damn successful.
You know, he ain't man,

1834
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:09,143
I ain't mad.

1835
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,280
Really hang out at the bar in her.
I don't hang out and not olive garden.

1836
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:17,990
The olive bar at Ralph's like that where
you have all of exotic olives. Okay.

1837
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:21,480
Get all, I'd like, I'll
heard olive garden. You just
heard all and like I said,

1838
01:49:21,481 --> 01:49:23,880
all the bar,
there's that all of uh,

1839
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:28,620
there's all of bar also like, or like
just a place that's an olive bar. Yeah,

1840
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,790
it's called the all time actually,
but I always call it the olive bar.

1841
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:34,310
Oh,

1842
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:39,180
it's a restaurant bar that's in Toluca
Lake is all into olives and stuff like

1843
01:49:39,181 --> 01:49:42,120
that. It's got everything. It's like
a little whole foods mixed with a bar.

1844
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,900
I'd have to go check that. A whole foods
in a bar together at the restaurant,

1845
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:48,010
like that kind of food.
You know that good please to pick

1846
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,240
up vegan chicks.
Oh,

1847
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:52,960
that's where all the actresses hang out
and just sit there and eat healthy and

1848
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:57,580
I'm in a de Bouley. What's up? I'm in the
olives man. They're like, oh dude. Yeah.

1849
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:01,390
What's that about? I don't know if I
can tell you about that. Tastes good.

1850
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:04,680
I do look on, all of us are disgusting
and it's funny that the WWE,

1851
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:07,870
I love the album, but I hate olives.
Why do you hate olives? They're gross.

1852
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:12,100
Have boils. Fantastic for you.
Did you always like olives?
Did you guys always up?

1853
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:14,380
I think that's one of those things
that come later in your life where you

1854
01:50:14,381 --> 01:50:15,214
started liking?

1855
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,730
No, no. I might dare. I liked him when
I was young. I think I just, you know,

1856
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:22,030
I like a lot of weird shit though.
I like starts thirties loves,

1857
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:26,950
I don't like sardines. I like anchovies.
Nah, no, I like them like you know,

1858
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,160
crushed into like flavors I couldn't eat.
Just the anchovy don't like,

1859
01:50:30,161 --> 01:50:33,550
I'm not opposed to some of those things
used as ingredients and other things.

1860
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:36,130
I'll eat a half a pound of
anchovies in a setting. Wow.

1861
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,550
Will you put it on like a big hunk of
bread and make a sandwich out of the war?

1862
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:43,560
She had doctor's orders to stop
faces and eyes and all I need. Uh,

1863
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:47,860
they told me to stop beating sardines
cause I had arsenic poison. Wow.

1864
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,130
Cause I was eating so many sardines.
Sardines are just dirty juice.

1865
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:55,210
Apple juice and grape juice. Yam. I
was like, I was talking to my wife,

1866
01:50:55,211 --> 01:50:57,370
why don't we ever give her apple juice?
And it's like,

1867
01:50:57,371 --> 01:51:00,820
cause there's arsenic in it and she
googled it up and show me grape juice and

1868
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:05,420
apple juice. Wow. You know the,
the metals, the heavy metals is,

1869
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:08,950
it's pollution. That's how the, uh,
that's how the sardines absorbed.

1870
01:51:08,951 --> 01:51:13,480
That's where the flavor comes
from. Now, pollution. Yeah.

1871
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:15,130
If you think about what lobsters are,
man,

1872
01:51:15,131 --> 01:51:17,710
lobsters are the dirtiest
bottom feeders of all time.

1873
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:21,310
They taste delicious
shrimp too. Yeah, exactly.

1874
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:24,040
Do you know what they used
to be like in New York?

1875
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:26,860
Lobsters were like poor people food.

1876
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:29,620
It's like there were so common they
used to like get them out of the Hudson

1877
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:32,470
river like way back in the day
and they would serve him at bars.

1878
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,200
That's like they would, the big thing
that people would serve peanuts.

1879
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:38,320
What would it be like? Normal bar
food. Like instead of a burger,

1880
01:51:38,321 --> 01:51:40,120
you get a lobster.
It was like poor people food.

1881
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:43,030
Easy to cook the throat and boiling water.
People crack it open and

1882
01:51:43,310 --> 01:51:44,780
well, fuck. Look at wood floors.

1883
01:51:44,781 --> 01:51:48,470
That used to be for poor people yet
carpet if you had money, you know,

1884
01:51:48,471 --> 01:51:52,370
and now I'm ripping out carpet and
sing this wood floor that did that.

1885
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:55,670
That just has glue and fucking
hammers and staples in it.

1886
01:51:55,671 --> 01:51:58,400
They don't give a shit because back then
they were like costing. What's that?

1887
01:51:58,401 --> 01:52:03,140
Carpet is nasty. Nasty. It's like never
changed her fucking clothes. One of the

1888
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,280
things about like,
you know,

1889
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,100
I live in with this cystic fibrosis
thing as we ought to be very,

1890
01:52:07,101 --> 01:52:09,550
she can't get a cold.
I got a two and a half year old daughter.

1891
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:12,470
Never had a sniffle.
Like a thing about that you have kids,

1892
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:16,520
do you have them monitor their
diet like oh well you have to,

1893
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:18,890
I mean actually no, no, no. With that,

1894
01:52:18,891 --> 01:52:23,000
with cystic fibrosis it's a constant
struggle to keep weight on them.

1895
01:52:23,001 --> 01:52:27,530
So you're fasting, you're putting, you're
loading up fats and and stuff like that.

1896
01:52:27,531 --> 01:52:29,990
Yeah, it's, it's absolutely
new. Our daughter who is like,

1897
01:52:29,991 --> 01:52:33,260
actually that's her only thing she
struggling with is a little bit of weight

1898
01:52:33,261 --> 01:52:35,090
we're trying to get,
you know.

1899
01:52:35,091 --> 01:52:40,010
But she's like that stage where she just
so ran two and a half ran buses and her

1900
01:52:40,011 --> 01:52:42,410
appetite just isn't huge. And
it's like we have, you know,

1901
01:52:42,411 --> 01:52:44,990
it's a constant battle to try and get,
get the weight on her.

1902
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,050
You have specific high caloric
foods that you use server.

1903
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,670
We just load a lot of things up with
extra butters and olive oils and you know,

1904
01:52:52,671 --> 01:52:54,320
and my wife is constantly,

1905
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:57,200
we have two different things like
what we eat and watch what she eats.

1906
01:52:57,201 --> 01:52:58,034
You know what I mean?

1907
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:01,730
Like she gets the full fat of everything
with the highest calories and we try

1908
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:03,970
and eat more of a, you know,
lower fat kind of, you know,

1909
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:08,370
server like Colby beef and stuff along
those lines. Well she started at what?

1910
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,120
Right for a while she would
only eat like two things, man,

1911
01:53:11,121 --> 01:53:14,870
macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets
and now she's starting to develop

1912
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:16,490
actually tastes for other things.

1913
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:20,480
I could stitch like a brilliant day
when we can get her to eat a burrito and

1914
01:53:20,481 --> 01:53:22,310
she'd like likes it and like,
you know,

1915
01:53:22,311 --> 01:53:26,060
get these new things because she's
starting to get more interested in food

1916
01:53:26,061 --> 01:53:28,220
hopefully. And what are the
treatments? What are they,

1917
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:31,490
what do they do for right now our does,
she's doing very well.

1918
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:33,020
She has no mucus in her lungs.

1919
01:53:33,021 --> 01:53:37,760
Her lungs are functioning at
99.9 plus, you know, percentage,

1920
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:41,990
which is awesome. But she's
still, we put her on a, in a vast,

1921
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:44,750
that's hooks to a compressor
that basically just

1922
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,740
kind of violently shakes her,
you know,

1923
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:53,210
and basically what the premise of that
is when the music mucus does form in

1924
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:54,890
these people's lungs,

1925
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:59,630
it shakes it loose so they can
expectorated a lot easier. And um,

1926
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:03,470
so besides that she did little albuterol
like, you know, Kinda like, you know,

1927
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,870
same as kind of asthma
right now just for us,

1928
01:54:05,871 --> 01:54:09,470
it's all preventative at the moment. You
know, our biggest struggle, like I said,

1929
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:12,060
is, is just keeping weight on her. Wow.

1930
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:14,990
Just getting her to gain and
gang because she's, you know,

1931
01:54:14,991 --> 01:54:16,220
she's very tall for her age,

1932
01:54:16,221 --> 01:54:19,090
but she's very thin and she
needs to be heavier because it,

1933
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:22,820
it'll help the lung development developed
that much healthier. You know, Brian,

1934
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:26,900
your friend Mc Chris also was
involved in helping. Yeah, I've been,

1935
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,600
I've been getting a lot of messages
about me and this dude should link up

1936
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:31,520
somehow. Great. He's a great guy.

1937
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:33,980
And Brian just did a podcast
with him and tell me,

1938
01:54:33,981 --> 01:54:36,850
what did he say Brian About cystic
fibrosis? I know that he's a,

1939
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:41,460
well, he's calm. He's been, he's,
he's amazing. He's, I, I think it's,

1940
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:45,250
I believe it's his niece
is, uh, has it. And so far,

1941
01:54:45,251 --> 01:54:47,090
the longest time he's been
doing these, uh, you know,

1942
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:51,340
shows and he's been doing ebay auctions
and stuff in and be good always website

1943
01:54:51,341 --> 01:54:55,810
also. He has ways that you
can help, uh, help the cause.

1944
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,900
And I asked him the other day how much
he's raising. He's, I mean, he's just,

1945
01:54:58,901 --> 01:55:02,140
you know, a white rapper,
nerd rapper, and he's almost,

1946
01:55:02,141 --> 01:55:05,210
I think he said almost
$100,000. He said, yeah,

1947
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:08,500
I listened to that part of your podcast.
And there was,

1948
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:10,960
what was the name of that podcast
on, what do you call it? A,

1949
01:55:10,961 --> 01:55:13,360
we haven't made a name of it,
we're thinking muff said,

1950
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:18,280
or if it's going to be released on
death squad in the next couple of days.

1951
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:21,170
So you haven't even named it yet.
Now we're asking in the,

1952
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:23,620
in the actual episode what we should
name it. And there's like, you know,

1953
01:55:23,621 --> 01:55:27,100
a lot of weird things, but what it
is, it's a comic books. Uh, with me,

1954
01:55:27,101 --> 01:55:28,810
Ryan Kelly talking with comic books.

1955
01:55:28,811 --> 01:55:32,080
We had a guy that worked at marvel
and Ryan steely is a porn star. Yeah.

1956
01:55:32,081 --> 01:55:34,180
Penthouse pet. Did you know there's
lot other, the artists we had,

1957
01:55:34,181 --> 01:55:37,360
he works on both marvel
and DC at the same time.

1958
01:55:37,361 --> 01:55:40,540
And he does like Conan and Batman.
That's awesome. And stuff like that.

1959
01:55:40,541 --> 01:55:43,560
He's bad ass, but we're going to,
what's his name? Uh, Shit you call me.

1960
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:48,540
I've got Dan. Uh, but he, he does this
thing called drink a drink and draw,

1961
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:51,510
which is a new thing that
blue with a draw something,

1962
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:54,000
it's a really popular
app that's on the iPhone,

1963
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:57,540
but he has been doing it at bars where
you just go and you just hang out with a

1964
01:55:57,541 --> 01:56:00,870
bunch of people and you all just
get drunk and draw at the same time.

1965
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,730
And now they have it.
Citywide were like,

1966
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:06,090
these guys like meet up and like these
artists and they just sit there and meet

1967
01:56:06,091 --> 01:56:10,920
each other and then they hang out and
started drawing shit on an iPhone. Oh No,

1968
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,900
no, no, no phones. Just an APP to
get them together. No, no, but,

1969
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,950
but with the popularity of that and
it's something that he's been doing,

1970
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:20,100
what I was saying is that there's a
popular app right now that you're pretty

1971
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:23,610
much playing, win, lose, or draw with
each other and that's so big right now.

1972
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:27,570
But he's been doing it. Yeah,
it was that pretty late.

1973
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:29,581
It's so buggy.

1974
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:34,140
It doesn't seem like they're finished
with [inaudible] words on there. Yeah,

1975
01:56:34,141 --> 01:56:37,370
I know. It's like eight words.
I'm confused. All right. He,

1976
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:40,890
he's working on something where they get
together and they draw. Yeah, like, like,

1977
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,240
like stuff. There's a lot of, yeah,

1978
01:56:42,241 --> 01:56:46,470
there's a lot of cities that are doing
this where you go to like these bars and

1979
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:49,410
just hang. His name is Dan.
He's urban barbarian at Twitter.

1980
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,560
It's called drinker draw and it's just
cool. He does hang out and get drunk and,

1981
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:55,650
and meet people and you draw and sometimes
you have like a little missions and

1982
01:56:55,651 --> 01:56:57,300
stuff. I'm not really sure how
it works. I haven't done it yet.

1983
01:56:57,330 --> 01:57:00,210
So everybody goes to a bar and
they just bring paper. Yeah,

1984
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:01,140
they just start drawing.
Yeah.

1985
01:57:01,141 --> 01:57:03,780
And they start drawing and it's really
cool if you go to his Twitter page,

1986
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:06,630
he has a bunch of shit, but
here, let me show you something.

1987
01:57:06,631 --> 01:57:10,370
He's done like a Batman drawing that he's
done that it's going to blow your mind

1988
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:14,610
and like how good it sounds like it
would be hard to find so many people that

1989
01:57:14,611 --> 01:57:17,040
are really into drawing,
get together at a bro.

1990
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:21,480
It's that many people that good
at it. Yeah. Drawing is hard.

1991
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:24,550
It's gotten so big that it's
actually, you know, it's, it's,

1992
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:26,340
it's in multiple cities now.

1993
01:57:26,341 --> 01:57:30,180
It's actually catching on pretty big
and with a slight cartooning karaoke or

1994
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:33,840
something. Exactly. That's funny.
That's a really good way of putting it.

1995
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:36,270
Here's this website. Check out this
drawing he just did the other day.

1996
01:57:36,271 --> 01:57:39,750
I drink her draw. I've of the
dark night, you know? Yeah.

1997
01:57:39,751 --> 01:57:43,170
That's some shit I did when I was 15 it's
crazy too. They're kind of shit. Yeah.

1998
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:47,130
Imagine doing that, getting drunk. Well,
you're obviously not going to do it,

1999
01:57:47,230 --> 01:57:51,460
but I would do it. I still draw, dude.
I just draw a lot. That's pretty good.

2000
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:55,390
He's very good obviously. Yeah, but no,
I mean if I was into comic book art,

2001
01:57:55,391 --> 01:57:58,000
if I was like really into drawing,
it'd be a fun fucking thing to do.

2002
01:57:58,001 --> 01:58:02,170
I'm sure you know a lot of people find
going out and hanging out with people.

2003
01:58:02,230 --> 01:58:05,680
That's pretty cool. A lot of people
find going out and going to bars,

2004
01:58:05,681 --> 01:58:07,600
like oftentimes it's
pretty fucking boring.

2005
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:11,370
And this guy is a huge fan of
the Joe Rogan Rogan podcast.

2006
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:15,460
He was at a big fan. He was so happy to
be here at the studio. Oh, that's cool.

2007
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:19,260
He's a big MMA fan,
but we had him and Mc Chris on the show.

2008
01:58:19,261 --> 01:58:22,590
It's going to be released next day or two
and it's a probably a called something

2009
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:25,860
like the warp zone or MF senators until
your boy. And He's good at me too.

2010
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:26,700
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2011
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:30,000
What is that a, what's that one image
that you were just showing the one down,

2012
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:32,340
right? Yeah, right there. You just
have the cursor. Yeah. What is that?

2013
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:35,840
Uh, this is, it looks like a c

2014
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:39,920
urban barbarian. He's got to look
like a liquor bottle. It says.

2015
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:43,600
Yeah, that's his Twitter name.
He just tagged it. But he does,

2016
01:58:43,601 --> 01:58:46,620
if you go to his website, oh,
here's one. He did a madmen. Uh,

2017
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:48,490
he's done a lot of video game covers.

2018
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:53,491
He's also done like a lot of different
random things also like movie posters and

2019
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:58,490
Shit. Just talented as fuck. Yeah. I used
to love comic books room, but I, I just,

2020
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:01,940
I've tried getting into him as an adult
and for whatever reason I just get,

2021
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:04,960
well I tell you the walking dead wants
pretty fucking good. That's what I hear.

2022
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:08,590
I just, I don't know. I can't get
myself to the store to buy it.

2023
01:59:08,591 --> 01:59:11,230
You know what I did though?
I did get an APP on, um,

2024
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:14,800
I wonder if I can get the walking dead on
my iPad. You care. That's how I read it.

2025
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:18,100
The, I got to, oh, by the way, I got
the new iPad. Me Now got the new,

2026
01:59:18,101 --> 01:59:21,190
I've had three over here.
What are you doing with that?

2027
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:24,370
You're fucking making loans on
their file because I wanted the, uh,

2028
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,780
the four g hotspot.
And what's crazy is,

2029
01:59:26,781 --> 01:59:31,781
is that I did a speed test on it and
it was actually faster than the $120

2030
01:59:34,331 --> 01:59:38,240
Internet that I have here at the
studio. Uh, the speech was quick,

2031
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:42,610
quicker on my iPad than it was Jose
talking charter business grades,

2032
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,890
uh, Internet. I don't lose your, your,
I got the Verizon, uh, iPad. Yeah,

2033
01:59:47,970 --> 01:59:51,610
the Verizon. So right now I'm on LTE
network is what it says on there.

2034
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:55,180
And I have a digital hot spot and
now I could have all my shit on that.

2035
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,830
Of course you're paying for the bandwidth.

2036
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:58,450
So they don't have like
unlimited bandwidth.

2037
01:59:58,990 --> 02:00:03,990
I have a card that it's a
Verizon on tour with the iPhone.

2038
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,490
Sometimes I would just
make my own little hotspot.

2039
02:00:07,690 --> 02:00:10,900
They kill you after a couple of days
of that, they start hollering messages.

2040
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:13,720
Oh yeah, you're going over. Right.

2041
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:17,050
It's amazing how little bandwidth you
can actually use. I've got a four g card,

2042
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:19,480
I put it in my laptop,
I downloaded one movie and they'll set,

2043
02:00:19,481 --> 02:00:23,140
I'd use 75% of my bandwidth for the month.
So they send you messages and stuff.

2044
02:00:23,310 --> 02:00:25,150
So, yeah, the secret is
just don't do videos,

2045
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:28,090
but if you do anything else but videos,
you should be fine. You know, like,

2046
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:29,250
like even youtube videos,

2047
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,330
just wait till you get home because
you're going to just kill it.

2048
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,130
I bet your upstream is not as
good though, right? Probably not.

2049
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:38,800
My upstream was faster than the charter
here. Really? It was only eight.

2050
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:41,590
I have a screenshot of it right now.
I could tweet, I'll tweet it later.

2051
02:00:41,590 --> 02:00:44,890
But it's incredible. Yeah. So
you really happy with that? Yeah.

2052
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:46,150
It was called the screen resolution.

2053
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:49,270
I didn't think I was just going to notice
a huge difference because this is the

2054
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:52,450
retina display and stuff like
that. Uh, it's totally noticeable,

2055
02:00:52,451 --> 02:00:55,570
but when I hold up both my iPad two
and the iPad three together, it's,

2056
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:57,210
it's night and day different.
So that,

2057
02:00:57,211 --> 02:01:01,030
that was bigger than I
thought it was a speed wise.

2058
02:01:01,031 --> 02:01:03,320
I don't really notice any
kind of speed difference. Uh,

2059
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,590
it's not overheating a lot of reports.

2060
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:08,560
I've been saying that the new iPads
overheating because it's got like so many

2061
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:11,740
dual processors in the retina
display and all this shit.

2062
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:14,770
But I haven't had any problems with it.
Right over your deck and go scrolling.

2063
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:19,070
Yeah. That's what happens, right. They get
hot. Yeah. Kill your sperm and you don't,

2064
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:19,690
you know,

2065
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:23,920
there's a big thing that lie to people
don't talk about is generic batteries

2066
02:01:23,921 --> 02:01:27,760
exploding. And I didn't know about
this until I went on Amazon in the,

2067
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:29,290
if he looks at some of the comments,

2068
02:01:29,291 --> 02:01:32,260
if you like buy a generic camera
for a cam quarter, you know,

2069
02:01:32,261 --> 02:01:33,570
instead of Saturday for battery,

2070
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:37,510
these cheaply made batteries
explode all the time.

2071
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:41,330
Somebody even like, like
commented me on at, uh,

2072
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:43,640
something I was talking
about in the past that I do,

2073
02:01:43,641 --> 02:01:45,920
don't buy the cheap version of this.
Look what happened to me.

2074
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:50,540
And he showed me his pictures of his bed
where he was in his bed with his laptop

2075
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:53,960
and he had a generic battery
in it and it blew up in his,

2076
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:57,920
in his bed and it's just blackness
all around his pillow. And I was like,

2077
02:01:57,921 --> 02:02:01,160
Holy Shit, that actually happened to you?
And he goes, yeah dude, don't buy the gin.

2078
02:02:01,190 --> 02:02:04,330
Don't buy that generic shit.
Yeah, they do blow up, man.

2079
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:07,210
You'll hear about batteries blowing up.
It was actually a case for your iPhone.

2080
02:02:07,211 --> 02:02:08,050
I'm sorry.
Now I laptop.

2081
02:02:08,051 --> 02:02:11,740
It was one of those battery extended
battery cases and I was going to buy the

2082
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:14,230
mophie one and then he's like,
eh, but then I was like, well,

2083
02:02:14,231 --> 02:02:17,900
I can save $50 by by this generic
wine. He's like, don't buy that shirt.

2084
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:21,040
I actually was rocking at morphing
one for awhile. I'm broke.

2085
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:24,380
I got to send it back. Did the
really? Yup. What happened? Stop war.

2086
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:27,880
Just stopped working and drop it a few
times. No, never dropped it or anything,

2087
02:02:27,881 --> 02:02:29,230
but if you look at the comments,

2088
02:02:29,260 --> 02:02:31,960
that's one of the biggest things
for those mofi cases. It's like, ah,

2089
02:02:31,961 --> 02:02:35,220
the thing breaks off where you have to
charge it or it stopped working so it's

2090
02:02:35,221 --> 02:02:38,490
not that durable. It's not that durable.
Have you seen that new phone? The,

2091
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:43,220
it's called the galaxy
note. It's 5.3 inches. Yeah.

2092
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:45,190
It's like this fucking bit.
It's enormous.

2093
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:48,190
It's like it's a cross between
like a tablet and a phone.

2094
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:50,200
They're coming out with another
iPhone, iPad. Supposedly.

2095
02:02:50,201 --> 02:02:52,360
That's going to be that like that.
Like a smaller version,

2096
02:02:52,361 --> 02:02:55,700
like a seven inch version. But
it's not a phone. No, no, no, no.

2097
02:02:55,730 --> 02:02:57,470
I got a phone with the high.
Yeah,

2098
02:02:57,530 --> 02:03:01,300
this has a stylist and you could write
on photos or you can write like I'm with

2099
02:03:01,301 --> 02:03:03,580
stupid and put an Arrow and then
put that shit up on Twitter.

2100
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:06,790
I mean it's the right on the photo.
You take a photo with it.

2101
02:03:06,820 --> 02:03:09,550
It's like an eight minute that on the IPAD
and I can do that on my iPhone. Right?

2102
02:03:09,551 --> 02:03:13,120
Yeah. You can write scribble on it,
man. I'm a killer on the iPhone dude.

2103
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:15,150
How do you write with, what do you
write with [inaudible]? You can use it.

2104
02:03:15,151 --> 02:03:18,640
A lot of different programs at the one
I use on the iPad for doing that exact

2105
02:03:18,641 --> 02:03:23,080
same thing is called pen. Uh, hold
on, let me look at, you use a stylist,

2106
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:26,570
these your finger. Uh, I have a
stylist but I never use it. I do.

2107
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:28,210
You do use your coke fingernail?

2108
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:32,110
It's called pen pencil to
meet or something like that.

2109
02:03:32,111 --> 02:03:35,160
And there's also one color box HD,
which is my new favorite drawing. Oh,

2110
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,160
so you can do the same thing.
It just won't happen.

2111
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:39,680
Just take a photo or take it from your
library, throw it on there tweeting.

2112
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:43,690
Some dude brought it to Louisville and
I swear for two whole seconds I really

2113
02:03:43,691 --> 02:03:47,740
thought I was on acid. The guy had this
camera and he was coming at me with this,

2114
02:03:47,741 --> 02:03:50,800
this phone out of my test on a
tablet and that's not a camera.

2115
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:55,090
That's not a phone. What the fuck is that
like? I really thought I was on acid.

2116
02:03:55,091 --> 02:03:58,450
The phone was so big. I was like,
this is beyond the looking glass.

2117
02:03:58,451 --> 02:04:00,520
I'm Alice in wonderland.
You know? I'm like,

2118
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:05,110
I'm like looking at a table that's the
size of the moon. I was looking at this.

2119
02:04:05,111 --> 02:04:05,950
They go like that.
Gabby.

2120
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:09,140
I think the IPAD or the iPhone
five when it gets announced,

2121
02:04:09,141 --> 02:04:11,150
probably in June or or so.

2122
02:04:11,151 --> 02:04:14,360
I think that's going to be something
similar to that where it's maybe not that

2123
02:04:14,361 --> 02:04:18,770
big, but I really think that it's probably
going to be from wall to wall screen.

2124
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:20,600
Maybe a teeny bit bigger and skinny.

2125
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:23,630
Maybe somebody had liked the size
of this the way it is. I mean,

2126
02:04:23,631 --> 02:04:27,120
not a lot of whole lot of people complain
except people that are really into

2127
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:30,780
media applications and you can always
get an android man. All right. That um,

2128
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:33,110
I'll tell you though,
that new a ice cream sandwich,

2129
02:04:33,111 --> 02:04:36,440
the new operating system on Android
is pretty fucking dope dude.

2130
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:38,120
It's pretty wild there.

2131
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:41,370
There's more people using androids
now than are even using iPhones.

2132
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:46,140
But I think the APP markets not as big in
the malware market is through the roof.

2133
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:51,310
Way more fake shit and malware and
viruses and the nonsense for androids.

2134
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:54,100
Everybody who opposed to
something on Instagram for her,

2135
02:04:54,101 --> 02:04:58,090
cause they apparently just let
android join Instagram. Right.

2136
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:01,980
He posted a picture, he's like,
here's for you android users.

2137
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:07,140
And it was a toilet with a bunch of gold.
That was pretty funny.

2138
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:09,210
A toilet with a bunch of gold fixtures.

2139
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:13,760
Here's a toilet with a bunch of gold
fixtures for all you and bite you.

2140
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:18,870
I don't get it. Android is a toilet with
a bunch of gold fixtures. Oh, I see.

2141
02:05:18,871 --> 02:05:21,210
What you're saying. I thought
it was funny as now, you know,

2142
02:05:21,211 --> 02:05:23,510
I'm I rock iPhone because
I liked the lenses.

2143
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:26,160
My Buddy and rented show show him this.
He was showing me this,

2144
02:05:26,910 --> 02:05:29,190
I'm going to freak the fuck out.
I need to get one of these.

2145
02:05:29,620 --> 02:05:34,620
A friend of mine's father apparently
invented this thing called Ipro lands is

2146
02:05:35,471 --> 02:05:39,750
this case starts with a case and
then has this like handle that.

2147
02:05:39,751 --> 02:05:43,260
You can kind of make until almost
a steady cam kind of thing. What?

2148
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:45,630
And you just screw on there.
But then there's a,

2149
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:51,150
a wide angle in a fish islands bill
into the handle to handle that is like

2150
02:05:51,470 --> 02:05:53,760
there's two of them. Take my word
for it. You just pull it off,

2151
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:57,990
you snap it on and now you got a crazy
fish islands and we were taking pictures

2152
02:05:57,991 --> 02:06:02,070
earlier, uh, with it and it's
perfect. Like the dirt, the
quality lens is actually,

2153
02:06:02,071 --> 02:06:06,620
I would say I always saw those,
but we really had one of those is his law,

2154
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:09,720
his buddy's dad. It's a,
both a mutual friend of ours,

2155
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:13,380
like basically the Lux model
with the handle and shit.

2156
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:17,280
[inaudible] have the handle. He probably
just doesn't use it. Like I, I'm, I'm,

2157
02:06:17,330 --> 02:06:20,760
I'm always on the camera and running
around doing stuff for Instagram and

2158
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:25,150
Instagram, which I love. I just signed up
today. Keeps me out of trouble man. Yeah,

2159
02:06:25,151 --> 02:06:27,840
just today, signed up doing
all kinds of edits. Oh Gee.

2160
02:06:27,841 --> 02:06:29,970
Everlast on both Twitter and Instagram.

2161
02:06:29,971 --> 02:06:33,870
Come Hollering Joe Rogan experience
on Instagram as a, to this a question.

2162
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:37,280
I'll be your picture. By the way, the
first photo I ever uploaded on Intagram,

2163
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:40,020
the one I took today. Oh, is
that right? In this studio?

2164
02:06:40,021 --> 02:06:43,860
Goddamn history was where you need to
attach my name to that told you you ever

2165
02:06:43,861 --> 02:06:46,470
lie. I don't know how to use
Instagram yet. I'm in the comments.

2166
02:06:46,471 --> 02:06:48,860
Just put at Ogm or now I'm a newb.

2167

You're the best man having you

2236
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:13,430
Do you want to be roommates?

2237
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:20,060

know, got, got to do the bromance,

2238

Don't put the wings on to,

2239
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:26,480
we could totally do this way more
often. People love you. Aww, I love you.

2240
02:13:26,481 --> 02:13:30,260
I'm so happy. You know, mandate. A lot
of love came through the podcast man and,

2241
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:32,220
and you know,
if you got an extra buck,

2242
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,480
if you don't, it's all good.
You got to ask you again. Um,

2243
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,540
I don't know the link off hand,
but uh,

2244
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:41,280
just hope that y'all will tweet
it out again. It's the cff.org.

2245
02:13:41,281 --> 02:13:42,570
There's a great strides.

2246
02:13:42,571 --> 02:13:47,370
Is the name of the organization where
the Schrody family team, um, you know,

2247
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:51,780
that's, that's, you know, you know,
we were trying to get our team,

2248
02:13:51,781 --> 02:13:54,240
obviously the donations,
but even if, you know,

2249
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:57,390
if you just sent them a donation that's
fine too. But we got, you know, we're,

2250
02:13:57,540 --> 02:14:00,810
this is a little walk we sponsor
every year and, and you know,

2251
02:14:00,811 --> 02:14:03,180
we liked doing it and I said,
yeah, like I said, I got,

2252
02:14:03,190 --> 02:14:06,030
I'm be hitting you up in a lot
of other cats, you know, for,

2253
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:09,090
in the future we're going to try and put
together some events and really do some,

2254
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,890
I'll do anything to get this thing wiped
out in the next five years and then

2255
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:16,530
we'll move onto the next thing. And this
is all a lot of privately financed. Yeah.

2256
02:14:16,531 --> 02:14:18,900
There's no government funding
whatsoever for it, man.

2257
02:14:18,901 --> 02:14:23,130
It's complete private donations and
it's also ranked like as one of the top

2258
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:26,010
charities in the world
as far as getting like,

2259
02:14:26,011 --> 02:14:30,480
it's the high 80th percentile on how
much every of every dollar gets into the

2260
02:14:30,481 --> 02:14:34,800
researchers actual. When you
are so closely, uh, you know,

2261
02:14:34,830 --> 02:14:36,960
you're so closely involved
with something like this.

2262
02:14:36,961 --> 02:14:39,750
Does this drive you crazy when
you see like that Coney Shit?

2263
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:44,770
Like you know when you yo, no,
no because you know, I mean it's,

2264
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:49,110
it's not a horrible thing for
everybody to jump on the bandwagon of,

2265
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:53,430
you know what I mean? The back does a
cystic fibrosis is such a rare thing,

2266
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:57,570
you know what I mean? It's like my, my,
in order for my daughter to have it,

2267
02:14:57,571 --> 02:15:02,340
both I and my wife had to be quote
unquote carriers of this. We had no idea,

2268
02:15:02,341 --> 02:15:05,670
cause I've looked back through generations
of my family and generation of hers

2269
02:15:05,671 --> 02:15:09,390
and it has to be both. It has to be
both. If there's one of us that didn't,

2270
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:12,360
it will, it will. And you know,
there's, if I have more children,

2271
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:16,560
there's a one in four chance that
that child will have cystic fibrosis.

2272
02:15:16,561 --> 02:15:19,690
So that's a, that's a whole nother
thing. But no, it doesn't bother me man.

2273
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:21,870
There's room for every, you
know, everything needs help.

2274
02:15:21,871 --> 02:15:24,840
I mean like honestly I'm at that
is a scandal involving the call,

2275
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:27,970
the dualistic guy who ripped
off a lot of people. Oh No.

2276
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:30,990
Huge percentage of the money
went to him and his organization.

2277
02:15:30,991 --> 02:15:34,920
Is that why they found him naked
in the like crazy. That's a shame.

2278
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:38,700
That's a shame. Well, my attitude in
general is like, look man, this is,

2279
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:39,870
this is my priority.

2280
02:15:39,870 --> 02:15:43,770
I don't expect the guy out there who
maybe he's might be dealing with a child

2281
02:15:43,771 --> 02:15:48,750
with something else cancer or, or down
syndrome. I expect them to, to just,

2282
02:15:48,751 --> 02:15:50,220
I'm doing my part and I'm saying,
Hey,

2283
02:15:50,221 --> 02:15:54,810
if you got an extra 50 cents and and
missing and five songs for you today,

2284
02:15:54,811 --> 02:15:56,310
maybe touched you a little something.
You know,

2285
02:15:57,170 --> 02:15:59,340
I just the other day from
throwing it down on Twitter,

2286
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:03,060
a couple thousand dollars from complete
strangers and there was a lot of $1

2287
02:16:03,061 --> 02:16:06,030
there was and you know what? Don't
think that doesn't make a difference.

2288
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:08,880
That's appreciate.
I know how hard times are that $1 debt.

2289
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:13,230
That means not even more. There's people
who get $500 I was tripping. I was like,

2290
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:16,950
these are strangers, man. You
know, and I wrote on Twitter,

2291
02:16:16,951 --> 02:16:19,650
the kindness of strangers
is, you know, overwhelming.

2292
02:16:19,651 --> 02:16:21,960
It's beautiful times and it
makes them feel so good to,

2293
02:16:21,961 --> 02:16:24,660
people don't know if they've
never donated something like that.

2294
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:29,010
If you really want to, this is something
we could, I'm, I honestly believe in the,

2295
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:32,470
and there's things going on
right now. This thing can
be, it's a genetic disorder.

2296
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:34,870
So technically you can't really,
all you can do is treat it,

2297
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:37,360
but they can treat it to the
point where it's nullified.

2298
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:41,020
And that can happen in our lifetime
and these kids won't be dying in their

2299
02:16:41,020 --> 02:16:43,690
thirties.
And you know that up until recently,

2300
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:48,250
the median life span is 35.
Wow. And so that's, you know,

2301
02:16:48,251 --> 02:16:50,740
and that's what I read instantly
when my child was diagnosed.

2302
02:16:50,741 --> 02:16:55,240
But it's changing every day right now
because the science every day is getting

2303
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:55,751
so much better.

2304
02:16:55,751 --> 02:16:59,500
So we don't know now because we haven't
seen what these effects of had on these

2305
02:16:59,501 --> 02:17:02,390
youngsters, man. So I mean, I'm,
I'm guarantee you that you would,

2306
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,500
did lifespans are already being,
being increased daily.

2307
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:09,910
But this thing could be like put to
bed honestly within the next 10 years.

2308
02:17:09,911 --> 02:17:13,570
If the right money and the right things
are found in it and it's one of them

2309
02:17:13,571 --> 02:17:16,600
things, it's one of them. It's like
such a complex genetic thing. I,

2310
02:17:16,601 --> 02:17:19,870
I'm not gonna try and s tell you details
about it because I'll sound like a

2311
02:17:19,871 --> 02:17:23,080
Maura, but it's one of them things
that attracts the most brilliant minds.

2312
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:26,470
It's one of the puzzles that the most
brilliant dudes want to figure out as far

2313
02:17:26,471 --> 02:17:30,160
as into medical fields. You, you get
the cream of the crop. And like I said,

2314
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:35,161
cff.org is one of the organizations like
88 85 to 89% sign of every dollar is

2315
02:17:36,911 --> 02:17:40,150
getting to the researchers. It's not,
it's not getting chopped up and you know,

2316
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:43,510
they, they're documented is one of
the best charities in that sense.

2317
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:47,380
That's beautiful. See F F. Dot. Org folks,
we're going to put this great strides.

2318
02:17:47,381 --> 02:17:49,660
You know,
there's walks all over the country too.

2319
02:17:49,661 --> 02:17:53,320
You could start your own team and,
and raise your own bread and you know,

2320
02:17:53,321 --> 02:17:55,060
if anybody feels like doing it,
you know,

2321
02:17:55,061 --> 02:17:57,460
and I saying we're going to have concerts
and we're going to do all kinds of

2322
02:17:57,461 --> 02:18:02,180
things. But right now that
we're sponsoring this walk,
I'm in F. Dot. Org folks, uh,

2323
02:18:02,181 --> 02:18:05,290
yet we're going to put it on Twitter too.
If you forget it from today,

2324
02:18:05,291 --> 02:18:06,190
if you're listening in your car,

2325
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:09,790
put a direct link to the Schrody family
teams so you could dedicated or like you

2326
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:14,340
know in the name of Layla are beautiful,
healthy, so far a young daughter and,

2327
02:18:14,341 --> 02:18:16,080
and hope to keep her that way.
Yes,

2328
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:19,420
we'll throw that up on Twitter
and we'll get as many people

2329
02:18:19,470 --> 02:18:22,920
and thanks for all the love. And literally
last time I came on I got more love.

2330
02:18:22,921 --> 02:18:26,080
I've never, ever, I've done a lot of
shows, I've done a lot of things do.

2331
02:18:26,081 --> 02:18:28,930
I have never seen the reaction I
saw for coming on the show. This

2332
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:31,540
is a, this is a beautiful
group of people out there, man.

2333
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:35,380
A Beautiful Group of people
that have tuned into this
show. And I don't, you know,

2334
02:18:35,381 --> 02:18:38,620
I don't know how it all
happened, but, uh, I feel very,

2335
02:18:38,621 --> 02:18:40,690
very fortunate and I think
Brian feels the same.

2336
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:44,560
It might have something to do with
all those cookies, sugar, cookies,

2337
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:49,720
sugar cookies are motherfucker,
man, real hard to tune into it.

2338
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,990
We're trying real hard to
tune into it and we want to,

2339
02:18:52,991 --> 02:18:56,260
we want everybody else to
tune into it to together.

2340
02:18:56,350 --> 02:19:00,790
I believe that we can truly be a better
group of human beings. All of us can win,

2341
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:03,220
absolutely. Buyer each other.
We push each other forward.

2342
02:19:03,221 --> 02:19:06,220
And if you get enough people that
think a certain way, it doesn't,

2343
02:19:06,250 --> 02:19:10,900
you don't lose hope. You
do know that there's people
out there that got it wrong,

2344
02:19:10,901 --> 02:19:14,440
but there's also people there that got
it right. You could find them. You know,

2345
02:19:14,441 --> 02:19:17,890
you could live your life like a Goddamn
episode of Nancy Grace and only look for

2346
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:21,670
the shittiest things every goddamn day
and really freak yourself the fuck out.

2347
02:19:21,671 --> 02:19:25,120
And that's, that's true and real.
Or You could live your life.

2348
02:19:25,150 --> 02:19:28,010
We need together a lot
of money, man, and make

2349
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,090
a network and just have it be the
good news network. Yeah, no shit.

2350
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:36,590
I bet you would be a huge success,
man. Yeah, exactly. We will.

2351
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:39,440
We have 7 billion people on this planet.

2352
02:19:39,441 --> 02:19:43,220
We concentrate on the most horrific
thing. There's a lot of good news, man.

2353
02:19:43,221 --> 02:19:45,710
You wouldn't know it. You're right.
You're right. And that would,

2354
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:47,180
that would feel good news.
How would you,

2355
02:19:47,181 --> 02:19:48,800
if you came home from the end of the day,
wouldn't you?

2356
02:19:48,810 --> 02:19:50,060
Wouldn't you just be glad to be like,

2357
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:52,040
let me just see some good
shit happening in the world.

2358
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:55,190
Turn that on for 45 minutes.
Exactly.

2359
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:57,530
We were constantly afraid of danger.

2360
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:00,530
We have information that's
coming to us from places we'll,

2361
02:20:00,531 --> 02:20:03,710
we'll never physically be and
yet we'll still worry about it.

2362
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:06,350
And I bet you there's good
news from those places too,

2363
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:10,760
that we're not being told bad. Yeah.
Motherfuckers keep us in the dark. Right.

2364
02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:13,160
Hey Gel. Um, can I say real quick?

2365
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:17,290
Me and Joey Diaz are doing a short
little Midwest tour. Yeah. What is that?

2366
02:20:17,570 --> 02:20:21,290
It's now on sale. I, it's a may
17 two will be in Columbus, Ohio.

2367
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:25,400
May 18th will be in Cleveland, Ohio. May
19th will be in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

2368
02:20:25,570 --> 02:20:26,211
You got a death squad.

2369
02:20:26,211 --> 02:20:29,310
Dot TV right at the top it says death
squad mini tour for all the links so that

2370
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:31,520
tickets, me and Joey Diaz. That's awesome.

2371
02:20:31,521 --> 02:20:35,070
This is your first time on the road or
like with a comic life Joey too. Yeah,

2372
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:38,150
just you and Joey and just me and joy.
Wow. How much time are you going to do?

2373
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:43,690
Like 1520 and that Joe is going to just
go off for an hour and a good Joey.

2374
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:48,560
A lot of those little five hour
energy drinks. He loves those as wow.

2375
02:20:48,561 --> 02:20:51,510
That's going to be fun. So what are the
places? Just it's on death squad TV. Yeah.

2376
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:54,350
Death squad.tv.
We're playing the woodlands tavern,

2377
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:57,320
that garage shop and the
Mullens in Pittsburgh. Oh,

2378
02:20:57,321 --> 02:20:59,930
so you're doing bars like
it's like stand up style,

2379
02:21:00,490 --> 02:21:04,910
like small menu music stuff too. That's
great stuff. It's going to be fun.

2380
02:21:04,911 --> 02:21:07,090
You're going to,
where was I was on tour.

2381
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:10,220
We were somewhere and we went
to a restaurant and it was like,

2382
02:21:10,221 --> 02:21:13,130
you know how to half a bar? I'm like, we
were really good restaurant too. I can't,

2383
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:18,131
I think it was in Chicago in Italian
spot and like a comic just started like,

2384
02:21:18,921 --> 02:21:21,230
I guess they were having a comedy night
and there's a few common standards just

2385
02:21:21,231 --> 02:21:23,690
like got up in front of
cats eating dinner and like,

2386
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:26,510
I don't even think people were expecting
comics to be there. Like in there.

2387
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:29,780
Maybe it was their girlfriend and they
just went at it and I was just like, man,

2388
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:34,190
I don't think I could do that.
Uh, that's rough business man.

2389
02:21:34,191 --> 02:21:37,460
Trying to get a laugh out of cats that
it was like got a mouthful of food and

2390
02:21:37,461 --> 02:21:39,660
like looking at you like,
what the hell are you doing here?

2391
02:21:39,661 --> 02:21:42,260
And I've done that shit.
I used to do a waiting room.

2392
02:21:42,261 --> 02:21:46,160
I did it only once the GIG was canceled,
but it was a waiting room of a,

2393
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:49,170
of a restaurant and this is the
first day they were going to have it.

2394
02:21:49,171 --> 02:21:51,620
It was a huge restaurant.
And what they had,

2395
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:56,180
they had two big gigantic places in
Massachusetts, like down by the Cape.

2396
02:21:56,420 --> 02:21:59,720
They have these giant restaurants,
they're mad like preposterously big.

2397
02:21:59,750 --> 02:22:01,280
I did it again,
boom drink.

2398
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:04,490
And in the middle of it there was like a
place where they would have a stage for

2399
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:08,450
a band. So people would be like
waiting, like waiting for the table,

2400
02:22:08,451 --> 02:22:11,840
it'd be called. And you just go
on stage out of nowhere. I mean,

2401
02:22:11,841 --> 02:22:14,840
I don't even remember if a Dj introduced
me. I don't know what had happened. Um,

2402
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:18,980
you know, telling these ridiculously
fucking dirty jokes, you know,

2403
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:22,760
to a bunch of strangers and right when
you're about to hit the punchline Johnson

2404
02:22:22,761 --> 02:22:26,400
table of three year, your table's
ready. Can you come to the front?

2405
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:28,230
It was on the same PA system.

2406
02:22:28,410 --> 02:22:32,680
That's my PA system for telling jokes
was on the same PA system as the tape.

2407
02:22:32,681 --> 02:22:33,480
It was.
That was,

2408
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:37,140
that was one of the most ridiculous
like carrying us rough business.

2409
02:22:37,141 --> 02:22:40,050
Anybody who gets somewhere
in comedy, man, I just like,

2410
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:44,640
I think it's referred in the fight
game, man. You got to have a particular,

2411
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:48,090
you've got to have a particular sickness,
like a fight game.

2412
02:22:48,091 --> 02:22:49,410
If you're really truly talented,

2413
02:22:49,411 --> 02:22:53,070
you might only have to fight two
or three fights in some real shitty

2414
02:22:53,071 --> 02:22:57,300
organization. As a comic, you probably
got to like early on, dude. I mean like,

2415
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,680
well there's some guys will tell you,

2416
02:22:58,681 --> 02:23:01,920
you should never get out
of a shitty situations.

2417
02:23:01,921 --> 02:23:06,420
You should always stay in the muck because
if you ever get too soft and get to a,

2418
02:23:06,421 --> 02:23:06,631
you know,

2419
02:23:06,631 --> 02:23:10,140
you only preach to the converted and
you don't go out and do like some sleazy

2420
02:23:10,141 --> 02:23:13,350
little places and seed. Second
Dingle. Yeah, there's a,

2421
02:23:13,351 --> 02:23:16,830
there's a very real vibe that
you get off a real small crowd.

2422
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:20,100
It's a different vibe, especially a small
crowd. Dennis, totally different thing.

2423
02:23:20,101 --> 02:23:24,210
If I were to stroll into a bar and
start playing songs, it's not the same.

2424
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:28,170
Even if it's total strangers dead
like you know, like say a dead call,

2425
02:23:28,171 --> 02:23:31,140
just show up and do it.
It's a totally different beings in your,

2426
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:34,710
it'd be way more accepting of short music
in the background and listening to you

2427
02:23:34,711 --> 02:23:35,630
playing. I'd be like, Oh yeah.

2428
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:38,970
Then like you're engaging people
as a community and like directly,

2429
02:23:38,971 --> 02:23:42,720
like I want you to laugh at what
I'm saying. It's very arrogant to,

2430
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:44,220
and most people,
you know,

2431
02:23:44,221 --> 02:23:47,880
you see a person there on stage and your
first reaction is why should you be the

2432
02:23:47,881 --> 02:23:50,940
guy talking? What you that I'm
going to give up the position.

2433
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:55,800
I'm going to sit back and just let you
run my thoughts with your loud amplified

2434
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:57,330
mouth.
That's offensive,

2435
02:23:57,450 --> 02:24:00,330
especially when you're not very good at
it and when you wanted to just go to a

2436
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:03,750
bar and have a drink and some
fucking guy who was not very good,

2437
02:24:03,770 --> 02:24:05,790
it's up there saying a
bunch of shitty jokes, man.

2438
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,470
That's how we learn how to do it
takes balls of steel man, very tart.

2439
02:24:10,471 --> 02:24:13,710
It doesn't matter how good you are.
It takes balls of steel. The fry,

2440
02:24:14,360 --> 02:24:18,810
it's a fun Gig. It's a Joey Diaz
says. He said it's the hardest,

2441
02:24:18,811 --> 02:24:21,480
easiest thing you'll ever do.
That's the best way to describe it.

2442
02:24:21,481 --> 02:24:24,300
I think if you get good at it,
it becomes easy. It becomes fun,

2443
02:24:24,510 --> 02:24:27,330
but it's hard to stay up. It's
hard to stay good. It's hard to

2444
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:33,450
stay in that frequency, you
know? Yeah. That's, that's
true of a lot of stuff. Yeah.

2445
02:24:33,451 --> 02:24:38,310
It is right. Creativity. Right. And if you
don't keep it moving. Yeah. And flowing.

2446
02:24:39,150 --> 02:24:40,890
Yeah. I always feel like that. Yeah.

2447
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:43,300
I always take too long and
don't write some music.

2448
02:24:43,301 --> 02:24:47,040
It becomes very hard to kickstart it and
get it going again towards going to be

2449
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:51,210
a level I'll, I'll be acceptable on.
That's why I buy mannequins. Yeah.

2450
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:55,110
That's how to do it. Brian, have you ever
read the war of art? I don't think I am.

2451
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:59,430
Great Book About Killing Procrastination,
about making you right. Making you, uh,

2452
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,530
get, get shit done or do heart sounds
like something I'd like to read.

2453
02:25:02,531 --> 02:25:05,520
It's a really good small short
book. It's, it's per people,

2454
02:25:05,521 --> 02:25:07,980
even people that aren't
artists, it'll, um,

2455
02:25:08,010 --> 02:25:11,790
it'll get you motivated to just get shit
done that you've been procrastinating.

2456
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:13,800
The way the guy puts it.
It's really,

2457
02:25:13,801 --> 02:25:17,040
he says his name is Steven Pressfield
and he wrote a, a bunch of books.

2458
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:21,660
He's a pretty famous author, a lot of
like historical novels and stuff. I think,

2459
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:24,280
I believe he's a famous for,
but he's,

2460
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:28,510
uh, he's also famous for being like really
prolific and he's super honest and I

2461
02:25:28,511 --> 02:25:32,500
spoke about how he was a fucking loser
up until he was like 40 years old.

2462
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:37,060
And it just like, he couldn't, couldn't
fucking get it together. It couldn't work.

2463
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,230
He couldn't just,
and he's,

2464
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:42,220
he just kept failing and then finally
figured out how to just become a

2465
02:25:42,221 --> 02:25:45,850
professional, how to really become
a professional and fucking work.

2466
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:49,150
And when he did that, everything
changed. Completely changed.

2467
02:25:49,151 --> 02:25:52,930
And he's like super honest about it
and super honest about, um, what, what,

2468
02:25:52,931 --> 02:25:55,960
what holds you back? The
resistance. He calls it resistance,

2469
02:25:56,110 --> 02:25:58,780
like the lazy procrastination,

2470
02:25:58,781 --> 02:26:02,050
all the self destructive shit that
people do to avoid doing things that they

2471
02:26:02,051 --> 02:26:02,884
know that they should do.

2472
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:06,760
And the way he puts it is really
a quite brilliant and it's a very,

2473
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:10,510
it's very inspirational. Book. It real
small too. If you're not a big reader,

2474
02:26:10,511 --> 02:26:14,830
the war of art, we'll get you cause it's
nice and small. Um, thanks everybody man.

2475
02:26:14,831 --> 02:26:18,610
Thank you. Everlast thank you. Always
come back again. Anytime we're going to,

2476
02:26:18,910 --> 02:26:20,580
we're going to have to do
more of these problems.

2477
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:23,810
I think we'll have to move to do at least
three a week. And you need to do like,

2478
02:26:23,811 --> 02:26:25,480
you know,
even like I said,

2479
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:28,520
bringing somebody in to the mix and now
don't want to meet some of these cats,

2480
02:26:28,521 --> 02:26:30,380
man and fans of somebody to do.

2481
02:26:30,381 --> 02:26:32,870
You tell me anytime I got somebody
that you want to, come on, man,

2482
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:36,640
you got a ticket always. I've got a
few folks that want to come on to what?

2483
02:26:36,810 --> 02:26:39,440
I'll tell you gotta make
some Shit happen folks.

2484
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:44,750
We're gonna make some shit
happen. All right? Yes. See
you heard it all here folks.

2485
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:48,620
Uh, thanks everybody. Thanks to the
flashlight. Go to Joe rogan.net.

2486
02:26:48,621 --> 02:26:50,510
Click on the link and enter
in the code name. Rogan.

2487
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:53,780
Save yourself some money on
your new jerk off toy. I use it.

2488
02:26:53,781 --> 02:26:57,080
It's fucking wonderful.
Nice. My wife actually said,

2489
02:26:57,081 --> 02:26:59,840
that sounds like something that's cool.

2490
02:26:59,870 --> 02:27:04,040
Like if you're going to jerk off
shore, that was like, you're crazy.

2491
02:27:04,041 --> 02:27:07,280
It's way better than the regular
masturbation. It's fucking solid product.

2492
02:27:07,281 --> 02:27:10,650
And it's the first one for
men that supposedly was
really good for a long time.

2493
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:13,970
It's really hard. I've got some questions.
Can I ask them real quick? Sure.

2494
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:17,330
We have time. Is it
disposable or chart? Yeah,

2495
02:27:17,331 --> 02:27:21,360
but you're going to throw his
weight. Jeans, man. I'm saying

2496
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:28,500
these things you get like a certain amount
of uses out or is it clean it after a

2497
02:27:28,510 --> 02:27:30,440
while. You kind of want to
probably get a new one now.

2498
02:27:30,441 --> 02:27:32,810
I in my opinions cause I mean
I fucked the shit out of him.

2499
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:35,860
I don't want to fuck them anymore.
Brian's a savage though. He fucked.

2500
02:27:37,010 --> 02:27:40,940
He shoves it in corners of couches
and fucking assaulted. He's a,

2501
02:27:40,941 --> 02:27:43,150
he's an animal man. Right?
The fucks like a while now.

2502
02:27:43,170 --> 02:27:45,440
I'm gonna say it has a lot of blood
stains on. Yeah. You look at him, man.

2503
02:27:45,441 --> 02:27:48,540
He's very deceptive. He's
quite violent and sexuality. I,

2504
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:53,810
I've been scared of him since I met him.
Thanks to audit the microphone.

Sound good man. I mean, I think it's a
really good thing. No training either.
