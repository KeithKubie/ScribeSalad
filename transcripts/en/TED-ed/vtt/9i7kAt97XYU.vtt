00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:09.789
What if you could absorb
another organism

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.817
and take on its abilities?

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:16.920
Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.884
Or if you engulfed a cobra

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:23.444
and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth.

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.177
Throughout the history of life,

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:29.904
specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells,

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:33.210
things like this happened all the time.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.877
One organism absorbed another,

00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:42.401
and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both.

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.814
We think that around 2 billion years ago,

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:48.960
the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.516
single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.311
Let's look closely at just three of them.

00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.659
One was a big, simple blob-like cell

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.186
with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them.

00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:07.861
Another was a bacterial cell

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:13.761
that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:18.585
A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:23.730
and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.407
The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria.

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:34.549
These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had,

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.694
but their existence became linked.

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:39.981
If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement,

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:43.124
you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism,

00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:47.461
that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.161
that performed one of its life functions,

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.189
just like your heart is a part of you

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.182
that performs the function 
of pumping your blood.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:00.861
This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis,

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:04.239
one organism living inside another.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.995
But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:10.693
What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too?

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:14.995
Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex.

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:17.184
They were big and full 
of intricate structures

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:21.488
that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria.

00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:24.156
These structures work together 
to harness sunlight,

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:25.146
make sugar,

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:27.973
and break down that sugar using the oxygen

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:32.701
that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.816
Organisms absorbing other organisms

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:39.193
was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.469
of their surroundings.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.941
This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory,

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:50.862
the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved.

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:53.358
There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory,

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.964
but let's look at three main pieces.

00:02:55.964 --> 00:03:01.236
First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:03.359
as those ancient bacteria,

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.315
which are still around, by the way.

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:10.459
In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.326
The cell can't make them.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:15.144
They can only make more of themselves.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:16.653
Second piece of evidence.

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:22.635
Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.725
Their DNA has a circular structure

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:28.769
that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria,

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.851
and it also contains many similar genes.

00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:36.709
The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria,

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.064
also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria,

00:03:41.064 --> 00:03:42.817
but are different from the ribosomes

00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:46.473
hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell.

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:50.810
Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.731
Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them,

00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:58.493
an inner and outer membrane.

00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:01.776
Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:04.919
that are not present 
in the outer membrane.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.528
Why is that significant?

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:10.350
Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.212
When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process,

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:18.418
they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one.

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.229
Surely enough, those same lipids

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.363
and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria.

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:27.263
Biologists now use this theory

00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:32.342
to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms.

00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:36.196
Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools.

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:41.338
A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella,

00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:47.514
at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena.

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:49.687
Euglena can perform photosynthesis,

00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:51.779
break down sugar using oxygen,

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.444
and swim around pond water.

00:04:54.444 --> 00:04:56.202
And as the theory would predict,

00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:59.845
the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:04.054
since they had two before being engulfed.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.689
The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.771
allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities

00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:13.046
to become better adapted to life on Earth.

00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:15.817
The results were species 
capable of much more

00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:18.252
than when they were separate organisms,

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:20.216
and this was an evolutionary leap

00:05:20.216 --> 00:05:22.653
that lead to the microorganisms, plants,

00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:26.139
and animals we observe 
on the planet today.
