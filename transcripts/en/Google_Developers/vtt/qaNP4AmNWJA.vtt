00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:06.690
JOSE UGIA: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.090
Welcome to our session.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.780
Today, we'll speak about how
to engage with your customers

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.570
with Google Pay beyond payments.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.219
First of all, I'd
like to say, thank

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.000
you so much for being here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.360
We know it's not so easy at
this time of the day, right?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.680
You're about to head back,
so we really appreciate that.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.110
We'd like to say hi
as well to all of you

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.630
watching us from the Livestream.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.490
My name is Jose, and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.710
on the Google Pay team.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.220
Together with me is--

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.380
MAILYS ROBIN: Hi everyone.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.320
My name is Mailys and
I'm the product manager

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.132
for Google Pay Passes.

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:41.040
JOSE UGIA: So we
truly believe that we

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
have a valuable, insightful,
and actionable session today.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.240
We'll go all the way
from the progress

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.220
that we have made
since last year,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.290
we'll talk to you
about new features

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.600
that build on what
we offer already

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.400
through the Passes' API.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.495
And finally, we'll look
back a bit into experience

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.370
to see what things can
we learn, so if you're

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.390
starting to integrate
the API now,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.850
you can learn from
what we have found out

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.637
by developing the product, but
also what other partners have

00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:10.720
seen, so you don't have
to go through that hassle.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.020
And this session is
filled with demos.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.628
So this is good for you, we
believe, for two reasons.

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:19.170
First one is you're going to
get to see how things look like,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.670
really before you
actually implement them.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.960
The second reason is,
that many chances for us,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.240
there's many chances that
some things may go wrong,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.230
so you probably have
some fun along the way.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.190
So what do we mean when we
say the Google API for passes?

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.370
Well, we're speaking about
what's left in your wallet

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.100
once we have covered payments.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.060
And we want to
help you, and help

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.670
your customers digitalize that.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.840
We're speaking about boarding
passes, event tickets,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.460
and loyalty cards.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.750
Now why this is good?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.930
Well first of all, you are
not only taking weight out

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.030
of your pockets and
space, but we also

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.610
benefit from the goodness
of technology, right?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.800
So if you have many,
many, many cards,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.980
then it's probably hard to just
keep them on in your wallet.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.100
At the same time, we can
add some additional features

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.460
on top of it, like for
example, showing your customers

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.080
their loyalty cards
or their gift cards,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.600
wherever they need
them, with things

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.150
like location-based
updates or information.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.990
We'll talk about these
three categories today,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.780
and we'll have new features
on each of those as well.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.060
And this is just one example,
a subset of the partners

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.890
that have worked
with us recently,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.450
and that I've integrated the
Google Pay API for passes.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.250
We have success stories
for these partners.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.400
As you can see, they're
in these five categories.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.790
And currently, we'd like to tell
you more about three of them,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.010
so you can probably get
inspiration from that.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.410
So the first of
all is Lufthansa,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.020
one of the world's
largest airlines,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.330
which integrated the
Google Pay API for passes

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.290
in four different
channels through SMS,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.780
email, mobile
application, and website.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.560
And they just did
that in a few weeks.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.700
So as you can read right in
there, the integration for them

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.080
was easy and quick.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.970
That was one of the
highlights from it.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.180
Which is something that
Ryanair shares as well.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.772
Ryanair, as many of
you probably know,

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:14.230
is one of the
airlines that changed

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.130
the way we fly in Europe.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.460
So for them, on top
of the how easy it is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.520
and how quick it is
to integrate the API,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.750
they highlighted and they
wanted to share with us

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.720
how open our team was to
extending the API to include

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.590
new functionality, and as
well as how flexible it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.230
was to fit their use case.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.250
Finally, Japan Airlines, with
their very particular and very

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.600
forward-looking vision
of smart airports,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.390
in which the Google Pay
for passes and the ability

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.650
to digitalize those
passes, and make

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.360
them available to their
customers on their devices

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.230
was a crucial part of that.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.500
Now, we'd like to give
you more specific numbers.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.600
We have two use cases.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.610
We have two case studies
from two of our partners,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.610
and we would like to share
with you some success

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.830
metrics that they sought.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.130
The first of them is Europcar,
one of the leading car rental

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.900
companies in Europe.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.920
And as you can see, from
Europcar's head of loyalty

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.980
and brand's words, for
them it was a natural step

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.010
to think about
digitizing their passes.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.279
With the uplift that they saw
in them in their mobile usage,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.340
it made sense for them to
give their customers a chance

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.390
to have those passes
on their devices.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.080
So with the help of Captain
Wallet, the company that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.990
helped them build the
backbone of their integration,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.070
they turned their privilege
loyalty card into digital.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.780
They brought it to
the digital world,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.830
they took the atoms into bits.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.770
What they saw, as you can
see, were great results.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.430
They got up to a 90%
digitization rate

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.020
on their customers,
on that loyalty card.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.703
And amongst those customers,
70% were so satisfied

00:04:52.703 --> 00:04:54.620
with that card that they
don't want to go back

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.550
to the physical card.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.645
MAILYS ROBIN: So the
second case study

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:03.030
is from Multikino, which is
one of the largest cinema

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.470
chains in Poland.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.530
And Multikino implemented
the full Google Pay solution

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.510
from letting their
users pay online

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.370
for cinema tickets to saving
them in the Google Pay app.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.380
And what they've
noticed is for users

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.420
that have their tickets
saved in Google Pay

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.560
compared to users
that are using paper,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.070
the check-in into the cinema
was four seconds faster,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.920
which had a huge impact
on their business

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.130
because it would just
remove a lot of queues

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.380
and waiting time for users.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.240
Also, the month-to-month growth
of people saving those passes

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.110
were 2X after launch, showing
that users really liked it.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.880
And generally
speaking, they found

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.590
that it's a great way to
communicate with the user

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.410
through the API with updates
and just notifications.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.310
So we've covered testimonies
from partners on the loyalty

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.130
side, cinematic, and flights.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.090
But now we cannot wait
to show you what is new,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.840
which is probably why
you came here today.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.890
So, first, we want to make
passes accessible easily

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.670
to user.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.350
They should be
informational and it

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.960
should be just available
there in one click

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.430
as soon as a user needs it.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.400
So to go through the
first set of features

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.290
that we have for you
today, we actually

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.570
are going to use Jose's
personal experience.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.670
So, Jose, do you want to
tell us a little bit more

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.503
about yourself?

00:06:25.503 --> 00:06:26.920
JOSE UGIA: Yeah,
I have to confess

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.370
that I have a bit of a bad
reputation with my friends,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.950
because I've missed some
flights in the past.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.230
I keep on telling them that
it's not really my fault,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.272
because, you know, some
things just can go wrong.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.460
They're out of my control, but
I guess it's not really helping.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.960
You know how it
really works, right?

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.060
You have to book a
ticket, then at some point

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.890
you would check in,
which is different

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.970
for different airlines.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.280
And it doesn't get any better
once you get into the airport.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.890
You have the stress
of the check in,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.620
and it gets even worse if
there are things changing,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.810
like your boarding time or
your boarding gate changes.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.168
So I actually know that
we have some features that

00:07:01.168 --> 00:07:02.460
are going to help me with that.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.710
So why don't we just share
them with our audience?

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.085
MAILYS ROBIN:
Yeah, so how can we

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:08.520
help people like Jose and
just generally people,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.090
to make the travel experience
faster and nicer and less

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.110
stressful?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.250
So we really believe that
using the Google ecosystem

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.440
can really help us building
strong user experience.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.680
So to remove the
stress and the process,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.050
and so users can really focus
on what matters to them.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.920
So this first feature
was announced at CES

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.870
earlier this year, and
is the flight check

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.940
in for the Google Assistant.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.420
The way it works is, as a user,
when I'm ready to check in,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.580
I would get a notification.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.610
That notification would bring
me to the user assistant.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.730
In a few clicks, I can
complete the check in,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.698
it's really simple.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:47.490
And then at the end of
it, I get a boarding

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.250
pass that I can access later.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.670
The reason why we are
talking about this feature

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.980
also at this Google
Pay Pass session

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.860
is because the API to
get the boarding pass

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.690
is reusing the Google Pay API.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.080
Meaning that, as a developer,
if you already implemented

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.720
the passes API to
let your users save

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.430
your boarding pass from
your website or your app,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.010
this is just incremental work.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.890
So you just have to
implement the check in part

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.400
with the Assistant, and
you will get both features.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.340
So this is launching
right now with United,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.950
and we also have
Vueling and Lufthansa

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.230
integrating and launching soon.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.630
But I'll just say
it, like it's simple,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.602
but how about we
just see it for real?

00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.560
JOSE UGIA: Actually, this
is really convenient,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.220
because my flight is just
taking off in a couple of days.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.720
So if you don't
mind, I'm just going

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.620
to go ahead and check
in to my flight.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.900
So I'm going to
go to my Pixel 3,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.340
and I'm going to
open the Assistant.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.150
I'm gonna ask it
to show my flights.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.310
Show my flights.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.850
So as you can see,
once this loads,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.150
I'll see my card for my
upcoming flight, right?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.450
And if you look a bit
below in one of the chips,

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.640
we have the option to
check in right in there.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.630
So I'm just going to take that.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.130
Great, so I'm just
going to be asked

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.340
a few questions in this really
nice conversational style

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.650
that you already know
about our system.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.720
I'm gonna say, yes
I'm ready to check in.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.460
Then, I'm going to
be asked, again,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.585
I'm gonna go through the
process of check in, which

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:14.640
may vary per airline.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.310
I usually travel light,
so I have no bags with me,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.240
it makes it easier.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.000
I really hate to
wait at the belt

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.730
when I'm in the
destination airport.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.340
Now, I think I don't have
anything that is forbidden,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.120
so it should be good to
go, I'm confirming here.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.477
And once this responds,
then what you will see

00:09:34.477 --> 00:09:35.810
is that the process is now done.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.790
But actually, my
favorite part of this

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.830
is that, I'm not only
already checked in,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.820
so I can forget about that
and enjoy the rest of I/O,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.250
even though it's not too much.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.280
But I can also show my
boarding pass, right?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.300
So you can see how close
to me is this right now.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.420
Actually, I'm going to
show my flights again.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.560
Show my flights.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.010
Or maybe, if we get
proper connectivity.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.850
Show my flights.

00:10:04.215 --> 00:10:05.840
Let's see if that
worked, there you go.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.400
So you see, I have my boarding
pass already in there.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.320
So the Google Pay
application is opening

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.060
and it's showing
my pass right away.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.130
You saw that it took
me maybe two attempts,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.630
but it was just one
tap away, right?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.090
So when I'm in the airport,
this really helps me save time.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.060
So with that, let's
head back to the slides.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.850
MAILYS ROBIN: So this is
great before your flight,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.210
but how about once
you're at the airport?

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.670
And the airport is usually
a really stressful moment,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.670
because I have to think about
my luggage, maybe my kids,

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.130
I have to go through
a lot of checks,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.290
so I don't want to think
about just accessing

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.970
my papers or my boarding pass.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.270
It has to be available,
just there when I need it.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.880
So this is why we launched
earlier this year,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.920
high priority notifications.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.290
So those are persistent
notifications

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.010
that are on your screen three
hours before your flight takes

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.060
off, and that can be used to go
back and forth to your boarding

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.780
pass in one click.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.310
So when I'm there, just one
click, I go to my notification,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.260
to my boarding pass,
and then I can come back

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.360
and it's already there for me.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.550
This doesn't come at any
extra implementation cost,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.180
it's just there with the API.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.830
And if you also
have event tickets,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.350
we have the same
notification for events.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.710
And this will be
dismissed automatically

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.590
when my flight takes off,
also you can manually

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.210
dismiss it as a user.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.300
The second thing that
is really stressful

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.010
is last minute changes.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.518
So I'm at the airport
and my gate changes,

00:11:34.518 --> 00:11:36.060
or my flight is
delayed, I don't want

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.640
to have to look at the
screen all the time to see

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.600
if something changed.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.900
So we also have a status
notification updates.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.820
So if something is delayed
or if my gate changes,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.460
the airline can send a
push update to the API,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.770
and we send the notification
to all the users

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.330
that have that boarding pass.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.685
Meaning that for me, as a
user, just all the updates

00:11:57.685 --> 00:11:58.810
are just there in my phone.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.730
No need to check anything else.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.720
So to recap, boarding pass
available one click away,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.150
or even one slide away,
because the barcode is also

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.520
inline in the notifications,
so you can even use that

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.330
to board your plane
or access your event.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.310
JOSE UGIA: That's great
for airline passengers,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.340
for airlines as well, but
we use different forms

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.020
of transportation to
move around, right?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.020
It's not like we move all
the time using planes.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.600
We're really happy to tell
you about that, recently,

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.750
we opened up part of our APIs
to support transit tickets

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.992
as well.

00:12:30.992 --> 00:12:33.200
And it works really similar
to what you have seen now

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.240
for boarding passes.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.600
Right, so you are able to,
first of all digitalize tickets,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.520
but also you can associate
barcodes, like QR codes,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.960
to that ticket.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.420
And on top of that, as
you just saw for flights,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.190
we're able to
create notifications

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.240
based on updates that happen in
real time coming from your end.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.130
Now similar to the
boarding passes,

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.040
once again, we'll have a high
priority notification showing

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.290
up, this time, one hour
before my trip begins.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.770
So I have my ticket
right there to access it

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.630
whenever I need it.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.110
Eurostar has been
the first partner

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.890
to launch with us using the
Google Pay API for passes,

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.760
but LNER and Russian
Railways will

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.340
be coming soon later this year.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.390
Here you can see how
it actually looks like.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.290
This is a transit
ticket from Eurostar.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.260
So if we are actually going
to or from London, Paris,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.440
or Brussels, you can just
go ahead and try it out

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.610
for yourself right now.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.100
All right, I see,
yeah, I understand

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.930
that we are a bit far
away from those cities.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.780
So I guess you
have no motivation

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.670
to go and book a train
for those places,

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.690
being 6,000 kilometers away.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.859
Well, fair enough, we
have a demo ready for you.

00:13:41.859 --> 00:13:43.276
Mailys is going
to show you how it

00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:45.690
would look like if you did it.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.020
MAILYS ROBIN: So going
to the Pixel phone.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.200
So I used to live, a
year ago, in London,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.750
and in case you haven't
noticed before, I'm French.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.890
So going back to Paris was
something I would do often

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.870
to see my family.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.915
And Eurostar is just a
convenient way to do that.

00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:04.540
So I'm just going to
book my next trip.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.500
So opening the Eurostar app,
I'm gonna book my next journey.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.120
I think in a week's
time sounds good,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.370
so let's just pick the trains.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.970
So I have a nice promo here, so
let's just do standard premier

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.850
and then, yeah,
return 8-13 is good.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.120
So I booked my trains,
now going to the checkout.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.290
So on the checkout
page, as you can see,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.990
we have the Google Pay option
to purchase the tickets, which

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.350
is great, because I don't
have to input my credit card

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.470
details here, so that's faster,
and also I know it's secured.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.010
So I'm just going to go ahead
and buy with Google Pay.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.500
So here I can also
change my card details

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.670
if I want, in this case, I will
just continue with this one.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.220
And then confirming the booking.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.050
And my payment was
accepted, I have my ticket.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.330
So I can now download
my ticket, so here I

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.080
see a button on Google
Pay, save to phone,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.150
where I can save my ticket.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.960
Now this trip is in a week.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.570
So at this point of
time, I might not

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.040
have time to save
my ticket, or I

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.790
might want to save them later.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.660
So let's just
ignore that for now.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.500
Now going fast forward
a week, now this

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.650
is really close to my trip.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.080
So I might want to
save my ticket as well.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.710
So I might not want
to go back to the app,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.710
or I forgot about it.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:27.660
But Eurostar also sent me
an email for my reservation.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.900
So I'm just going to open
this so I can see my tickets.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.940
And I also have the Save
button here as well,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.190
which is great, because I
want to save them right now.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.899
So I'm just going to
save the first one.

00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:39.399
Oops.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.120
Just going back to the
email and saving it.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.140
So I get a confirmation screen
to save my ticket, so saving,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.590
and then I can see my
ticket in the Google Pay app

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.360
where I can access it.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.540
And was mentioned
earlier, I will also

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.330
get a notification an hour
before my train starts,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.870
so I will be able to access
my pass from there as well.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.190
So going back to the slides.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.450
So this is for
static barcodes, it's

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.670
something that might
not update all the time,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.680
but we are also
working on announcing

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.430
this API to support dynamic
visuals and dynamic barcode

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.190
or QR codes.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.780
What a dynamic barcode
is, is a barcode

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.070
that will updates every
couple of seconds,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.220
even if the device is offline.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.010
And what that really
means is more security,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.040
because somehow if
someone was able to take

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.090
a picture of my pass,
or just replicate it,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.330
this pass would only be valid
for the next couple of seconds.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.880
Because after that,
this pass will also

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.160
update the barcode again,
and it's much harder

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.620
to commit fraud.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.470
So we are working
on this right now,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.930
it will be available
before the end of the year.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.610
And we are working with
Token Transit, which

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.140
is a company that provides
tickets and other services

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.880
to transit agencies to
integrate this wisdom.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.069
And the same as
for boarding pass,

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.579
we really think that
utilizing the Google ecosystem

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.700
can help us building
great user experience.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.280
And when we're
talking about transit,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.770
the first Google App
that I can think about

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.932
is Maps, because this is where
I'm going to start my journey.

00:17:23.932 --> 00:17:25.390
So when I want to
go somewhere, I'm

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.930
just going to open Maps and
search for the best itinerary

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.700
to go somewhere.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.530
So we are adding a feature
to purchase tickets and save

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.710
the tickets in
Google Pay from Maps.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.860
So from a user perspective, I
can just do my whole journey,

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.430
from searching for my itinerary,
to redeeming the tickets

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.400
from Google Pay at the
transit agencies in one go.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.480
So this is first, this
actually has launched already

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.490
in Melbourne, Australia.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.210
With NTT Data and Public
Transport Victoria

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.220
for the myki card.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.210
And we are just going to
show you how it works.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.910
JOSE UGIA: Let's do
a little exercise,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.160
an exercise of imagination.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.050
So just come with
me, let's teleport

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.980
our minds and our bodies
all the way into Australia.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.260
We're going to Melbourne,
imagine, like really all of us,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.740
it's a bunch of people.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.680
So we're there, we have
been spending the day

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.780
just checking out some places.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.810
And now it's a bit late in the
evening, we're a bit tired,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.730
we're hungry, so we want
to go to a specific place

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.210
that we were recommended, right?

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.360
So what would we typically do
when we are in this situation?

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.340
We go ahead and we open
Google Maps, right?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.610
You probably are doing,
already today, dozens of times.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.520
So the place that we
are going to go to

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.080
is near to the town hall.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.050
So why don't we go ahead
and select that place.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.735
We are right now in the zoo,
so this is our origin point.

00:18:53.735 --> 00:18:55.110
Now, as you can
see, you probably

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.120
have seen this
screen many times.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.340
We'll get a few options,
we'll go for the first one,

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.720
it takes us 29
minutes to get there.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.250
Let's go ahead and select it.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.950
And now it produces something
new, right at the top.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.908
I have the option to add
or use my myki card, right?

00:19:09.908 --> 00:19:11.700
Right where I need it,
right on the default

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.460
view of the planning
of my route.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.070
Since I don't have a card, I'm
going to go ahead and create it

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.600
right now as we speak.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.380
So we're just going to be
there for a few more seconds.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.426
So why don't we go ahead
and get the prepaid card.

00:19:26.426 --> 00:19:30.680
There you go, I'm going
to go for the full fare.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.530
And now, on my payment method,
I select my payment option.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.280
I'm going to top up
10 Australian dollars,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.655
I think that's going to be
enough for all of us probably.

00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:41.020
So I'm going to continue,
and as I purchase,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.773
then I'm going to
see that reflected.

00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:44.190
Now as we get back
to Google Maps,

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.290
we're going to
see that reflected

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.750
next to the route where
I just saw my myki card

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.010
for the first time.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.920
Now you saw that this was
the first time I did that.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.830
So it was a process to buy
it, it was still really quick,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.320
but now once I already
have it, and if I go back

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.990
to Google Maps, this is
going to show up in there

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.090
and it's going to show
my current balance.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.940
So all I have to do, is just
get close to an appliance,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.010
tap with my phone, and
then off I go, right?

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.265
So this felt probably
pretty straightforward,

00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:13.890
but what I would like
us to do, is just

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.140
take a step back and
compare that to the way

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.300
we have been doing
things so far.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.550
So after finding the route
that we want to go through,

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.830
we normally had to get out
of our application, right,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.860
and find another application
to buy the ticket or a website.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.220
Or even worse, we had to
look in the physical space

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.620
to see if there was some
appliances to buy a ticket.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.610
So you can see how, with
integrations like this,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.970
the life of your customers,
but also your life's

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.200
going to be much, much simpler.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.620
So if we could, go back
to the slides, please.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.720
We'd like to tell
you about, so this

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.580
was like for Melbourne
in Australia,

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.580
but this is just the beginning.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.490
We're building a similar
integration in Japan

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.420
with Suica and JR East.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.370
Suica is an e-money
prepaid card that

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.820
allows you to pay on
buses, on the subway,

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.830
in trains, and in shops.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.280
So if you live in Japan,
or you go there often,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:13.220
stay tuned because we'll have
more updates later this year.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.200
Now we have spoken about
transit and about airlines,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.920
but what's there
for all of you who

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.990
wanna engage with your
customers a bit more

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.750
to create longer lasting
relationships, for example,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.330
a loyalty program, right?

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.770
We think you'll be really
happy to hear that we're just

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.170
making your life easier
in terms of accessibility

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.375
and discoverability of
those loyalty cards.

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.000
Because I'm sure it
has happened to you

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.880
that, maybe you got new sign
ups into your loyalty program,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.300
but then your customers may
have transacted once or twice,

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.202
and maybe they
didn't do it anymore.

00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:47.160
It can be that they
weren't interested anymore,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.490
but it's also likely that
they simply forgot about it.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.210
Or the email you send them is
just below a pile of dozens

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.150
of emails, so they cannot
find it anymore, right?

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.820
So we added the ability
to import loyalty cards

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.910
automatically from Gmail.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.920
So all your customers will have
to do is simply open the Google

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.357
Pay app, accept
the consent screen,

00:22:07.357 --> 00:22:08.940
and then they will
get all the loyalty

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.820
cards automatically imported.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.570
You'll probably be happier to
hear that the integration, what

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.450
it takes from your end, is
just really little, almost

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.080
effortless.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.980
All you need to do is add
Markup to your emails,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.360
so that our parser can
just find those cards

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.030
and add them to your
customer's Google account.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.030
We promised that the
theme of this session

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.530
was going to be
showing things live,

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.740
so how about we stop saying
and then we start doing.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.880
So Mailys, you want to
show us how this works?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.140
MAILYS ROBIN: Yes, so
going to the Pixel.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.390
So here I have my Google Pay
app and there are a few ways

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.390
to trigger this.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.208
So if you have object
in Gmail already,

00:22:49.208 --> 00:22:51.250
you should see a consent
screen, but you can also

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.250
trigger this feature
manually for later.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.220
So in the settings,
you can go to General

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.210
and you'll find the
Gmail import settings.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.500
So this is the consent
screen, so I'm just

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.850
going to connect my
Google Pay to Gmail.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.790
It's connecting, and
it found three passes.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.570
So United, so that's
the one that I

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.150
marked with a little nail.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.050
So we have a Kohl's rewards,
National Car Rental,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.640
and United Airlines.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.740
So you can see that now I
can see my number for United,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.330
it's pretty easy.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.310
I can even see the email that
we used to trigger that card,

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.810
in case I want more information.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.110
So this is working right
now only for loyalty,

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:38.140
but we will be working
on extending it

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.880
to other types of passes.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.632
And also, as was
mentioned, as a merchant,

00:23:41.632 --> 00:23:43.840
if you want to make sure
that your detail gets passed

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.780
into Google Pay, it's
just a few lines of Gmail

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.850
to add to your
email, and we'll have

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.910
this ready in our
documentation, which is public.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.123
So it's something you
can do really easily.

00:23:55.123 --> 00:23:56.290
So going back to the slides.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.190
And this is really useful
for your existing users,

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.220
but how about new users?

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.390
So an option that we
have in our passes

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:14.600
documentation for loyalty,
is the option to add,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.620
sorry it's going ahead, a sign
up option for a new account.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.890
So as a developer, you
can enable that option,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.780
and then in Google Pay, when
users manually add passes,

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:28.850
if they look for your
brand or your store,

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.260
they will see that
option to sign up.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.650
So the way it works is
we show a screen that

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.542
is configurable by you, so you
can tell us which user details

00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:40.750
you need to create a loyalty.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.030
So first name, last
name, maybe the zip code,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:46.210
or an email address, then
clicking on the button,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.730
will bring you to your
website where you can

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.190
create that loyalty program.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:54.610
And then you will send it
back to Google Pay, where

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.940
the user can see their
newly created loyalty.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.760
So from there, you can
access to the users

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.597
so you can send them updates
on the loyalty points.

00:25:03.597 --> 00:25:05.680
And it's even something
that you can, for example,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.030
offer in store.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.403
Where, if you ask a user to
sign up for something in store,

00:25:10.403 --> 00:25:12.820
they can just have a new program
in a few clicks, and then

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.040
they already have their
loyalty card ready.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.620
And they can scan it, and
just start collecting points

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.820
and everything.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.290
And last but not least,
we heard you last year.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.530
So this is all great, but
what if my users don't have

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.490
the Google Pay app installed.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.890
Well good news, we
are working on this.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:37.170
So starting with a boarding
pass, even tickets,

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:42.440
and extending later to
other types of passes,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.010
we are working on making
those passes available

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.830
even if the user doesn't
have the Google Pay app.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:51.935
And the first iteration of
that will be through web views.

00:25:51.935 --> 00:25:53.560
So if the user doesn't
have Google Pay,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.890
we'll still render a web
view of their boarding pass.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.850
So an example of entry point,
for example, is the Assistant.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:06.340
And this feature will launch in
a month or two, so really soon.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.260
And the way it works is,
once I save my boarding pass,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.020
I can ask the Assistant,
Hey, Google, show me

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.610
my boarding pass.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:18.430
And then I have a chip there
to see my boarding pass.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.780
If I click on the chip, if
Google Pay is installed,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.550
it will, of course,
open Google Pay.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.420
But if it's not installed,
we will open a web view.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.497
So how about we also demo it?

00:26:27.497 --> 00:26:29.080
JOSE UGIA: Yeah, and
also in the past,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.080
I've gotten this wrong a
few times, as you know.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.012
And so I just
checked in, but, hey,

00:26:33.012 --> 00:26:34.720
I would rather double
check and make sure

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.012
that my boarding pass is there.

00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:38.720
I don't want to find that
out when I'm at the airport.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.160
So let's go to my
iPhone this time.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.030
I'm going to show you
how to do this now

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.830
from the Assistant on my iPhone.

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.740
So I'm going to
open the Assistant.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.225
Show my flights.

00:26:51.225 --> 00:26:53.100
So I'm just going to
retrieve the same flight

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.320
that I checked in
for a second ago,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.183
and as you can see this
time, in the chips below,

00:26:58.183 --> 00:26:59.850
I don't see the check
in option anymore.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.650
That's good news, I'm
checked in already,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.630
but I can see the
boarding pass, right?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.930
So I can open right from there.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.550
And there you go, it will load
directly on this web view,

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.050
right?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.588
So similar experience,
now on my iOS device.

00:27:13.588 --> 00:27:14.880
So let's go back to the slides.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.450
And just take a
step back and recap,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.290
we have talked about
a number of features.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.840
We'd like to just summarize
them up looking at them from two

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.580
different points of view.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.500
First of all, what do
you get we integrate

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.390
the Google API for passes?

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.203
Well first of all, is you will
digitalize your pass, that

00:27:34.203 --> 00:27:36.120
is, your customers will
be able to have access

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.000
from their devices to their
boarding passes, loyalty

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.740
cards, and tickets.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.815
With that one click
access that you

00:27:42.815 --> 00:27:46.240
just saw a second ago on
the Assistant on my iPhone.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.020
You also get the ability
to update your passes.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.910
That is, that will
generate notifications

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:54.500
as well that will inform
your users what to do best,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.480
how to react, right?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.740
Especially when they're
in stressful situations.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.060
Finally, if you remember, we had
the high priority notifications

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.370
that will give me
access to my pass

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.610
right away from a notification
whenever I need it.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.250
From a different perspective
now, let's look at it

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.760
from what things can we add
to the API, what functionality

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.890
can we add to our
customers, as well, just

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.900
with very minimal effort.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.590
Well first one is, as you saw,
just by adding email markup

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.510
to your emails,
then Gmail will be

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.870
able to import automatically
those passes for your customers

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.180
into the Google Pay app.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.113
Second, you can allow
users to sign up directly

00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:36.280
from the Google Pay app,
so they don't have to leave

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.390
that application, right?

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.490
Which you know will
cause more friction.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.950
Finally, on integrating
cross product

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.600
within other parts of the
platform in Google or other

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.690
products, you just saw how
we integrated the myki card

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.640
on Google Maps right
where you need it.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.390
Or how you can check in with
the Assistant for your flights.

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.950
So this is what we had
in terms of new features.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.010
We also talked about the
momentum before, right?

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.960
In the last section
of this talk,

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.420
we'd like to talk about
some best practices.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.995
Tips and tricks that we have
learned through our experience

00:29:07.995 --> 00:29:10.120
developing the product and
talking to our partners,

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.110
so that you don't have to go
through that hassle again.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.160
We have two tips on the button.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.230
The button is that gateway
into digitalizing your pass

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.310
that we have seen already
a few times, right?

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.130
We strongly recommend you
to build a button that

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.850
goes directly to the pass.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.540
No intermediate screens, if
you can avoid extra latency,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.290
do that too, because that
will generate drop offs

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.970
and reduce your conversions.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.260
Second, you can put many passes
behind one single button.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.170
So for those use cases,
like multi-leg flights,

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.205
or bookings with many
tickets, like for example,

00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:44.830
when you go with your
family or friends

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.510
to the cinema or the theater.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.190
You can just put one
button behind that

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.310
and that will take care of
generating all those passes.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.240
Now from a UI UX
perspective, right, there

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.497
are two more tips that we'd
like to share with you.

00:29:57.497 --> 00:29:59.080
First is that, you
don't have to worry

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.497
about the designing
of the button,

00:30:00.497 --> 00:30:01.760
because we help you do that.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.810
We have JavaScript libraries
for the web, and graphic assets

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.210
for your mobile applications
that you can just

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.550
take them, import them,
and just have them,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.290
based on how your
application looks

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.750
like, you can choose between
the light and the dark themes,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.340
right?

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.910
The second is, make sure
you choose the context

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.540
that it's right for
your application.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.260
What we mean with that is,
that you want your users

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.660
to know that when
they click the button

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.510
they're going to digitalize the
pass and you're showing on top.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.030
This can be a matter of
colors, backgrounds, frames,

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.550
and shapes, but also
about bits of information

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:37.160
that you can see
in this example.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.470
MAILYS ROBIN: And
then, digital passes,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.610
so the power of digital passes
is that they are digital.

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.860
So they can be updated
in real time at any time.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.360
So compared to a paper, if
a user just gets new points,

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.580
you can reflect it
right away on the pass.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.610
If they got a new seat upgrade
in their plane or transit,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.200
that's something you can show.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.178
If they got a new airline
tier, you can change the color,

00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:01.970
you can make it look
different, so the user

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.700
feels like they
achieved something.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.690
And there's no need
to reprint any paper

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.120
or reissue any plastic
cards, it's just there.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.750
And also, I will
show you earlier,

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.153
any importance of dates will
also trigger notification.

00:31:15.153 --> 00:31:17.320
So that's why it's really
important that any updates

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.520
that you have, you can
just send them to the API

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.140
and we'll update the
object for the user.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.240
And finally, use
all the channels.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.210
So have you seen it
in the Eurostar demo,

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.300
or with Lufthansa who's using
a lot of saving channel, it's

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.300
important that the user
find the button where

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.625
they need to find it.

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:38.000
And that place
could be different

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.740
depending on where
they are in the flow,

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.198
for like the purchase
and the save.

00:31:41.198 --> 00:31:44.470
So it could be in the
website, could be in your app,

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.885
in the email, or an SMS.

00:31:45.885 --> 00:31:48.260
So it's important that they
can find the button anywhere,

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.800
so once they're ready to
save it, they can find it.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.800
So you increase your CTA.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.050
So this is an example, also,
for even tickets, where

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.270
you can put the
button in the tickets,

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.844
but also after the
purchase confirmation.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.510
JOSE UGIA: Finally,
to wrap it up,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.010
we'd like to leave you
with three call to actions.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.020
We said before
that we wanted this

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.500
to be an actionable session.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.200
So based on maybe how
you feel right now,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.220
we hope we have three
really good links for you.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.340
We hope we are on target.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.380
First of all, if what
you heard makes sense,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.320
this sounds good to you,
you want to find out more,

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.840
you want to check out
documentation, reference

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.280
API, see more tips and tricks
maybe, just use the first link.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.130
Go to g.co/pay/passes to see
more of what we have told you

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.390
already.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.830
If, otherwise,
you're ready to go,

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.940
maybe you're good to implement
the API and digitalize some

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.010
tickets, passes,
and loyalty cards,

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.790
well then use the second
one g.co/pay/passes-sign-up

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.700
to create a merchant account
and start calling the APIs right

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.010
away.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.040
Third, if you would like to hear
more about us, more use cases,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.560
maybe more tips and tricks,
maybe more information about

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.320
our partners, just use the
third link, g.co/pay/stay-tuned.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.880
And speaking of
staying tuned, we

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.150
would like to let you
know more about an event

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.960
that we'll be running later this
year in September in London.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.790
Which is going to be
exclusively about Google Pay,

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.100
it's called the Google
Pay Developers Live.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.790
So if you want to see more
use cases, case studies,

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.040
want to see more best
practices, you want to hear from

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.970
our partners directly, make
sure you check out that link

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.250
in there and we'll get
back in touch with you,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.760
g.co/pay/live2019.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.550
Finally, we hope we
added value to you today.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.590
If you have questions or issues,
we'd love to hear from you.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.830
We're just across the
boardwalk, we're in Dome A

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.910
together with the web team.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.110
We have a team of
people there who

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.150
will be willing to really hear
your stories, your issues,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.220
and see if they can help you.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.740
For those of you joining
us from the Livestream,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.560
or for all of those people from
the future who are watching us

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.500
from YouTube, use
that link in there

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.900
to get started with the
Google Pay API for passes

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.510
