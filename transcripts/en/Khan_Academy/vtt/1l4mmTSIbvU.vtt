00:00:00.258 --> 00:00:02.217
- [Instructor] What we're gonna do

00:00:02.217 --> 00:00:04.262
in this video is look at
the work of other people

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:06.034
as they try to take derivatives

00:00:06.034 --> 00:00:07.862
and see if their reasoning is correct

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:09.165
and if it's not correct,

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.376
try to identify what they should have done

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:13.764
or where their reasoning went wrong.

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:15.716
So over here it says Nate tried to find

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.824
the derivative of X squared plus five X

00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:20.706
times sine of X.

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.152
Here is his work.

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:23.858
Is Nate's work correct?

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.365
If not, what's his mistake?

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:28.723
So pause the video and see
if you can answer this.

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.438
Is Nate's work correct,

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:33.021
and if not, what's his mistake?

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.965
All right so I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.387
So let's work though this step by step.

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:41.542
So over here he's just trying to apply

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.826
the derivative operator to the expression.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.509
Which is exactly what he needed to do.

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.443
He's trying to find the
derivative of this thing,

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:51.405
and he says okay this is a
product of two expressions,

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:54.566
and then he says okay,
well this is gonna be

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.300
the same thing as the derivative

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.922
or this is the same thing as
the product of the derivatives.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:02.485
Now this is a problem.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.568
You are probably familiar,

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:07.191
if I take the derivative
of the sum of two things.

00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:10.454
So the derivative with
respect to X of F of X

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:11.454
plus G of X,

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:16.370
that indeed is equal to
the derivative of the first

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.153
F prime of X plus the
derivative of the second,

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:23.798
but that is not true if we
are dealing with the product

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:25.196
of functions.

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:29.363
The derivative with respect
to X of F of X, G of X

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.776
is not necessarily,

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:36.098
maybe there's some very
special circumstance,

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:38.256
but in general it's not going to be

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.785
just the product of the derivative.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:45.209
It's not going to be just
F prime of X, G prime of X.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.229
Here we would want to
apply the product rule.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.026
This is going to be equal to,

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:52.597
this is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:55.791
of the first function
times the second function,

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.091
plus the derivative, or
let me write it this way.

00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:00.400
Plus the first function,
not taking its derivative,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.135
times the derivative
of the second function.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.374
So he should have applied
the product rule here,

00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:07.743
and so let's do that

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:10.344
just to see what his
answer should have been.

00:02:10.344 --> 00:02:11.873
So what he should have done here,

00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.674
I'll get my correcting red pen out here.

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:16.661
Say no that's not what
he should have done.

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:19.412
He says let's take the
derivative of this first thing.

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.749
So actually let me color code it.

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.511
So the derivative of
this is two X plus five.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.678
So it should have been two X plus five

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:32.085
times the second thing.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.668
So times sine of X.

00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:37.802
Times, we do it in another color.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.132
Time the sine of X,

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.406
and then to that he would
add the first thing,

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:49.906
which is X squared plus five X

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.729
times the derivative of the second thing.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.218
So the derivative of
sine of X is cosine of X.

00:02:58.218 --> 00:03:00.787
So this is what we should have been seeing

00:03:00.787 --> 00:03:02.522
at this step right over here.

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:05.103
He shouldn't have just taken the product

00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:06.352
of the derivatives.

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:07.963
He should have applied the product rule.

00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:09.232
So his work is not correct,

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:11.281
and his mistake is that he
didn't apply the product rule.

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:13.886
He just assumed that the
derivative of the products

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:16.749
is the same thing as the
product of the derivatives.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.666
Let's do more examples.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.079
Okay so let's see.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.435
It says Katy tried to find the derivative

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.522
of two X squared minus four.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:30.052
All of that to the third power.

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:31.133
Here's her work.

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.578
Is Katy's work correct?

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.512
If not, what is her mistake?

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:36.237
So once again, pause the video.

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:37.999
See if you can figure it out.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.818
All right now let's inspect Katy's work.

00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:44.159
So she's taking the derivative
of this and let's see,

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.815
over here it looks like she's taking

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:48.284
the derivative of the entire expression

00:03:48.284 --> 00:03:51.284
with respect to the inner expression

00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:56.933
and that is close to applying
the chain rule properly

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:59.578
but it's not applying
the chain rule properly.

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:01.036
So her work is not correct,

00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:03.080
and her mistake is she's not correctly

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.438
applying the chain rule.

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:06.362
Just as a review, the
chain rule says look,

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:08.736
if we're trying tot ake the
derivative with respect to X

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:09.986
of F of G of X,

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:15.258
F of G of X,

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.691
that this is going to be equal to,

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.918
this is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:23.064
of the whole thing with respect to G of X.

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:26.647
So I could write that
as F prime of G of X.

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:33.022
F prime of G of X times the
derivative of the inner function

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.241
with respect to X.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.959
Times G prime of X.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.042
So over here,

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.993
we could view our F function as a thing

00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:45.064
that takes its input and
takes it to the third power,

00:04:45.064 --> 00:04:49.038
and so this right over
here is F prime of G of X.

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:52.388
So this thing is the F prime of G of X

00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:54.688
but she forgot to multiply
it by the derivative

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:57.223
of the inner function with respect to X.

00:04:57.223 --> 00:05:00.887
So she forgot to multiply
this times the derivative

00:05:00.887 --> 00:05:05.483
of two X squared minus
four with respect to X.

00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:07.088
Which is gonna be, let's see,

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:08.840
the derivative of two X squared,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.767
power rule two times two is four,

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.244
so it's gonna be four X to the first,

00:05:13.244 --> 00:05:15.960
and then the derivative of
negative four is just a zero.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.463
So it's just gonna be times four X.

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.071
So that's what she needed
to do in order for it

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.279
to be correct.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.992
So she had to have this times four X here.

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:26.614
Times four X.

00:05:26.614 --> 00:05:27.662
So not correct.

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:31.162
She didn't correctly apply the chain rule.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:35.399
So let's do another one of these.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.118
So here,

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:41.639
it says Njoman tried to
find the derivative of sine

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.804
of seven X squared plus four X.

00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:45.040
Here's his work.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.335
Is Njoman's work correct?

00:05:46.335 --> 00:05:47.606
If not, what is his mistake?

00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:50.027
Pause the video, see if
you can figure it out.

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:54.616
All right, so it's a derivative
of sine of this expression.

00:05:54.616 --> 00:05:56.497
So you'd wanna use the chain rule.

00:05:56.497 --> 00:05:58.149
In fact, using the chain
rule you wanna find

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.785
the derivative of the outside function

00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:01.223
with respect to the inside.

00:06:01.223 --> 00:06:03.356
So the derivative of sine of something

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:05.031
with respect to that something

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.657
is gonna be cosine of that something.

00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:09.195
So that's right,

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:11.724
and then you wanna multiply that

00:06:11.724 --> 00:06:15.137
times the derivative of the
inside with respect to X.

00:06:15.137 --> 00:06:17.937
So the derivative of
seven X squared is 14 X.

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:19.969
The derivative of four X is four.

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.380
So this is actually, that step looks good.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.632
But then Njoman does
something strange over here.

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:28.627
This is the cosine of seven
X squared plus four X.

00:06:28.627 --> 00:06:31.320
Then that whole thing
times 14 X plus four,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.540
but they get confused where just looking

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.945
at these parentheses and this
tends to happen sometimes.

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:38.888
This is actually one of the key errors

00:06:38.888 --> 00:06:40.713
that the folks at the college board,

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:42.592
AP folks told us about.

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:44.629
Is that when dealing with
these transcendental functions

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.244
cosine, sine, tangent,

00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:48.014
natural log that are written like this

00:06:48.014 --> 00:06:49.474
and people see the parentheses

00:06:49.474 --> 00:06:51.007
and see another parentheses,

00:06:51.007 --> 00:06:52.947
their brain just says oh let me multiply

00:06:52.947 --> 00:06:54.686
these two expressions in parentheses,

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:55.981
but that's not right,

00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:57.736
because if we were to add parentheses

00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:59.146
this is what this is implying.

00:06:59.146 --> 00:07:01.049
So you can't just take the 14 X plus four

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:02.476
and multiply it by this,

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:05.102
and assuming you're taking
the cosine of the whole thing.

00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:07.656
So this is where Njoman makes the mistake.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:08.999
The work is not correct,

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.335
and the mistake is trying to multiply

00:07:11.335 --> 00:07:13.897
these two expressions
and taking the cosine

00:07:13.897 --> 00:07:15.174
of the whole thing.

00:07:15.174 --> 00:07:16.724
Let's do one more of these.

00:07:16.724 --> 00:07:18.773
I find these strangely fun.

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:20.694
All right this one is involved.

00:07:20.694 --> 00:07:22.535
Tom tried to find the derivative of

00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:24.404
the square root of X over X to the fourth.

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:25.576
Here is his work.

00:07:25.576 --> 00:07:27.016
Is Tom's work correct?

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.493
If not, what's his mistake?

00:07:28.493 --> 00:07:31.144
Pause the video and see if
you can figure that out.

00:07:31.144 --> 00:07:34.098
So it looks like he's trying
to apply the quotient rule.

00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:36.771
So applying the quotient rule, you would,

00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:40.525
in the numerator you
would take the derivative

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:44.527
of the first expression
times the second expression

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:47.156
and then minus the first expression

00:07:47.156 --> 00:07:49.321
times the derivative of
the second expression

00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:50.422
all of that over,

00:07:50.422 --> 00:07:53.614
or I should say the derivative
of the numerator expression

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.334
times the denominator expression,

00:07:56.334 --> 00:08:00.804
minus the numerator expression
times the derivative

00:08:00.804 --> 00:08:02.303
of the denominator expression,

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:04.332
all of that over the
denominator expression squared.

00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:05.845
So this looks correct actually.

00:08:05.845 --> 00:08:08.232
It's a correct application
of the the quotient rule.

00:08:08.232 --> 00:08:10.989
It looks like Tom is
correctly simplifying.

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:13.085
So the derivative of X to the one half

00:08:13.085 --> 00:08:15.258
is one half X to the negative one half.

00:08:15.258 --> 00:08:16.614
So that looks right.

00:08:16.614 --> 00:08:19.610
Derivative of X to the fourth
is four X to the third.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.798
So that looks right.

00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:22.703
All of this looks algebraically right,

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:24.766
and let's see, when you simplify this.

00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:27.813
So let's see, X to the negative one half

00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:30.896
times X to the fourth is indeed X to,

00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:35.598
well that's going to be X to the.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.152
Oh this correlates.

00:08:37.152 --> 00:08:39.842
So this simplifies to that.

00:08:39.842 --> 00:08:44.147
Which looks correct, and
that simplifies to that.

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:46.184
Which looks correct.

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:48.249
We're just using exponent
properties there,

00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:50.749
and then divide everything by,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.705
let's see, oh there, everything
is terms of X to 3.5.

00:08:54.705 --> 00:08:58.455
So we're going to have
negative 3.5 X to 3.5,

00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:02.938
and then you use exploder problems.

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:05.250
So actually it looks like
he did everything correctly.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.815
This is the right answer.

00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:08.572
So his work is correct.

00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:10.375
He did not make any mistakes.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.379
But I do have a bone to pick.

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:13.695
So speak with Tom,

00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:16.153
because he didn't have to
apply the quotient rule here.

00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:18.172
He did all of this hairy calculus

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:20.429
and algebra but it could have been

00:09:20.429 --> 00:09:21.904
a very simple simplification

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:23.359
he could have made up here,

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:24.947
and this is a key thing to realize.

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:26.116
He could have said hey,

00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:27.868
you know what, this is the same thing.

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:31.496
It's the derivative with respect to X of

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.367
X to the one half.

00:09:33.367 --> 00:09:35.189
That's what the square root of X is.

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:38.203
Times X to the negative four power.

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:41.383
That's what one over X to the fourth is.

00:09:41.383 --> 00:09:43.698
And so let me color code it.

00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:46.369
So that is the same thing as that,

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:49.983
and that is the same thing as that,

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:51.940
and you wouldn't even have
to use the product rule here.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.801
You could simplify this even further.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:55.345
This is the same thing

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:58.262
as the derivative with respect to X

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:02.583
of just, we have the same base.

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:04.367
We can add the (mumbles) products.

00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:08.534
It's gonna be X to the negative
3., X to the negative 3.5,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.791
and so you can just use the power rule.

00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:14.281
So this is going to be equal to,

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.089
bring the negative 3.5 out front.

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:18.510
Negative 3.5 X to the,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.402
and then we just
decrement this one by one.

00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:21.692
We subtract one from that.

00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:23.915
Negative 4.5 power.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:25.084
So as you can see.

00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:26.527
He could have gotten this answer

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:29.142
much much much much much much quicker,

00:10:29.142 --> 00:10:30.633
but he didn't make any mistakes.

00:10:30.633 --> 00:10:32.404
There's a little bit of a judgment error

00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:35.560
just immediately going
forth with the quotient rule

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.871
which gets quite hairy quite fast.
