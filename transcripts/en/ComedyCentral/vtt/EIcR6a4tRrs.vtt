00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.337
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:12.879
- My ex boyfriend and I,

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.880
the breakup itself
probably took longer

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.083 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
than the actual
relationship lasted.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.083
At one point, he was like,

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.285
"I need a little bit of space,"

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.119 line:0%
and I was like,

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.087 line:0%
"You got it, babe."

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.388
And instead of doing that,

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.591
I immediately sent him
the most heinous email

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.926 align:start size:88% position:13%
that I have ever written
in my entire life.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.761
I chose to write it
while it was raining,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.564
so that I could look outside
at the rain while I cried.

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.633 align:start size:94% position:6%
Here are a few highlights
from that email.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.303
(classical music)

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.771 align:start size:88% position:13%
"If I ever made you
feel like you were less

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start size:97% position:3%
"than the most important
thing in my life, I'm sorry.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.142
"And in a month, when we
meet up in Union Square,

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I hope you will
hold me in your arms

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start size:97% position:3%
"and we can go back to being
what we were meant to be.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Do you remember the night
you said you would die for me?

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.450
"I don't want you to do that.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.453
"I just want you to love me."

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.621
Oh my god, why?

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.257
(exhales)

00:00:57.257 --> 00:01:01.460
And I ended it with a quote
from a Garth Brooks song,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.131 align:start size:97% position:3%
even though neither of us
listen to Garth Brooks' music.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.465
I went nuts.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was this really long,
super intense email.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.972
He responded to it like
three or four days later,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.473
and literally just said,

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.175 line:0%
"Thank you."

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.344
That bitch just said
thank you, that's it.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.445
Thank you?

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.646
Double f*** yous.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.815 align:start size:81% position:19%
It was the most
embarrassing thing

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.984
that I have ever done.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.352
The only good thing
that came out of that

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.187
is when he sent
me back the email

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.789
that said thank you,

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was immediately
over that little turd.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:33.659 line:0%
Pro tip,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.861 line:0%
if he asks for space,

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.697
maybe don't be crazy.
