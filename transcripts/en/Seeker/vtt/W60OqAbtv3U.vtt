00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.550
We know there tend to be supermassive black
holes at the center of galaxies, but the nuances

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.910
of galactic evolution are still a mystery.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.769
Now two discoveries may shedding light on
these dark places and the galaxies that form

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:12.830
around them.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.690
In a cloud of molecular gas near the center
of the Milky Way -- so in our own neighbourhood

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.840
-- astronomers have found a giant black hole
100,000 times the mass of the Sun.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.390
It’s the second largest supermassive black
hole in our galaxy and the best evidence of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
a class of 'intermediate-mass' black holes.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.590
Astronomers have been looking for these because
they might be the key to understanding how

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.480
supermassive black holes can get so big.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.410
We know that supermassive black holes formed
early in the Universe’s lifetime, we just

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.980
don’t totally know how.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
But one theory says that intermediate-mass
black holes might act as seeds for their supermassive

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
cousins.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.970
Larger, more gravitationally-dominant galaxies
could cannibalize smaller ones that cross

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.800
their paths, the larger black hole at the
center pulling the material of the smaller

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.489
one into itself.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.640
That means, mid-sized black holes could have
combined to form supermassive structures...right?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.940
The thing is, we also recently found the furthest
supermassive black hole, which means it’s

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.940
super old.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.660
With a mass 800 million times greater than
our Sun, it’s enormous.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.160
And did I mention, it’s old?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.760
It grew far larger than expected in the 690
million years after the Big Bang... (which

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.210
is the blink of an eye considering the Universe
is more than 13 billion years old).

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
This relic from the earliest days of the universe
is ALSO devouring all the material near it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.440
meaning it’s a quasar, another indication
it formed early in the Universe’s life.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.460
This black hole is proving to be a window
into a transitional period for the Universe,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.140
but it’s also throwing a bit of a wrench
into how we understand black holes’ formation.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.700
Nothing astronomers have measured can explain
how a supermassive black hole got this big

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.250
so long ago.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.180
Something had to have facilitated such rapid
growth, they just don’t know what that SOMETHING

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.290
is yet.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.490
It could be that intermediate black holes
hold an answer.But for the moment that remains

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.840
a theory.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.810
Astronomers will need more observations and
more data to solidify any link between smaller

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.850
black holes and the supermassive ones that
dominate galaxies; not to mention explain

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.580
how massive black holes could form so early
in the Universe’s life.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500
Nevertheless, these discoveries are taking
us one step closer to answering the big question

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.750
of how galaxies evolve.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.470

The weirdest thing about black holes is that
we, of course, can’t see them.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.790
Astronomers infer their existence from the
material around them.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.290
So cool!
