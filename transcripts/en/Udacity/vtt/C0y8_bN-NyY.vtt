Hi, I'm Geoff Donaker. I live here in the Bay Area,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.930
California Bay Area, and I have red and green color blindness.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, so red green color blindness. We you know, just

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.250
sort of heard about that for the first time in the course, and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.530
we're learning a bit more about the inheritance patterns. What is

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.890
red green colorblindness? What does it mean to be red green colorblind?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.180
&gt;&gt; Well, to me, what it means is that I often mix

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.030
up colors that have red in them. And so, in particular I

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.790
mix up reds and browns and sometimes browns and greens because I'm not

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.729
seeing the red correctly in those. Sometimes it can even show up in the

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.060
form of blues and purples. I'm sort of seeing them all as about

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.600
the same and in fact, you know, they may look different to other people.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.090
&gt;&gt; When did you first know that you had red-green colorblindness?

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.040
Yeah, I don't really remember. It was when I was really

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.760
young child. my uncle had been red-green color blind, and then

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.360
actually my mom's uncle as well. So I think I inherited

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.490
it from her side. And so when I was a little kid she recognized

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.810
that I might be color blind or had this propensity. And so she had

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.620
me tested at, you know, one of the eye doctors, with looking at those

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.450
little bubble charts with colors that you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.099
may remember having taken at some point.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.560
&gt;&gt; So you were very young when your, I guess, your mother found this out.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.170
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.010
&gt;&gt; And did it I mean, was it a, did it cause any

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.640
issue? I mean, was it like, okay, we knew this was a possibility and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.670
now, what kind of, if anything, was there to do at that point?

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.332
&gt;&gt; Not really much. you know, as I say, her

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:27.420
brother and uncle had had it, and so she was

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.900
sort of aware of it. And, you know, it's useful

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.470
to know that you see the world in different colors than

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.746
everybody else just so you can be prepared. and, you

00:01:35.746 --> 00:01:38.068
know, obviously that's something that I just am aware of today

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:40.026
too. So that I I don't say, you know, this

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:42.729
is definitely purple to other people if they, if I realize,

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.270
I go oh, it might actually be blue, and you know others are saying it's blue.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.430
&gt;&gt; How do people respond to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.702
this particular trait of red-green color blindness?

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:56.820
&gt;&gt; I'd say that you know probably about half of people that I interact

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.000
with already know somebody closely who is red-green color blind, so it's no news

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.884
to them. And they'll just say, oh yeah, my brother is also, or something

00:02:03.884 --> 00:02:07.620
of that nature. And then the other half, it's a like a great party trick.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.690
So the first time they hear that you're red-green color

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.040
blind, what they want to do is walk around the room going

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.370
What color's this? What color's this? What color's this? What color's?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.205
You know, which is fun for about 30 seconds or so.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:17.520
[LAUGH]

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.990
Then you're kind of ready to move on.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.020
But that's been my general experience over the years.
