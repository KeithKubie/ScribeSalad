00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:07.831
There are a lot of ways

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:09.379
this marvelous language of ours,

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:11.139
English, doesn't make sense.

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:12.782
For example, most of the time

00:00:12.806 --> 00:00:14.997
when we talk about more
than one of something,

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:16.639
we put an S on the end.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:18.829
One cat, two cats.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:20.711
But then, there's that handful of words

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:22.346
where things work differently.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.551
Alone you have a man;

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.036
if he has company, then you've got men,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.304
or probably better for him, women too.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.233
Although if there were only one of them,

00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:31.921
it would be a woman.

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.824
Or if there's more than one goose,

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:35.066
they're geese,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.531
but why not lots of mooses, meese?

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:39.235
Or if you have two feet,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:41.405
then why don't you read two beek

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.488
instead of books.

00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:45.655
The fact is that if you
were speaking English

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.632
before about a thousand years ago,

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.638
beek is exactly what you would have said

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.507
for more than one book.

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.427
If Modern English is strange,

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:55.262
Old English needed therapy.

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.330
Believe it or not,

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.522
English used to be an even harder language

00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:01.024
to learn than it is today.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:02.796
Twenty-five hundred years ago,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.328
English and German were the same language.

00:01:05.352 --> 00:01:06.758
They drifted apart slowly,

00:01:06.782 --> 00:01:10.091
little by little becoming
more and more different.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:11.687
That meant that in early English,

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:12.721
just like in German,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.796
inanimate objects had gender.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.182
A fork, gafol, was a woman;

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:19.166
a spoon, laefel, was a man;

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.019
and the table they were on, bord,

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.762
was neither, also called neuter.

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:24.814
Go figure!

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:26.305
Being able to use words

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.054
meant not just knowing their meaning

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.906
but what gender they were, too.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.991
And while today there
are only about a dozen plurals

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:34.059
that don't make sense,

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:34.745
like men

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:35.546
and geese,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.554
in Old English, it was perfectly normal

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.126
for countless plurals to be like that.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.997
You think it's odd that more
than one goose is geese?

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.844
Well, imagine if more than one goat

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:46.465
was a bunch of gat,

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.175
or if more than one oak tree

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.259
was a field of ack.

00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:52.093
To be able to talk about any of these,

00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:54.826
you just had to know the exact
word for their plural

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.799
rather than just adding
the handy S on the end.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.237
And it wasn't always
an S at the end either.

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.353
In merry Old English,

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.235
they could add other sounds to the end.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.702
Just like more than one child is children,

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.427
more than one lamb was lambru,

00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:11.594
you fried up your eggru,

00:02:11.618 --> 00:02:13.285
and people talked not about breads,

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.046
but breadru.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.060
Sometimes it was like sheep is today -

00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:19.717
where, to make a plural,
you don't do anything.

00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.593
One sheep,

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:21.718
two sheep.

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:22.805
In Old English, one house,

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.588
two house.

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:28.680
And just like today, we have
oxen instead of oxes.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:32.175
Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues,

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.110
namen instead of names,

00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.111
and if things stayed the way they were,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:40.075
today we would have eyen instead of eyes.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.374
So, why didn't things
stay the way they were?

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:44.043
In a word, Vikings.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:46.630
In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.514
started taking over much of England.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:49.542
They didn't speak English,

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:50.961
they spoke Norse.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:52.224
Plus, they were grown-ups,

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:53.596
and grown-ups aren't as good

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.733
at learning languages as children.

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:58.081
After the age of roughly 15,

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:00.296
it's almost impossible
to learn a new language

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.151
without an accent

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.203
and without slipping up here and there

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:06.685
as we all know from what language
classes are like.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.403
The Vikings were no different,

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.259
so they had a way of smoothing away

00:03:10.283 --> 00:03:12.605
the harder parts of how English worked.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.012
Part of that was those crazy plurals.

00:03:15.036 --> 00:03:16.798
Imagine running up against a language

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:17.532
with eggru

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:18.147
and gat

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:19.228
on the one hand,

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:20.396
and then with other words,

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.801
all you have to do is add 's'

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:22.398
and get days

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:23.736
and stones.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.864
Wouldn't it make things easier

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:27.257
to just use the 's' for everything?

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.034
That's how the Vikings felt too.

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:30.148
And there were so many of them,

00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:32.363
and they married so
many of the English women,

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:34.544
that pretty soon, if you
grew up in England,

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:38.184
you heard streamlined English
as much as the real kind.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:41.003
After a while nobody remembered
the real kind any more.

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:43.679
Nobody remembered that once you said doora

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:44.847
instead of doors

00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:47.009
and handa instead of hands.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.840
Plurals made a lot more sense now,

00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:50.993
except for a few hold-outs like children

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:51.925
and teeth

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.015
that get used so much

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.370
that it was hard to break the habit.

00:03:55.394 --> 00:03:56.276
The lesson is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.062
that English makes a lot
more sense than you think.

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.612
Thank the ancestors of people

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.449
in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:05.482
that today we don't ask
for a handful of pea-night

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:07.144
instead of peanuts.

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:08.873
Although, wouldn't it be fun,

00:04:08.897 --> 00:04:09.915
if for just a week or two,

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.277
we could?
