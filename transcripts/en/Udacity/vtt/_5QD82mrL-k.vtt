00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.106
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I second that. Thank you very A and L Creations, this is a wonderful addition

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:06.916
to the event. So now it's time to move into our chemical senses.

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:09.489
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wait. Andy, should I be worried? Should I be, are things going to be blowing

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:10.465
up? What's going on?

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:13.552
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Lauren, before you run to get your hazmat suit, the chemical senses are just

00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:17.960
senses that are based on the reception of chemicals. So for example, your sense

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.852
of smell or your sense of taste.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.614
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh. So, with smell, the tiny particles that go up your nose and that are

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.915
detected by your smell receptors?

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:30.430
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And something pretty similar for taste, actually. let's actually go to

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.081
Susan, who is, yep, sounds like she's on location at the taste-off now.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:39.762
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, Andy. Although the taste-off will focus on our senseletes' ability

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:44.129
to activate their 10,000 tastebuds. The person who's going to excel in this

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.555
competition is the one who also activates their smell receptors.

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:51.331
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's truly amazing how our perception of taste actually depends on the

00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.045
sensation of taste and smell.

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:58.820
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It really is. How is it possible that these two seemingly different senses are

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.015
so intimately related?

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:04.039
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well Andy, that's because both taste and smell are processed up here, in the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.837
frontal lobes of our brain. For the taste-off the contestants are going to have

00:01:08.837 --> 00:01:14.266
to identify samples that contain each of the five basic flavors. These are

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:19.863
sweet, salty, sour, savory and bitter. To do this we'll be using the following

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:25.472
ingredients. Sugar, salt, lemon, MSG, and tonic water.

00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:31.703
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And Susan, which ingredient is going to correspond to which flavor?
