at full power can drain a battery in

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.150
a matter of hours, it's critical to understand

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.915
that intermittent network access can be just as bad.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:12.750
AT&amp;T has a great free tool you can

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.260
use to analyze your network use, the Application Resource

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.410
Optimizer. This tool can help you visualize the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.610
state transitions your application causes in the radio stack.
