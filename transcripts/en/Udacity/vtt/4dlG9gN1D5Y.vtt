00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A lot of people were having questions about YAML files.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
People had problems getting the YAML files configured correctly.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Could you go on to what exactly that is and what you need in it?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sure. To the extent that I can. I, like you, am also a little bit new to Goggle App Engine.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A YAML file is just this configuration file that App Engine uses.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It defines what the main file of your app is going to be.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Like what file is going to load first Python. What libraries need to be loaded.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
App Engine runs in this kind of sandbox situation. That might not be the right word.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But basically libraries that you have installed on your system aren't necessarily accessible,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and libraries that ship with App Engine aren't necessarily accessible in App Engine

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
unless you tell the YAML file, "Hey I want to use this library."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This helps Google, presumably, deploy your code properly when they deploy it on their machines.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So it's not a difficult piece of technology.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Basically, if you don't know, I would ask in the forums.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I've been doing a lot of googling myself to get my YAML file in order.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That's sort of the nature of the business.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Try to stay out of these configuration files as much as you can.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When we make my cut available, I'll include the YAML file that I've been using

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is very simple.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I just based it on the "hello, world!" examples from the App Engine website. Okay.
