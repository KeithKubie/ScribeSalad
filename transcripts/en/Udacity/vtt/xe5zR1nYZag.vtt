00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.830
Well, this is an obvious one, isn't it? The first

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.040
thing to look for is the size of the area

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.820
we have to paint. In this case, both divs are

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.410
100 by 100 pixels. Now, let's look at what we're

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.250
painting. The second div is just a square filled with

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.550
white pixels. Now compare this to the first div. Here

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.340
we have a transparent background and we also need to

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.480
render an inset shadow. As a result, the second div is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.060
definitely cheaper and faster to paint.
