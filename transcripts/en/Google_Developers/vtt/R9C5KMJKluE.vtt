Have you ever wanted to give your app

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:12.535
a fancy animated header
that changes appearance as you scroll

00:00:12.535 --> 00:00:14.289
or maybe even disappears?

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:16.562
You can with <i>SliverAppBar</i>!

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:19.926
<i>SliverAppBar</i> is used with <i>CustomScrollView</i>

00:00:19.927 --> 00:00:22.992
to provide custom scroll behavior
for the app bar.

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.633
The word "sliver" may give you the shivers,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.244
but it's really just a funny word
for a portion of a scrollable area.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.989
You can think of slivers
as a lower level interface

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.675
providing finer grain control
on implementing scrollable areas.

00:00:36.678 --> 00:00:37.975
The <i>flexibleSpace</i> parameter

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.973
goes hand in hand
with the <i>expandedHeight</i> parameter.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:44.223
You can set both for a different height
and appearance of your app bar

00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:46.743
when it is expanded to its full size.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.422
Set the <i>floating</i> parameter to <i>true</i>

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:50.800
to make the app bar reappear
when you scroll down,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.094
even if you haven't reached
the top of the list.
