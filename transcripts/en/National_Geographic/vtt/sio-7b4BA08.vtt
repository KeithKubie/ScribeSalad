00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.302
I was seeing six blue whales

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:05.405
in an area the size
of a soccer pitch.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:08.040
I've gone on to name them
the "unorthodox whales,"

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start position:0%
because they actually break 
the stereotypes

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.844 size:75% position:38%
we had for this species.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.682
it has sent me on an
incredible adventure.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.952 line:0%
(audience clapping)

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.553 line:0%
It was back in 2003.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.388
I was working on a
whale research vessel

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.424 align:start size:94% position:6%
that was circumnavigating
the globe.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.692
On this particular
day of significance,

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was standing up on
deck, straining my eyes,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.063
looking out for this
pod of sperm whales

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:33.099
that we'd tracked
all night long.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.401 line:0%
I could hear their
sounds eminating from

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.772 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
the pilot house below me,
but I just couldn't see them.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
I knew what I was
looking for, this short

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.877
lofty blow slanted off
to the left hand side,

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
super characteristic
of sperm whale.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.014
I searched and I
looked for hours

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.684
on end and I couldn't find them.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:56.322 align:start size:84% position:16%
But then I saw this,
a tall, powerful,

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.625
vertical blow that
rose all the way

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.694
to the sky as far
as I could tell.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:03.296
This animal was at
least two kilometers

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
away from us, but it
was an incredible sight,

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I knew it could
only come from

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.037 align:start size:97% position:3%
an animal that was incredibly
large and powerful.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:14.807
So I got super excited,
as you would as well,

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.075
and I grabbed my walkie-talkie

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.576
and I called down to my captain.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:19.311
I said, "Bob, Bob, 11 o'clock,

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
two kilometers, go go
go," and he says, "Why?"

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.018
And I said, "I think
it's a blue whale,"

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.251
and he says, "Sure."

00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.820
Get's off course, starts
cruising the direction

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.024
that I've now sent him
off in, and I am now,

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:35.028 align:start size:97% position:3%
like so afraid and paranoid
to lose this visual.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:38.264
My eyes are streaming as
I stare into the glare.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:41.034 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm trying so hard
to just focus,

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:45.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that's when I think I've
started to lose my mind.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.140
(audience laughing)

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.109
Because it wasn't just one
blue whale I was seeing.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.078
I was seeing six blue whales in

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.546
an area the size
of a soccer pitch.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.750
I'm thinking to myself, why
on earth would an animal,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.885
the largest that has
ever roamed the planet,

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.288 align:start size:94% position:6%
with the freedom to
travel 70% of our planet,

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:04.823
choose to just aggregate in this

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:08.328
tiny little spot in a
warm tropical ocean?

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.631
So, I was fresh out of
undergrad, and I started

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.101
to think about what
I'd been taught.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:16.269
Thought about my
textbooks and what

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.505 align:start size:88% position:13%
my professors had
said, and I remembered,

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:22.275 align:start size:84% position:16%
large whales like
blue whales undertake

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.279 align:start size:94% position:6%
long-range migrations
between cold feeding areas

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:30.550
and warm breeding
and calving areas.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.720
That was it.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.088
I was super stoked.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.589
(audience laughing)

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.157 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was going to be the
first person on the planet

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.693
to document blue
whales having sex.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.395
(audience laughing)

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.396 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I, you know, I
thought, this is awesome,

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:46.432
my career is made,
fame and fortune.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:49.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
What do people complain
about, this is so easy, gosh.

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.103
(audience laughing)

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.838 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I'm there egging
the captain on.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.206
I'm like, "Bob, we have to go.

00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:56.475
"This is going to
be incredible!"

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.343 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, we're moving
forward, getting there,

00:02:58.343 --> 00:03:01.714
we're moving as fast as
this boat can take us,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:06.552
and we get there, and it is
not what you think it is.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.688
There's not a single
whale penis in sight.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.889
(audience laughing)

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.491 align:start size:88% position:13%
I am super disappointed,
because these whales

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:14.560
are now lolling at the
surface, hanging out,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.230
occasionally one will
dive, come back up,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.301
and I'm like, what
the heck is going on?

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.769
My dreams that I
had created for the

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.506 align:start size:97% position:3%
last two kilometers of my life
were completely shattered.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.507
(audience laughing)

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:30.042
And I was like, oh my god, what

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.911
am I going to do with my life?

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.246
But I insisted that
we stayed around

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.649
and watched for
a little, 'cause,

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.386 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know, this was my
first blue whale, or six.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.621
And that's when I saw this.

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:46.693
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is a pile of blue whale poop.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:47.659
(audience laughing)

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.328
What's most exciting about this

00:03:49.328 --> 00:03:51.697 align:start size:84% position:16%
is not just the
stunning red color,

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:54.801
but the fact that there
was poo, which meant

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.603 align:start size:88% position:13%
these animals were
feeding somewhere close.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:59.638 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now remember what I
told you at the start.

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:01.373
Blue whales undertake long range

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:04.444
migrations between
cold feeding areas

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:08.781
and warm breeding
and calving areas.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
Sri Lanka is five degrees
above the equator,

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:14.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
as warm and as
tropical as it can get.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:18.357 align:start size:84% position:16%
What the heck?
(audience laughing)

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:20.593
How the hell were they
feeding in these waters?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:24.430 align:start position:0%
They're considered unproductive
because they're warm.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.599
This was my eureka moment.

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:29.869
Not everyone can say that their

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.604
careers started with
a pile of (bleep).

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.973
(audience laughing)

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.641
But I'm pretty pleased
to be able to do that.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:36.909
(audience laughing)

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.045 align:start size:81% position:19%
The thing is, this
moment spiraled

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.013
into me pioneering
blue whale research

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:42.414
in the Northern Indian Ocean.

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:44.350 align:start size:84% position:16%
I launched the first
long term study

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.154 align:start size:97% position:3%
on this population of pretty
much unknown blue whales.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:50.022
Crazy but true,
and it has set me

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:52.191
on an incredible adventure.

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:55.261
In the intervening years I
have discovered that in fact,

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:58.196
these waters, because
of the enclosed nature

00:04:58.196 --> 00:04:59.932
of the Northern Indian Ocean,

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.901
the situation of Sri
Lanka's southern coast

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.037 align:start size:88% position:13%
is extremely productive
for that latitude.

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.472
I've gone on to name them
the "unorthodox whales,"

00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:08.841
because they actually break the

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:11.677
stereotypes we had
for this species.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.979
They don't undertake
long range migrations,

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.115
they actually have a
very limited range.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.084
They hang out all
year round in warm

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.887
tropical waters of the
Northern Indian Ocean.

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.721
They're the smallest
of the blue whales

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.457
that you'll find in the oceans.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.258 align:start size:81% position:19%
They're called
pygmy blue whales.

00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:28.794
They grow to 80 feet, not 100.

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.863 align:start size:84% position:16%
They have a different
acoustic dialect.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.365 align:start size:84% position:16%
They also have
different behaviors.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
They lift their tail flukes
up before a deep dive

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.969 align:start size:88% position:13%
more often than anywhere
else in the world,

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you'll see this
about 60% of the time,

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:42.408 align:start size:94% position:6%
whereas anywhere else,
less than 20% of the time.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.744
It's a photographer's
dream destination.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:46.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
Blue whales everywhere
in the world

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
are called stenophagous,
because they're

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:51.918
very specific, they feed
on one single thing, krill.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:53.019 align:start size:94% position:6%
These guys feed on
something different.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.086 align:start size:94% position:6%
These guys feed on
something different.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
But the key thing
here is that they have

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.224 align:start size:94% position:6%
all these different
behaviors and adaptations,

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.591
because they are
living in a very

00:05:59.591 --> 00:06:02.829
confined space over
a very limited range.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.263 align:start size:81% position:19%
And during the
course of my work,

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:07.433 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've also met the oldest
blue whale in our population.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.669 align:start size:97% position:3%
I took this photograph in
2011 on a documentary shoot,

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.605
and as soon as I
saw the markings,

00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:16.275
I thought to myself, I
have seen you before.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:18.410
Luckily, not a lot of work had

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.811
gone on before on these whales.

00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.613
In fact, there was only
one paper that existed

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.316
in the history of our
nation, and that was

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.819
done in 1984, and you can see,

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:29.989
and I've named it Whalentine.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.624
(audience laughing)

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:33.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
But the point is, this
animal is at least

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.627
27 years old and it's
living in our waters,

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:37.629 align:start size:84% position:16%
but what's really cool
about this sighting

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.399
is that you can see,
where I saw the whale

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.402
in 2011 was just less
than 10 kilometers away

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.771
from where it was
sighted in 1984.

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.073 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, we're getting a
sense of sight fidelity,

00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:51.043
how important this area
is to these animals.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:53.212 align:start size:88% position:13%
We know they're feeding,
breeding, and calving

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:56.582 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a very confined space,
so the conservation problems

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.419
they face are far
more compounded.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.955 align:start size:84% position:16%
Right now my crusade
is about saving

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.457 align:start size:88% position:13%
these whales from
getting killed by ships.

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:06.892
The southern coast of Sri Lanka

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.328 align:start size:97% position:3%
is one of the busiest
shipping lanes in the world.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.997 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's the main artery
through the Indian Ocean.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:13.999 align:start size:81% position:19%
Everything from
Singapore to Dubai

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.601 align:start size:84% position:16%
cruises right
through these waters.

00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:18.137
Here's some of the data we have.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:21.139 align:start size:97% position:3%
The red lines are showing
you this dense ship traffic.

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.443
The black dots, those
are whale sightings.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.811
Look at the south coast.

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.913
There's a distinct overlap.

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:32.718
So sightings like this,
are totally unsurprising.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.186
This is a whale
that came wrapped

00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:35.821
on the bow of a container ship

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:39.958
into the main port in Sri
Lanka, in Colombo, in 2012.

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.893
12 days later we
had another carcass

00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:45.097
floating at sea with a
massive propeller gash.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.465
The thing is, evidence like this

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.500
can be a little
bit rare, because

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.336 align:start size:84% position:16%
oftentimes the
carcasses will sink,

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.104
get pushed off shore,
or they'll deteriorate

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.206 align:start size:84% position:16%
so much that when
they come on to shore,

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:56.775 align:start size:94% position:6%
we can't actually identify
the cause of death.

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.444
But calculations
show that for every

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:03.249
one we document, at least
ten have gone undocumented.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.317 align:start size:81% position:19%
So it's not an
isolated incident.

00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:07.352
Neither are the numbers small.

00:08:07.352 --> 00:08:09.354
90% of the vessels that cruise

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:10.756
through our waters are actually

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:14.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
bypassing my country,
they're not coming into port.

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.861
So if we can shift
the shipping lanes

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.031
15 nautical miles
off shore, we can

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start size:81% position:19%
reduce the problem
significantly.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.835
And then that 10
percent of vessels

00:08:23.835 --> 00:08:26.071
that are actually
coming into port,

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.307 align:start size:84% position:16%
well if they slowed
down a little

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.709
it would make a difference.

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:32.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've done the
science, I've created

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.146
all the awareness,
and now I'm pushing

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:36.214
for policy change,
both at the level of

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:37.749
Sri Lankan government, but also

00:08:37.749 --> 00:08:39.951
intergovernmentally,
because shipping lanes

00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.054
are a slightly complex problem.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:45.491
But my work is not just
about saving whales.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.961
My work is about showing the
talent of the developing world.

00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:52.732 align:start size:88% position:13%
I believe that we get
local scientists trained

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.866
so they can start looking
after their own waters

00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:59.038
using local solutions, that is
what creates sustainability.

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:02.941
And I invite all
of you to join me

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:05.844
on this audacious,
audacious journey,

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:10.016
to achieve this for the sake
of the oceans and humanity.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.784
Thank you.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:14.453
