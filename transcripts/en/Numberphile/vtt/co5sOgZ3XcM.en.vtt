00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
I got an Interesting number sequence.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.160
It's the' Kolakoski sequence'..

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.340
and i'm just going to write it out..

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.380
and see if you can see why it might be interesting.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.000
We go, "One"

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.020
"Two".

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.140
I'm going to put a comma in.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.800
Two, two

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.060
One, one

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.980
Two...

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.120
...

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.300
One

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.320
Two

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.360
Two

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.019
Sometimes, I like to call this the Ready

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.320
Sequence because it's like: 1 2 2 1 1 2

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.980
Testing!

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.620
Why is this interesting?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.820
This kit carries over, like this..

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.520
There's going to be a pattern there and you might think:

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520
"This is a really boring sequence because it's got one's and two's"

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.380
and that's-that's not even in any particular order!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.980
But let's look at the runs, because the numbers..

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.320
Either coming in runs of One or Two, interestingly.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.220
So, this is a run of one because it's just one "1".

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.020
So...

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.140
I'll write a '1'.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.500
Here's a run of '2', because, there are two of them....

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
and the run of '2'...

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
Oh, a run of '1', a run of '1'.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.240
Oh, a run of '2'...

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.280
and have you noticed something very interesting?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.560
This one starts with 1,2,2,1,1,2.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.560
and here... 1,2,2,1,1,2...

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.580
and this will...

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.640
Continue forever.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.360
In other words...

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.540
"The sequence...

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.940
describes...

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.180
itself, by...

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.900
telling you the length of the run.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.800
It's a very, very famous sequence.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.300
It's one of the very first ones that was put in the...

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.660
'Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences', so people just say it's the kind of the 'Kolakoski Sequence' and in fact,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.220
there are only two sequences that have this property...

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.940
and it's this one...

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.300
and, this one.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.020
Which is the 'Kolakoski sequence' without the '1'

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.240
So, it begins 2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2...

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.000
Brady: Do you know who 'Kolakoski' was?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.660
Bill.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.020
I think he's called 'William''

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.740
'William Kolakoski', and I know that...

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.360
He came up with this idea in the 1960s.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440
It's like, you're sort of...

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.940
scratching your own back and the other hand's coming there.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.980
It's like a sort of 'Escher' painting

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.920
but done in numbers.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.640
So in the book that I did with Edmund Harriss

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.640
We, rather 'he did'

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.980
I would like to claim credit but I cannot.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.660
He found a way of representing this, in a rather, sort of, beautiful way.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.040
We have the sequence start in the outer circle, so, the inner one is...

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.780
Describing The length of Run and obviously that therefore, becomes a continuation of the same sequence...

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780
and then, within it, within it, within it.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
so rather than one sequence and then the other one referring to it, you have these kind of

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.959
concentric rings of referring, referring, referring, and that's kind of quite interesting, and quite fun and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.259
If you do all the Twos one color and all the Ones another color, say one black or gray and then one white...

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.180
and then you get rid of all the numbers

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.840
we're going to get rid of all the numbers, then you see it's this kind of quite, striking

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.100
Brady: But that's all white, that is.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.740
This is all white, and that's because, it's a colouring book. (Silly Brady...)

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.380
Oh.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.960
well, you know, it's a coloring Book but, if I had this, well I do have this,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.180
Well I do have this but if I was 'Not Me' and I was given this, I'm not Sure I would want to color it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.180
in because I think, actually that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.889
what you get from contemplating it without color, and you see how it all fits in, is rather beautiful.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.760
and you're looking at it and you're seeing there are other patterns that you can see, so you've got this, sort-of blob here.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.880
Kind of gets bigger and bigger and bigger because what's happening, is that as

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.740
the ring gets smaller it happens further away, so you get this kind of Shift.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.080
Brady: Kolakoski sequence?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.160
Not 'Kowalski', who, wasn't there a 'Primal Scream' did a song about that?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I think, I think, yeah, because he was-he was some famous

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.080
Some filming the guy called 'Kowalski' or something like that, anyway, but it was not him!

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.729
Of the mathematical things that you might want to investigate in the sequence is, are there more 1's than 2's?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.579
No one knows. That is another unsolved problem.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.530
A bit like the Collatz Conjecture

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.010
but, you'll be a lot less famous if you get this one.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.520
Like it, looks like it approaches 50%...

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.660
in the limit.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.800
Brady: We don't know.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.680
No, we don't know.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680
Brady: Greatness awaits.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.560
Now you might not be able to color things in as beautifully as Tif here but one thing you can

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.029
always make look beautiful Is a website and that's thanks to Squarespace; I use them myself all the time for multiple websites.
