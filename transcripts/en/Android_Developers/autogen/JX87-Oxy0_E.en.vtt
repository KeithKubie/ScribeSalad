you start building slices when they

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
you start building slices when they
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720
you start building slices when they
become available so let's start by

surfaces and the whole idea of slice is
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080
surfaces and the whole idea of slice is
to be able to constrain but I'll still

search predictions the first are for app
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.670
search predictions the first are for app
name queries so if someone's searching

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
name queries so if someone's searching
 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.550

for your app you can accelerate them to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560
for your app you can accelerate them to
 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.860
for your app you can accelerate them to
a canonical part in your app so for

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
a canonical part in your app so for
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.140

another use case is for any kind of
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.290
another use case is for any kind of
general term beyond your app name and so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300
general term beyond your app name and so
 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.330
general term beyond your app name and so
in this instance users can be typing for

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
in this instance users can be typing for
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.760
in this instance users can be typing for
mobile data or data usage and the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770
mobile data or data usage and the
 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.080
mobile data or data usage and the
Settings app will present them with

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
Settings app will present them with
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.180
Settings app will present them with
toggles to toggle their settings

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
toggles to toggle their settings
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.200

regarding data usage so how do we build

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210
regarding data usage so how do we build
 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.610

these slices well let's start with

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
these slices well let's start with
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.820
these slices well let's start with
default slices or app name slices it's

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
default slices or app name slices it's
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620
default slices or app name slices it's
actually very easy to build an app named

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
actually very easy to build an app named
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.870
actually very easy to build an app named
slice first you just construct a slice

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880
slice first you just construct a slice
 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.949
slice first you just construct a slice
as you normally would

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959
as you normally would
 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.170

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
an extension to the slice provider class
 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.050
an extension to the slice provider class
and that will provide details of how app

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
and that will provide details of how app
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.820
and that will provide details of how app
how the system can find your slice and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830
how the system can find your slice and
 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.410
how the system can find your slice and
what kind of template to offer to the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420
what kind of template to offer to the
 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.100
what kind of template to offer to the
system when it does to make this slice

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110
system when it does to make this slice
 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.410

map to your activity or to make the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420
map to your activity or to make the
 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420
map to your activity or to make the
slice map to your app name you have to

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
slice map to your app name you have to
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.240
slice map to your app name you have to
add the slice content URI to your main

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
add the slice content URI to your main
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.250
add the slice content URI to your main
activity and make sure to specify this

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260
activity and make sure to specify this
 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.590
activity and make sure to specify this
in the metadata field as pictured here

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600
in the metadata field as pictured here
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.960

so this tells the system hey this is a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970
so this tells the system hey this is a
 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.060
so this tells the system hey this is a
slice that I want to point to this main

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
slice that I want to point to this main
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.979
