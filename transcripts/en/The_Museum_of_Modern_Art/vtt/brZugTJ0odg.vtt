00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.100
The St. Mark's Tower is one of Frank
Lloyd Wright's earliest designs for a

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.850
skyscraper. This was planned to go around
St. Mark's Church in downtown Manhattan,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.800
and had it been built it would have been
the first glass skyscraper in New York

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.120
City. The model came to us in very, very
poor condition. It was missing about 50%

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.290
of its exterior, it was covered with soot
and grime. It was up to us to bring it to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.819
a stable enough condition to be studied
and exhibited.

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:50.930
I began by vacuuming, first, to remove
the bulk of the grime and dust and then I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.560
went over all the surfaces with a very
slightly dampened sponge cut into small

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.080
shapes so I could get into the interior
parts of the model. The first thing I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.200
noticed, when you look past the damage, is
how intricate the object is. It has a lot

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.920
of detail both on the interior floorboards
and the exterior walls. Little stenciled

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.550
drawings and incised designs. He just left
the windowpanes totally empty with the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.340
occasional pane open, tilted open and
painted blue to reflect the sky. The

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.830
landscaping is also very carefully
executed. They took little pieces of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.430
paperboard and wood and glued them to the
balconies so they would look like plants

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.130
cascading over the balconies.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.340
I learned by looking at correspondence
in the archive why St. Mark's Tower was

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.000
never built. Part of the reason was
because Wright's client was worried that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.340
it was too avant-garde for its time. He
wrote that he was afraid that tenants in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.440
the building would be struck with vertigo
on the upper floors, having nothing

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.320
between them and the city streets but a
thin pane of glass. When the building

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.750
wasn't built, Wright went on to reuse or
recycle the model, showing it in his

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.920
exhibitions he curated about his designs,
and these exhibitions would tour the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.590
country and sometimes the world. The
extensive exhibition and travel that this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.980
model underwent really took its toll, so
it's not surprising that we see early

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.320
touch ups and restorations carried out by
Wright and his students. Once we got to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.990
the point where the model was stabilized
and clean, we came to the question of

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.930
whether to restore it and if we restore
it, how far to take it. This was a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.450
conversation we had with the curators at
MoMA. We discussed everything from leaving

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.840
it just as it was in this ruined state. We
also discussed restoring it fully, but

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.280
that felt a little bit heavy-handed. The
decision to leave one corner of the model

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.580
unrestored felt to us like it struck the
right balance between respecting the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.130
object's history but also respecting
Wright's original vision.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.560
For the restoration, a lot of it was
just cutting acid-free paperboard to the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.960
right shapes, painting them, and gluing
them in place. Then I was also able to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.340
take advantage of new techniques to
replicate these exterior stencil designs

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.600
by printing them on Japanese paper made of
mulberry fibers, which go transparent when

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.400
you add adhesive to them. With this tiny
furniture that came along with the model,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.370
we don't have photographs of how it was
originally arranged but we do have

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.800
drawings where Wright stipulates how you
should arrange his Wright Design

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.120
furniture.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.540
The primary goal of this conservation
campaign was to make Wright's vision more

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.590
clear to audiences today and in the
future. But the restoration is also

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.730
designed to be revisited, reversed if
desired, by future generations who may

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.460
have a different interpretation of this
model.
