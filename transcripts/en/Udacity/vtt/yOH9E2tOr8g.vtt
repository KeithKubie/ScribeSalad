00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.682
You might be enticed to start your
design work for larger screens.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:07.810
After all, everyone has these humongous
phones and tablet's these days, right?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.740
While the average size of phones and
tablet's is growing,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.850
we're going to consciously design for
the smaller sizes first.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.160
If you design an interface for

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.280
a phone screen,
it's still usable on a tablet screen.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.638
It might have lots of white space and
look odd, but

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:22.050
the app will still work fine.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.870
Now you can't see the same for
a tablet UI viewed on a phone.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.300
That'd be really hard to use,
all those little touch targets.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.830
Starting with small screens also
really helps you simplify and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.430
prioritize what should go into the UI.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.870
At each step we want to carefully
consider which elements, if any,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.140
to add to larger screens.
