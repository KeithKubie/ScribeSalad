00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.060
When in doubt Use brute Force

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.259
What's up guys Welcome back to the Shop for part Two of our Flamethrower build Video you remember in Our Last Video We took A

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.119
20 Pound Co2 Tank A Scuba Harness and Some other Miscellaneous fittings and Put it all together to Make a basic

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.419
Flamethrower Assembly in This Video Today, we're Tying up the loose Ends with A

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.539
Slightly More Complicated

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.289
Assembly and Getting This Thing Ready for Action now. Once again Just want to give A big Shout-out to FlameThrowerPlans.com They in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:22.630
no Way

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.630
Sponsored This Video but it was Their Idea

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.848
And Made This Video Possible Today. So our Flamethrower Is pretty much assemble There's Really only Two things that We need to do left at

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.578
This Point and that is to Take the Hose from our Pressure Washer and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.520
Connect it to the Co2 Tank then Take a propane Torch and Mount it underneath the pressure Washer but it's not Nearly as

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.329
Easy as it sounds Because

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.009
We're Actually gonna have to do A lot of Modifications to the nozzle Itself Alright so first Things first let's Jump

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.610
Over to our tank and drill some holes

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.950
Now I'm gonna be Shooting this Thing right Handed when the sticks on my back I want the Hose to connect to the right Side

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.989
Right Down here so the first Thing I'm going to, do

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
Is put the Paintball tank across from me on the Opposite Side I'm going to take my left hand go all the way to the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.489
Bottom and Measure Up from the Bottom One inch

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.729
Now that We got our Position Mark I'm going to be using a thirty seven sixty Four Drill bit to drill in Tap a hole

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.580
Yay

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.870
Success

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.319
That Took far longer Than I was expecting

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.790
You know it's Really weird about that Is I think We caught it on the Curve There's like half an inch here but then it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.390
Curves in

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.870
Obviously The Bottom is Thicker and then the walls are

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.129
Cuz the Top part of the Wall here is only About half an inch Thick but then that back end is like an inch and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130
A half I'm not sweating at all

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.199
So quick Update Guys I Finally got Through this tank here, was A lot more difficult than I was Expecting here's why?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.060
When I drill down Into the saloon I was expecting it to maybe be half an inch Thick but it just kept Going and Going

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.189
And i think the Reason is because the Bottom of This tank is actually Sloped on the inside so there's much more Metal near the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.930
Bottom and Even Though the Instructions Safe to drill at the One-inch Point Just be Prepared that it's gonna be A lot more Work than

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.620
You Think

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.190
We used our Thirty seven Sixty Four-bit to go in and Then I use this 3/8 inch 18

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.329
Npt to Actually cut some Threads so Theoretically The end of our pressure washer hood

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.199
Should Now Screw in Perfectly but The Problem With Drilling and Tapping our Own hole Is it's put a lot

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.140
of aluminum Shavings inside The Tank so actually Had to Take a pair of Channellocks and A rubber Mallet and Knock the Top valve Loose

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.619
To open A, hole big Enough, We could turn the tank Upside Down and Shake all Those Shavings out

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.440
so here

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.589
We are Guys it took quite A bit of Work but We now have the Hose attached to the tank

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.749
Few Surprises Along the way the tank Is very very Thick it's very difficult to tap this Thing and Screwing the Hose on

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.910
Only Got Within About a Quarter of an inch of the tank Itself but There's Quite A bit of Pipe Thread tape on There and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.179
It's sealed Up pretty Nice and tight so i think it's gonna do the Job and now

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.930
We can move on to adding the propane Torch to the actual Flamethrower Nozzle Itself

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.740
Now Looking at the Plans I think This might be One of the Harder two ways to go and might be a little bit Easier

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.999
To Stick Some Kind of Electric igniter near The end of the Tips as the gas links Coming out it Auto

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.749
Ignites With High volts Electricity However I am Gonna stay True to the Plans

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.020
We're Gonna Finish this thing out With a propane Torch now the basic Modification

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.599
We need to
Make With the Torch Itself is Actually to bend This Part

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.040
Forward Because When it's Resting up against here you can See the Flame Goes Straight Through the Gasoline

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.139
We want it to be more in Line With the flow but Unfortunately it's not Quite as Easy as Just Taking this Tube and Bending

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.330
It There Are Things on the inside that we need to tweak, we?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.720
Also want to modify the Handle so it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.509
Offsets About 130 degrees if We can use it more of the Handle for striking the Flame on our Flamethrower

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.590
So, we're Gonna get Down here we're Gonna Undo the nuts and the bolts, we're Gonna Pull out the electrical Cable

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.040
We're Gonna heat this thing up with another Torch bend it Let it cool Down and then

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.819
We're Gonna drill a tap a hole and reassemble everything and Hopefully it Works

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.280
So what I just

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.290
Did Is took a little allen wrench and I ended this set Screw Which allowed me to remove the entire Nozzle at that Point I

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.819
Unscrewed the Tip and We could See down Inside There was a little green wire which Is used to Make the Electric spark to Actually

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.540
Light off the Propane or the map gas?

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.719
That Little Green wire needed to come out so we took a little Elbow bracket pull the Cap off That and then unscrewed it so

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.410
That We could push the green wire up through the Top of the Nozzle and that's what

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.250
We have now so at this Point we're Gonna Make Two Main?

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.910
Modifications To it we're Gonna Heat up this Elbow to the point Where

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.200
We can bend it Up a couple of inches and Straighten it out They're Gonna Drill and Tap a hole Into the side of the

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.469
Brass so when, We put the whole Thing back Together it Would be offset to the point Where?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.470
We can start off our Flamethrower with the press of a Button?

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.509
Alright Guys so here is where, we're at with our Nozzle We took the other Propane Torch We heated this Up and then?

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.818
We used A wrench to bend it over about two inches or so just so it Flattens out the Angle then

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.158
We located the original Hope for That 90-Degree Elbow and We Flipped it over About a hundred and Thirty degrees and Drilled and tapped A

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.169
New hole Into the Top Drilled with A 7/32 inch Drill bit and Tapped with a, quarter inch F28 I

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.909
Also Had a little bit of Heat Shrink Tubing Onto the green Cable Itself and that's Just to Help Protect it from Any Scratches and

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:26.069
Give it a little bit more Thermal Insulation so the last step Now Is Just to rerun that Green wire Through everything and use the

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.579
New hole for our 90-Degree Elbow and We Basically put The propane Torch back Together, oh?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.270
Success

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.250
Is actually Looking Really good

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.740
oh

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.719
Right-Handed Oops

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:04.808
I think I made it Left-Handed

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.019
Well I messed that up so, we're Gonna have to do all over again

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.809
There You go all Fixed

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.849
Our torts Modifications are Complete and I just Gotta Say word of Caution don't do what I do

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.528
When you're Drilling and Tapping the new hole for the 90-Degree Elbow Make sure you're Drilling it in the right Place

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:28.269
When all Said and Done You want your torch to be able to sit in your hand With your Middle Finger or a pointer Finger

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.449
on the Button There and The Torch Angling Upward it Should Look something like This

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:35.739
And Just to Make Sure the electrical went Back Together I took the Nozzle Off and as you look Down and click it

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:41.139
We Can Actually See the green wire Sparking against the Outside of the Tube and Clicking it ten Times in A row

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.049
We see at fire ten Times that's a pretty good sign so at this Point

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.710
We can put The Nozzle Back on Screw it Onto a tank of Propane and See if it Still lights off?

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:51.549
All right moment of Truth and Pull the trigger if This Thing lights Off We Should be good?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.259
Looks Like it's Firing off Just About every Time so let's go Ahead and Strap it up

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.299
Strapping This Propane Tank To our pressure Washer is as simple as using two of These large Quick-Release Bands

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:33.919
There We have it guys you can See I'Ve Got the Propane Tank Connected now to the pressure washer?

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:39.259
Nozzle I just use two of These bands to show up nice and Tight and i tried to line it up so that the Nozzle

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.559
And the Propane Nozzle are in Line With each other and Looks like

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.589
We did Pretty good Job

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:48.259
Now in Essence This is it and Just for fun I'm going to Strap this to my back and Just get A feel for how

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.649
It Works but before I actually use this

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:54.499
Before I fill it full of Gasoline and Diesel I'm gonna do pressure Test With Water Look for Any leaks and then charge up this

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.219
Co2 Container Here The Basic Idea of how the System Works Is this big Co2 Canister here Provides Pressure inside the tank Which pushes the

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:07.250
Gasoline and Diesel Mixture Through This host of the pressure Washer out the Nozzle and Into the Flame of the propane Torch Below

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.969
And if This Thing does what it Claims, We Should be able to Shoot Flames About 50 feet Long

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.379
What's Really Nice About this Is it's very Ergonomically Placed, We got the propane Torch right Up here in the Left Hand

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:28.149
We got the pressure washer in The right Hand and Just Feels very very Comfortable and to Make this Thing Spray

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:32.289
We just Disengage the Safety Pull the Handle to get the Gasoline Shooting Ignite the propane Torch

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.179
And Throw some Flames so using pressure Washer Parts and A Co2 Tank we've Been able to Make a Flamethrower

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:46.030
Using Instructions off The Internet and the next Time You see this Thing will Be in Action Putting up the test With Diesel and Gasoline

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.229
Thanks for Joining Me for This Build Video I'll be Looking for the next One Talk to you then

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.060
in Case

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.810
We haven't met yet?

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.239
I'm Nate and I'm here working With brandt on some awesome New Projects Yes I am excited to have nate Joining Us here on the

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.490
King of Random if You will have him and With Any Luck

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.500
He'll Be Seen Coming the next Video back to then

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.840
Real Quick Update Guys That Came out Here To pressure Test the System and Found that I made A few of the Connections a little

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.350
bit Differently Than the

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.570
Instructions Suggest Down Here to the tank I just had the Hose Connected straight To it and what I've Done

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:19.450
Is I'Ve Taken two of the fittings and I've Put a male Fitting and then this quick Connect adapter so that now This Flamethrower Does

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.450
Match the Plans Perfectly

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:31.139
you
