00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.680
"Let ABC be a triangle,
such that angle ABC

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.890
is equal to pi over 6."

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.070
Let me draw it.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.950
So that's A, B, and
C. And they tell us

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.490
that angle ACB, this angle
right over here, is pi over 6.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.800
I'm assuming it's
pi over 6 radians.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.790
Or we could view
that as 30 degrees.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.710
And then they tell
us, "Let a, b, and c

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.947
denote the lengths of the sides
opposite to capital A, B, C,

00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:29.530
respectively."

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.130
So this is a, this is b, and
this is c, right over there.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.730
The values of x, for which
a is equal to this thing, b

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.791
is equal to this thing, and
c is equal to this thing is?

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:42.790
So let's think about it.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.540
One, we need to find a
relationship between A, B,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.144
and C in this angle.

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.810
And then once we have
that relationship,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.360
we can substitute them
with these expressions.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.995
And then essentially
try to solve for x.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:56.120
And the first thing you
want to think about is, OK,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.970
how can I relate
the length of b,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.150
this lowercase c, this lowercase
a with this angle here.?

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.129
And what should pop
out into your brain

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.870
is the law of cosines.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.550
Law of cosines.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.300
Law of cosines that
tells us that c squared

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.592
is equal to a squared
plus b squared.

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:18.050
It's essentially the Pythagorean
theorem with an adjustment

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.170
right here, because this
isn't a right triangle.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.830
So a squared plus b
squared minus 2ab times

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.970
the cosine of C.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.930
Now in this case,
angle C right here--

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.610
or I should say, in this case,
it's angle ACB-- this over here

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.950
is going to be 30 degrees.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.860
So what's the cosine
of 30 degrees?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.180
And just in case you
forgot it, although I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.960
assume if you're going to
take the IIT exam, the JEE,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.200
you're going to need all the
help you need in terms of time.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.620
So this is 30 degrees.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.070
That is 1.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.560
Then this is 1/2, the side
opposite the 30-degree side.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.720
This will be 60 degrees.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.370
It's going to be a 30-60-90.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.350
And so this is square
root of 3 over 2.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.980
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse,

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.720
so square root of 3/2 over 1.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.720
So this, in this
example, it's going

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.100
to be c squared is equal
to a squared plus b squared

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.965
minus 2ab.

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:21.280
And then this whole thing
is square root of 3/2.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.140
So times square root of 3/2.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.200
And these 2's cancel out.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.660
And so we get c squared is equal
to a squared plus b squared

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.130
minus the square root of 3ab.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.715
Now the next thing I'd want
to do is substitute for a,

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:42.900
I'd substitute with this
expression over here.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.160
For b, I want to substitute
with this expression over here.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.160
And then for c, I want to
substitute this expression

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.106
right over here.

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:51.980
But I want to be careful,
I want to make sure

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.230
that it's in a form that I
can, in some way, simplify.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.900
Because if I just take this
a over here-- this x squared

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.505
plus x plus 1-- if
I square it, I'm

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:00.630
going to end up with
something to the fourth power.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.407
This b, I'm going to end up with
something to the fourth power.

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:05.740
And then I have the square
root of 3 business over here.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.150
So let's see if we can at least
rearrange it, or at least maybe

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.250
quarantine the square
root of 3, little bit,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880
to make it at least
something that we might have

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.390
some hopes of factoring,
or solving in some way.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.260
And I want to make a little
clarifying point here.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.020
In most Western exams,
if you're taking the SAT

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.560
or you're taking any type of--
even at a math competition--

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.000
if you find yourself
grinding through math,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.730
multiplying huge polynomials
times each other,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.540
you're probably doing
something wrong.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.724
Most Western exams--
like the SAT--

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:37.140
you kind of have
to see the trick,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.110
you kind of have to see the
elegance in the problem.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.840
But once you see the
elegance, the problem

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.000
is usually pretty
straightforward.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.760
In fact, if you're
grinding through math,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.480
it's usually a giveaway that
you're doing something wrong.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.867
On these JEE math
problems-- and I've

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.450
only recently gotten
exposure to them.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.640
I obviously never took them,
not having grown up in India.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.904
But on these, you have
to kind of see the trick.

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:57.570
And then you have to
grind through math,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.360
and you have to use every
trick at your disposal

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.510
to make the grinding through
math a little bit easier.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.280
So the test writers for the
JEE are definitely a little,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.050
actually, a lot more
cruel than the test

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.302
writers for most Western
exams that I've seen.

00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:15.760
So what I want to
do is, let's just

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.800
isolate the square root of 3ab.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.649
So let's add it to both sides.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.510
So the square root
of 3ab plus-- so

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.680
let's just add that--
square root of 3ab.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.930
And let's get the c squared
onto this side of the equation.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.970
So let me subtract c
squared from both sides

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.210
of the equation.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.430
So minus c squared.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.040
And then minus c squared.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.540
And so I will have, on this
side, those cancel out.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.410
And I just have the
square root of 3ab

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.960
is equal to a squared plus b
squared-- these cancel out--

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.990
minus c squared--
I'm just rearranging

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.290
the whole thing--
minus c squared.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.370
All of that, well right
now, that's all it is.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.390
And now I can divide
both sides of this by ab.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.200
So if I divide
that by ab and then

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.015
I divide the right-hand side
by ab, that cancels out.

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:10.140
And I've kind of quarantined
that square root of 3.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.310
So I'll hopefully only
have integer stuff

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.050
on this side of the equation.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.270
So I have the
square root of 3 is

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.237
equal to a squared plus b
squared minus c squared.

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:24.320
So let's figure out what
each of these things are.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.720
Let's expand them out,
actually, before we rewrite it.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.980
So let's figure out
what a squared is.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.890
So let's think about a squared.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.100
a squared is going
to be equal to--

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.000
and this is the part
where they clearly

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.280
want to see whether you can
multiply multiple polynomials.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.510
That's going to be x squared
plus x plus 1 squared,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.040
or x squared plus x plus 1
times x squared plus x plus 1.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.130
And so this is going to be
1 times this whole thing,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.280
is x squared plus x plus 1.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.610
x times this whole
thing, is x plus x

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.270
squared plus x to the third.

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.600
And you may or might
not have noticed,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880
I'm doing these a little faster
than I traditionally do them,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.680
just in the hope of
being able to finish

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.430
this problem in a
reasonable amount of time.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.840
And then finally, x squared
times this whole thing,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.270
x squared times 1 is x squared.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.250
x squared times x
is x to the third.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.785
And then x squared times x
squared is x to the fourth.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.280
So a squared is going to
be x to the fourth plus

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:46.250
2x to the third plus 3x
squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.020
So that's a squared.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.870
What's b squared?

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.960
That looks a little bit
more straightforward.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.760
b squared, so that's b.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.250
So b squared is going to be--
well, that squared is just

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.830
x to the fourth minus
2x squared plus 1.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.894
And then c squared.

00:07:03.894 --> 00:07:05.060
That's more straightforward.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.940
So at least they
weren't as painful

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:16.520
as this. c squared is going to
4x squared plus 4x-- 2 times

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.040
the product of these
two, so plus 4x-- plus 1.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.170
So the numerator of
our expression here.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.830
So let's rewrite this thing
that we were simplifying.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.290
It now becomes the square
root of 3 is equal to-- oh,

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.180
and we don't want
to-- well, let's just

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.290
do one step at a time.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.920
So it's equal to a squared,
which is this thing over here.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.340
So it is x to the
fourth-- actually,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.830
let me scroll down a little bit.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.366
It's this thing plus this thing,
minus this thing over here.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.240
So let me just do it.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.830
It's this thing
plus the blue thing,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.440
plus x to the fourth
minus 2x squared--

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.530
it'll be easier to add
them up this way-- plus 1.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.120
And then it's minus this
thing, minus c squared.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.980
So minus.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.870
So this is going to be a
minus 4x squared minus 4x.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.810
And then you have a minus 1.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.394
And then when you
add them all up-- so

00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:18.310
this will be the numerator
of this expression.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.870
We have the square root
of 3 is equal to-- so let

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.440
me just do it down here.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.210
So we have 2x to the
fourth-- let's scroll

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.770
to the left a little bit.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.150
So we have 2x to the fourth
plus 2x to the third.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:38.039
And then 3x squared minus 6x
squared is minus 3x squared.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.130
2 minus 4 is minus 2x, and
then you have 2 minus 1

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.310
is-- then you have just plus 1.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.650
So the numerator, this thing
over here, simplifies to this.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:56.510
It's equal to 2x to the fourth
plus 2x to the third minus

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.010
3x squared minus 2x plus 1.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.232
And the denominator is ab.

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:07.550
a is this thing over here.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.640
a is x squared plus x plus 1.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.490
And b, we saw it up
here, b is-- actually,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.020
we have it written up over
here. b is x squared minus 1.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.280
So b is x squared minus 1.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.040
Now at this point, we
need to solve for x.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.248
If we just multiply this
stuff times square root of 3

00:09:31.248 --> 00:09:33.690
and went backwards, kind of
unsolved it back to the form

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.039
that we had way up here, we'd
have a fourth degree polynomial

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:39.330
with square roots of 3's in it.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.780
We still have a fourth
degree polynomial.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.220
But at least this one has
all integer coefficients,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.094
which at least
gives me some hope

00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:47.510
that I might be
able to factor it.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.340
I might be able to
find some roots.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.220
And if I can find
some roots that

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.460
are common to the numerator
and the denominator,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.967
maybe I can reduce this
into a lower degree problem.

00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.300
So I'm going to leave you there.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.258
I'm pushing 10 minutes.

00:09:59.258 --> 00:10:02.690
In the next video, we're going
to try to factor this beast up

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.930
here and see if it has any
common factors with this

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.510
over here.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.340
And then try to solve for x.
