trying to reach a bar that just keeps
 

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.520
trying to reach a bar that just keeps
moving and the problem is that when you

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:22.530
moving and the problem is that when you
 

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.800
moving and the problem is that when you
live in a nation where the bar is always

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:24.810
live in a nation where the bar is always

shifting and moving and you don't know
whether the work that you put in is

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:29.670
whether the work that you put in is
 

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.130
whether the work that you put in is
going to lead to the outcome that you

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140
going to lead to the outcome that you
 

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.220
going to lead to the outcome that you
thought you get is that it makes people

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.230
thought you get is that it makes people
 

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.600
thought you get is that it makes people
feel isolated because folks are

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:38.610
feel isolated because folks are
 

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.740
feel isolated because folks are
struggling so hard every day and their

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:42.750
struggling so hard every day and their
 

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.200
struggling so hard every day and their
struggles are not amounting to what they

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.210
struggles are not amounting to what they
 

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.860
struggles are not amounting to what they
hoped would happen so you start feeling

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:48.870
hoped would happen so you start feeling
 

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.880
hoped would happen so you start feeling
isolated and lonely and it is easy to be

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:52.890
isolated and lonely and it is easy to be
 

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.490
isolated and lonely and it is easy to be
divided when you are in a country that

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500
divided when you are in a country that
 

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.500
divided when you are in a country that
is struggling to reach a never moving

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:57.510
is struggling to reach a never moving
 

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.920
is struggling to reach a never moving
and shifting bar you feel like your pain

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:00.930
and shifting bar you feel like your pain
 

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.830
and shifting bar you feel like your pain
and struggle is all your own that you

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840
and struggle is all your own that you
 

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.019
and struggle is all your own that you
are alone in your failures

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:06.029
are alone in your failures
 

00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:09.589
are alone in your failures
so it's easy to be divided and it is

00:24:09.589 --> 00:24:09.599
so it's easy to be divided and it is
 

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:15.320
so it's easy to be divided and it is
also easy to be a pathetic because you

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:15.330
also easy to be a pathetic because you
 

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.450
also easy to be a pathetic because you
feel like you know what I am working so

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460
feel like you know what I am working so
 

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.479
feel like you know what I am working so

to chase an ever moving bar so people
 

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.169
to chase an ever moving bar so people
don't engage and when you live in a

00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179
don't engage and when you live in a
 

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:43.849
don't engage and when you live in a
country where the bar is moving and

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:43.859
country where the bar is moving and
 

00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:46.549
country where the bar is moving and
shifting on you then it is so easy to be

guided by fear because when your world

00:24:50.329 --> 00:24:50.339
guided by fear because when your world
 

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:52.369
guided by fear because when your world
isn't right when you're trying to do

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:52.379
isn't right when you're trying to do
 

00:24:52.379 --> 00:24:53.839
isn't right when you're trying to do
everything in your power to make it

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:53.849
everything in your power to make it
 

00:24:53.849 --> 00:24:56.089
everything in your power to make it
right and it doesn't happen all you have

00:24:56.089 --> 00:24:56.099
right and it doesn't happen all you have
 

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.899
right and it doesn't happen all you have
is fear fear of other people who are

00:24:59.899 --> 00:24:59.909
is fear fear of other people who are
 

00:24:59.909 --> 00:25:02.899
is fear fear of other people who are
threat to you and that's where we are

00:25:02.899 --> 00:25:02.909
threat to you and that's where we are
 

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:05.299
threat to you and that's where we are
and the problem with being in a country

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:05.309
and the problem with being in a country
 

00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:09.229
and the problem with being in a country
that is guided by fear is that it cuts

00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:09.239
that is guided by fear is that it cuts
 

00:25:09.239 --> 00:25:12.859
that is guided by fear is that it cuts
us off from one another it cuts us off

00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:12.869
us off from one another it cuts us off
 

00:25:12.869 --> 00:25:14.659
us off from one another it cuts us off
from one another in our own

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:14.669
from one another in our own
 

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:16.579
from one another in our own
neighborhoods and our own families and

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:16.589
neighborhoods and our own families and
 

00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:18.529
neighborhoods and our own families and
our communities and it has certainly cut

00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539
our communities and it has certainly cut
 

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.769
our communities and it has certainly cut
us off from the rest of the world the

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:21.779
us off from the rest of the world the
 

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:24.799
us off from the rest of the world the
problem with fear is that it creates

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:24.809
problem with fear is that it creates
 

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:27.799
problem with fear is that it creates
this veil of impossibility and we spend

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:27.809
this veil of impossibility and we spend
 

00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:29.989
this veil of impossibility and we spend
more time in this country talking about

00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:29.999
more time in this country talking about
 

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:32.299
more time in this country talking about
what we can't do what can't change what

00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:32.309
what we can't do what can't change what
 

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:36.769
what we can't do what can't change what
won't work and we pass that belief

00:25:36.769 --> 00:25:36.779
won't work and we pass that belief
 

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:40.159
won't work and we pass that belief
system on to our children so we're

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:40.169
system on to our children so we're
 

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:42.409
system on to our children so we're
raising a generation of young people who

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419
raising a generation of young people who
 

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:46.039
raising a generation of young people who
are insular and timid and many of them

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:46.049
are insular and timid and many of them
 

00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:48.499
are insular and timid and many of them
don't try because we already told them

00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:48.509
don't try because we already told them
 

00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:52.279
don't try because we already told them
why they can't do it and see I don't

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:52.289
why they can't do it and see I don't
 

00:25:52.289 --> 00:25:56.209
why they can't do it and see I don't
