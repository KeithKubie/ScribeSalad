00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:56.219
The Second Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary
is generally regarded as the single most comprehensive

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.399
record of the English language to exist.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.430
Included in this work are many thousands of
words considered completely “obsolete”

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.440
by lexicographers.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.420
You see, in something of a Hotel California
of linguistics, once a word has made it into

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.270
the OED, it can never leave.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.210
Whether other dictionaries remove words or
not varies from dictionary to dictionary,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.450
but major dictionaries who attempt to put
out “complete” editions tend to follow

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.799
suit in never removing words once they make
it in.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.450
However, the much more common concise editions
of all dictionaries do occasionally remove

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.450
not just obsolete words, but sometimes quite
common ones that simply don’t fit and are

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.970
deemed less important to include than other
words for various reasons.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.150
Before we get to how a word becomes obsolete
in the eyes of dictionary creators, it’s

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.520
helpful to understand how a word enters the
dictionary in the first place and what it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.490
means for a word to be there, with the latter
being something of a common misconception.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.360
While it’s very common for people to say
something like, “It’s not in the dictionary,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.959
so it’s not a word”, this sentiment is
rarely, if ever, shared by professional word-nerds.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.670
One does not have to look hard to find editors
at all of the major dictionaries specifically

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.979
denouncing this popular notion.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.080
As co-founder of the phenomenal word reference
site Wordnik and one time chief editor of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.740
American Dictionaries at Oxford University
Press, including editing the second edition

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.340
of The New Oxford American Dictionary, Erin
McKean, notes,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.989
All words (aside from unintentional errors
and malapropisms) are words at their birth.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.780
All you have to decide is whether the word
in question is the right one for the job.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.680
Dictionaries don’t measure realness; they
serve as rough proxies for the extent of a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.860
word’s use.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.700
Or as noted in the FAQ section of Merriam-Webster’s
website,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.120
Most general English dictionaries are designed
to include only those words that meet certain

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.450
criteria of usage across wide areas and over
extended periods of time.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.220
As a result, they may omit words that are
still in the process of becoming established,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.020
those that are too highly specialized, or
those that are so informal that they are rarely

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.050
documented in professionally edited writing.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.380
The words left out are as real as those that
gain entry; the former simply haven’t met

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.900
the criteria for dictionary entry – at least
not yet (newer ones may ultimately gain admission

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.830
to the dictionary’s pages if they gain sufficient
use).

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.340
Going further, in a rather enjoyable diatribe
on this general topic, professor of linguistics

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.650
at Stanford, Arnold Zwicky, states,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.819
We start with the admonition that people of
taste and refinement should not use X.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.140
This is then exaggerated, elevated to the
admonition that people, in general, should

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.620
not use X; what should govern the behavior
of the “best” of us (those are genuine

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.310
sneer quotes) in certain circumstances should
govern the behavior of all of us, all of the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.930
time, in all contexts, for all purposes.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.400
(What a remarkable lack of nuance!

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.420
What a divorcement from the complex textures
of social life!)

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.510
As if that weren’t enough, it ratchets up,
hysterically, one more notch, to the bald

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.040
assertion that X simply isn’t available
for use; it’s just not part of the social

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040
repertoire.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.560
My dear, it just isn’t done.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.950
But if it truly isn’t done, then there’s
no need for the admonitions.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.879
Don’t tell me there’s “no such word”.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.569
Parade your idiosyncratic prejudices, if you
wish, and if your mind is open enough we might

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.820
be able to talk about the bases of your prejudices
(and mine).

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.040
But don’t lie to me about the state of the
language.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.530
(Two other great similar rants we recommend
are linguist professor Mark Leberman’s Snoot?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.270
Bluck. and Stephen Fry’s, Language.)

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.620
Backing up this slightly philosophical point
of view with real world usage is a 2011 paper

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.930
published in Science, “Quantitative Analysis
of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books”,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:59.760
which analyzes the language used in 5,195,769
books (about 4% of all books ever published).

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.900
Among other things, they found that when comparing
words used in those books to the OED and Merriam-Webster’s

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.520
Unabridged Dictionary, even when excluding
proper nouns (which those dictionaries don’t

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.400
include), “a large fraction of the words
in our lexicon (63%) were in this lowest frequency

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
bin.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.069
As a result, we estimated that 52% of the
English lexicon – the majority of the words

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:27.770
used in English books – consists of lexical
‘dark matter’ undocumented in standard

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.870
references.”

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.659
On a similar note, with regards to not just
what constitutes a word, but proper usage,

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:38.979
the OED also distances themselves from carrying
that banner, stating quite frankly,

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:45.089
The Oxford English Dictionary is not an arbiter
of proper usage, despite its widespread reputation

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.159
to the contrary.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.099
The Dictionary is intended to be descriptive,
not prescriptive.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.449
In other words, its content should be viewed
as an objective reflection of English language

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.210
usage, not a subjective collection of usage
‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.379
In the end, language is an ever evolving beast
and really any combination of letters can

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.319
count as a word if said combination has or
is given some meaning; and grammatical conventions

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.020
exist to serve language, not the other way
around.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.840
For reference here, the venerable OED *only*
contains about 600,000 entries, with most

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.520
lexicographers estimating there are probably
actually about twice that many words in the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520
English language.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.400
(There is much debate on this, however, owing
to what actually counts as a distinct word.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.909
For instance, Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary lists 12 distinct words spelled

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:35.909
“post”.

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.460
On top of this, there are numerous regional
slang terms largely unknown by the general

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.680
speaker of English that would never be included
in most dictionaries.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.870
On that note, Wordnik, which seeks to document
every word ever appearing in the English language,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.669
regardless of dialect or how obscure the word
is, currently has almost seven million unique

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:55.669
entries!)

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.180
Alright, so now we’ve laid to rest the popular
notion that dictionaries are the bastions

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.699
of what counts as a word or not.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.680
If even the OED isn’t including every word,
then what is required for a word to make it

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.849
into their distinguished record of the English
language?

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.999
In two words- sustained usage.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.789
Or to quote the OED on their general method:

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:22.659
The OED requires several independent examples
of the word being used, and also evidence

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.199
that the word has been in use for a reasonable
amount of time.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:31.300
The exact time-span and number of examples
may vary: for instance, one word may be included

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.669
on the evidence of only a few examples, spread
out over a long period of time, while another

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.699
may gather momentum very quickly, resulting
in a wide range of evidence in a shorter space

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:41.699
of time.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.559
We also look for the word to reach a level
of general currency where it is unselfconsciously

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:52.929
used with the expectation of being understood:
that is, we look for examples of uses of a

00:07:52.929 --> 00:07:57.199
word that are not immediately followed by
an explanation of its meaning for the benefit

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.330
of the reader.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.779
We have a large range of words under constant
review, and as items are assessed for inclusion

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:04.809
in the dictionary, words which have not yet
accumulated enough evidence are kept on file,

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:09.059
so that we can refer back to them if further
evidence comes to light.

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:12.930
Evidence of a potential new word’s use is
provided mostly by volunteers who pore over

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.370
everything from magazines to obscure scientific
journals as part of something dubbed the “Reading

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.559
Programme”, which “recruits voluntary
and paid readers, and these readers provide

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:27.719
the OED editors with quotations which illustrate
how words are used.”

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:31.599
These quotations are all meticulously catalogued
and if they happen to contain a new word or

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:36.180
“new sense of an existing word” editors
aren’t familiar with it can easily be cross-referenced

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:41.500
with other quotations to see if it needs to
be added to the dictionary or perhaps investigated

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.530
further.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.700
As it is the mission of the OED to provide
“a permanent record of [a word’s] place

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.450
in the language”, once a word is deemed
worthy to be added to the dictionary, as previously

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:57.430
noted, it will never be removed, regardless
of whether or not it later falls out of use.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:03.220
The reasoning behind this is twofold- first,
to ensure the OED remains as close to a definitive

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.410
record of the English language as practically
possible; second, to ensure a reader can be

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.899
reasonably confident that a large percentage
of the time, any word they do not know the

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:15.950
definition or meaning of will be found in
the OED.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.650
To quote the OED website: “The idea is that
a puzzled reader encountering an unfamiliar

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:26.120
word in, say, a 1920s novel, will be able
to find the word in the OED even if it has

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.940
been little used for the past fifty years.”

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.690
Though admirable, a side-effect of this dedication
to broadly documenting the English language

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.510
is that editors struggle mightily to keep
up with the rate at which language evolves.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.600
For example, the complete Third Edition of
the OED, the hotly anticipated follow-up to

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.950
the Second Edition, isn’t set to be completed
until around the late 2030s and at an estimated

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.440
production cost of around £34 million (about
$45 million).

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.430
As an idea of how painstakingly slowly this
process is, in 2010 the Third Edition was

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.710
estimated to be 28% complete.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:08.070
At the time, around 80 lexicographers, then
led by John Simpson, had been working on it

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.180
for 21 years…

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.370
In fact, Simpson ended up retiring in 2013
after 24 years of working on the OED3, with

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.540
the chief editor job falling to then 48 year
old Michael Proffitt.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.930
Given the estimates for the completion of
the Third Edition, Proffitt will be around

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.080
70 years old, and perhaps himself retired,
by the time it’s finished.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.920
So yeah, Game of Thrones fans, if you think
you Throners have had it bad waiting for the

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.080
next book in the series to be finished, spare
a thought for us OEDers.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.490
(Though, at least in our case, we get regular
published updates on the work as small sections

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.580
are completed.)

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.150
Now, although it is the policy of the OED
to never remove a word from the dictionary,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.190
they do release abridged versions containing
what they feel reflects “the living English

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:58.450
language” at the time, or in some editions
a set of words curated to be suitable for

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.510
a given audience.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:04.470
Towards this end, the OED, and other dictionaries,
regularly remove what they feel are “obsolete”

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.380
words from newer editions of abridged versions.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.900
This has historically been done for the sake
of cost and size practicality, though the

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.150
digital age is rapidly making this less of
a concern.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.460
To illustrate how much of a problem this historically
has been, however, consider the Second Edition

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.660
of the OED, which consists of a collection
of a whopping 20 volumes and roughly 22,000

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.270
pages; that’s a lot of paper, binding, and
shipping.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.310
The end cost to the consumer for that complete
set is in turn about $1100.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:39.000
(And it should be noted that, according to
Chief Executive of Oxford University Press,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.260
Nigel Portwood, the OED has never made a profit,
even with such prices, not to mention the

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.490
$295 annual fee if one wants access to the
online digital edition.)

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.000
Obviously the market for such a massive physical
product is very niche, and most word-nerds

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.670
these days who do have a use for the product
use the digital version anyway, including

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.600
ourselves, as it’s a vastly superior research
tool.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.990
(This is, in part, why the completed much
longer Third Edition will likely never be

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.990
printed.)

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.790
But concise print editions are still somewhat
commonly used, at least for now, so it makes

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.380
sense to trim some of the more extraneous
content and release an abridged version that

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.410
doesn’t cost as much as a flight to Hawaii
or take up an entire bookshelf.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.220
So how is it decided which words won’t make
the cut in these concise editions?

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.680
Well this process varies from publisher to
publisher, although the typical method seems

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.990
to be simply going through the previous edition
with a fine toothed comb to look for words

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.890
that are no longer terribly common in a given
sphere- hopefully finding more words that

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.410
are acceptable to cut than new words that
need added, though this seems rarely to be

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.410
the case.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.380
For example, Angus Stevenson, the head of
dictionary projects at the Oxford University

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:57.040
Press was tasked with cutting 200 words from
the 12th edition of the Concise Oxford English

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.480
Dictionary to make way for around 400 newer
words in 2011.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.000
To accomplish this, he had to rejigger the
font and formatting in the dictionary to avoid

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.230
having to cut too many words still in relatively
popular use.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.640
Editors at Collins dictionary had to do more
or less the same thing when they excised some

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.970
2000 words from their 2008 edition to make
way for newer words more familiar to modern

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.060
English speakers.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.410
The senior editor of the dictionary, Cormac
McKeown, would later explain that to accomplish

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.810
this, “We’ve been fiddling around with
the typeface to try to get more in, but it

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.550
is at saturation point.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.570
There is a trade-off between getting them
in and legibility.”

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.740
Unfortunately, this inevitably leads to familiar,
but somewhat obsolete, words being removed.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.230
For example, in the aforementioned 12th edition
of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.430
amongst the entries culled were the likes
of “cassette player” in favor of things

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.333
like “mankini” (though “cassette tape”
still remained, contrary to what was stated

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:58.750
in many dozens of news reports we read concerning
this).

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.830
This process can become highly controversial,
such as happened in the case of the Oxford

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.640
Junior Dictionary, where they decided to cut
out about 50 words connected to nature, like

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.540
“acorn” and “buttercup”, using the
freed up space to add words like “chatroom”

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.540
and “blog”.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.210
As the latter new technologies have given
rise to everyone having a platform for their

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.170
outrage (and the media loving a good controversy
surrounding a major brand for the clicks it

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:26.060
brings), naturally, this resulted in a well-published
outcry over the removal of words describing

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.570
the “outside” world in favor of the “interior,
solitary”.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.170
Of course, these words weren’t actually
being removed from the English language (nor

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.510
common usage), merely a Junior Edition of
the dictionary which could only include a

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:43.240
minuscule 10,000 or so of the over 600,000
entries found in the OED.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.640
In the end, the editors simply chose words
that best reflect those that kids today most

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.800
frequently use or encounter.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.480
So to sum up the question posed at the start
of this article, if you’re referring to

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.400
complete editions of certain major dictionaries,
like the OED, once a word is added to it,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.160
it will never be removed.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.670
However, if you’re referring to the more
commonly found various abridged dictionaries

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.320
lying around, words are removed whenever the
respective editors decide they are no longer

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.570
as relevant as other words, even if sometimes
those cut words are still relatively commonly

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.570
used…

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.890
Bringing us all back to the point that if
ever someone picks up such a dictionary and

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.880
tells you the word you just used “isn’t
a word because it’s not in the dictionary”,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.650
you have our permission to slap them upside
the head* with that very tome of knowledge

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.310
and then politely tell them that’s not how
dictionaries or languages work…

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:44.640
(*Full disclosure: we may be slightly oversensitive
on this topic owing to having published over

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:59.400
six million words online read by millions
of people from various dialects of English…

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.150
Certain Grammar Nazis, or as I prefer to refer
to this flavour, “Grammar Nazi’s”, as

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.760
opposed to regular pro word-nerds we have
the utmost respect for and are usually extremely

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.900
helpful and polite- not to mention generally
vastly more flexible with language than their

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.750
Grammar Nazi counterparts- have, naturally,
created something of a perpetually open wound

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:24.120
for us on this one over the years.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:17:09.929
For instance, “anyways” is a word, dammit,
has been around in English since at least

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:49.450
the 13th century, and we have no plans to
stop using it- if 

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:59.239
for no other reason than out of unabashedly
petty spite.
