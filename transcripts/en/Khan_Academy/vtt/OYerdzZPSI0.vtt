00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Voiceover] Up to now we've talked about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.169
resistors and capacitors
and other components,

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:07.400
and we've connected them up

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.209
and learned about Ohm's
law, for resistors,

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.400
and we've also learned some
things about series resistors,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.922
like we show here.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:18.243
The idea of Kirchhoff's Laws,

00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:20.566
these are basically common sense laws

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.328
that we can derive from
looking at simple circuits,

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.047
and in this video we're gonna

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:29.558
work out Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:32.686
Let's take a look at these
series resistors here.

00:00:32.686 --> 00:00:34.869
There's a connection point right there,

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:37.580
and that's called a node, a junction.

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.158
And one of the things we know is that

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:45.934
when we put current through this,

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.196
let's say we put a current through here.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.018
And we know that current
is flowing charge,

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.840
so we know that the charge
does not collect anywhere.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.509
So that means it comes
out of this resistor

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:57.868
and flows into the node,

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:01.015
and that goes across and
it comes out on this side,

00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:04.579
all the current that comes in comes out.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:05.519
That's something we know,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.796
that's the conservation of charge,

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:10.018
and we know that the charge
does not pile up anywhere.

00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:13.966
We'll call this current i1.

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:17.007
And we'll call this current i2.

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:24.636
And we know, we can just write
right away, i1 equals i2.

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:31.270
That seems pretty clear from
our argument about charge.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.756
Now let me add something else here,

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.363
we'll add another resistor to our node.

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:38.131
Like that.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.173
And this now, there's gonna be
some current going this way.

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:43.305
Let's call that i3.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.676
And now this doesn't work anymore,

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:49.800
this i1 and i2 are not
necessarily the same.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.551
But what we do know is
any current that goes in

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.432
has to come out of this node.

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:59.412
So we can say that i1 equals i2 plus i3.

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:01.131
That seems pretty reasonable.

00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:03.975
And in general, what we have here isn't,

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.216
if we take all the current flowing in,

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:09.678
it equals all the current flowing out.

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:13.618
And that's Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:14.849
That's a one way to say it,

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.849
in mathematical notation,
we would say i in,

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:24.786
the summation of currents going in,

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.845
this is the summation sign,

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:31.310
is the summation of i out.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.476
That's one expression of
Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:42.345
So now I want to generalize
this a little bit.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:44.318
Let's say we have a node,

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:46.606
and we have some wires going into it,

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:49.096
here's some wires connecting up to a node.

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:52.288
And there's current going into each one.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.883
I'm gonna define the current arrows,

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.784
this looks a little odd,
but it's okay to do.

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:00.479
All going in.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.300
And what Kirchhoff's Current Law says

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.109
is that the sum of the currents

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.257
going into that node

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:11.458
has to be equal to zero.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.249
Let's work out how that works.

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.243
Let's say this is one
amp, and this is one amp,

00:03:18.243 --> 00:03:21.584
and this is one amp.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.918
And the question is, what is this one?

00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:27.936
What's that current there?

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:32.936
If I use my Kirchhoff's
Current Law, express this way,

00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:37.268
it says that one plus one plus one

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:42.268
plus i, whatever this i
here, has to equal zero.

00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:48.305
And what that says is
that i equals minus three.

00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:51.327
So that says, minus three amps flowing in

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:55.762
is the same exact thing as
plus three amps flowing out.

00:03:55.762 --> 00:03:58.770
So one amp, one amp, one amp comes in,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.472
three amperes flows out.

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:05.680
Another way we could do it, equally valid,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.513
this is just three ways to
say exactly the same thing.

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:13.152
I have a bunch of wires going
to a junction, like this.

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:16.361
And this time I define
the currents going out,

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.003
let's say I define them all going out.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.012
And this same thing works.

00:04:24.012 --> 00:04:26.739
The sum of the currents,

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:29.316
this time going out,

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:31.638
I'll go back over here, I'll write in,

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.320
all the currents going in.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.225
That has to equal zero as well.

00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:38.464
And you can do the same exercise,

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:41.131
if I make all these one amp,

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.602
and ask, what is this
one here, what is i here,

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:48.659
outgoing current,

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.562
it's one plus one plus one plus one,

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:55.245
those are the four that I know,

00:04:55.245 --> 00:04:57.811
and those are the ones going out,

00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:00.110
so what's the last one going
out, it has to equal zero.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.441
The last one has to be
minus four equals zero.

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:09.441
So this is a current
of minus four amperes.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.901
So that's the idea of
Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:13.597
It's basically,

00:05:13.597 --> 00:05:16.581
we've reasoned through
it from first principles,

00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:19.622
because everything that comes in

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.375
has to leave by some route,

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.175
and when we've talked about it that way,

00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:25.637
we ended up with this expression

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:28.179
for Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:30.467
And we can come up with a slightly smaller

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:33.125
mathematical expression, if we say,

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:36.236
let's define all the
currents to be pointing in.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.361
Some of them may turn out to be negative,

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:41.155
but then that's another way

00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:43.674
to write Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:45.253
And in the same way,

00:05:45.253 --> 00:05:46.717
if we define all the currents going out,

00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:48.656
and you actually have
your choice of any of

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:51.117
these three any time
you want to use these.

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:53.560
If we define them all going out.

00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:58.860
This is Kirchhoff's Current Law,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.804
and we'll use this all the time
when we do circuit analysis.
