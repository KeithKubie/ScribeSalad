&gt;&gt; Becky Baines:
Cold-- ah, sorry--

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.620
it was a cold mic for a second
but-- I think we're good to go.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.230
Hi guys. Good morning.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530
How's everybody doing?

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.860
Pretty good?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.730
My name is Becky Baines, and
I'm the Editorial Director

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.050
and Vice President of National
Geographic kid's books.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.530
First, I would like to thank
the Library of Congress so much

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.160
for sponsoring this
wonderful event.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.780
Are you guys having fun?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.230
Yes, yes. So, if you
haven't had a chance yet,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.250
I encourage everybody to stop
by our booth, which is S3,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.070
where you can do some
really cool code breaking.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.040
There's virtual reality,
where you can travel

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.410
to the Arenal rain forest.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.770
And of course, you can meet
our author, who you'll be dying

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.330
to meet after this presentation.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.910
So, I just want to give
you a little background.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.400
As an organization, we pride
ourselves on bringing facts,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
photos, fun, and all
things animal to kids.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.050
Or you guys familiar
with our animal books?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.630
Yeah? So, when we decided
to get into fiction,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.550
it's not something we
decided to do lightly.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
And actually, this is something
five years in the making now.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.080
But somewhere along the line,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.880
we realized that we have all
these super cool explorers,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.430
we have all these
amazing adventure stories,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.230
we have access to all this
really cool technology.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.800
And what if we could take
all that stuff and put it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.340
in a fictional world,
where you guys, the kids,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.770
are at the center of the action?

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.790
Does that sound cool?

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.750
So, we had this concept.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.460
And we decided, okay,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.380
we're going to make
this Explorer Academy.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.260
And it's a school where kids
can travel the world on a ship,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.440
they can dive with whales, they
can uncover ancient artifacts,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.250
they can scale mountains,
they can scale glaciers.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.590
And you can basically see
all this amazing planet has

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.910
to offer.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.860
So, what we needed next
was an author, right?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.280
You need someone to write it.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.860
So, we had all this cool
stuff, and we needed someone

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.500
who could take it and intertwine
in with a super cool kid heroes,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.290
top secret missions,
ancient codes and ciphers,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.800
and of course, a villainous
organization who's always

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.100
out to get them, right?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.860
Because you always
need a bad guy.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.560
So, there is so many twists and
turns in this story, you guys.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.570
Once you start reading, you
will not be able to stop.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.670
So, I am so pleased

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.420
that a journalist
turned TV News reporter,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.680
turn the TV weather woman,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.130
turned children's author
actually answered our call.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.070
Trudi Trueit has brought
awe inspiring science tech

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.540
and adventure of National
Geographic two life

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.650
in this pages turning
Explorer Academy.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.980
The first book is
'The Nebula Secret'.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.670
Through these fun, funny,
brilliant characters.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.070
And she created this
incredible futuristic world

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.370
where it all takes place.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.690
And once you read it, you guys
will imagine yourselves right

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.450
at the center of the action.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.560
And if you guys liked
which you see up here,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.110
I have a secret for you.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.350
This book actually doesn't
go on sale until Tuesday,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.310
but back at the bookstore,
we have some exclusive copies

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.560
that you guys can pick up today.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.820
And you can get it
signed by our author.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.140
Oh, we have one right there.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.560
You can get it signed
by our author,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.700
who will be at the
signing booth at 12:30.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.920
So don't miss out
on that opportunity.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.600
So, without further ado,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.510
I'd like to present our
author, Trudi Trueit.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.850
[ Applause ]

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.150
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Hi, everyone.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.960
Are you having a
good time today?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.060
Oh, it's so exciting for
me to be here and to talk

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000
about Explorer Academy.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.730
It is a series of seven books.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.840
And the first one will be
coming out September 4,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.600
but you guys get it today.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.010
And I wanted to start with a
little video of why I wanted

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.750
to write for National
Geographic,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.050
as if you needed to know.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.350
But let's play that.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.830
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: No?

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.530
No video. Okay, we'll
move along.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.830
There you go.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.820
Okay, so this is me when
I was eight years old.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.490
And I might not look
like it at the time.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.690
Because, you know, cat's
eye glasses weren't popular,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.530
not like they are now.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.620
But I loved reading and writing.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.170
And how many of you guys
love reading and writing too?

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.470
Put up your hands.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.770
Let's see how many.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.070
Oh, we have lots of
readers, wonderful.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.000
So, I started writing plays
when I was in the fourth grade.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.990
And I realized the
power words over people,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.900
that you could write words and
impact people and evoke emotion

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.200
and share your passion.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.500
And that's what I started doing.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.800
And then I became a journalist.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.750
And I worked as a TV
reporter for a while,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.050
and also a weather anchor.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.410
That's why I keep wanting
to do this all the time.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.930
But, so I started
writing children's books

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.230
because I would go
around to schools

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.690
and I would talk
about the weather.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.910
And we would talk about
clouds and rain and rainbows,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.650
and how the weather worked.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.760
And I loved talking to
classes so much that I decided

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.060
to write a weather book.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.100
And I submitted it,
and of course,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.800
Nobody really wanted
to publish it.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.140
But, Scholastic came to me
and said, 'How would you

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.580
like to write four
weather books?'

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.550
And I said I would
love to do that.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.480
So, I started writing
nonfiction.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.700
And you may know
of me, hopefully,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.660
from nonfiction books
in your library.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.360
If you go back to your school
library, look up my name and see

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.550
if you can find some
of my nonfiction work.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.880
Because I've done everything
from animals to health

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.860
to wildlife to video games.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.930
I can even show you how to make
things out of Popsicle sticks

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.230
to give your mom
for Mother's Day.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.870
And along that same route, I
also started doing fiction,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.210
and I wrote a couple
of fiction series,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.300
one of them called 'Julep
O' Toole' and 'Secrets

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.110
of a Lab Rat' was the
second series that I wrote.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.670
And I wrote those for
Simon and Schuster.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.790
And it was just such a
wonderful opportunity to be able

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.630
to do both fiction
and nonfiction.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.550
And I did that for
the longest time.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.220
So, when National
Geographic came along,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.500
it was the perfect
opportunity to take what I knew

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.430
about writing nonfiction and
when I knew about fiction

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.900
and put them together.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.280
So, let me tell you a little
bit about Explorer Academy.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.840
Explorer Academy is the story
of 12 year old Cruz Coronado.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.020
And he has been accepted into
a very elite school for tours.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.700
And he's going to
travel around the world,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.150
learning about all different
kinds of issues and things

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.490
that are going on in the world.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.370
He's going to travel to faraway
places and talk to animals

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.170
and get involved in
preserving the earth.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.430
And he's going to do it
with 23 very good friends.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.080
And along the way,
Cruz has a mystery

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.510
that he's going to solve.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.110
And you, as the reader, are
going to help him solve it.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.060
Because you get to
crack the clues

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.050
and the puzzles along with Cruz.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.390
So now I have a book trailer.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.780
Let's see if we can
watch the book trailer.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.810
Still nothing?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.350
No, we don't even have a book
[inaudible] I'm so sorry.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.540
If you go to my website,
truditreuit.com,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.560
you can watch the book trailer
because it is so amazing.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.950
Alright, so what inspired
me to write this series?

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.930
Well, really it was
the explorers

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.640
of National Geographic.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.070
All the archeologists
and the marine biologists

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.840
and the scientists of National
Geographic inspired me.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.010
Now in the book, Cruz
and his friends get

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.460
to do augmented reality.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.760
So, you know what that is?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.470
That's like virtual reality.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.850
They get to go to what's
called a computer animated

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.650
virtual experience.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.670
And they get to explore things

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.710
without really ever
leaving home.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.420
And that's how they
learn how to train.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.710
And so, I had to create
some interesting things

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.530
for Explorer Academy.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.690
And one of those things that I
thought would be fun would be--

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.570
because I wore glasses
as a kid and I still do--

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.630
glasses that change color
and shape with your emotion.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.470
So, I see a few kids
here wearing glasses.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.860
Can you imagine what it would
be like if you were angry

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.150
and your glasses got red and
started, you know, spewing fire?

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.650
And I thought this would
be really fun to do.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.990
And what I found out
is that explorers

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.230
at National Geographic are
already doing something very

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.530
similar to that.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.940
There are scientists that are
already working on materials

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.400
that can actually change color
and shape and texture based

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.460
on your environment and
based on h ow you feel.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.060
And say if it's raining outside,
you could actually have a coat

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.360
that automatically
opens on its own.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.550
So, I found some pretty amazing
technology is already happening

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.850
right now.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.490
It's not even science fiction.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.710
So, Cruz has a honeybee
drone, and her name is Mel.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.620
And she goes with
him everywhere.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.480
And again, I thought,
well, you know,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.590
there's still a little
bit science fiction.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.730
But in actuality, scientists
are already doing this.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.450
They are already developing--
you see on the left-hand side--

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.810
there already developing
tiny drones.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.180
And these drones can go into
places that people can't go.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.100
Like to search and rescue
and to earthquake areas.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.040
They're also used
for medical purposes.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.340
So, science and science
fiction isn't that far apart.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.670
So, one of the key elements

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.410
of Explorer Academy is
Cruz's mother was working

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.650
on a secret formula
when she was killed

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.340
in a mysterious lab accident.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.140
And I decided to use what
I knew about snake venom

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.680
and scorpion venom
and animal venoms

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.900
in general as a key plot point.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.480
Because we're using those for
medicinal purposes in science.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.170
And one of the explorers
that helped me with that,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.950
his name is Zoltan Takacs.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.790
And Zoltan is here today.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.090
So, if you head on over

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.040
to the National Geographic
booth this afternoon, at 2:30

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.280
and 4:00, were going to do a
little presentation together.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.580
He will talk about
all things snakes,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.160
which kind of scares me a little
bit, but I only have to write

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.880
The material, I don't
have to hold the snakes.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.000
So, a little behind the
scenes of Explorer Academy.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.480
We tried a couple of
different covers and this is--

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.790
the big one on the right--
that's the one we chose based

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.490
on what you guys liked and what
we thought really represented

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.640
action and adventure
in Explorer Academy.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.380
And I kind of like
that cover too.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.770
And one of the things
I do when I write,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.540
is I tent to doodle
the characters.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.680
So, I have a little
bulletin board

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.380
where I put the characters up.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.700
And so, those are my doodles
of the main characters.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.680
And you can see what our
illustrator, Scott Plumbe did.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.940
His illustrations are
much better than mine.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.880
And there's lots of
illustrations in the book.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.600
And what's really cool
about it is, there's plenty

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.260
of places for imagination.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.430
But he's also done a
really terrific job

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.530
at illustrating throughout
the book as well.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.020
So those are the
main characters.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.080
Cruz is the big picture,
and then his friends.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.180
Emmet is on the right.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.870
Lonnie is on the top.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.720
And then Sailor is
on the bottom.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.370
I also had to draw a boat.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.470
Because in book two,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.270
the explorers head
off around the world.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.010
So that's my drawing
of the boat.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.310
And again, take a look

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.260
at Scott's illustration
in the book.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.100
So much better than mine.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.750
So, with Explorer
Academy, my goal really was

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.940
to tell a great adventure story,
have you guys been excited

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.670
about exploring in the world,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.790
and finding maybe
even your passion.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.590
Because maybe one
of you guys sitting

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.440
out there is the
next great scientist

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:46.050
to discover something
amazing and to get involved

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.160
in conservation issues and to
make difference in the world.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.220
Because the future is really
what you guys make of it.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.660
So, that's Explorer Academy.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.360
And do you guys have
questions for me?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.940
I think we have microphones,
right?

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.660
So, if you head out to the
side and you can ask a question

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.970
about Explorer Academy
or reading or science.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.130
Oh, we have a few questions.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.520
Yeah?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.090
&gt;&gt; Who's your favorite
character in Explorer Academy?

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.390
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Oh, you know,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.890
actually my favorite character
is the honeybee drone.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.910
Because her name is
Mel and she gets Cruz

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.420
out of a lot of trouble.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.150
So, he gets stuck in some places

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.130
and Mel comes along
and saves him.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.970
My human favorite character
this probably his best friend,

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.270
Lonnie.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.770
She didn't get accepted into
the academy in the first book,

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.640
so she has to-- they
converse long distance.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.690
But she helps him out
of a lot of trouble.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.230
And she also eventually
will be able to make her way

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.120
into the academy, which, you
guys only know that first

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.650
because most people
don't know that.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.170
Yeah, thank you for
the question.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.470
Yeah?

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.960
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
that you created

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.610
and is there any competitions?

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.910
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Is
there any competitions?

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.210
You mean write the book?

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.010
&gt;&gt; No, where do you
get the books?

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.310
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Where
do I get my ideas?

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.910
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Well, you know,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.630
I get my ideas from
a lot of places.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.470
I'm really a Star Trek geek
and I love science fiction.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.190
I love adventure stories.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.260
And, of course, I
give my inspiration

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.460
from the National
Geographic explorers.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.900
If you go to the National
Geographic's website--

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:50.650
&gt;&gt; My friend Alex, her mom works

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.710
at National Geographic
in Washington, DC.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.220
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Oh,
that's wonderful.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.240
&gt;&gt; And one last thing.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.200
Who is your illustrator?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.010
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: My illustrator,
his name is Scott Plumbe.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.860
And he is from Vancouver
British Columbia I think.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.160
I think he's from Canada.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.460
He's really good.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.760
I really like his work.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.520
&gt;&gt; I like mythology.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:22.150
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Thank
you for your question.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:27.090
&gt;&gt; So, what inspired you to
write about the new book?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.090
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: What
inspired me to write what book?

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.890
&gt;&gt; About the book that
you were showing us.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.190
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit:
What inspired me?

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.490
Well, there's so many things.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.180
I love adventure stories.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.510
And so, when I was a kid, I used
to read all kinds of adventure.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.580
I love science fiction.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.840
I love being able to--
I love animals too.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.090
So, it's a great fun
to be able to bring all

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.830
of those things together and
just, you know, have the kids go

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.460
out on an amazing
adventure together and learn

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.940
about the world and
discover new animals.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.240
I mean, that's so
inspiring to me.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.070
But what the real National
Geographic explorers do,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.370
that really inspires me.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.020
&gt;&gt; The honeybee drone, Mel,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.860
really made me remember
something about drones

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.570
that they are trying to make
as spies, pets for people

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:29.190
who can't really have
pets, like living animals.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.990
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit:
Robotics is really huge.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.690
Yeah. And it's amazing what
they're doing in the field

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.110
of drones, robotics,
all the things that--

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.440
I mean, some of the technology
in the book, I used the power

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.930
of your mind to do things.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.270
There is-- they have
mind control cameras.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.710
So, you put a tiny
little camera in front

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.610
of your eyes then you
take a picture based

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.500
on what you say in your brain.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.530
We're really actually
not that far away

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.070
from doing things like that.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.950
So that's pretty cool.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.930
Thanks for your question.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:08.220
&gt;&gt; Have you ever read a book
about the Galápagos Island?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.820
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: About
what, the Galápagos?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.420
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: You
know, I haven't written

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.360
about the Galápagos islands,
but I have written books

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.950
about snakes, alligators,
turtles, reptiles, octopuses.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.650
My biggest book, one
of my biggest sellers,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.470
in a book on octopuses.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.160
They have all this strange,
weird octopuses that are

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.460
out there in the world.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.810
So, I love wildlife
and I love nature.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.240
One of the Explorer Academy
books will be devoted

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.540
to ocean life.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.840
So, they just spend
the whole time

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.410
in the ocean under the water.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.650
And I'm hoping that they
can swim with the turtles

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.420
and have a good time doing that.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.720
Yeah.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.100
&gt;&gt; Well I like reading
Nat Geo kids.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.070
And I notice some of
your work is in there.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.750
I read a sneak peek.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.180
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Thank you.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:08.470
&gt;&gt; And I'm just wondering,
did you write the bits

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.380
for Nat Geo kid's magazine?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.220
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: I
may have had a hand

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.580
in writing a little bit of it.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.290
I only did an interview
with them, but I think most

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.330
of that was probably
written by the staff,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.550
may be taking some
things from the book.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.380
We kind of worked together
on some of the items.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.820
But did you-- you saw the
issue where it had all

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.860
of the sneak peek of the
Explorer Academy and all that?

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really liked that.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.820
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Thank you.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.400
I hope you like the book too.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.550
Thanks for your question.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.860
&gt;&gt; What inspired
you to write books?

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.080
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: What
inspired me to write books?

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.890
I just loved reading as a kid.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.360
And so, when I was your age,
I read, and read, and read.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.760
And I used to bring home a stack
of books from the library so big

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.230
that I could barely fit
them into my backpack.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.240
And I always have loved books.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.150
I didn't always know that
I would write for children.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.120
But when I got a chance
to go visit classrooms

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.420
as a weather forecaster,
you guys always had

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.410
such great questions, and
you are always so fascinated

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.830
and curious, that I just had to.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.930
I just had to start
writing for children.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.300
I just love two write for kids.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.600
Thank you.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.040
Good question.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.730
&gt;&gt; How long did it take
you to write the book?

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.910
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: It
took about six months.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.590
And we're releasing a
book every six months.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.940
So, I have to keep moving.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.980
But the second book
will be out next spring.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.440
And then the third book will
be out the following fall.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.520
So, about five to six months.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.820
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.620
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Good
question, thanks.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.650
&gt;&gt; What was your first
book that you wrote?

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.340
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: My first
book was the one that was

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.090
up here called, 'Clouds', that
I showed in the beginning.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.010
It was all about
different cloud formations

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.070
and how the clouds are formed.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.490
And then I wrote about three
other books for Scholastic

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.840
on storm chasing and water
cycle and rain, hail,

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.950
and snow so that kids who
went to the library to learn

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.340
about weather or if you
wanted to write a report,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.800
you could check out
one of my books.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.380
So that was the first
book I ever wrote.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.730
Then I was hooked.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.830
&gt;&gt; How did you organize your
ideas for the first book?

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.360
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Good question.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.100
So, what I like to do is, I
like to outline the story.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.760
And I get an idea, and I
actually where I want each book

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.110
to go so that I know throughout
the series what is going

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.410
to happen in every book.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.150
And then I do a more intense
outline for the first book.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.730
Kind of where I want it to
start, how I want it to end,

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.610
and then where I want the kids
to be in the middle of the book.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.170
And then you just sit down
every day and you write.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.860
And sometimes, the characters
tell you different things,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.120
they go different places, they
have different ideas than you,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.420
and I have to let them be

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.760
who they are.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.600
But it does help
to have an outline.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.390
Because then I know where I
want to start and pretty much

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:11.320
where I want to finish up too.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.510
Thanks for your question.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.050
&gt;&gt; Did you get tired
of writing books?

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:20.350
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Did I what?

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.320
&gt;&gt; Get tired of writing books?

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.840
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Tired
of writing-- oh, no.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.090
I never get tired
of writing books.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.780
I get tired of other things
like deadlines when I have

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.010
to turn the book in if I
don't get done in time.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.870
But I never get tired
of writing books.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.900
I hope I'm writing
books forever.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.200
Yeah, I love books.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.410
As long as you guys keep
reading, we're good.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.790
&gt;&gt; How much books do you have?

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.090
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: How
many books do I have?

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.160
I have over 100 books in print.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.400
I think the Explorer Academy
is 103 but I'm not sure.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.390
I kind of figured I'd
stop counting at 100.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.440
So, most of them are nonfiction.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.520
But I have about
nine that are fiction

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.460
and Explorer Academy
is the tenth.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.840
And I love, like I said, I love
nonfiction, I love learning.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.810
So, it's great to
be able to do both.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.800
Good questions.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.360
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
sea creature?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.310
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: My
favorite sea creature?

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:25.810
I'm going to go-- it's a tossup
between the Dumbo octopus

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.710
and the Vampire squid.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.010
But I like them both.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.420
I like octopuses a lot.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.270
Because they're really smart

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.020
and they're clever
and they're creative.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.100
And when I was doing my book on
octopuses-- I'm from Seattle.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.550
And I went to a Seattle aquarium
and I talked to a biologist.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.880
And he told me just how
smart the octopuses were

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.180
at the aquarium.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.470
He said that they had
an octopus name Clyde.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.080
And they noticed that
the other exhibits

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.750
around Clyde seemed
to be disappearing.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.290
The other fish and
the crab were missing.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.940
And they put a camera on Clyde

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.190
and they realized Clyde was
leaving his exhibit at night

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.510
and going into the other
exhibits and eating them.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:11.490
And that's when I realized that
these animals are really cool.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.370
They're very clever,
they're very smart.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.000
They can open jars.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.270
My sister is a diver
and she went diving once

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.830
and an octopus came along
and took her flashlight

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.400
and swam away with it.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.920
She never saw it again.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.530
It just went away.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.280
So, I love octopuses a lot.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.990
I have to figure out a way to
get them into Explorer Academy.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.710
So, I have a couple
minutes left.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.710
Are there more questions?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.790
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
part about creating a book?

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.090
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit:
My favorite part

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.200
about creating a book really
is starting with page one.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.760
I love a blank page.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.840
Because at that point,
you can do anything.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.070
You can have the
characters go anywhere,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.110
say anything, do anything.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.080
And it's exciting to me
to write that first page.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.380
I love that part.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.490
The hardest part-- because I bet
you're going to ask that too--

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.590
is ending a series
or ending a book.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.290
It's hard to say
goodbye to characters

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.950
that you spent so
much time with.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.800
Good questions, you guys.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.100
Yeah?

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.900
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite
book you've made?

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.200
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit:
My favorite book?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.280
Well, I have to say
Explorer Academy.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.580
Usually the book
that I'm working

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.180
on now is my favorite book.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.220
And I love Explorer Academy

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.540
because it combines all the
things that I love to do.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.040
In nonfiction and fiction,
and adventure and science.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.740
It's a perfect combination
for me.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.090
I love doing Explorer Academy.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.290
&gt;&gt; What inspired
you to write books?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.450
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: So many things.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.980
I just really enjoy words.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.020
I enjoyed telling stories.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.300
My parents can tell you I
was telling them stories

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.640
when I was really young,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.520
and they were really
tired of hearing it.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.560
But I just love storytelling.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.220
I love reading.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:58.430
And to be able to do an
adventure series is so exciting.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.490
I'm, you know, thrilled
to be able to do that.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.140
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit:
You're very welcome.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.440
Thank you.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.170
&gt;&gt; What challenges did you
face writing this book?

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.470
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Good question.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.410
There were a lot of challenges
in writing an adventure

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.520
because you want it to be fast
paced, really interesting.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.850
You want them to go
through a lot of challenges.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.150
But at the same time,
you want to be able

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.580
to develop the characters too

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.120
and have good relationships
and good friendships.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.060
So, yeah, it is, at times it
can be a challenge to make sure

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.360
that you have a lot of action.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.950
Because you don't
want it to be boring.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.410
But you also want the
characters to develop

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.000
and get to know one another.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.390
And so, pacing a book can be
a little bit of a challenge.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:40.780
That's a really good question.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.710
So, I want to make sure
I'm not going too fast.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.260
But you also don't
want to go too slow.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.260
So, you find kind of
that middle ground

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.530
where you're telling
the story at a good pace

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.200
and allowing the
characters to develop

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.880
and have relationships
with each other.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.340
So, yeah. That's
always a challenge,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.280
pacing is a big challenge
in a book.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.910
&gt;&gt; How many books will be in
the Explorer Academy series?

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.470
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: We're planning
for seven books in the series.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.380
And the first book, you
know, is coming out now.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.940
The second book will
be out next spring.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.400
And so, every six months, we
will release another book.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.920
And right now, I'm working
on book number four.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.340
So, you can tell, I'm already
halfway through the series.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.170
So, thank you for coming.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.470
Do you have closing--

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.770
&gt;&gt; Becky Baines: I was
just going to say that I'm

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.620
so sorry we ran out
of time for questions.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.130
But Trudi will be at the
signing booth at 12:30.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.450
So if you have any
more questions,

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.920
she's happy to answer them.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.280
And also, she'll l be at our
booth all day, which is S3.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.480
She'll be doing mini
presentations

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.120
up on our stage in there.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.810
So, feel free to come by
and talk to her anytime.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.630
&gt;&gt; Trudi Trueit: Yeah and
thank you so much you guys.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.200
Come on by, say hi let
me know what you think.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.580
