00:00:00.513 --> 00:00:03.854
I have the complex number
cosine of two pi over three,

00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:07.292
or two thirds pi, plus
i sine of two thirds pi

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:09.313
and I'm going to raise
that to the 20th power.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.388
What I want to do is first
plot this number in blue

00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:14.652
on the complex plane, and
then figure out what it is

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:17.296
raised to the 20th power
and then try to plot that.

00:00:17.564 --> 00:00:19.249
I encourage you to
pause this video and try

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.329
this out on your own
before I work through it.

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:25.924
Let's first focus on this
blue complex number over here.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:27.716
It's clearly written in polar form.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:35.827
The angle is two thirds pi
or two pi over three radians.

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:40.808
And it's magnitude of this
complex number is clearly one.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:42.559
To make that a little clearer
you could write it in the

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.359
pure polar form where you
have its magnitude out front.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.200
It's cosine of two over three pi

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.592
plus i sine of two over three pi.

00:00:55.302 --> 00:00:57.061
You could write it just like that.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:59.512
When you look at that the
angle is two over three pi.

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:01.246
That would get us, let's see.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.403
This is zero, this is pi, we're going

00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:04.939
to go two thirds of the way to pi.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.794
Each of these is one, two, three, four,

00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:11.062
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:16.063
Each of these is pi over
12 so we're going to go,

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:19.090
two thirds of the way would
be eight pis over twelve.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.313
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:28.105
The way I was able to reason
through that is two thirds pi

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:32.185
is the same thing as eight pi over twelve.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:33.684
Each of these segments is pi over 12

00:01:33.684 --> 00:01:35.111
so I just counted eight of them.

00:01:35.403 --> 00:01:37.764
That's that number, but now let's

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:42.137
try to raise it to the 20th power.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:47.545
To do that we're going
to use Euler's formula.

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:50.606
Euler's formula, you might remember,

00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:54.609
tells us that e to the i theta is equal to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.390
cosine of theta plus i sine of theta.

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:03.402
You see right over here
this is already written

00:02:03.402 --> 00:02:06.087
in that form where theta is two thirds pi.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.204
We can rewrite what we have in blue

00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:16.808
here as e to the two thirds pi i.

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.714
Then of course we're raising
that to the 20th power.

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:24.448
This simplifies things
dramatically because

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.948
here if I tried to
multiply this thing times-

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:29.932
If I had 20 of these things
and I multiplied them together

00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:32.263
that would get really, really,
really hairy really fast,

00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.519
but here I can just use
exponent properties.

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.772
This is going to be the
same thing as e to the,

00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:39.972
if I raise something to
exponent and then raise that to

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.523
an exponent I can just take
the product of the exponents.

00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:50.364
This is e to the 20 times
two over three pi i,

00:02:50.644 --> 00:03:00.035
which is equal to e to
the 40 over three pi i.

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:05.256
Now this is this number
raised to the 20th power

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:08.528
but this is an awfully
large angle right here.

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.098
If we're thinking of 40 over three pi,

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:12.338
let's just try to digest this.

00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:17.289
40 over three pi, this
is the same thing as-

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.005
Let's see, 40 divided
three is 13 and one third.

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:26.301
This is the same thing as
13 and one third times pi.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:30.379
We know that going two pi radians gets you

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.896
around the unit circle
once, so this is going

00:03:32.896 --> 00:03:37.050
over six times around
the unit circle to get-

00:03:37.972 --> 00:03:39.492
Or around, I should say,
not the unit circle,

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:43.832
going six times around, going in circles

00:03:43.832 --> 00:03:46.130
in order to get to the point we want to.

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:49.945
In order to simplify this a
little bit let me subtract

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:54.037
the largest multiple of
two pi that I could figure,

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:56.908
to get this in as small
of a form as possible.

00:03:57.188 --> 00:04:01.638
We know an angle, if we have
some angle it's equal to that

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:07.497
angle plus some multiple of
two pi where k is any integer.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.810
k could also be negative, we could

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.782
be subtracting a multiple of two pi.

00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:13.750
Let me subtract, let's see.
The largest multiple of

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.581
two pi that I could subtract
here is going to be 12 pi.

00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:21.639
Let me subtract 12 pi from this.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.607
If I subtract 12 pi, I'll do it down here.

00:04:25.857 --> 00:04:31.250
13 and one third pi minus 12 pi.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.050
Remember, I'm just trying to subtract the

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:34.283
largest multiple of two pi that I can.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:44.237
13 and one third minus
twelve is one and one third.

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:47.223
That's going to be one and one third pi,

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:50.192
or we could write it as four thirds pi.

00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.939
This complex number is going to be

00:04:54.177 --> 00:05:00.006
equivalent to e to the four thirds pi i.

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.705
This makes it much simpler and
much easier for me to plot.

00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:07.096
Four thirds pi, or the same
thing as one and one third pi.

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.973
This would be pi, and now
we have to just go another

00:05:10.973 --> 00:05:13.360
one third pi, and each of these are 12ths.

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:18.252
If we go four 12ths pi. Sorry,
each of these are pi over 12,

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.220
so we go four pi over 12.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.221
One, two, three, four
gets us right over there.

00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:29.007
This number raised to
the 20th power is this,

00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:30.351
which is equivalent to this,

00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:32.241
which we've plotted right over there.

00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.789
What if we wanted to take it
to, let's say the 21st power.

00:05:37.227 --> 00:05:40.709
Then we would increase
the angle by another

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:43.913
two pi over three or eight pi over 12.

00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.365
We'd increase the angle by
one, two, three, four, five,

00:05:47.365 --> 00:05:50.741
six, seven, eight. And we
would go right over there.

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:52.913
How does this make conceptual sense?

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:56.729
The number to the first
power was right over here,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.117
that was our original number
is blue right over here.

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:00.977
If you raise it to the second power then

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:03.805
you're increasing the
angle by two thirds pi,

00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:05.242
you're increasing the angle to go there.

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.150
You raise it to the
third power, you increase

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.137
the angle by two thirds
pi, you go over there.

00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:11.055
Fourth power you get back here.

00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:13.585
Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:18.038
10th, 11th, 12th, 13th,
14th, 15th, 16th, 17,

00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:23.163
18, 19, 20th power gets
us right over there.
