00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.926
This election made me feel as
excited as Steve Harvey.

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:11.887
Hosting Family Feud when there's
two white families that day.

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:15.015
But now that it's over let's
stop saying the two candidates
were similar.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.143
Hilary may be everything that's
wrong with politics.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.355
But Trump is everything that is
wrong with humanity.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.774
The difference between them is
the difference between.

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:27.194
Getting fucked in the ass by a
person who knows how to properly
fuck you in the ass.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:29.571
Because they watched someone
else do it well for eight years.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.241
And getting fucked in the eye
socket by a belligerent failure.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.784
Who at the age of 70 decided-

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:37.704
"Hey it mught be fun to start
fucking people in the eye
socket"

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:43.043
And honestly getting fucked in
the eye socket doesn't seem like
the worst idea right now.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.838
Cos at least then I won't have
to see just how terrible things
are gonna get. 

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.971
Certain people don't get
Superman.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.056
Including the entire team of
people.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.475
That are currently making his
movies.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.187
They think Superman is just a
goofy dope with his underwear on
the outside.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.482
That gets outshined by any other
hero on screen.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.900
Not true!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.361
Superman is a hard working
illegal alien.

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.321
From far far away.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.116
That got adopted by two nice old
white poeple from Kansas.

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:16.535
That didn't even teach him to be
racist.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.788
That's way more impressive than
a sad billionare named Bruce.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:22.833
Who's only power is not being
able to let go of some sad shit.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.626
That happened 30 years ago.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:30.590
Get over it!

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.342
Award shoes are overly long.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.052
Masturbatory.

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:36.221
And overlook great outside of
the box projects.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.098
Because they dont feature
slavery....Aids...

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.182
Or the Holocost.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.184
But they aren't meanigless.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.061
For every person that wins.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.855
There's a pile of loosers.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.859
Soalking in tuxedos knowing they
won't get the perfect kind of
blowjob.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.363
You only receive when you thank
your wife in an acceptance
speech.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.700
And there is a lot of meeting
and watching people who look
better than you.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.202
And make more money than you be
sad.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.705
And feel like as much as a
failure as you are.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.791
Which is a really positive way
of thinking about it.
