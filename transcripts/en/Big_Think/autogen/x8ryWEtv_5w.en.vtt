in the moment we're talking a lot about
 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.620
in the moment we're talking a lot about
reform and the potential now to build

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
reform and the potential now to build
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.509
reform and the potential now to build
down the carceral state and we've

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
down the carceral state and we've
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.560
down the carceral state and we've
ignored or overlooked places where it's

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
ignored or overlooked places where it's
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.540
ignored or overlooked places where it's
rapidly growing and so what we're seeing

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
rapidly growing and so what we're seeing
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.420
rapidly growing and so what we're seeing
now is law enforcement and immigration

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430
now is law enforcement and immigration
 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.700
now is law enforcement and immigration
enforcement are colliding or converging

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
enforcement are colliding or converging
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.620
enforcement are colliding or converging
where they used to be quite separate

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
where they used to be quite separate
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.230
where they used to be quite separate
systems and we're essentially

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240
systems and we're essentially
 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.070
systems and we're essentially
criminalizing the enforcement of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
criminalizing the enforcement of
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.130

deported for minor violations or for
violations that they committed many

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
violations that they committed many
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250
violations that they committed many
years ago and have not committed a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
years ago and have not committed a
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340
years ago and have not committed a
serious crime since then now what we're

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
serious crime since then now what we're
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010
serious crime since then now what we're
seeing is very similar I feel like we're

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
seeing is very similar I feel like we're
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260
seeing is very similar I feel like we're
living through the 1960s and 70s again

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
living through the 1960s and 70s again
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.310
living through the 1960s and 70s again
where we criminalized race in the 1960s

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
where we criminalized race in the 1960s
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190
where we criminalized race in the 1960s
and 70s and now this great unease that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
and 70s and now this great unease that
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920
and 70s and now this great unease that
we have in this society and anxiety has

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
we have in this society and anxiety has
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020
we have in this society and anxiety has
landed on immigrants and that's even

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
landed on immigrants and that's even
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.960
landed on immigrants and that's even
prior to Isis and the San Bernardino

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
prior to Isis and the San Bernardino
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940
prior to Isis and the San Bernardino
killings and things like that and so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
killings and things like that and so
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.010
killings and things like that and so
we've created this misperception now

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
we've created this misperception now
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.190
we've created this misperception now
that immigrants bring crime and increase

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
that immigrants bring crime and increase
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.740
that immigrants bring crime and increase
crime rates when the data actually tells

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
crime rates when the data actually tells
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.679
crime rates when the data actually tells
us that immigrant populations suppress

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689
us that immigrant populations suppress
 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.889
us that immigrant populations suppress
crime rates in gateway cities and in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
crime rates in gateway cities and in
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.179
crime rates in gateway cities and in
cities that are not gateways for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
cities that are not gateways for
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219
cities that are not gateways for
gateways for immigrants but smaller

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
gateways for immigrants but smaller
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530
gateways for immigrants but smaller
cities they neither suppress nor

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
cities they neither suppress nor
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389
cities they neither suppress nor
increase the crime rate but we've

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
increase the crime rate but we've
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240
increase the crime rate but we've
created this misimpression now that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
created this misimpression now that
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219
created this misimpression now that
immigrants are bringing lots of crime to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
immigrants are bringing lots of crime to
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499
immigrants are bringing lots of crime to
the United States and are destabilizing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
the United States and are destabilizing
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.410
the United States and are destabilizing
force I think one point it's important

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
force I think one point it's important
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.999
force I think one point it's important
to make is that the largest population

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
to make is that the largest population
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.160
to make is that the largest population
now in the federal prison system are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
now in the federal prison system are
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320
now in the federal prison system are
Hispanics they're the largest plurality

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
Hispanics they're the largest plurality
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.900
Hispanics they're the largest plurality
larger than whites and larger than

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
larger than whites and larger than
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.090
larger than whites and larger than
african-americans

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100
african-americans
 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.880
african-americans
and many of them are there for

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
and many of them are there for
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.800
and many of them are there for
immigration related offenses so again

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
immigration related offenses so again
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.450
immigration related offenses so again
when we try to think about the carceral

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460
when we try to think about the carceral
 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.300
when we try to think about the carceral
state in black/white terms we really

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
state in black/white terms we really
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310
state in black/white terms we really
need to think about immigration because

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
need to think about immigration because
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.220
need to think about immigration because
again drug crimes fueled a lot of the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230
again drug crimes fueled a lot of the
 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.170
again drug crimes fueled a lot of the
growth of the federal prison system but

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
growth of the federal prison system but
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.110
growth of the federal prison system but
immigration crimes are fueling much more

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
immigration crimes are fueling much more
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.700
immigration crimes are fueling much more
and the other thing to think about

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
and the other thing to think about
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.520
and the other thing to think about
immigration is that if we care about

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
immigration is that if we care about
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.770
immigration is that if we care about
crime and we care about protecting our

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780
crime and we care about protecting our
 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.220
crime and we care about protecting our
borders prosecuting so many petty

borders prosecuting so many petty
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.340
