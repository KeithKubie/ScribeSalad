00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
reason why I did it but one of my
 

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.970 align:start position:0%
reason why I did it but one of my
theories<00:12:05.839><c> is</c><00:12:06.200><c> that</c>

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:06.980 align:start position:0%
theories is that
 

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.610 align:start position:0%
theories is that
and<00:12:07.370><c> she</c><00:12:08.330><c> goes</c><00:12:08.510><c> more</c><00:12:08.810><c> nuts</c><00:12:09.020><c> he</c><00:12:09.260><c> wanted</c><00:12:09.500><c> to</c>

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:09.620 align:start position:0%
and she goes more nuts he wanted to
 

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.990 align:start position:0%
and she goes more nuts he wanted to

separate her from the rest of the pack
 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
separate her from the rest of the pack
and<00:12:11.180><c> I</c><00:12:11.240><c> think</c><00:12:11.450><c> it</c><00:12:11.570><c> does</c><00:12:11.750><c> that</c><00:12:11.779><c> because</c><00:12:12.110><c> she's</c>

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:12.770 align:start position:0%

think it was really intentional no
you're<00:12:38.420><c> probably</c><00:12:38.600><c> right</c><00:12:38.870><c> because</c><00:12:39.079><c> as</c><00:12:39.260><c> she</c>

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.290 align:start position:0%
you're probably right because as she
 

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.010 align:start position:0%
you're probably right because as she

right<00:12:42.140><c> the</c><00:12:42.260><c> fire</c><00:12:42.440><c> changes</c><00:12:42.800><c> color</c><00:12:43.010><c> and</c><00:12:43.220><c> becomes</c>

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
right the fire changes color and becomes
 

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
right the fire changes color and becomes

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:45.890 align:start position:0%
less warm and more cold and thus it
 

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%

it's a good trick though I see it used
 

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.769 align:start position:0%
it's a good trick though I see it used
sometimes<00:15:24.420><c> and</c><00:15:25.019><c> it's</c><00:15:25.230><c> really</c><00:15:25.769><c> effective</c><00:15:26.339><c> I</c>

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:26.779 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it's really effective I
 

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:28.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it's really effective I
because<00:15:27.779><c> I</c><00:15:27.899><c> think</c><00:15:27.959><c> there's</c><00:15:28.230><c> some</c>

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:28.350 align:start position:0%
because I think there's some
 

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.429 align:start position:0%
because I think there's some

nuts and then the music just going yeah
the<00:15:38.250><c> music</c><00:15:38.610><c> takes</c><00:15:39.029><c> over</c><00:15:39.480><c> entirely</c><00:15:39.839><c> to</c><00:15:40.110><c> the</c>

the music takes over entirely to the

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.369 align:start position:0%
point that there is lightsaber sounds
but<00:15:42.029><c> it's</c><00:15:42.149><c> like</c><00:15:42.240><c> they</c><00:15:42.389><c> tuned</c><00:15:42.839><c> it</c><00:15:43.019><c> down</c><00:15:43.199><c> a</c><00:15:43.230><c> bit</c>

00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:43.379 align:start position:0%
but it's like they tuned it down a bit
 

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
but it's like they tuned it down a bit
and<00:15:43.470><c> let</c><00:15:43.620><c> the</c><00:15:43.740><c> music</c><00:15:43.949><c> just</c><00:15:44.069><c> take</c><00:15:44.399><c> over</c><00:15:44.699><c> and</c>

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:44.910 align:start position:0%
and let the music just take over and
 

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.369 align:start position:0%
and let the music just take over and
then<00:15:45.000><c> the</c><00:15:45.209><c> choir</c><00:15:45.389><c> do</c><00:15:45.660><c> something</c><00:15:46.019><c> somewhere</c>

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:46.379 align:start position:0%
then the choir do something somewhere
 

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:48.290 align:start position:0%
then the choir do something somewhere
here<00:15:46.589><c> and</c><00:15:46.709><c> it</c><00:15:46.769><c> really</c><00:15:47.220><c> really</c><00:15:47.610><c> works</c><00:15:47.790><c> and</c>

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
here and it really really works and
 

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
here and it really really works and
again<00:15:48.480><c> I</c><00:15:48.540><c> separates</c><00:15:49.230><c> that</c><00:15:49.350><c> scene</c><00:15:49.769><c> I</c><00:15:50.069><c> think</c>

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:50.370 align:start position:0%
again I separates that scene I think
 

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
again I separates that scene I think
that<00:15:50.670><c> really</c><00:15:50.850><c> works</c><00:15:51.060><c> in</c><00:15:51.420><c> something</c><00:15:51.810><c> like</c><00:15:51.870><c> this</c>

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.050 align:start position:0%
that really works in something like this
 

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.869 align:start position:0%
that really works in something like this
where<00:15:52.230><c> there's</c><00:15:52.379><c> a</c><00:15:52.439><c> couple</c><00:15:52.649><c> climaxes</c><00:15:53.399><c> going</c><00:15:53.699><c> on</c>

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:53.879 align:start position:0%
where there's a couple climaxes going on
 

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:55.249 align:start position:0%
where there's a couple climaxes going on
so<00:15:54.060><c> they</c><00:15:54.149><c> can</c><00:15:54.209><c> really</c><00:15:54.360><c> offset</c><00:15:54.720><c> each</c><00:15:54.839><c> other</c><00:15:55.050><c> if</c>

00:15:55.249 --> 00:15:55.259 align:start position:0%
so they can really offset each other if
 

00:15:55.259 --> 00:15:57.530 align:start position:0%
so they can really offset each other if
that<00:15:55.500><c> was</c><00:15:55.740><c> it</c><00:15:56.040><c> I</c><00:15:56.310><c> say</c><00:15:56.670><c> wow</c><00:15:56.879><c> that</c><00:15:57.149><c> was</c><00:15:57.300><c> ballsy</c>

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
that was it I say wow that was ballsy
 

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.210 align:start position:0%
that was it I say wow that was ballsy
that<00:15:57.899><c> was</c><00:15:57.990><c> a</c><00:15:58.019><c> risky</c><00:15:58.439><c> move</c><00:15:58.560><c> it's</c><00:15:58.769><c> like</c><00:15:58.920><c> this</c><00:15:59.069><c> is</c>

00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
that was a risky move it's like this is
 

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.139 align:start position:0%
that was a risky move it's like this is
the<00:15:59.370><c> big</c><00:15:59.519><c> climax</c>
