00:00:00.822 --> 00:00:02.633
- [Sal] What we're going
to do is think about

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:06.800
the graphs of marginal utility
and total utility curves.

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:09.483
And so right over here,

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:11.271
I have a table showing me

00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:15.543
the marginal utility I get
from getting tennis balls.

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:18.051
And so it says look if
I have no tennis balls

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.723
and I'm not able to play tennis,

00:00:19.723 --> 00:00:22.045
so I'm pretty happy when
I get that first ball.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.644
It gives me a marginal utility of 100.

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.384
Now you might say 100 what Sal?

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:29.559
And I would say to you
well that's the thing

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.022
about marginal utility.

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:33.344
We're using fairly abstract units here.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:35.248
We're not speaking in terms of dollar

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:36.873
or opportunity cost.

00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:39.265
We're just have this abstract unit,

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:41.563
we could call it utility units if we want,

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.514
but what really matters is the relation

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:45.232
between these values.

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.183
So for example, that second ball,

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.365
it's nice, now I can lose that first ball

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.687
or I don't have to chase
that first ball around

00:00:51.687 --> 00:00:54.311
as frequently, but it's not as,

00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:57.028
I don't get as much incremental utility

00:00:57.028 --> 00:00:59.234
as I got from that first ball.

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.859
That first ball allowed me to play tennis.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:01.904
Now the second ball,

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:02.903
I was already playing tennis,

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:04.249
now my tennis is just going to be

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:05.759
a little bit more pleasant.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.686
So the marginal utility
one way to think about it,

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.427
this is 80 and this is 100,

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:12.283
the marginal utility of
that second ball is 80%

00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:15.256
of what that first ball is.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:16.904
Now I promised that I would graph these,

00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:19.133
so let's get a graph out here

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.271
So there we go.

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.849
And let's start plotting these
and see what it looks like.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.053
Well that first ball
gave me a utility of 100.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:29.071
The second ball gives me a utility of 80.

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:30.558
Third ball, you see the trend.

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:32.485
This is a downward sloping,

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:34.807
if this was a line, these
are discrete values here,

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:37.082
but if I cared about 1/2 of a tennis ball

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:39.033
or 3/4 of a tennis ball,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.867
then I could connect
the dots here as well.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.282
But you can see that it
is downward sloping line

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:44.954
if you were to connect the dots.

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:47.454
So three balls, utility of 60.

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:52.802
If I have four balls,
it's a utility of 40.

00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.565
Five balls, utility of 20.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:57.516
And once again, when
I get that fifth ball,

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.000
yeah it's nice, but now my
pockets are getting pretty full

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.997
and I was all, it's hard to play tennis

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:03.135
with those full pockets.

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:04.598
By the time I get that sixth ball,

00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:07.431
I get no marginal utility from that.

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.103
I don't have a place to store it,

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.146
it's I don't really,
I'm not really into it.

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.980
And then that seventh ball,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.979
I actually view it as a negative.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.326
It's one extra ball to worry about.

00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:19.436
No place to store it, it's
taking up space in my life.

00:02:19.436 --> 00:02:21.432
And so if you were to connect the dots,

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.081
we're talking about a discrete case,

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:24.892
but oftentimes you could
think about something

00:02:24.892 --> 00:02:26.262
that's a little bit more continuous

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.956
where the quantity is more
granular if you said pounds

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:31.347
of chocolate or something like that,

00:02:31.347 --> 00:02:33.042
then you could imagine

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:35.434
in general for a marginal utility curve,

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:38.184
to be able to connect these dots.

00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:41.425
And you see in this case,

00:02:41.425 --> 00:02:42.981
it is downward sloping.

00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:45.651
So this is the marginal utility,

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.323
the marginal utility curve.

00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:49.823
Notice that it is slopes down,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.690
slopes down.

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.055
And this you're generally
going to see this

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:56.866
for any marginal utility curve

00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.721
because the incremental
benefit of that next amount,

00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:03.809
that next unit, is seldom as good

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.550
as the benefit of getting it before.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.665
You get tired of the thing,

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:07.687
you start running out of space,

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.380
you've already consumed
more than you need of it.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.913
And this is consistent with what we know

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:13.584
from the law of demand.

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:15.001
And the law of demand,

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.951
every incremental amount of quantity,

00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.879
people are like well I already have some,

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.924
and this might not be,

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:21.317
the law of demand is not talking about

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:22.315
just an individual,

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:24.150
it's talking about a market,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.052
but the market as a whole
is made up of individuals,

00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:28.445
and if each individual is saying,

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.557
hey you know that first
unit really matters to me,

00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:34.064
but the next unit, it's
nice, but not as good,

00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:35.318
so I'd pay less for it.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:36.294
And then the unit after that,

00:03:36.294 --> 00:03:37.780
it's nice, so I might pay less for it.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.591
And so if you aggregate
all those individuals,

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:41.332
that's where that law
of demand comes from.

00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:42.586
These are consistent ideas,

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.606
and that's why the demand curve,

00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:47.625
you are also, it is sloping down.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.854
Price is usually on this
axis instead of utility,

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:54.127
and you could imagine price
as being a proxy for utility.

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:58.097
And quantity of course is on
this axis right over here.

00:03:58.097 --> 00:04:00.698
So this is quantity of balls.

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:03.066
So that's our marginal utility curve.

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:05.179
What about total utility?

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.012
So let me

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.399
have a table here that
shows total utility.

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.117
And total utility from marginal utility

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:17.284
is pretty straightforward.

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:23.128
All you do is say okay,

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.614
well that first ball,

00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:27.215
when I have one ball, my
total utility is the same

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:29.305
as my marginal utility.

00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:33.670
And so you're going to have
that same starting place

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.433
at when your consumption
is just beginning.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.918
But then your total
utility from two balls,

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:42.122
well I had 100 utility
units from the first ball,

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:44.583
and then I get 80 more
from that second ball,

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:46.302
so it's gonna be 180.

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:49.802
So for two balls, my total utility is 180.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:54.545
All I'm doing is I just
added that to that.

00:04:54.545 --> 00:04:57.285
Now for three balls I
add that to that to that.

00:04:57.285 --> 00:05:00.628
I take 180 and I add the 60 extra

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:02.765
utility units I get for that third ball,

00:05:02.765 --> 00:05:05.087
and now I'm at 240.

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:08.670
So that third ball
gives me, gets me to 240

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:10.938
right over there.

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:13.608
Now the fourth ball, once again,

00:05:13.608 --> 00:05:16.534
I'm just gonna take 240
and add the incremental

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:19.065
utility of that fourth
ball, the marginal utility

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:20.551
of that fourth ball.

00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:22.711
That gets me to 280.

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.628
So that gets me to 280,

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:27.814
which is right over,

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:32.068
let's see, 20, 30, 20, 40, 60, 80.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.109
So this is right over there.

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:37.548
Now that fifth ball,

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:40.265
I'm just gonna take the 280
and then the marginal utility

00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:43.075
of the fifth ball, add 20, gets me to 300.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.025
Fifth ball gets me to 300 which would be

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.608
right around there.

00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:50.598
Now the sixth ball gave me no incremental,

00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:52.339
no marginal utility,

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.056
so my total utility,
when I have six balls,

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.031
stays the same.

00:05:56.031 --> 00:06:00.002
I'm indifferent as to whether
I have five or six balls.

00:06:00.002 --> 00:06:03.601
So the sixth ball, it is
now flat right over here.

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:04.692
And now the seventh ball,

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:06.271
I'm tired of these tennis balls.

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:07.827
I'm being overwhelmed by them.

00:06:07.827 --> 00:06:09.569
I'm finding it stressful.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.657
And so it actually has a
negative marginal utility,

00:06:12.657 --> 00:06:14.073
and so my total utility,

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.861
if someone forced me to have seven balls,

00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.694
my total utility would now go down by 20.

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:22.456
And so my total utility now would be 280,

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:23.709
right over here.

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.428
And you could see the
marginal utilities here,

00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:27.355
if you just say look this is plus 80,

00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:29.027
this is plus 60,

00:06:29.027 --> 00:06:30.629
this is plus 40,

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.022
this is plus 20,

00:06:32.022 --> 00:06:33.555
this is plus zero,

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:35.505
and then this is minus 20.

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:39.197
And so you see the numbers right over,

00:06:39.197 --> 00:06:40.776
right over there.

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:43.145
Now this tennis ball example,

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:44.398
this would be a discrete case.

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:46.767
You wouldn't have 1/2 a tennis ball or

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:49.344
pi tennis balls or something like that,

00:06:49.344 --> 00:06:51.225
but if we wanna speak in general terms,

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:53.013
you could think about connecting the dots,

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:55.637
if you had a more continuous example.

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:58.516
And your total utility curve might look

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:00.183
something like this.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.857
Now what's interesting is
right when you're beginning

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.296
consumption you're
starting at the same place.

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:06.388
Well that makes sense.

00:07:06.388 --> 00:07:08.199
Your first unit, you get marginal utility,

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:10.591
that's gonna be your total utility.

00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:13.423
And this is upward sloping as long as

00:07:13.423 --> 00:07:15.722
you're getting some
positive marginal utility

00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:17.510
from each increment.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.761
So as long as my marginal
utilities were positive,

00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.011
well this graph

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:25.544
is going to be increasing.

00:07:25.544 --> 00:07:27.518
But notice, because the marginal utilities

00:07:27.518 --> 00:07:30.281
are getting are decreasing
right over here,

00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.928
the rate of increase for total utility

00:07:32.928 --> 00:07:36.458
is decreasing, the slope
here is decreasing.

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.362
You can view the marginal utility

00:07:38.362 --> 00:07:41.695
as the slope of the total utility curve.

00:07:43.006 --> 00:07:45.119
And then notice the total utility curve

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:47.255
has a maximum value,

00:07:47.255 --> 00:07:50.343
it's starting to hit a maximum
value right over there,

00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:54.360
when the marginal utility
curve is hitting zero.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.357
Because beyond that point,

00:07:56.357 --> 00:07:58.540
where at least in this
example we had negative

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.165
marginal utility.

00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:02.301
And so when you add that seventh unit,

00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:05.134
well that's gonna make your
total utility curve go down,

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:06.690
and so you're gonna have a negative slope

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.940
in this particular example.
