00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:01.377
 In these videos I want to start thinking 

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:03.536
 for the different ways in which molecules 

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.347
 can pass through the cell membrane 

00:00:05.347 --> 00:00:07.325
 outwards or downwards 

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:09.968
 inside out. 

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.545
 The first type of transport of molecules through the membranes, 

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.889
 which I'm going to talk about is transport, 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.584
 which does not require energy. 

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.301
 With it the molecules move in the direction 

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:22.414
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:25.740
 We call this mode passive. 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.613
 Passive transport. 

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.005
 He does not use energy. 

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.560
 Simply molecules move in the direction 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.618
 of its concentration gradient. 

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:39.202
 I will write it, "They move in the direction of their concentration gradient." 

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:43.308
 Toward 

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:46.718
 the concentration gradient. 

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.958
 If we have this cell membrane, 

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.321
 many things can move 

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.179
 in the direction of its concentration gradient. 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.090
 But this membrane has selective permeability. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.099
 It will be less permeable for 

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:01.003
 certain types of molecules. 

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:02.837
 Consider the different types of molecules 

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:05.716
 and how they can pass passively 

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.318
 through the membrane. 

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.664
 If we had very small molecules, we can say, 

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:11.243
 "Well, they can pass through the spaces 

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.982
 between hydrophilic heads, 

00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:16.792
 may fit in the spaces 

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:19.067
 between hydrophilic tails and through the membrane. " 

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.043
 So it's good for them to be small. 

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:27.182
 If you are small, it helps transport, passive transport, 

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:29.911
 promotes diffusion through the membrane. 

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.257
 More precisely, it is good to be 

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.998
 small and unladen. 

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:37.783
 Small and unladen. 

00:01:37.783 --> 00:01:41.567
 An example of such a molecule is carbon dioxide. 

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:45.932
 Carbon dioxide is a small molecule 

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:47.814
 without charge. 

00:01:47.814 --> 00:01:49.415
 So if the molecules carbon dioxide 

00:01:49.415 --> 00:01:53.036
 have a higher concentration from the outside, 

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.976
 than in the inside of the cage - actually, do it upside down. 

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:58.099
 Let's say we have a higher concentration in the cell's interior, 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.116
 from outside. 

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.183
 As we learned in the video about diffusion, 

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:05.528
 after a certain time 

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:07.914
 we will have more molecules of carbon dioxide, which 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.884
 pass from the inside of the cell and interact with the membrane, 

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:14.635
 of carbon dioxide molecules that interact with the membrane on the outside. 

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.073
 Of course they have no charge 

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:19.139
 will not be attracted 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.152
 of the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids, 

00:02:22.152 --> 00:02:24.039
 but they will not be repulsed by them either. 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.895
 On the inside there will be more molecules that interact 

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.404
 with the membrane on the outside. 

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:28.913
 And as they are small, 

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:30.982
 some of them will pass through the membrane. 

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:32.363
 They will not worry about them 

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:34.458
 hydrophobic tails. 

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.942
 There will be movement of carbon dioxide molecules in both directions, 

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.553
 but there will be more molecules going inside 

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:39.814
 outside as far as the outside. 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.351
 They will move in the direction of 

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.557
 its concentration gradient. 

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:46.459
 Therefore, carbon dioxide can pass 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.806
 easily by diffusion through the cell membranes. 

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:52.682
 Another such molecule is that of oxygen. 

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:55.933
 Oxygen molecules can easily pass through diffusion 

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.767
 through the cell membranes. 

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.300
 If we have a higher concentration 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.990
 of oxygen outside, than you turn away, 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.754
 since the oxygen molecule is small and uncharged, 

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:08.423
 it will not have any problems with transport. 

00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:09.703
 Will not be attracted to 

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.467
 hydrophilic heads, 

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:12.996
 but since it is small, it will be able to pass 

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.228
 between them, 

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.597
 they will be indifferent to them. 

00:03:15.597 --> 00:03:16.984
 Then he will be able to pass 

00:03:16.984 --> 00:03:18.980
 between hydrophilic tails 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.163
 and since it has a higher concentration from outside, 

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:23.019
 than on the inside, 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.024
 after a while 

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:26.596
 there will be more random interactions in the direction from the outside to the inside, 

00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:27.967
 than in the direction from the inside out. 

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:30.706
 Therefore, as a whole, we will have oxygen transport to the inside of the cell. 

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:33.471
 These molecules will naturally be transported 

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:39.586
 by diffusion. 

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.375
 They will be on their way 

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:44.509
 the structure made up of all these molecules, 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.296
 which make up the cell membrane, 

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:48.409
 but they will be able to go through it. 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.476
 And what happens to things they will have 

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:52.148
 many transport problems? 

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.982
 Things that will make it difficult for them to pass through the membrane, 

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:58.347
 are, for example, sodium ions. 

00:03:58.347 --> 00:04:00.292
 Sodium ion. 

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:04.714
 Either potassium ion. 

00:04:05.314 --> 00:04:07.009
 Why would they have difficulty going through the membrane? 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.006
 Let's think. 

00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:09.516
 Let's say we have a higher concentration 

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.518
 of sodium ions from outside, 

00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:17.782
 than on the inside. 

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:20.407
 They can be attracted to hydrophilic heads, 

00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:22.193
 which have a charge, 

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.167
 but there is no reason to want 

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:25.537
 to continue after that. 

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:28.316
 They will be attracted by hydrophilic heads, 

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:29.659
 which have a charge, 

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.423
 while hydrophobic tails have nothing to interest them. 

00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:37.476
 They may want to climb 

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:39.439
 about phosphate heads, 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.619
 but they will not be able to migrate all the way through the membrane. 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.614
 Therefore particles that are loaded have 

00:04:45.614 --> 00:04:47.567
 passive diffusion problem. 

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.865
 In the next videos we will see that there are other ways, 

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.419
 which they can go through. 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.464
 There are protein channels, 

00:04:53.464 --> 00:04:54.793
 which provide them with transport tunnels. 

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.187
 We'll talk about that. 

00:04:56.187 --> 00:05:00.437
 But natural diffusion will be difficult 

00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:01.992
 for particles like these. 

00:05:01.992 --> 00:05:04.478
 Well, particles that are somewhere in the middle. 

00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.590
 Like these water molecules for example? 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.169
 Water is extremely important, 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.280
 because the cells live in an aquatic environment. 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.069
 They are surrounded by water inside and 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.741
 outside. 

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.411
 Water is the middle between the ions and the neutral molecules, 

00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:18.874
 because there is no full charge, 

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:20.894
 but partial. 

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:24.167
 Water = oxygen + 2 x hydrogen. 

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.048
 Oxygen likes to attract electrons. 

00:05:26.048 --> 00:05:28.208
 There is a partial negative charge at this end. 

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:30.182
 And the hydrogen atoms have 

00:05:30.182 --> 00:05:32.226
 partial positive charge. 

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.726
 Partial positive charge at this end. 

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:38.470
 We call these phosphate heads hydrophilic, 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.631
 because they are attracted to the water 

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.211
 and the water is attracted to them. 

00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:44.810
 So the water molecules definitely 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.150
 will be attracted 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.840
 to hydrophilic heads. 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.980
 But their charge is not so strong. 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.373
 If there are enough interactions, 

00:05:56.373 --> 00:05:57.951
 many water molecules will be attracted, 

00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.809
 but some of them will be able to pass through the membrane. 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.365
 The water molecule is small enough, 

00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:04.476
 and its charge is not strong enough. 

00:06:04.476 --> 00:06:05.637
 We can say it's polar, 

00:06:05.637 --> 00:06:07.286
 but it will pass through the membrane. 

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.537
 Not as easy as carbon dioxide and oxygen, 

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.972
 but will slowly pass through diffusion. 

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.667
 As we shall see, there are other ways 

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.246
 this transport can be facilitated 

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.291
 and the water can pass. 

00:06:19.861 --> 00:06:22.215
 We will see in the next videos that there are things like aquaporins - 

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.513
 tunnels through the membranes, 

00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:26.762
 so water does not have to deal with 

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.857
 with all this here. 

00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:30.923
 And of course, if we have big molecules, 

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:35.218
 if we have such a large protein, 

00:06:35.218 --> 00:06:36.518
 he will have difficulty with transport. 

00:06:36.518 --> 00:06:37.355
 There will be problems. 

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.911
 It will be difficult for him to physically pass 

00:06:38.911 --> 00:06:41.117
 through the spaces in the membrane, not to mention its parts, 

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.647
 which are hydrophobic or hydrophilic. 

00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:46.085
 I hope this video gave you an idea of ​​the things that can pass 

00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:49.614
 through the cell membrane by diffusion. 

00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:52.212
 It is a type of passive transport, 

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.052
 in the next video 

00:06:55.052 --> 00:06:58.321
 we will talk about relieved passive transport.
