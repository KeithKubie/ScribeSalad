QUESTION: If humanity at some point in the
future discovered another alien civilization,

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.800
at least mildly comparable to our own, if
society as it is now stayed basically the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.450
same, how do you think we would react to it,
you know: be violent or have a new colonial

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.559
era, or make peace and advance with everyone
or something like that?

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:28.559
Thank you.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.890
BILL NYE: What if we found or discovered another
alien civilization, would there be colonization?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.890
I hope not.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.129
I just feel that another alien civilization
probably couldn’t live on the earth and

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.449
we probably couldn’t live there.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.109
There’s too many details that wouldn’t
work, unless we’re all wearing spacesuits.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.109
But maybe.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.110
I just don’t think that there would be that
much interaction.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.370
That is to say, I think it’s much more like
we will find an alien civilization on a world

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.039
so distant, so remote, that there won’t
be going back and forth in spaceships.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.330
If it’s, let’s say, 40 lightyears, as
it is to these TRAPPIST-1 planets, the ones

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:17.710
they found around this very cold or relatively
cold small star—cool star, then the way

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.659
we’d communicate with them is by radio or
by light, electromagnetic waves.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.000
And so there wouldn’t be a chance for colonization
or misplaced bank accounts or whatever else

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.979
would go wrong—or warfare.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.460
That just wouldn’t be possible.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.420
Instead though, it would be profound.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.770
It would change the way everybody feels about
being a living thing in the cosmos.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.299
It would be extraordinary.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.170
And furthermore we do this research looking
for alien civilizations at a tiny fraction

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.789
of our international budget.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.179
It’s a worthy thing to always be doing in
the background.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.900
Listening and looking for aliens.
