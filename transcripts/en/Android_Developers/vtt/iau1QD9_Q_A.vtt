RETO MEIER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.790
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to "This Week in

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.000
Android Development,"
November 5, 2012.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.170
Last week was a big week in
Android with Andy Rubin

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.160
pulling back the veil of
secrecy to announce the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.570
release of Android Jelly Bean
4.2 along with a slew of new

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.310
hardware to go along with it.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.660
It's now possible to get a pure
Android device to suit

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.100
all tastes, with Nexus devices
now available in

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.860
tall, grande, and venti.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.850
All three sizes will be
available for purchase at

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.330
Google Play on November 13.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.220
This week in "Android Developers
Live," Roman and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.960
Adam briefly considered hosting
"Android Design in

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.600
Action," live from New York,
under water, and without power

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.140
before coming to their senses
and heading home to brace for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.460
Hurricane Sandy.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.780
As a result, there was no show,
but I'm happy to report

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.320
that all of our presenters
are safe and well.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.460
It's unlikely that the guys will
be back in action this

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.960
week as New York continues
its cleanup benefits.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.550
But as soon as they're finished
bailing out the New

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.070
York studio, the guys
will be back.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.150
Meanwhile, in sunny California,
where the only way

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.230
our studio will ever be
underwater is when the next

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.860
big earthquake hits and tips us
all off the edge of the US

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.750
and into the bottom of the
Pacific, Ian and I were able

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.190
to host the first our new
format app clinics.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.670
We briefly considered following
ABC sitcom "Up All

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.270
Night's" lead in switching to
a multi-camera, live studio

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.960
audience format, but instead
elected to dedicate the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.280
majority of the show to
technical tips and tricks that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
make a great travel
assistance app.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820
Last Friday, we looked at how
to use location and transfer

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.550
data efficiently as well as
sharing data between apps.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.620
You can tell us which apps and
which app categories you'd

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.730
like us to review using
this Trello board.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.980
We'd prefer to review
self-nominated apps, so if

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.130
you're an app developer, please
put your app forward

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.930
for us to take a look at.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.800
This week Ian and I will be
exploring ways to work

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.000
together more effectively by
eliminating the awkward

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.420
face-to-face meetings and
corresponding only through

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.720
instant messages.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.750
Find out more this Friday when
we look at the technology

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.620
behind WhatsApp messenger,
GroupMe, and Trillion.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.070
Tune in on Wednesday for our
regular European office hours

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.620
with Rich and Nick, and watch as
Bruno hosts a very special

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.880
Spanish addition of "Android
LATAM Developers Live." Next

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.810
week also sees the premiere of a
new show, "Table Flip," with

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.480
me, Reto Meier.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.600
This week I'll be talking about
exit buttons and why you

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.110
should never, ever have one
in your Android apps.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.130
Exit buttons--

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.240
not even once.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.310
As always, you can find the
complete scheduled for this

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.510
week's live shows at Google
Developers Live.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.430
If you'd like to meet one of
our developer advocates in

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850
person and you're lucky enough
to live in Prague, you can

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.610
catch Rich and Nick
at the Prague GDG

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.480
Devfest this weekend.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.600
Today's live wallpaper was
"Fresh Leaves," from

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.510
maxelus.net.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.870
And remember, to make the most
if this night like we're going

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.500
to die young.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.690
My name is Rete Meier.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.480
Thanks for watching.
