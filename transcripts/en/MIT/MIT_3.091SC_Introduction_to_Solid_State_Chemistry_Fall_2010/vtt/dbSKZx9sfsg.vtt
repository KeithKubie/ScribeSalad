00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.050
Hi.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.560
I'm Jocelyn, and we're going to
go over fall 2009, exam 1,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.480
problem number 3.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.060
With every question, we want to
make sure we read the full

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.070
problem first. So answer the
following questions about the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.610
difluoro-iodate ion.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.290
Draw a three-dimensional
representation of the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.480
molecular geometry around the
central atom, not simply the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.770
Lewis structure.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.530
Show all atoms and bonds
between them.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.620
Because this part seems pretty
separate from the rest of

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.880
them, we're going to
start with that.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.250
So we have a difluoro-iodate
ion.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.740
It has a positive charge.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.530
And it asks us to draw the
molecular geometry in a 3D

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.800
representation, and not
just Lewis structure.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.200
However, to do the molecular
geometry in 3D, we need to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.250
know the Lewis structure.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.550
So we're going to
start with that.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.190
To draw the Lewis structure,
we first need to figure out

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.140
which atom is the
central atom.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.700
And it's always a good idea to
do that by looking at the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.140
relative electronegativities.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.680
As we know, fluorine is the most
electronegative element

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.940
in the periodic table, and so
that's probably not going to

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.500
be in the middle.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.385
Therefore, iodine, being the
less electronegative, is going

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.410
to be in the middle,
and it will have

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.170
fluorines on either side.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.620
This is our rough sketch of
the molecular geometry.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.180
Not too important right now.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.470
Next we need to know how many
electrons we have. Iodine has

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.470
seven valence electrons,
fluoride has seven valence

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.270
electrons, and we have a
positive charge, so we know

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.160
that we're missing one.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.720
And that gives us
20 electrons.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.660
Now that we know how many
electrons we have to work

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.530
with, we need start
filling them in.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.810
I always start with the
outer electrons.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.770
Those are usually, hopefully,
the most electronegative, and

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.480
therefore, the most likely to
have the octet rule satisfied.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.330
Also, if you remember, fluorine
is in the second row,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.840
and therefore needs to have
the octet rule satisfied.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.830
Iodine is a little bit lower in
the periodic table, so the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.460
octet rule isn't as important.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.550
It can have an extended octet
if we need it to.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.360
So we will work with
iodine second.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.550
Let's start out with satisfying
the octet rule for

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.800
the fluorine, putting first the
seven valence electrons

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.320
that the fluorines brought
themselves, and then noticing

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.750
that each needs to share one
from iodine, so that we have a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.790
full octet.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.620
So each has one bond
with iodine.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.550
We've used 8 electrons,
or 8 per fluorine.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.800
So we have a total of 16.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.820
We have 4 left, and
we're going to put

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.370
those on the iodine.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.340
Counting up how many electronics
are around iodine,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, we see
that the octet rule is also

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.820
satisfied for iodine.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.980
This is looking like a pretty
good Lewis structure.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.640
Now, just to make sure it's
really good, we're going to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.030
look at the formal charge.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.480
So if you recall, the formal
charge is the number of

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:16.490
valence electrons that the
element usually has, and minus

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:27.380
the number of unshared
electrons, and

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.630
the number of dots.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.940
So this sum subtracted from
the valence electrons will

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.980
give us the formal charge.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.010
Looking at the fluorine, we have
seven valence electrons.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.260
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 unpaired, and

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.300
one bond to the fluorine.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.220
So that gives us a formal
charge of 0.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.645
The same goes for the
other fluorine.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.210
So I guess its formal
charge is 0.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.910
Now for the iodine, we have--

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.410
I'm going to do the formal
charge down here--

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.930
it again has 7 valence
electrons, usually.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.930
We have 4 unshared electrons,
and 2 bonds.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.600
That gives us a formal
charge of plus 1.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.550
Because we have a charged
species here, the full

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.110
molecule has a plus 1 charge.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.270
There's no way we cannot have
a net formal charge.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.490
Right?

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.850
We need to have a net formal
charge of plus 1.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.490
And it makes sense that that
formal charge is on the least

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.280
electronegative atom.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.300
So this looks like
the right Lewis

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.970
structure for our purposes.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.050
One more thing that you might
want to write down.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.870
I'm not sure if points were
taken off from this.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.680
But technically, if you have a
charged species, put brackets

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.620
around your Lewis structure,
and put the net

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.230
charge on the outside.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.290
This is not, however, our
final answer, right?

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.080
This is the Lewis structure.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.230
But the question asks for the
molecular geometry to be

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.320
represented.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.480
So if we remember how we
determine molecular geometry,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.880
we need to look at the number of
electron domains around the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.450
essential atom.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.130
So we're going to move over
here, and I'll redraw our

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.380
Lewis structure.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.450
And remember, an electron
domain can be either an

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.530
electron pair, or a bond.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:13.790
So we see that iodine has
4 electron domains.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.180
And if we remember our skeletal
geometry, we know

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.430
that that's tetrahedral.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.930
Thus, to draw this in a more 3D
fashion, we might want to

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:49.190
say that one of the electron
pairs is here, one of the

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.750
electron pairs is over here,
and then we have a fluorine

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.825
coming out of the board, and a
fluorine going into the board.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.120
We didn't really go
over how to do

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.050
three-dimensional drawings.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:15.310
So as long as you show something
like, you know the

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.820
fluorines will be an angle, not
straight from the iodine,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.920
and that the electrons be on the
other side, something to

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.230
that effect.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.960
A little bit more detailed than
just a Lewis structure,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.260
was what Professor Sadoway was
looking for in this problem.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.650
And that would be your answer.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.440
And for this one especially, I'd
say it's important to box

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.390
your final answer.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.240
Because you hopefully would
have figured out the Lewis

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.120
structure, but this is not
the correct answer.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.650
So you always want to
signify what answer

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.760
you want to be graded.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.890
Part B says, name the type of
hybrid orbitals that the

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:04.540
central atom forms. So we are
almost all the way to

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.150
answering this question, so
I'll put it down here.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.380
Remember, hybrid
orbitals are--

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:20.590
we have hybrid orbitals, because
we can't really say

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.990
what orbitals exactly are
bonding to which atoms. We

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.910
want to have 4 equivalent
orbitals for

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.170
this system, right?

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.320
We have 4 electron domains,
so we want 4

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.410
equivalent bonding orbitals.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.670
And from our talks earlier
in the lectures about

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:45.130
hybridization, we know that if
we want 4, we take 1S and 3P,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:50.240
and that gives us the
hybridization of the SP3.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.550
if we only had 3 electron
domains, it would be SP2,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.340
because we only use
3 orbitals.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.970
And the number of orbitals that
go into the hybrid is the

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.910
number of orbitals
you will get out.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.210
So we know that our
hybridization is SP3.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.290
And that goes along with the
fact that our shape is

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.540
tetrahedral.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.290
Now we need to name
the molecular

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.510
geometry of this molecule.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.630
so we already have the molecular
shape and the kind

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.430
of spacial arrangement
is tetrahedral.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.600
However, when we're naming the
molecular geometry, electron

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.320
pairs no longer matter.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:44.820
So for part C, tetrahedral is
our skeletal geometry, right?

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.500
It shows us our special
arrangement.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.360
The molecular geometry is
ignoring those electron pairs.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:11:01.000
So it is called bent when
we only have 2 bonds.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.080
And I think about that because
in spectroscopy and ways that

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.080
are used to study molecules,
you can't see the electron

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.700
clouds very well.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.550
So they could only see the
iodine and the two fluorines,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.750
thus looking like a
bent structure.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.460
So hopefully you're sticking
with me here, because this

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.050
problem has a lot of parts.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.810
And we're going to move
on to part D now.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.420
Part D asks, is difluoro-iodate
polar or

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.250
nonpolar, and explain.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.030
If you put down polar or
nonpolar and did not explain,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.020
we assume you guessed, and you
didn't get any points.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.670
Explaining shows that you know
why, and you understand the

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.930
concepts behind this,
and thus deserved

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.230
points on this problem.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.530
So there's two different
parts of this problem.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.400
First, to have a polar molecule,
you need to have

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.830
polar bonds.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.931
So I would first ask myself,
are the bonds polar?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.460
We have a difference of
electronegativity that you can

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.380
look up on your periodic table
and know is not negligible.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.630
And so yes.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.360
A difference in
electronegativity signifies

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.280
that our bonds are polar.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.240
However, not all molecules
that have polar bonds are

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.530
themselves polar, right?

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:43.930
if we have spacial symmetry,
those polar bonds

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.200
could cancel out.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.393
So now we need to make sure,
is the molecule polar?

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.060
And for that, we need
to have answered the

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.770
first questions correctly.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:12:59.990
Right?

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.520
We need to know that this is
not a linear structure.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.540
If this was a linear structure,
those polar bonds

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.400
would be geometrically
symmetric, and

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.860
cancel each other out.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.340
But we all are very smart, and
we got this part C right.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.620
We know that we have
a bent structure.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.050
Thus, I'll rewrite
this over here.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:32.450
We know that if we draw in our
polarity vectors, we can

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.070
realize that we'll have a net
dipole pointing down.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:45.650
So the answer to this is yes,
because of the difference in

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.930
the electronegativity,
and because

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:55.160
of the spacial asymmetry.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.730
If you said both of
those things, you

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.340
would get full credit.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.610
If you said one or
the other, you'd

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.290
probably get part credit.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:12.080
But knowing to look at these
two things shows that you

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.520
fully understand what it means
to have molecular polarity.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:17.840
All right.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.105
So now we're going to
move to part E.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.660
This part is changing gears a
little bit, so if you didn't

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.960
quite understand the
first part, you can

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.460
still try this one.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.570
Part E, again, what is the
question asking us?

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.070
Determine the maximum wavelength
of electromagnetic

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.260
radiation capable of breaking
the IS bond.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:55.740
So we need to find the maximum
wavelengths which corresponds

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.560
to the minimum energy.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.050
Right?

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:04.290
Because we have e equals
hc over over lambda for

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.220
electromagnetic radiation.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.440
We're trying to figure out the
lowest energy of photon that

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.890
will break the IF bond.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.310
Now, what are we given to
answer this question?

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:24.920
We're given the energy of the
homogeneous fluorine-fluorine

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.850
bond, is 160 kilojoules
per mole.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:37.290
And the energy of the
homogeneous iodine-iodine bond

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:43.970
is 150 kilojoules per mole.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:50.280
And in order to find the
wavelength that will break the

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.030
IS bond, we need to know the
energy of the IS bond.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.100
Right?

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.560
That's what we're working
towards in this problem.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.200
So given the homogeneous
energies, do we have a

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.360
relationship that will
help us determine the

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.440
energy of the IS bond?

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.870
If you recall, in lecture 9,
Professor Sadoway went over

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.630
the Pauling formula for
determining a heterogeneous

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.990
bond energy from the homogeneous
bond energies, and

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.240
the electronegativity.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.250
So I'll just write
that up here.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:44.900
The Pauling formula is, in a
generic form, the energy of an

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:57.100
AB bond equals the square root
of the product of the

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:04.950
homogeneous bond energies plus
a constant times the

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:13.750
difference between the
electronegativities squared.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.310
And I just said what all
of these terms mean.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.340
Because even if you had this on
your equation sheet in the

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.480
test or something, a lot of
people wrote this down, and

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.150
then used it incorrectly.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.720
So it's really important to know
not only what equations

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.150
you have, but especially what
each of the terms in the

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.030
equations mean.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.640
So we're given the homogeneous
bond energies, and we have a

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.550
periodic table, or some other
resource, that has the

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.910
elecronegativities.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.150
Next step is to plug in the
numbers and find the energy of

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.780
the IF bond.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:21.430
So we have the square root
of 150 kilojoules plus.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.770
And the exact values you get for
the electronegativity may

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.820
vary, depending on the source.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.720
But they'll be close
enough, and

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.980
relatively, probably very--

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.860
the difference between them
will be very similar.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.580
So don't worry if your
numbers were a little

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.100
different than mine.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.500
So we wrote all that out,
and plugging it into the

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:53.160
calculator, you get that the IF
bond has an energy of 323

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.410
kilojoules per mole.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:04.020
Now that we've found the energy
of the IS bond, are we

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.960
done with the problem?

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.170
You have an answer.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.500
You might be ready to move
on to the next question.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.420
However, this isn't what the
question is asking us, right?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.870
We are asked for the maximum
wavelength that can break a

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.500
bond of that energy.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.250
So we need to go back to our
energy relation to our

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.020
wavelengths.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.720
And we know that the wavelength

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.100
equals hc over the energy.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.710
Now here's where some people
tripped up a little bit.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.520
You have a value
for the energy.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.700
h and c are constants.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.200
And you find the lambda.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:55.960
However, if you plugged that all
in, your answer would be

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.160
6.15 times 10 to the
negative 31 meters.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.060
Some people, that was the
answer that they found.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:05.850
And it makes sense.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.230
You have an energy, you have
some constants, and you can

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.530
get your lambda.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.080
However, if you think about
it, does this wavelength

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.610
actually make sense?

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.160
The gamma ray radiation has a
wavelength of about 10 to the

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.130
negative 17.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.510
That's very, very,
very energetic

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.410
electromagnetic radiation.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:33.490
So this is 14 magnitudes
smaller than gamma ray

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.830
radiation, and it just doesn't
make sense for a bond energy

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.630
of this much.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.980
Plus it doesn't--

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.640
it just-- you should look at the
answer you get, and try to

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.290
be comfortable with if it
makes sense or not.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.740
So where people got tripped
up, is in the units.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.210
We found Pauling's formula gives
you the bond energy in

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.050
kilojoules per mole.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.850
However, if you look at Planck's
constant, it has

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.480
units of joules time seconds.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.810
The speed of light is in
meters per second.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.180
And you want lambda in meters.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.540
To make everything or cancel
out, that means we want the

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.240
energy to be in joules.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.600
Not joules per mole, because
we're looking at the

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.330
wavelength of one
photon, right?

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.410
We're looking at the energy of
one photon to break this bond.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:45.070
So we want the energy of the
bond, not per mole of bonds,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.060
but just of one bond.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.500
So instead of just having this
equation, we want to have put

00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:22.190
in h times c over 323, change
it to joules, and then

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.440
multiply by--

00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:30.700
sorry, moles are on
the bottom, 1 mole

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.950
and Avogadro's number.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.860
And Planck's constant of the
speed of light, you should

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.710
have on your equation sheet, or
somewhere else, some other

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.640
resource that you have. You
don't need to memorize those

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.010
in most cases.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:23:00.570
If you remembered to divide by
Avogadro's number, you got 3.7

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:06.790
times 10 to the negative 7
meters, which equals 370

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.830
nanometers.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:15.070
And if we recall, the light we
can see is in the 400 to 700

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.990
nanometer range.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:22.190
So this puts us in ultraviolet
radiation, which makes sense

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.720
that it would take that much
energy to break a bond.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.510
The other problem some people
had was forgetting to convert

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.700
from kilojoules to joules.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.830
That would still give you
a physical answer.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.810
But again, I can't stress
unit cancel out enough.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.200
So make sure you know that since
your Planck's constant

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.450
is in joules, you want
to make sure you have

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.320
joules on the bottom.
