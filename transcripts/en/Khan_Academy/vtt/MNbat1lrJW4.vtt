00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.230
Where we left off in the last
video, we were trying to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.340
figure out if there's a
meaningful difference between

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.850
the proportion of men voting
for a candidate and the

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.080
proportion of women.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.740
We sampled 1,000 men, sampled
1,000 women, and we got a

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.140
sample proportion for
each of them.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.650
We got 0.642 for the men and
0.591 for the women.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.530
But our goal is to get a 95%
confidence interval.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.610
So just based on our actual
sample, we got-- let me write

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.180
it over here.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.110
We got our sample proportion for
the men minus-- let me do

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.040
this in a neutral color.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.750
We got our sample proportion for
the men minus our sample

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.060
proportion for the women
being 0.642 minus

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.400
0.591, that's 0.051.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.680
I just subtracted
this from that.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.600
So what we want to do when we
want a confidence interval, we

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
want to be confident.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.160
I'll always have to say that
because it's not going to be

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.310
super precise.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:15.050
We want to be confident that
there's a 95% chance that this

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.610
thing right here-- remember,
when we took the two sample

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630
proportions and took their
difference, it's like taking a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.930
sample from the sampling
distribution of the statistic.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.300
So we want a 95% chance that
the true mean or the true

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.360
value of this, that P1 minus P2
is within some range, let's

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.430
say is within d, I'll say d for
distance, of the actual

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.020
difference that we got
with our samples.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.470
Within d of 0.051.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.330
And I write this multiple
times, but I always

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.890
write it this way.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.220
I don't just give the
formula that you

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.230
normally see in books.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.490
It's very easy to memorize if
you do, but this way, you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.410
actually see why
this confidence

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.270
interval makes sense.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.960
If there's a 95% chance that P1
minus P2, the actual true

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.650
proportions, the difference of
the true proportions, is

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.950
within d of the difference
between our sample

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.230
proportions, this statement
right here is the same thing

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:38.120
that there's a 95% chance that
0.051 is within d of this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.730
actual parameter, P1 minus
P2, which is the same

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.830
thing as the mean.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.070
So we need to figure out some
distance around this mean,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.140
where if we take a random sample
from this, and this is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.740
a random sample from this
distribution, it has a 95%

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.050
chance of being within d of
this mean, because if it's

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.100
within d of the mean, then
there's also a 95% chance that

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.890
the mean is within d of our
sample, and then we'll have

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.310
our confidence interval.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.540
Our confidence interval would be
this value plus d and this

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.000
value minus d.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.100
So what are these?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.960
What is the distance d?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.980
Well, in a normalized normal
distribution, I got a Z-table

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.440
right over here, and we can
assume everything is normal,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.520
especially the sampling
distributions because our n is

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.170
so big and also our proportion
is not close to zero or one.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.460
It's nice and close to the
middle, so we don't end up

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.820
with all these weird cases
near the edges.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.400
We say, OK, how do we contain
the middle 95%?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.000
How many standard deviations in
a normal distribution do we

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.060
need to be away from the mean in
order to contain 95% of the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.000
probability?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.460
Now these Z-tables, and we've
done it multiple times, give

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.730
you cumulative distribution.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.090
We're looking for this Z-value
right over here.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.810
If it's containing 95%, you're
going to have 2.5% over here

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.710
and you're going to have
2.5% over here.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.180
So from a Z-table's point of
view, this Z-table gives you

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.630
the cumulative probability
up to that Z-value.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.850
So what we're looking for
is actually 97.5%.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.920
We're looking for something
that contains all

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.170
of this over here.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.420
If we get the Z-value and then
apply it on both sides, then

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.930
we're going to have something
that contains 95%.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.880
So let's look up the 97.5.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.170
97.5 is right over there, and
that is 1.96 standard

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.450
deviations.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.040
So this is 1.96 for a normalized
standard deviation,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.460
or a Z-score of 1.96.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.140
So if we looked to this normal
distribution right over here,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.740
this distance that we care
about is going to be 1.96

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.650
times the standard deviation of
this distribution, so it's

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.710
going to be 1.96 times
all of this business.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.650
1.96 times the standard
deviation of this

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.300
distribution.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.450
And so we just need to
calculate this and

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.870
multiply it by 1.96.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.440
Now, we have a problem.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.410
We don't know the true
parameters P1 and P2.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.990
We don't know the true
population parameters.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.610
We don't know P1 and P2.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.990
That's part of the problem.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.170
We're trying to figure out
if there's a meaningful

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.110
difference between P1 and P2.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.770
But we've seen it
multiple times.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.830
Since our sample size is a
large, we can estimate P1 and

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.760
P2 with our sample
proportions.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.800
So we could change this to
approximately and we can use

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.540
our sample proportions.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.710
And we know what those
values are.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.870
And actually this n over
here was 1,000.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.680
So let's figure that out.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.150
Let's just get the
calculator out.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.360
It's just going to be one
big calculation here.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.260
So what we have is the square
root, and then in parentheses,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:28.816
our sample proportion for the
men is 0.642, and then we're

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:39.310
going to multiply that times
1 minus 0.642, close

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.990
parentheses.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.020
That's that over there
divided by 1,000.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.710
And then we're going to add to
that plus-- do the same thing

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.930
for the women.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:07:06.300
Our sample proportion is 0.591
times 1 minus 0.591.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.810
So that's this term right over
here divided by 1,000.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.520
Once again, I need to get
the parentheses right.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.010
And then we just need to close
the parentheses, this original

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.770
parentheses, because we're
taking the square root of

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.020
everything.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:33.540
So we get 0.021, or maybe
we'll say 0.022.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:44.040
So this value right here
is approximately 0.022.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.550
So going back to our question,
or this distance that we care

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.180
about, this value is going to be
approximately, or our best

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.080
estimate of it, is 0.022.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.640
So let's just multiply that.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:10.880
0.022 times 1.96 gives 0.043.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.180
I'll just round it.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:21.860
So this right here is
equal to 0.043.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.690
And just like that, we have
our confidence interval.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:32.900
We know that there's a 95%
chance that the true

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:43.559
difference of the proportions is
within 0.043 of the actual

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.240
difference of our sample
proportions that we got.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.100
Or if we actually want to get
an interval, we take this

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.200
value minus 0.043.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.590
So let's do that.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:09:01.910
So we could have 0.051
minus 0.043 is

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.320
going to give us 0.008.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.130
And then if we add
it, so 0.051 plus

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.550
0.043, it gives us 0.094.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.480
So the 95% confidence interval
between the proportions of men

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.390
and the proportion of women who
are going to vote for the

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:45.450
candidate for P1 minus
P2 is 0.008 to 0.094.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.720
I have it right here
on the calculator.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.310
And we're done.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.290
So it does seem we're confident
that there's a 95%

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.150
chance that men are more
likely to vote for the

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.460
candidate than women.
