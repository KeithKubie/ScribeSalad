00:00:01.225 --> 00:00:03.975
(computer click)

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:08.236
(cheerful music)

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920
- [Mark Ellisman] So, you may
ask what's that title about?

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.020
Well, when you are
asked for a title early,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.456
sometimes you don't know
what you're going to say.

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:32.289
(laughter)

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.320
So, I figured I could say anything

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.810
and what I was thinking about was

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.340
RamÃ³n y Cajal and what
he would have thought

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.810
beyond his great gift of seeing things

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.890
with the Golgi technique,
that we're actually hiding

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.880
in a forest of complexity.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.540
That led him to speculate
and make predictions

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.860
that we're still following
in neurobiology today,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.390
about how things actually connect.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.320
If he were alive today,
he would be in wonderment,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.300
if you like, regarding all
of the scales of details

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.520
that we can now describe,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.300
with different kinds of
microscopies and labels.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.327
And he would probably be, as I think

00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:19.327
this conference is considering,
amazed at the gaps.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.270
So, where are we limited
with regard to filling gaps

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.090
across either the spatial scales,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.950
all the way from macromolecules to organs,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.160
to the temporal scales.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.520
And so today, I'm going to tell you

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.180
a little bit about filling a few gaps

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.540
all the way out to lifespans.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.210
Two projects about dendritic spines

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.530
and about lifelong memories.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.450
But I can't do this without
giving you a little background

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.690
on techniques at the national center

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.120
that Jennifer mentioned.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.490
We use, really, two techniques

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.960
to do electron microscopy across scales.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.150
One is Serial Section Electron Tomography,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.060
where we take thick sections,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.880
map them to get the best
X, Y, and Z resolution.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.200
We look at systems that
can be manipulated.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.560
So, here, a vestibular
hair cell is moving around.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.393
That's what it's doing.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.840
The top is rocking and
it's changing the output.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.610
Or we use a method that was pioneered

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.110
by Winfried Denk called
Serial Block-Face Imaging.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.350
You'll see an alternative of
this from Harold Hess, shortly,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.940
where you can put a microtome
inside of a scanning EM

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.150
and just automatically record

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.810
image after image after image,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.680
kind of like taking a look at a piece,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.140
at a loaf of bread as you keep slicing it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.270
and get a reconstruction
with modern methods.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.010
If you selectively stain in a cell,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.030
as was done by these colleagues.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.160
This was a sample we imaged
when we first got this going

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.680
about ten years ago.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.950
That's the endoplasmic reticulum

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.300
in the mitotic spindle and
if the endoplasmic reticulum

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.270
is stained, in this case,
with horseradish peroxidase,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.290
you can then pick up,
those are mitochondria

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.550
those are lysosomes,
wait til you see the ER.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.700
This cell's just in the
early stages of dividing.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.340
Okay, so that's all the ER.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.320
So, how do you find that stuff,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.960
hiding in plain sight?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.110
So, first,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.780
unashamed pitch, we push this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.490
technology quite a bit.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.370
While Harold Hess pushed the technology,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.930
he's gonna tell you about,
we've been pushing this

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.260
to higher and higher resolution

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.770
and bringing stains in, as you see here,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.940
so that we can genetically mark components

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.900
in the context of this method.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.045
We pushed it so that you
can look quite easily

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:42.990
at structures like the golgi apparatus

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.790
mitochondria, ER, but we've done that

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.990
through the benefit a long
collaboration with Roger Tsien,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.940
from about the time Roger came to UCSD.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.930
Even before the fluorescent proteins,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.280
but then with families of proteins

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.620
coming up with ways of
marking genetically for EM.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.990
And then, ultimately,
with Alice Ting, APEX

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.130
which is a small peroxidase.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.070
Now, that was preceded by activity

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.640
trying something called, photooxidation.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.530
Using a reactive generating probe,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.340
something as simple as Eosin
to generate reactive oxygen

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.420
and capture diaminobenzidine,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.920
which then can be reacted with

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.080
osmium tetroxide or ruthenium tetroxide

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.520
to give you electron density in locations.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.980
At the scale of molecules,
we can see receptors

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.880
marked quite clearly with this method.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.130
So, here's an example,
getting us into spines, now.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.570
Eric Bushong, who's here in the audience,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.450
when he was a graduate student in the lab,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.660
now he's a senior scientist in the group,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.810
tried out using phalloidin,
which binds to actin.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.510
In this case, with fluorescein,
but also with Eosin,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.950
we had it specially conjugated to give us

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.020
a way of doing actin by EM.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.480
At that time, Francis
Crick had postulated 1982

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.930
that do spines twitch?

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.560
You can look this up. It's a beautiful

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.560
little theoretical paper,
which was Francis' best thing,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.780
being a theoretician.

00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:16.700
So these are all dendritic spines

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.370
marked by actin in a confocal microscope.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.600
This cell, this is a purkinje cell,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.640
was also injected just to
see it with the red dye.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.420
And at that time, tomography was best done

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.670
with massive microscopes.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.686
Here's a person for size reference.

00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:35.560
(audience coos)

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.490
And we could punch through
with these very high energy

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.720
electrons, three million
volts, through samples

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.780
as thick as ten microns.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.260
So, kind of a light microscopic sample,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.450
but you can see inside.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.630
This is from a fragile X animal model

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.520
and you can see how tortured
or variable the spines are.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.810
That's a hallmark of that disease
in animal models or humans

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.220
and then if you switch
to the Eosin phalloidin,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.890
do more or less the same thing.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.850
That's the light microscopy.
Actin looks like it's all over.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.940
It's not actually. It's
concentrated in the spines.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.250
And if you punch through
it, this is not a tomogram

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.320
it's just a projection,
the spines are full

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.470
with this flocculant
material, that's actin.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.340
It's not just filaments.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.380
It's like we know in cells now, a gel

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.890
actually forms dodecahedral plates.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.260
Okay, so, fast forward to today

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.550
we continue to develop these
techniques and the math

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.700
and Rick Lawrence is a mathematician.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.942
Sebastian Phan, who I believe is here,

00:06:35.942 --> 00:06:38.790
is a polymer physicist.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.740
We developed software and methods and

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.600
automated these microscopes,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.280
so that we take as many as
a thousand or two thousand

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.580
images of the same object.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.900
So, by tilting the sample, rotating it,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.640
kind of like having a thousand drones

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.820
in this room simultaneously
taking pictures of you,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.470
then you have a super sampling.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.800
So, this solves, to some extent,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.240
what Daniel said, is the Z problem.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.310
So, what you just saw play
was one of these volumes.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.013
I'll show you another
one, but if you extract

00:07:06.013 --> 00:07:08.980
the dendritic spine from that volume,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.520
that's what it looks like,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.830
okay, after you use some fancy tools

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.940
to follow the actin.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.070
Okay, so that's the post-synaptic density.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.700
This is a little finger-like process,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.790
probably this guy was trying to extend.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.210
But this is just a surfacing
of the actin, okay.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.930
Here is a more recent
one, with something called

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.040
the direct detector, which
we invented at the Center.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.440
So, here's the spine.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.880
Head, neck, the shaft of the dendrite.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.860
These are actin polymers.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.790
The little balls you
see are actin monomers.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.400
Here, you can even see if
you're close to the front,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.860
membrane proteins in the membrane

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.890
and then this is extracellular matrix,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.520
perhaps the perineuronal net,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.290
that I'll talk about in a moment,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.920
which you can see actually connects

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.700
from the extracellular space
to proteins in the membrane

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.530
on into the cytoskeleton.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.280
That's the second part of the talk.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.260
If you look at this as a volume,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.520
now, that's just one slide,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.900
you can see how rich this is

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.230
and how we extract it
with the right algorithms,

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.980
what you saw on the previous slide.

00:08:17.182 --> 00:08:18.960
Okay, so, this is what we do today,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.260
at even a higher resolution
than this to match up

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.910
to the molecular details that are coming

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.930
from structural biology.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.580
But then to begin with different
cadence of experiments,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.650
to look at what changes
during sleep, wakefulness

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.850
timescales that we can actually
stop action quite easily.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.850
So, with colleagues in Munich

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.050
and in Stockholm,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.820
we developed methods to extract

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.040
this kind of information in large scale.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.870
This is just an example
of how this is done

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.050
slice by slice and you
can begin to study these

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.930
and consistency between
spines and different regions

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.840
or, as was published in science recently

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.300
by a group collaborating with us,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.820
how this changes when
you sleep or are awake.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.590
Spines shrink by 20% when you sleep.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.850
More adventuresomely, we're saying okay,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.900
if we know it's actin, or the majority

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.510
of what's there is actin,
what does it look like

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.530
if you substitute for the center lines

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.290
that we defined, for
the actin that you saw

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.730
in that previous colorful
spine spinning, actually actin

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.240
and does that tell us anything

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.620
about the charge and the crowding.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.740
So, this is takin actin,
replacing all the threads,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.290
this is actin from the PDB.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.123
Why do we do that?

00:09:38.123 --> 00:09:41.080
Because actin is highly
charged, very acidic

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.390
and this leads us to
predict that the actin

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.950
creates an ion binding matrix, a gel

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.770
and it's actually the saw gel changes

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.980
that may be driving a
lot of the physiology

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.240
that's interesting, okay,
so that's a speculation.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.610
Moving on, back to that
extracellular matrix,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.400
in a short amount of
time, I thought I'd try

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.740
and squeeze in what I think

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.700
is one of the most exciting projects,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.220
kind of a leave from Roger,

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.290
this is what he and I,
and he was most excited

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.060
about when he died.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.730
Project's now being led by
Varda Lev-Ram, who's here,

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.660
having to do with lifelong memories

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.470
and Martin Hetzer, who's also involved,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.240
because these techniques overlap.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.030
But Roger's hypothesis is
this and you can look it up,

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:38.030
it's in a paper postulating
that very longterm memories

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.230
might be stored in a pattern of holes

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.420
in the extracellular matrix.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.320
The idea being that if
the extracellular matrix

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.770
holds state and the more dynamic things,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.330
like Daniel talked about
and you'll hear more about,

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.570
know about the state of
that part of the brain,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.160
then those things that
turn over will come back

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.380
or form those parts of cells,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.720
guided by the extracellular matrix,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.480
kind of like extracellular
matrix is the stone

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.900
that's chiseled in that gives
a durable state for the brain.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.020
So, that was Roger's idea,
that this extracellular matrix

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.730
would be edited by Metallo
Proteases, synapses form,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.400
synapses come to a shape
by activity or size,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.280
predicted that the synaptic proteins,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.270
pre and post-synaptic would
have short half lives,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.090
relative to the extracellular matrix.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.070
So, how do you test that?
How do you play with that?

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.840
Well, sorry, this is
just a little bit more

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.870
about the perineuronal net,
which had been described

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.630
by Cajal and others.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.840
This is what it looks
like in light microscopy

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.495
with Wisteria floribunda
as a fluorescent stain.

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.880
And this is some of the molecules

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.580
that are known to be associated with it.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.130
So, you can use proteomics
and look at that,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.700
you can stain it. Sorry,
I got ahead of myself.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.780
You can stain this the same way

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.690
that it was just done by light microscopy

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.940
by doing a peroxidase reaction to mark

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.350
that material in the extracellular space.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.310
You can reconstruct it by the methods

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.430
that I showed you to
see what it looks like.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.690
The synapses are in these holes

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.490
and then the question
is, does it stay around?

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.760
So, what Varda did following a protocol

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.870
that Martin Hetzer had first done

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.740
was create animals that
are 100% Nitrogen-15.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.930
You're otherwise Nitrogen-14,

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.410
so this is kind of the
most expensive and heroic

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.340
pulse chase experiment.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.890
You can see the paradigm here,

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.230
what is it, $800 a kilo for
food, something like that

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.310
and so these experiments
are, for the food, could be

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.790
$100,000 for a colony of sufficient size.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.950
And then, at the right
point, after let's say

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.610
a six month or an 18 month
chase with the normal Nitrogen,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.640
you sacrifice animals from the colony,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.990
grind up their brains, do proteomics,

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.650
and then you're able to ask,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.490
synaptic proteins have short half lives.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.121
Those molecules that I said are part

00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:01.796
of the extracellular matrix

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.660
at six months, still 30% of them.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.190
At 18 months, they're decreasing,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.830
but some of them are
quite significantly more

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.130
persistent than those constituents

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.680
that everybody's excited about,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.740
it's synaptic plasticity,
which do turn over.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.650
So, this is supportive
of Roger's hypothesis.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.215
Can we image in 15 and 14?

00:13:23.215 --> 00:13:25.520
So, then we went after tricks

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.400
that are done more in
geology or in astrophysics,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.940
looking at meteorites or whatever.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.340
Something that was taught to me

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.060
by a colleague, Victoria
Orphan at Cal Tech,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.660
working on some samples from the ocean

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.060
and this is a machine
that uses a Cesium beam,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.820
knocks out atoms, secondary ions,

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.180
runs them down something
like a mass spec column

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.580
and then point by point,
you get a collection

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.580
of masses for as many as
seven different atoms.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.940
And you can make a map, okay?

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.820
So, one of the things that we tried,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.020
Nick's postdoctoral
advisor, Jack McMahon okay,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.670
so this goes back a way,
postulated and then proved

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.240
that Agrin, a molecule that secreted

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.180
into the extracellular matrix,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.510
guides synapse formation for
the neuromuscular synapse.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.685
So, we said, "well we
have intercostal muscles

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:27.480
from these mice, what do
the end plates look like?"

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.800
Do we see a signal from this method

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.790
that I just showed you? Yes, okay.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.820
So, that would be predicted.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.660
Here it shows you can do this.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.320
We went from there, to
ask in these samples

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.710
from the mice that Varda grew,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.230
what about this stuff,
this extracellular matrix,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.650
is it old?

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.970
And here, you see, doing
the same sort of thing

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.080
on those samples, okay,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.050
that indeed it is, okay.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.550
And this, by they way, is myelin.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.350
Myelin turns out, like you saw,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.610
maybe if you were paying
attention to the bottom,

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.806
myelin basic protein to
other myelins are old.

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:10.740
So this is telling you,
if you look at the brain

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.940
and after the majority of
proteins have turned over,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.220
six months, 18 months later,

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.700
what piece parts are left behind.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.260
And here, this is the stuff
that is presumably left behind.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.760
Turns over very slowly
and these terminals,

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.100
these boutons come in,
plug in, in between.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.830
So this is, how would you say,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.750
data that is headed in the direction

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.240
I think, of strongly
supporting Roger's postulate.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.660
All of this is unpublished,
but I think it's exciting.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.010
It's the product of, I
think, great thinking

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.420
by many investigators, great colleagues,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.073
great collaborators, generous support.

00:15:53.073 --> 00:15:56.632
This is the cast of characters,
some of whom are here,

00:15:56.632 --> 00:15:59.040
and I think, with that,
maybe I ended early.

00:15:59.997 --> 00:16:02.247
(applause)

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.860
- [Na Ji] I think we can all agree

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.860
that it is very difficult
to understand the brain.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.670
Part of the reason is
because the sheer number

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.550
of neurons we have to study.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.340
There's about 100 billion
stars in our galaxy,

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.190
but if you look at the human brain,

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.150
there's about the same number of neurons.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.420
It's also about 100 billion,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.410
but what makes it even more difficult

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.340
is that, on average,
each neuron is connected

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.930
with about 10,000 other neurons.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.980
You might look at a much smaller brain,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.980
for example that of a mouse,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.260
there's still about
100 millions of neurons

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.050
with that forming about
100 billion connections.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.400
What makes it difficult
to understand is not

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.910
just the sheer amount of numbers.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.846
The theory is that all the mental activity

00:16:48.846 --> 00:16:51.000
that really want to be able to understand

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.700
for example, perception,
attention, or consciousness,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.180
is really an emergent property

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.410
of not just a few neurons, but instead

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.560
those millions up to billions of neurons

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.280
that form a neural
network or neural circuit

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.990
by forming connections with each other,

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.800
which we call synapses.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.460
So, it's not enough to
only and try to understand

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.160
the you know 100 neurons,
even though you can

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.060
already learn a lot about the universe

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.140
by looking at 100 stars that
are formed at different stage.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.140
So, condense all this into a
scientific question we can ask.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.520
The first set of questions
we want to understand

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.970
is how a single neuron operates.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.794
For example, the single neuron in a cortex

00:17:36.794 --> 00:17:39.400
may receive 10,000 inputs.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.830
We want to know what are those inputs

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.930
and we also want to know

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.940
how this individual neuron integrates

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.650
all the inputs it receives
to generate an output signal.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.870
So, another way to ask the question is

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.020
what is the input output relationship

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.720
for the individual neuron in the brain?

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.280
After we understand
that, we can then look at

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.151
how multiple neurons,
actually tens of thousands

00:18:01.151 --> 00:18:03.940
of neurons that are working together

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.790
by forming a circuit
and what are the inputs

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.676
those circuits receive and
how individual neurons,

00:18:10.676 --> 00:18:15.580
within the circuit encode sensory stimuli

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.240
and execute a neural
command, a motor command.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.950
So, in order to do that,
we really need to spend

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.230
a very large scale, both
in space and in time,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.800
as Mark mentioned previously.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.180
So, for imaging method, what
we would like to have is

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.100
we would like to have
sub-micron spatial resolution

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.650
because that is the size
of individual synapses.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.680
Those are the size of the
connections between neurons,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.140
but we also want to be able to have

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.400
millisecond-scale time resolution

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.490
because of how quickly the neural signal

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.240
may be happening in the brain.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.840
We want to be able to image
those processes and depths

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.770
because the brain is a three dimensional,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.820
rather thick structure, which are,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.100
in all the adult brains,
they are also scattering.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.100
So, one of the techniques
that has been around

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.880
for many years, which is
very powerful in this aspect,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.580
is the so called two-photon
fluorescence microscopy.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.260
So, this microscopy
relies on the excitation

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.552
of the fluorescent
molecule by the absorption

00:19:18.552 --> 00:19:21.580
of two photons at the same time.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.840
And then when the molecule
comes back to the ground state,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.090
it will release its energy in the form

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.490
of a fluorescent photon.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.070
The nice thing about this technique

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.499
is that the fluorescent signal

00:19:32.499 --> 00:19:37.400
is only generated at the focus
of your excitation laser.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.870
So, in order to form
an image of the brain,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.070
what you only need to do is just to scan

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.189
this focus around the inside of the brain

00:19:44.189 --> 00:19:47.810
and connect to the fluorescent
signal at each position

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.950
and then when you plot out this

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.870
two dimensional roster plot
that basically gives you

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.960
a micrograph of the fluorescent
molecule distribution.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.460
As this example shows, you can see

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.680
that there's a special
resolution of this technique

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.710
is clearly sufficient,
since you are able to see

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.720
individual dendritic spines in vivo.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.771
But there's a problem
when you try to image,

00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:14.440
going beyond a two dimensional image

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.420
and this is important because,

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.830
from a single neuron to a neural circuit,

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.390
this is really a three
dimensional structure.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.790
If you only scan in 2D
plane, you will only

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.600
be able to have cross
sectional view of the sample.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.020
So, in order to get a volumetric
imaging of the neurons,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.290
you basically need to scan,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.820
you basically need to scan
this focus in three dimensions.

00:20:39.675 --> 00:20:42.470
So, you can see that it takes time.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.180
And, secondly, sometimes
your sample may be moving

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.750
and then you will have this
motion induced artifact

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.200
in your image.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.480
And, finally, if you want to learn

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.800
how high volumetric imaging speed,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.240
the traditional approach
is basically trying to move

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.210
this laser focus very
rapidly in three dimensions.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.360
So, assume that you can do that.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.570
What will then happen is
that now you will have

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.400
a huge amount of data, cause
you go from two dimensional

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.650
image now to a three
dimensional image stack.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.510
And because of this motion problem

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.670
that you want to correct,
now you need to do

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.940
three dimensional motion registration,

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.630
which is very difficult to do when

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.300
you're dealing with gigabytes of data.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.530
And typically, traditional
neurobiology laboratories

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.240
are not really equipped,
either in terms of

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.110
computation or hardware and expertise

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.250
to really handle this type of a big data.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.183
And, finally, the actual
volume rate is still limited

00:21:38.183 --> 00:21:41.270
by the brightness of the
fluorescent molecule.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.971
Even if you can move
the focus very rapidly,

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:47.200
the focus is still required to stay

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.830
at each individual position
for a long enough time

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.300
for you to gather enough
photons to see the structure.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.332
So when we were confronted
with this problem,

00:21:56.332 --> 00:21:58.700
we ask ourselves this question,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.080
is this traditional approach of scanning

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.650
this focus in 3D absolutely necessary?

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.310
And before I give you the answer,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.100
I want show to show you that

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.400
those are the neurons in the brain

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.600
and you can see individual circles.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.320
Those are individual cell body

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.560
of individual neurons and
those are the dendritic spines

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.560
of a single neuron.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.010
So, there's lots of things happening.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.839
You'll see flashes of
fluorescence intensity change,

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:29.490
which is basically telling you

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.770
that these neurons are becoming active.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.310
But despite of all these activities,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.743
you will probably also notice,

00:22:35.743 --> 00:22:38.740
is that nothing is changing.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.310
I'm sorry, the neurons
are not moving around.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.000
I mean, lots of things are
changing, but neurons stay put,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.200
maybe because of the actual [Inaudible]

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.120
that are holding them in space,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.610
but they are so stationary that they are

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.060
even constantly, constantly
have the position

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.510
on the middle of a single synapse.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.050
So, this means now we
actually have a choice

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.840
which is specifically true

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.100
if you have a sparsely labeled sample.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.680
You could do this conventional scan

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.720
and then for a sparsely labeled sample,

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.270
you will spend lots of
time looking at nothing.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.180
Or what you could do is to stretch out

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.560
your excitation focus so that

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.840
by scanning this focus
once in two dimensions

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.480
you will have a projected
view of the same volume.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.600
But the advantage here is
that the imaging frame rate,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.620
in this particular case,
is 30 frames per second

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.360
now becomes your volume rate.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.370
So, here you are looking
at the volume of the brain

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.750
inside the awake behaving mouse

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.720
and you can see the neurons
become brighter and dimmer,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.090
reflecting the activity
on this particular neuron.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:54.090
So, this type of focus where we stretch it

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.000
in the axial direction is called

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.220
a Bessel focus or a Bessel beam

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.020
and this conventional type of focus

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.920
where it's very small
in the axial direction

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.950
is called Gaussian beam.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:07.200
Now, Bessel beam is actually
not something very exotic.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.840
When ever you go to the supermarket

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.610
and you go to the checkout line,

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.810
they will have this red light
that is reading the barcode.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.110
Those red lights are
actually Bessel beams.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.790
But so when we use this for

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.450
two photon fluorescence
microscopy, though,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.960
we can't just use whatever is

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.010
inside the checkout
line of the supermarket.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.300
So, what we did is that we
built a very simple module

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.070
that is located between
our excitation laser

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.130
and the two photon microscope.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.500
I'm not going to go through the details,

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.220
but we use this middle equipment

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.170
called a spatial light modulator,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.460
which allows us to generate a Bessel beam

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.940
of different lengths,
as well as narrowness.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.400
So, here are just two examples.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.880
On the right hand side, is
what an excitation focus

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.310
actually looks like in
the axial direction.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.070
I just want to point out that this is

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.970
the actual size, you'll have to stretch

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.990
this whole thing by five times

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.540
because it's just too long to show it,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.440
if I show you its real aspect ratio.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.360
So, you can see when we
use a longer Bessel beam,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.970
in this case about 60 micron
in the axial direction,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.000
you can see more structures.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.690
But one thing I want to point out,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.090
is that you will compare
the image that you get

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.510
with what you have gotten with
the conventional approach.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.220
You can notice that we
maintain the ability

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.430
to resolve individual synapses.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.709
For example, there is
about 3 axonal boutons

00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:36.240
in this Gaussian image, which is clearly

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.230
detected in the Bessel images, as well.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.740
So, one big advantage of this approach

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.170
is that, now, the imaging
becomes insensitive

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.360
to the axial motions.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.010
So what do I mean by that?

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.530
So, here are the images of a
stretch of dendrites in a mouse

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.120
taken with a Gaussian beam,
as well as, a Bessel beam.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.010
So, you can see there's
quite a bit of motion

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.430
because this animal is awake

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.239
and hasn't been fully
habituated to have fixation.

00:26:03.239 --> 00:26:06.190
And we can easily
register this image in 2D,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.650
just to correct the matter of shift

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.630
and then, now you can sees
that it doesn't jitter

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.210
in the X Y direction as much.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.190
And if you now plot out
the fluorescence intensity,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.930
within this small stretch of dendrites,

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.070
you can see that in the Gaussian data,

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.770
you see this up and down signal

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.270
which actually looks very much like

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.994
the Calcium activity that
you would expect to see

00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:32.680
when the neuron becomes active.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.890
However, when you look at the Bessel data,

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.365
you don't see such up and,

00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:40.500
those transient like variations.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.380
Now, we could also quantify
how much the brain's moving

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.928
and when we do that, you actually realize

00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:49.590
that all those transience we see here

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.650
are very strongly correlated
with motion of the brain.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.510
So, then you can say well how do you know

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.770
this is not activity?

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.070
It could still be some kind of

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.860
motion induced activity of the neuron.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.630
But we know, in this case,
it cannot be activity

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.170
because we are not expressing
Calcium indicating rises.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.520
In this case, it's just very simple

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.080
yellow fluorescence protein.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.000
So, by using a Bessel beam,
now really don't need to worry

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.800
about whether the data
you get is contaminated

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.470
by motion artifact or not.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.490
So, as I mentioned before,
we have synaptic activity

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.610
and this will help us to do a subtype

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.400
of neuro biological experiment

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.320
where we ask the question of

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.930
what has a synaptic input
a single neuron receives?

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.240
So, here you are looking
at a 3D imaging stack

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.610
of the dendrites of a neuron.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.530
You can see the dendritic spines

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.690
distributed at a different depth.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.350
And the question here we are asking

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.977
is that what has orientation selectivity

00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:55.830
each that synaptic, each dendritic spines.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.063
What has orientation
selectivity of the inputs

00:27:59.063 --> 00:28:02.350
each synaptic spines are receiving.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.390
Now, if you want to
interrogate all the spines

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.140
within this volume using
the conventional approach,

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.480
the experiment is going to take

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.370
about 10 hours, but with Bessel beam,

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.998
we could probe the orientation selectivity

00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:19.998
of those synaptic inputs
in a single session,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.270
which will only take 20 minutes.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:26.690
So, we have about 30 times the increase

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.948
of the output and if you
would analyze this data,

00:28:30.948 --> 00:28:33.940
you can then gather the tuning property

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.460
of all the dendritic spines in one round

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.118
and, in this particular case,
we observe some clustering

00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:41.530
of inputs of a similar type.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.300
Now we are not limited to this
dendritic type of imaging.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.600
Any kind of sparsely labeled sample

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.690
can be studied using this method.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.970
So, here we are looking at
inhibitory neuron population

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.780
in the mouse brain and using
the conventional approach,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.340
to probe the first 400
micron inhibitory neurons,

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.200
we need to take at least 80 images.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.020
But with the Bessel approach, we only need

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.860
to take four images and by doing that,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.723
in each imaging session, we
can gather lots of neurons.

00:29:11.723 --> 00:29:15.760
And by looking at this
data, we very easily realize

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.610
this trend that is
there is a subpopulation

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.020
of neurons have very highly
synchronized activity.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.800
So, if you are into interneurons,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.050
then you will ask the question

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.070
that they are many
subtypes of interneurons.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.930
We can label a particular
subtype called the VIP neuron

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.041
and you can again see
with the Bessel approach,

00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:38.830
we can get all those VIP
neurons in one imaging session.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.150
And when we look at the activity,

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.940
we actually found that those neurons

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.997
are highly synchronized
and we further discovered

00:29:44.997 --> 00:29:47.130
that the activity is very much

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.020
correlated with the diameter
of the pupil of the mouse.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.040
So, now what does that mean?

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.950
It is known that if
your pupils are dilated,

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.960
that means you are paying attention,

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.384
so I hope all your guys' pupils
are dilated at this moment.

00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:03.870
But what we basically discovered is that

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.920
VIP neurons as a population has

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.040
extremely synchronized activity

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.310
reflecting the arousal level.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.703
Now, if you are in the interneuron field,

00:30:12.703 --> 00:30:14.531
then the cell type you want to look at

00:30:14.531 --> 00:30:17.190
are the so called somatostatin neuron.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.030
The reason is because the current model,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.360
the most dominant model
is that the VIP neuron

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.509
will inhibit the somatostatin neuron.

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:27.910
If this model is correct,
then what you will expect

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.270
is that the somatostatin neuron's activity

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.780
to be always anti
correlated with the pupil.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.140
But, that's not what we see.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.660
We do see anti correlated the population

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.810
but we also see lots of the population

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.480
that are also correlated.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.589
So, this means that this really a problem

00:30:44.589 --> 00:30:46.568
with too simplistic a picture

00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:48.020
and somatostatin neurons really only

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.620
have heterogeneous activity

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.860
that wasn't appreciated before.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.260
Now, what we actually didn't set out

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.124
to make this discovery,
but because we can image

00:30:56.124 --> 00:30:59.400
at a high support, this kind of conclusion

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.050
just naturally fall out of data

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.000
with a minimum amount of data analysis.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.890
One thing that I think makes
this technique very powerful,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.720
is that it is very easy to add

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.560
this capacity to our existing microscope.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.740
So my postdoc Rongwen flew down

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.600
to Max Planck Florida Institute
and it took him only one day

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.290
to install a Bessel beam scanning module

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:24.020
on our commercial microscope
in the David Fitzpatrick mod

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.860
and because biology is much harder,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.820
they spend a lot longer trying to gather

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:33.270
the high speed synaptic
imaging to work in a ferret.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.410
So, since we published the results,

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:39.260
we've been helping multiple
labs to implement this method.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.550
While we were doing that, we realized

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.630
there's two limitations
of the implementation

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.520
that we designed originally.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.380
Number one is the limitation of money

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.200
because the spatial light modulator

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.730
is rather expensive, the
equipment is about $25,000.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.797
Not every lab can easily come up

00:31:56.797 --> 00:31:59.030
with the money to afford it.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.030
Secondly, is the space,
especially for labs

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.560
that are using commercial microscopes

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.870
often time is a very compact design,

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.170
so it's difficult to fit
in an SLM-based module

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.910
into those space, into those space.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.720
So, an alternative is to use the optics

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.388
that checkout line also uses is called

00:32:18.388 --> 00:32:20.640
Axicon generator Bessel beam.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.080
It's much cheaper and the whole module

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.020
is now only about $5,000

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.960
and it's very much smaller and compact.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.430
But the problem with the
Axicon-based method is

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.100
you cannot really choose how long

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.510
your Bessel beam will be.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.440
But my postdoc, Rongwen, figured out

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.200
that you can simply transmit a lens

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.514
inside the module and by doing that,

00:32:41.514 --> 00:32:43.340
we can generate a Bessel beam

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.240
of different lengths very easily.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.500
So, again here, you need
stretch out the focus

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.574
about 10 times to
appreciate the real length.

00:32:50.574 --> 00:32:53.340
So, because this system is so compact,

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.950
we cannot easily implement
it on any kind of microscope.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.600
One particular microscope
that is of interest here

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.730
is a mesoscope that was designed and built

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.660
by a group of correspondents
at the Janelia farm.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.170
So, this microscope has a
very large field of view.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.190
It's about five millimeters, which covers

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:17.190
about 50% of half of a
hemisphere of the cortex.

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:19.290
I also want to mention that there is

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.560
a remote focusing unit
there, which allows them

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.620
to very rapidly move the
focus in a Z direction.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.370
So, we can combine the Bessel
module with the mesoscope.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.510
This is how the whole module looks like

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.060
relative to the whole microscope

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.907
and now we can probe a very large volume

00:33:35.907 --> 00:33:38.720
of neurons at a very high resolution.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.290
For example, where we can zoom in

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.420
to this very large field of view

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.640
and you can still see, we
maintain the resolution

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.340
to see dendritic spines and just a few

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.190
nice movements by combining this

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.430
with functional imaging, now we can do

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.590
extra large volumetric
imaging at high speed.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.758
So, this is 300 Gaussian
image frame of a single neuron

00:34:02.758 --> 00:34:07.710
labeled in the mouse cortex
and we can just translate

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.599
the Bessel beam six times
and cover the same volume

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:15.240
and, in this case, we can
now monitor the activity,

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.090
while maintaining the ability
to see individual synapses.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.920
And, remember at the beginning of my talk,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.420
I mentioned that the goal
of being able to study

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.180
the input output relationship
of a single neuron,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.510
now we really have the
technique to do that

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.470
on an awake behaving animal.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.130
The very last example I wanna show,

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.670
is when we look at enough
just single neurons,

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.700
but also cell bodies in a circuit.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.622
So, here we are looking
at extra large volume.

00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:43.940
Those are the inhibitory neurons

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.940
from the first 650 micron
thick in the mouse brain

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.009
and we can image this whole volume,

00:34:52.009 --> 00:34:55.140
1.3 millimeters by three
millimeters by 600 micron volume

00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.840
of inhibitory neuron
activity ar one hertz.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.810
And we're still doing this analysis,

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.800
but just, you know, subset of data

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.800
gives us about 1700 neuron
of the activity information.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.060
So, I just wanna quickly summarize.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.830
This work was made by the postdoc Rongwen

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.370
with help from many biologists

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.660
and collaborators both
inside and outside Janeila.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:21.064
Thank you very much.

00:35:21.064 --> 00:35:23.430
(applause)

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.490
- [Alipasha Vaziri] So, my lab
is interested in development

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.170
of new high speed volumetric
imaging techniques

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:31.310
with the goal of understanding
how neural circuits

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.440
give rise to behavior and
you have heard already

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.900
a number of fascinating talks today

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.750
and also the motivations
for why we need these tools.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.870
For us, I just want to briefly summarize

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.619
also why from a biological point of view,

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:47.900
we are developing these techniques

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.110
and this is basically comes down to

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.000
what has been already
mentioned previously,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.940
which is related to the incredible density

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.760
of the interconnectedness
of the neurons in the brain.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.850
So, if we think about the human brain

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.910
that has about 80 billion neurons,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.230
and we take out two of
the neurons randomly,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.210
they are only connect to
two or three synapses.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.530
And so this alone shows
us that, in many cases,

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.480
information may be not represented

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.010
by the individual elements of the systems,

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:19.847
but rather by states of the network

00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:22.510
and therefore we
intrinsically to move forward

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.360
and record from many
neurons at the same time.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.910
So, these are some of the questions

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.470
that we are interested in approaching

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.720
by developing these
technologies in the lab

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.100
and you have heard also
about parallel efforts

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.510
that are going on, on the
level of connectronics

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.930
that are related to understanding

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.760
the wiring diagram of the connectivity.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.880
But I think connection will not

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.080
be answering us these questions.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.840
It may be so the connectome,
may be putting us a constraint

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.670
on how we could approach this question,

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.780
but it will not be
sufficient to answer them

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.030
and the best example comes from C. elegans

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.160
that we also heard about.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.230
The C. elegans had only 300 neurons.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.980
The connectome is mapped out
already for over 30 years,

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.540
nevertheless we cannot predict
the behavior of C. elegans.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.420
So that is really the motivation for us,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.180
why we want to move forward and develop,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.550
move towards functional
maps of neural circuits

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.610
and in particular, what is necessary,

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.460
is we need to have tools that
allow us to do two things.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.900
On one hand, we want to be able to

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.670
do stimulation of defined
spatio-temporal patterns

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.855
of activity on a genetically
identical set of neurons

00:37:30.855 --> 00:37:32.540
and combine that with a
parallel and unbiased recording

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.530
from an entire population
while we are doing that.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.990
And you can also think about
if you had these tools,

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.120
how you would be going conceptually about

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.100
approaching some of these questions

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.490
and what we would like to do is

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:45.869
we would like to use methods from

00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:50.280
machine learning, graph
theory, and information theory

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.113
to approach them.

00:37:51.113 --> 00:37:53.587
So, in this example, you can imagine

00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:56.120
that the first set of tools could allow

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.340
us to position ourselves in each

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.910
of these individual states
of these abstract space

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.970
that are the state's space and then

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.230
by having the ability to observe how

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.470
these points evolved to other points,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.760
we could build over time
transition probability maps

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.140
that could inform us about the probability

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.035
of the transitions and use them to inform

00:38:17.035 --> 00:38:19.386
models that could be generative

00:38:19.386 --> 00:38:21.270
of the dynamics of the brain

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.860
and ultimately, what we are interested in,

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.497
to work towards discovery of
the underlying algorithms.

00:38:27.497 --> 00:38:29.990
So, about seven, eight years ago,

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.220
when we started with this project,

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:35.100
we first focused on the first topic

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.567
and developed, basically
based on optogenetics,

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:40.940
methods that allowed us to
sculpt the distribution of light

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.220
and thereby stimulating
the individual neurons

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.660
at high speed and resolution.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.260
And, moreover, the last few years

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.090
we have focused on the second topic,

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.490
which is the parallel
and unbiased recording

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.410
and here we have developed a portfolio

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.830
of different techniques
that are addressing

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.390
this question from the
level of small organisms

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.029
on C. elegans and more recently,

00:39:03.029 --> 00:39:06.900
the more scattering brain of rodents

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.770
and you're moving also to
towards primate imaging.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.420
So, and today I would like basically,

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.900
to give you a vignette
of some of the techniques

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.783
that we have developed,

00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:19.580
mainly, around the idea of light sculpting

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.174
that has found application,
both in the smaller

00:39:22.174 --> 00:39:25.828
semi-transparent C. Elegans,
but as I will show you, also

00:39:25.828 --> 00:39:30.828
could be a useful technique
for imaging the rodent brain.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.400
So, I would like to introduce

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.450
the basic idea of light sculpting

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.980
and those of you who are familiar

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.788
with optics and microscopy techniques,

00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:42.107
quickly realize that in any kind of

00:39:42.107 --> 00:39:45.270
microscope basically, the two parameters

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.190
that are describing the confinement

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.030
of the light in our sample

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.610
are defined by the, by two things.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.330
One is the spot size of the beam

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:56.680
that we choose to
illuminate the sample with.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.500
And the other one is the depth of field

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.640
or the axial confinement and you have

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.330
heard this also in many talks.

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:04.002
And with the problems that we are facing,

00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:06.221
in some sense, is the fact that

00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:09.040
these two parameters that
are fundamentally defining

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.500
the properties of lighting in the sample

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.520
are both given by the wavelength of light,

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.900
lambda, and the numerical
aperture of the optics

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.300
which is basically the ratio

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.650
between the diameter of the
lens and the focal length.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.700
So, as such, the two
are inherently coupled

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.210
and so whenever we choose our spot size

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.160
to be a certain size, we inevitably end up

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.360
with a certain axial
confinement or depth of field.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.130
And what we are basically asking is

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.250
how we can go beyond that and come up

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.068
with a technique that
can allow us to create

00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:44.910
more arbitrary distributions
of light within the sample.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.910
Now, as you have heard, the lambda

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.490
is the wavelength of light.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.630
So, if we set also our wavelength fix,

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.360
then there is now way
around this coupling.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.730
So we will end up inevitably,
for every given spot size

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.840
and every given depth of field.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.270
However, if we go to
a different situation,

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:04.490
you have heard also about
two photon microscopy.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.260
And in two photon microscopy,
it is typically based on

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.230
the use of femtosecond pulses of light

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:15.090
and the so called uncertainty relationship

00:41:16.272 --> 00:41:19.130
which says if you choose
the time very short,

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:21.720
you end up with an uncertainty in energy

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.710
which translates uncertainty into colors,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.040
means that if we use femtosecond pulses,

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.260
we are no longer dealing with

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.830
a single wavelength, but with a spectrum.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.020
As you can see, at
least that by exploiting

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.620
that spectrum effectively is constrained,

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.310
as I was mentioning
before, could be relaxed.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.320
And, so one way how this can be done

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.980
has been shown to be,
through the technique

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.399
of so called temporal focusing

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:48.130
that I would like to
introduce to you, briefly.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.870
The basic idea is we use the
femtosecond pulses of light.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.170
We send them to a dispersive element,

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.710
for instance a grating,
and what a grating does

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.020
is it sends the different
spectral components

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.640
within the pulse along
different spatial directions.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.670
So, as the pulse is propagating
away from the grating,

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.350
the peak intensity drops off as a function

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.040
of propagation and this leads basically

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.930
to a dilution of the photons in space.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.330
So, a pulse like that
is not very effective

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.850
in exciting the molecules.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:22.010
So, we reduce the two photon
excitation probability

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.890
as a function of propagation.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.870
Now we reverse the process
by using a telescope

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.753
that is consisting of a lens

00:42:29.753 --> 00:42:32.030
and our microscope objective

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.060
and what that telescope
does is forms an image

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.140
here in the sample of our originally

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.970
short pulse on the grating.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.380
So what that means is that there will be

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.480
only one plane in the axial location

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.370
where all the spectral components

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.870
will be, again, colocalized,
both in time and space,

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.910
leading to this high energetic pulse

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.480
that is very effective in
exciting the molecules,

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.240
but outside of that
region, we are basically

00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.660
dealing with a disperse pulse

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.450
and such pulses are not very effective

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.640
in exciting the molecules.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.620
So what we can achieve in this way,

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.270
we can achieve the
localization of excitation

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.100
in the axial direction by manipulating

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.934
the spectral properties of the pulse

00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:16.100
and thereby basically decouple it

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.510
from the lateral confinement and have the

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.260
reserve the lateral confinement

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.740
to basically choose the spot size

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.710
that we are interested in the sample

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.270
by basically illuminating the pulse

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.650
on the grating with a different size.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:29.050
Just to draw the comparison to

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.890
the standard two photon microscope

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.680
that you are more familiar with.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.560
In the standard two photon microscope,

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.791
both the localization
laterally and axially,

00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:42.791
are generated by their focusing

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.940
in space and in the temporal focusing.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.030
The axial localization is generated

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.120
by manipulating the spectral
properties of the pulse

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.800
and laterally we can focus in space.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.200
So, going to the problem of
large scale volumetric imaging,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.740
we thought instead of now
exciting each of the neurons

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.355
at once and scanning it, we could use

00:44:03.355 --> 00:44:05.750
that to create a sheet of light,

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:09.150
similar to Phillip's
light sheet microscopy.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.840
In this case, we can create a sheet

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.110
that is spanning over about 75 microns

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.110
but still be axially confined
to about two microns.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.410
So, the main difference is this is

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.930
a two photon excitation
and it doesn't require

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.675
the geometry that you saw before

00:44:23.675 --> 00:44:25.860
where you have the two objectives

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.830
being orthogonal to each other.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:31.570
So the idea was exciting a
field of view of that size

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.460
and then scanning that sheet axially,

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.430
quickly to capture the volume

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:40.120
and we wanted to use GCaMP
again as our Calcium indicator.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.610
And the reason why we chose that size,

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.560
was that we were interested in looking at

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.968
the brain of C. elegans that is roughly,

00:44:45.968 --> 00:44:48.610
that would fit in that volume.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:50.780
So now if you want to
do two photon excitation

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.010
of a sheet of that size, this doesn't work

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.940
with the conventional laser sources

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.640
that people have been using for

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.560
two photon scanning microscopy.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.100
You need significantly
higher pulse energies

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.750
and for that we used so called

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.450
regenerative amplifier that is shown here.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.672
Basically it is seated by a conventional

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:12.030
two photon laser and what it does

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.130
is creates a significantly
higher pulse energies

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.550
but at the lower repetition rates.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.790
And so the pulses are now sent

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:23.040
to the grating and here you
have the temporally focus,

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.400
focusing set up that I was describing.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.240
And the fluorescence is now excited here

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.650
and then collected,
separated by a dichroic

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.420
and set to a detector
that we have designed

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.670
based on so called image
intensifier and a camera.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.110
So, overall, you can see
that we can create now

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.650
a sheet that is about 75 microns

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.370
and being axially confined to two.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:47.570
And what this allows us basically is to

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:52.010
go at very high speeds,
about 200 frames per second

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.210
or video rate volumetric image.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.680
So, I said earlier, we wanted to

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.657
apply that to the brain of C. elegans,

00:45:59.657 --> 00:46:02.090
and the neurons we wanted
to record from here

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.260
are located in the so called head ganglia

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.760
that are shown here and this was done

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.110
in a collaboration with
my former colleague,

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.759
Manuel Zimmer who is at IMP.

00:46:11.759 --> 00:46:13.890
So, when we first expressed GCaMP

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.480
into all of these head ganglia neurons,

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.480
we saw that due to the incredible density

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.218
of the neurons and of the small size,

00:46:22.218 --> 00:46:25.101
we couldn't distinguish them individually.

00:46:25.101 --> 00:46:27.730
So, we came up with the idea of using

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.580
the nuclear localized version of GCaMP.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.360
Basically, it has a nuclear
localization sequence

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:35.280
that drove the expression
of GCaMP into the nuclei

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.220
and then we could nicely
see that the neurons

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.760
were localized in all dimensions,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.220
so we could apply our wide
field imaging technique.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.700
And what I'm showing you here is now

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.360
a three dimensional maximum
intensity projection

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:54.100
of 120 neurons of the worm and
during spontaneous activity.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.570
So, you see significant
spontaneous activity.

00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:59.510
Certain neurons are correlated,

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.900
others are anticorrelated to each other

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.880
and this is all recorded at
about five volumes per second.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.520
Our method can go about
four or five times faster,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.710
but the neurons in C. elegans

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.651
have intrinsically low
responding or slow responding

00:47:15.651 --> 00:47:18.850
time scales, so we chose to image them

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.985
at the lower frame rates.

00:47:20.985 --> 00:47:24.517
Now if you have such a
high dimensional system

00:47:24.517 --> 00:47:26.129
and you want to make sense out of it,

00:47:26.129 --> 00:47:29.681
one simple way of asking what
are these neurons telling us

00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:31.470
and what are they doing, is to do

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:35.300
dimensionality reduction and
one simple way of doing it

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.730
is to doing principal component analysis,

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.506
which is like asking what are the most

00:47:41.506 --> 00:47:44.930
components in this system that
it can rise to the variance

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:46.760
that we are observing here.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.040
So when we are doing PCA, we observe

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.581
that about 70% of the
variance of this data

00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:57.924
was explainable by the first
three principal components

00:47:57.924 --> 00:48:00.450
that are now shown here and here, you see

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:03.020
the color is encoding for the time.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.160
Now, again, the great
advantage of C. elegans

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.740
comes from the fact that
we have the connectome,

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.827
so we can map this principal components

00:48:10.827 --> 00:48:12.880
back to their known connectome.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.230
And what we found was that
the first principal components

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.320
was basically an antagonism
between different interneurons

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.638
and head motor neurons.

00:48:20.638 --> 00:48:22.490
The second principal component

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.390
was a class of head motor neurons

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.710
and the third principal component

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.680
was antagonism between
different head motor neurons.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.980
And we could now display
these principal components

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.180
in the face space and what we observed

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.590
was an interesting behavior,
which showed sort of

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.240
a trajectory that was reproducible

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.630
and that was also characterized by regions

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:47.350
that resembled attractors,
which you can see now

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.920
in this movie much better,
as the states of the brain

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.690
are evolving, you see
that the brain seems to be

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:55.960
spending time in one of these attractors

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.050
and then it's switching
back and going to another

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:02.240
attractor, coming back again
and going on and on and so on.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.990
So, this was an interesting observation,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:07.330
and now we have increasing evidence,

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.150
mainly from the lab of
Manuel, who has been looking

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.180
also at these animals
during free behavior.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.280
And what we know is these
attractors correspond

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.540
now to unique motor programs,
such as forwards crawling,

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.370
backward crawling, left and
right movement, and so on.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.990
So, it seems that doing
spontaneous activity,

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.660
the brain is randomly switching

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.600
between these possible motor programs

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.530
and in the presence of the stimulus,

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.430
this landscape could be tilted

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.690
such that the probability of one of them

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:37.180
being a assumed with the
other, could be modulated.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.950
So, we are following up on this

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.850
biologically and interestingly now

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.900
developing techniques that allow us

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.770
to observe this behavior during freely

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.090
free navigation as the animal

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:50.290
is making left right type of decisions

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:54.244
and see what kind of
things can we observe here.

00:49:54.244 --> 00:49:57.130
So, while working on
this, we have been also

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.696
trying to push these methods further

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.800
and I would like to give you an overview

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.070
of another technique
and this is related to

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.103
how can we extend these
techniques into the mouse brain

00:50:08.103 --> 00:50:12.060
and look at the larger
scale in scattering tissue.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.421
So since you are, many
of you are familiar with

00:50:14.421 --> 00:50:17.454
conventional two photon
scanning microscopy,

00:50:17.454 --> 00:50:19.680
I just want to briefly take a moment

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.530
and outline the limitations,
the fundamental limitations

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.570
of two photon microscopy.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.120
It's assumed that we would have

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.982
we were interested in
recording from a volume

00:50:27.982 --> 00:50:31.220
that is about 500 micron cubed

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.850
and this would be about the size

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:34.750
of our diffraction limited spot

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:38.850
and we want to record from this
volume at about five hertz.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:40.530
And now if you do the simple math,

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:43.620
these are 500 million
voxels and recording them

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:48.620
at five hertz requires a 2.5
gigahertz acquisition rate

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.480
and therefore if you wanna
at least excite each pixel

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.350
with one pulse, we would
need to have a laser

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.610
that runs at that repetition rate.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.490
So, lasers are conventionally
not available at this rate,

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.370
but even if they would be,
you're facing another problem

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.547
that is that each individual
voxel will be spending

00:51:05.547 --> 00:51:08.326
only .4 nanoseconds, which is about

00:51:08.326 --> 00:51:10.350
an order of magnitude shorter

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.020
that the fluorescence life time.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.420
It means we will not be able to

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.465
collect any fluorescence
out of this voxels.

00:51:16.465 --> 00:51:19.600
So, one conceptual
solution that we need to

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.040
that we could employ here, is to minimize

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:27.097
the spatial resolution
or the sampling grate

00:51:27.097 --> 00:51:30.410
to the limit of the structure of interest.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.980
So if we are interested, for instance,

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.890
in recording from individual cell bodies

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.600
or from individual neurons,
this resolution, in some way,

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.830
may be too good and we are
paying the price for that

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.460
by having a reduced
volumetric acquisition rate.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.130
So the question becomes in some way,

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.790
how can we relax the spatial resolution

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.000
in a meaningful manner?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.535
So, cortical neurons are in the order

00:51:53.535 --> 00:51:57.480
of about 10 to 15 microns
and this is the size

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.640
of the point split
function and in some ways,

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.130
people are mainly using that,

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.650
at least for this kind of imaging,

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.090
because they are mainly interested

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.410
in the axial sectioning capability.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.630
So we could on principle,
relax the spatial resolution

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.330
laterally, by for instance, on the filling

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.390
the microscope objective,
but if we do that,

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.468
then we will soon end up with a beam

00:52:15.468 --> 00:52:18.338
that is going axially about 70 microns

00:52:18.338 --> 00:52:20.530
for the reasons I mentioned before.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.850
So, what we really want
is to be able to have

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.136
to sculpt an isotropically,

00:52:25.136 --> 00:52:28.500
isotropically sculpted
point split function,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.310
laterally and axially.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:33.130
And so and thereby, we
would also need to be able

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:36.253
to decouple again the lateral
from the axial confinement

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:39.440
and this is again where
light sculpting comes in.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.960
So the idea here is now,
instead of sculpting

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.260
our point split function
to be a large sheet

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.280
as I was showing you before, in this case,

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.330
we would sculpt it to be
an isotropically shaped

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:53.473
five micron sphere, which shown here

00:52:53.473 --> 00:52:57.130
and then we can scan
this by various methods.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:59.800
This is a conventional
way, laterally and axially

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.220
to cover the volume.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.560
So, going back to the
example that I showed you.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.633
So the one million pixels
are now translating

00:53:08.633 --> 00:53:13.633
at five hertz to about five
megahertz acquisition rate

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.295
and which is more realistically possible

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.960
with laser technology and also we get

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.740
a much higher pixel dwell
time at each of them

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.480
so we can collect significantly
more fluorescence.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.960
So, nevertheless, if you look at the size

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.620
of this point split function, it's still

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.940
one hundred thirty times larger

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.410
than the conventional diffraction limited

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:36.730
point split function.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.230
So, lasers that were developed for

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.950
that excitation wouldn't work here because

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:45.660
they're lacking in their
sufficient laser pulse energies.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.530
So we built a laser in our own lab,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.530
that was running at about 4.1 megahertz

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:54.350
and delivered .5 microjoule pulses

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:58.130
that are enough to excite these
sized point split functions

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:01.110
and this was integrated
into a scanned version

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.190
of the temporal focusing set up,

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:05.380
which is consisting basically of mirrors

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.340
that are then scanning the beam

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.750
that is illuminating the grating

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.040
together with the lens and the objective

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.170
is performing the temporal focusing

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:20.440
and we are scanning it up and
down with an objective pixel.

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.140
So, we collect now in the fluorescence

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.480
instead of on camera, from each of these

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.560
point split functions on the PMT

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.200
and the acquisition is also

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.170
synchronized with the excitation.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:32.000
So we are running in the domain

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.890
that we have one pulse per pixel only.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:36.316
So this is just an impression

00:54:36.316 --> 00:54:39.480
of the home built laser
and it's integration

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.940
to the scanned temporal
focusing microscope.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.980
Next, we were interested
in recording the activity

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.430
from in vivo in the mouse brain,

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.760
so we used mice in where we expressed

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.220
GCaMP in the motor cortical
areas and in the PPC,

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:56.340
while they were awake and were running.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.183
So with this, we can now go deep

00:54:58.183 --> 00:55:01.150
and look at the layer to three neurons

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:04.180
and record from them as you can see here

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.760
at about 200 microns depth,
from about 110 neurons or so.

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.300
We can go also deeper
to layer five neurons

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.113
at about 470 microns, record from

00:55:14.113 --> 00:55:18.040
a similar number of neurons
and what is important here now

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.520
to realize is beyond
looking at a field of view

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.440
that is about 500 by 500
can capture at 160 hertz.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.709
So, this is way too
fast for a single plane

00:55:28.709 --> 00:55:31.560
given the slow response time of Calcium.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.020
So what we could do is
to use the time instead

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.160
and look at two planes, for
instance, at the same time.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.600
Which is now shown here, one at 150

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.730
the other one at 350 microns
recorded simultaneously.

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.600
Or going back to the example,
that I was outlining,

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.280
we can now go here and
record from a volume

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.453
that is now about 500 micron cubed

00:55:51.453 --> 00:55:54.330
encompassing about 4,000 neurons

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:57.900
and record all of that at
about 3 hertz volumetric rate.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.310
So, here you start also to see

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.740
the layered structure of the cortex,

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.501
the layer two three neurons
and the layer four neurons

00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:08.660
that try to, that seem to come out here

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.460
and one of the things that we
are now collaborating with,

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.139
with other labs, is trying
to understand basically

00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:16.690
how the cortex performs computation.

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:19.270
So we know that computation arises from

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.982
complicated interactions between different

00:56:21.982 --> 00:56:24.320
layers of the cortical neurons,

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:28.360
but how that is exactly
done is not very clear.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:32.540
So just to show you
what we can also observe

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.530
if you do some simple data analysis,

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.400
this is basically looking at the top .1%

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.200
cross-correlation within
the given time window.

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:43.890
What we observe are interesting
functional connectivities

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:46.610
or networks that are forming transiently

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.723
and also then changing over time.

00:56:48.723 --> 00:56:50.710
Here the strength of these lines

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.640
are indicating the degree
of the correlation.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.760
So one could look at
these things in principle

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.462
and ask how do they change on the

00:56:58.462 --> 00:56:59.560
different behavioral states,

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:04.186
in the diseased states, and so on.

00:57:04.186 --> 00:57:07.030
So, I just want to briefly summarize.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:10.040
We saw that this idea of
light sculpting is possible

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.040
by decoupling the lateral from the axial

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.280
parameters of the beam and this allows

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.637
us in the Wiedefield configuration

00:57:16.637 --> 00:57:19.480
is useful for recording at high speed

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.580
and semitransparent
organisms like C. elegans

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.620
and in combination with scanning,

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.343
it can be a method that
allows us to record

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.910
on the single cell resolution

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:34.050
from a large number of neurons
in the scattering brain.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.023
Finally, I just want to
thank the people in the lab

00:57:37.023 --> 00:57:39.694
who have been involved in doing the work

00:57:39.694 --> 00:57:42.410
and our collaborators, as
well as our funding sources.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:43.685
Thank you.

00:57:43.685 --> 00:57:45.935
(applause)

00:57:47.803 --> 00:57:50.720
(energetic music)
