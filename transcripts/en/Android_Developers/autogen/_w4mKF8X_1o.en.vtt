that's why they they've restricted it to
 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.350
that's why they they've restricted it to
certain number of devices and I'm trying

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360
certain number of devices and I'm trying
 

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.730
certain number of devices and I'm trying
to make sure that they've got the CPU

to make sure that they've got the CPU
 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.279
to make sure that they've got the CPU
power too and I can also I can also send

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:12.289
power too and I can also I can also send
 

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:14.170
power too and I can also I can also send
them into my own star and this upgrades

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:14.180
them into my own star and this upgrades
 

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.270
them into my own star and this upgrades
the power of that star the number of

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280
the power of that star the number of
 

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.680
the power of that star the number of
rings around the star actually

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:17.690
rings around the star actually
 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.080

and pulses in my world

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320
and pulses in my world
 

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.040
and pulses in my world
not getting completely obliterated it

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.050
not getting completely obliterated it
 

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.990
not getting completely obliterated it
happens yeah I just got attacked by the

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000
happens yeah I just got attacked by the
 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.550
happens yeah I just got attacked by the
green guys I'm basically screwed the

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560
green guys I'm basically screwed the
 

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.840
green guys I'm basically screwed the
green guys and red guys are both gonna

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:10.850
green guys and red guys are both gonna
 

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.490
green guys and red guys are both gonna
go after my world now you guys out is

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:12.500
go after my world now you guys out is
 

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.750
go after my world now you guys out is
what happened yeah so what I'm gonna do

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760
what happened yeah so what I'm gonna do
 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.950
what happened yeah so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna get these guys out of there

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:14.960
is I'm gonna get these guys out of there
 

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.900
is I'm gonna get these guys out of there
because by getting them out of there

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:16.910
because by getting them out of there
 

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.180
because by getting them out of there
they'll attack each other and so that's

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.190
they'll attack each other and so that's
 

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.610
they'll attack each other and so that's
another good strategy in the game now so

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:21.620
another good strategy in the game now so
 

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.590
another good strategy in the game now so
the game actually plays music and in

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600
the game actually plays music and in
 

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.940
the game actually plays music and in
line to the pulses and there's actually

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:24.950
line to the pulses and there's actually
 

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.710
line to the pulses and there's actually
sort of a beat going on there is sort of

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720
sort of a beat going on there is sort of
 

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.650
sort of a beat going on there is sort of
a synthase shaaa kind of the season

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.660
a synthase shaaa kind of the season
 

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.240
a synthase shaaa kind of the season
scene fcj yeah kind of thing going on

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.250
scene fcj yeah kind of thing going on
 

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.340
scene fcj yeah kind of thing going on
thank you cool yeah so that's actually

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.350
thank you cool yeah so that's actually
 

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.870
thank you cool yeah so that's actually
that's actually kind of a fun part of

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880
that's actually kind of a fun part of
 

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.400
that's actually kind of a fun part of
the game that you can fortunately you're

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:36.410
the game that you can fortunately you're
 

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.320
the game that you can fortunately you're
missing out on so that's an example of

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.330
missing out on so that's an example of
 

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.700
missing out on so that's an example of
the kind of strategy that one might use

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:39.710
the kind of strategy that one might use
 

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.410
the kind of strategy that one might use
unfortunately I'm kind of weak to be

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:41.420
unfortunately I'm kind of weak to be
 

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.540
unfortunately I'm kind of weak to be
using any strategy right now the other

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:43.550
using any strategy right now the other
 

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.950
using any strategy right now the other
thing I would would want to point out

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:44.960
thing I would would want to point out
 

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.740
thing I would would want to point out
here is that the game actually does not

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:47.750
here is that the game actually does not
 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.880
here is that the game actually does not
do a bunch of things correct with the

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:48.890
do a bunch of things correct with the
 

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.820
do a bunch of things correct with the
back key and so developer already knows

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:51.830
back key and so developer already knows
 

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.310
back key and so developer already knows
this per figure you know the back key

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320
this per figure you know the back key
 

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.790
this per figure you know the back key
whoa should should dome you're gone okay

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800
whoa should should dome you're gone okay
 

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.020
whoa should should dome you're gone okay
to the game I think I might've hit the

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.030
to the game I think I might've hit the
 

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.910
to the game I think I might've hit the
HOME key there what what is cool about

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920
HOME key there what what is cool about
 

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.980
HOME key there what what is cool about
the game is then you have a resume right

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:02.990
the game is then you have a resume right
 

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.540
the game is then you have a resume right
here at the beginning because I done ice

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:04.550
here at the beginning because I done ice
 

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.070
here at the beginning because I done ice
but you know what's not nice is that

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.080
but you know what's not nice is that
 

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.680
but you know what's not nice is that
splash screen so basically oh if I hit a

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:08.690
splash screen so basically oh if I hit a
 

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.780
splash screen so basically oh if I hit a
button that I didn't mean to hit boom I

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:10.790
button that I didn't mean to hit boom I
 

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.510

admittedly yeah the splash screen does
 

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.940

really show me yeah yeah if I can go
 

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.190
really show me yeah yeah if I can go
back it's not it's not it's not okay

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:24.200
back it's not it's not it's not okay
 

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.720
back it's not it's not it's not okay
it's alright admittedly it doesn't need

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:25.730
it's alright admittedly it doesn't need
 

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.980
it's alright admittedly it doesn't need
to be there the game's already running

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:26.990
to be there the game's already running
 

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.780
to be there the game's already running
it's already actually running in the in

other case potentially although
 

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.390
other case potentially although
technically if you hit the back key to

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:31.400
technically if you hit the back key to
 

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.130
technically if you hit the back key to
exit it's the process so you expect when

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.140
exit it's the process so you expect when
 

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.420
exit it's the process so you expect when
you go back into it it's gonna do

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.430
you go back into it it's gonna do
 

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.310
you go back into it it's gonna do
whatever it does when you start so yeah

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:13.850
we'll probably take another look at that
 

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.040
we'll probably take another look at that
when they actually get to build out

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.050

00:14:34.449 --> 00:14:34.459
the ones that all work in landscape
 

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:37.180
the ones that all work in landscape
first so I look at drive with zombies

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.190
first so I look at drive with zombies
 

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.190
first so I look at drive with zombies
and drive with zombies is a perfect

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:39.200

example of a game that kind of works on
tablets and what I mean is that a lot of

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:45.290
tablets and what I mean is that a lot of
 

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.590
tablets and what I mean is that a lot of
the touch areas are actually your size

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600
the touch areas are actually your size
 

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.670
the touch areas are actually your size
in a way that's really really

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680
in a way that's really really
 

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.440

the tail but looking at it the graphics

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160
the tail but looking at it the graphics
 

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.430
the tail but looking at it the graphics
are kind of low res and you get actually

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440
are kind of low res and you get actually
 

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.290
are kind of low res and you get actually
into the game not bad no I well the

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:11.300
into the game not bad no I well the
 

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.410
into the game not bad no I well the
title screen I liked but yeah this one

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:14.420
title screen I liked but yeah this one
 

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.100
title screen I liked but yeah this one
it sort of reminds me of Desert Bus

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:17.110
it sort of reminds me of Desert Bus
 

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.250
it sort of reminds me of Desert Bus
mm-hmm

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:18.260
mm-hmm
 

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.900
mm-hmm
so you got you've got some choices you

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:19.910
so you got you've got some choices you
 

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.880
so you got you've got some choices you
can run over zombies now you see there's

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:21.890
can run over zombies now you see there's
 

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.530
can run over zombies now you see there's
a little icon there on the side I wants

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.540
a little icon there on the side I wants
 

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.660
a little icon there on the side I wants
me to shoot that zombie and trying to

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:25.670
me to shoot that zombie and trying to
 

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.940
me to shoot that zombie and trying to
roll and so for the most part

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:30.950
roll and so for the most part
 

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.139
roll and so for the most part
the big the biggest problem with this

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:32.149
the big the biggest problem with this
 

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:34.290
the big the biggest problem with this
game is that is is probably that it's

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:34.300
game is that is is probably that it's
 

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.579
game is that is is probably that it's
actually looking at this device as an

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:36.589
actually looking at this device as an
 

00:15:36.589 --> 00:15:39.820
actually looking at this device as an
mdpi device rather than as a tablet

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:39.830
mdpi device rather than as a tablet
 

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.950
mdpi device rather than as a tablet
device what you really really you think

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:41.960
device what you really really you think
 

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.880
device what you really really you think
that's the problem

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:42.890
that's the problem
 

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.440
that's the problem
yeah so why do you think that's a

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.450
yeah so why do you think that's a
 

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.970
yeah so why do you think that's a
problem because the resources are really

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:45.980
problem because the resources are really
 

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.550
problem because the resources are really
small uh uh you're talking about the

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560
small uh uh you're talking about the
 

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.199
small uh uh you're talking about the
size like up in the left hand corner

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:50.209
size like up in the left hand corner
 

00:15:50.209 --> 00:15:52.420
size like up in the left hand corner
yeah exactly so there's okay so my

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.430
yeah exactly so there's okay so my
 

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.949
yeah exactly so there's okay so my
suspicion is that is it like in Scout

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959
suspicion is that is it like in Scout
 

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:55.300
suspicion is that is it like in Scout
small that little arrow is on the right

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:55.310
small that little arrow is on the right
 

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.850
small that little arrow is on the right
so my feeling is it is it on a phone all

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:57.860
so my feeling is it is it on a phone all
 

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.170
so my feeling is it is it on a phone all
these would be fine I didn't have time

00:15:59.170 --> 00:15:59.180
these would be fine I didn't have time
 

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.250
these would be fine I didn't have time
to play this on the phone so I actually

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:00.260
to play this on the phone so I actually
 

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.690
to play this on the phone so I actually
don't know so I think the real problem

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:01.700
don't know so I think the real problem
 

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.670
don't know so I think the real problem
in this game is there's like this great

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680
in this game is there's like this great
 

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.260
in this game is there's like this great
concept but it could be ten times more

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:05.270
concept but it could be ten times more
 

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.240
concept but it could be ten times more
awesome yeah it just it really part of

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.250
awesome yeah it just it really part of
 

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.910
awesome yeah it just it really part of
it would be just actually going back and

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920
it would be just actually going back and
 

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.139
it would be just actually going back and
doing a you know a demolition style

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:14.149
doing a you know a demolition style
 

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:16.900
doing a you know a demolition style
version you know some crash physics yeah

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:16.910
version you know some crash physics yeah
 

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.639
version you know some crash physics yeah
what's hicking what second where you

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:18.649
what's hicking what second where you
 

00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:20.110
what's hicking what second where you
just have to crash everything in an

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120
just have to crash everything in an
 

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.870
just have to crash everything in an
intersection we looked at it a while

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880
intersection we looked at it a while
 

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.420
intersection we looked at it a while
back oh yeah yeah yeah I'm I don't

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.430
back oh yeah yeah yeah I'm I don't
 

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.680
back oh yeah yeah yeah I'm I don't

remember but I know where that game for
the Xbox 360

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.200
the Xbox 360
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.980
the Xbox 360
burnout yeah right there's a burner I

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:32.990
burnout yeah right there's a burner I
 

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.570
burnout yeah right there's a burner I
can't remember anyway okay right right

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:37.580

yeah exactly
 

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:43.180
yeah exactly
yep and now when when I hit a bus there

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.190
yep and now when when I hit a bus there
 

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.100
yep and now when when I hit a bus there
I'd like something to happen I'm just

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.110
I'd like something to happen I'm just
 

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.780

yeah and so you know you'll see you know

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:48.589
yeah and so you know you'll see you know
 

00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:50.170
yeah and so you know you'll see you know
a lot of a lot of things in this game

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.180
a lot of a lot of things in this game
 

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.280
a lot of a lot of things in this game
are are there's a lot of the graphics

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:54.290
are are there's a lot of the graphics
 

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.380
are are there's a lot of the graphics
are just a little bit low register which

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:56.390
are just a little bit low register which
 

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.540
are just a little bit low register which
means certainly low res for a Galaxy

00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:58.550
means certainly low res for a Galaxy
 

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:03.190
means certainly low res for a Galaxy
Nexus for a lot of that's just kind of

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:03.200
Nexus for a lot of that's just kind of
 

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.189
Nexus for a lot of that's just kind of
note about the game the numbers aren't

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199
note about the game the numbers aren't
 

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.110
note about the game the numbers aren't
actually centered like we actually take

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120
actually centered like we actually take
 

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.939
actually centered like we actually take
a look here I guess I'm not touching it

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:09.949
a look here I guess I'm not touching it
 

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:11.110
a look here I guess I'm not touching it
I thought that was this other sort of

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120
I thought that was this other sort of
 

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.270
I thought that was this other sort of
avant-garde no no no it's it's actually

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280
avant-garde no no no it's it's actually
 

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.669
avant-garde no no no it's it's actually
it's it's throughout the yeah yeah yeah

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679
it's it's throughout the yeah yeah yeah
 

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:18.340
it's it's throughout the yeah yeah yeah
it's right throughout the entire app so

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:18.350
it's right throughout the entire app so
 

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.860
it's right throughout the entire app so
the main lesson here is tests on modes

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:20.870
the main lesson here is tests on modes
 

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.069
the main lesson here is tests on modes
of multiple devices and you know one of

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079
of multiple devices and you know one of
 

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.140
of multiple devices and you know one of
the reasons that we that we do this show

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.150
the reasons that we that we do this show
 

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.480
the reasons that we that we do this show

why your app you know doesn't make sense
 

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.279
why your app you know doesn't make sense
and even then probably make it look good

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:57.289
and even then probably make it look good
 

00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:58.659
and even then probably make it look good
anyways because even if it doesn't make

00:18:58.659 --> 00:18:58.669
anyways because even if it doesn't make
 

00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:59.830
anyways because even if it doesn't make
sense someone's gonna want to play with

00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:37.610
control just being a lot more solid you
 

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.100
control just being a lot more solid you
know the way the control is sort of it

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.110
know the way the control is sort of it
 

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.500
know the way the control is sort of it
feels like semi analog but not really

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.510
feels like semi analog but not really

like you have to tilt in room moving and
 

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:46.960
like you have to tilt in room moving and
and I really want to have much much

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:46.970
and I really want to have much much
 

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.940
and I really want to have much much
tighter control where if I if I tilt it

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:48.950
tighter control where if I if I tilt it
 

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:49.990
tighter control where if I if I tilt it
a little bit I get a little bit of

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000
a little bit I get a little bit of
 

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.029
a little bit I get a little bit of

that's sort of what it felt like when I

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:55.940
that's sort of what it felt like when I
 

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.620
that's sort of what it felt like when I
was playing the game

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:56.630
was playing the game
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.590
was playing the game
no one tip that

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600
no one tip that
 

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.169
no one tip that
so we actually had a really fun summit

00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179
so we actually had a really fun summit
 

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.320
so we actually had a really fun summit
meeting with a bunch of all the leading

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:03.330
meeting with a bunch of all the leading
 

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.810
meeting with a bunch of all the leading
game engines and hardware manufacturers

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820
game engines and hardware manufacturers
 

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.960
game engines and hardware manufacturers
right before Google i/o and one of the

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:08.970
right before Google i/o and one of the
 

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.409
right before Google i/o and one of the
things that came up was the fact that

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:11.419
things that came up was the fact that
 

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:14.150
things that came up was the fact that
very few games are correctly using the

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160
very few games are correctly using the
 

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.120
very few games are correctly using the
gravity sensor now that's understandable

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.130
gravity sensor now that's understandable
 

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.700
gravity sensor now that's understandable
because that's a you know we've improved

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:19.710
because that's a you know we've improved
 

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.650
because that's a you know we've improved
it recently and it wasn't that good

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660
it recently and it wasn't that good
 

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.789
it recently and it wasn't that good
earlier but if you use the gravity

00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799
earlier but if you use the gravity
 

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:29.510
earlier but if you use the gravity
sensor a gives you a quaternion loop see

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520
sensor a gives you a quaternion loop see
 

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.250
sensor a gives you a quaternion loop see
now it's fun because we're doing the

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260
now it's fun because we're doing the
 

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.899
now it's fun because we're doing the
game review and I can say quaternion

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:32.909
game review and I can say quaternion
 

00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:35.270
game review and I can say quaternion
without having to explain what it is an

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280
without having to explain what it is an
 

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.340
without having to explain what it is an
86 by anyways okay well a quaternion is

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:37.350
86 by anyways okay well a quaternion is
 

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.500
86 by anyways okay well a quaternion is
like a rotation matrix good enough good

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:39.510
like a rotation matrix good enough good
 

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.710
like a rotation matrix good enough good
enough so the the thing is it gives you

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720
enough so the the thing is it gives you
 

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.029
enough so the the thing is it gives you
back a quaternion that you can plug

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039
back a quaternion that you can plug
 

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:46.250
back a quaternion that you can plug
directly into your engine it's really

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260
directly into your engine it's really
 

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.289
directly into your engine it's really
precise especially compared to the other

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299
precise especially compared to the other
 

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:52.159
precise especially compared to the other
sensors it it it yeah it brings together

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:52.169
sensors it it it yeah it brings together
 

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:54.320
sensors it it it yeah it brings together
all of the data from all of the sensors

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.330
all of the data from all of the sensors
 

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.390
all of the data from all of the sensors
on the device to try and distill it into

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400
on the device to try and distill it into
 

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.580
on the device to try and distill it into
the most precise sensor you can get and

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:58.590
the most precise sensor you can get and
 

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.649
the most precise sensor you can get and
it's not only is it precise it reacts

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:00.659
it's not only is it precise it reacts
 

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.310
it's not only is it precise it reacts
really fast so people that have used the

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320
really fast so people that have used the
 

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.840
really fast so people that have used the
gravity center and I think you know

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:05.850
gravity center and I think you know
 

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.399
gravity center and I think you know
vector unit was there and they switched

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:07.409
vector unit was there and they switched
 

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:09.470
vector unit was there and they switched
over to the gravity sensor just a couple

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480
over to the gravity sensor just a couple
 

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.299
over to the gravity sensor just a couple
days later and they're like wow we can't

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:11.309
days later and they're like wow we can't
 

00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:13.190
days later and they're like wow we can't
believe how awesome it is to play

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200

Riptide with this now now that we've
 

00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:16.669
Riptide with this now now that we've
switched over but it just feels so much

00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679
switched over but it just feels so much
 

00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:18.649
switched over but it just feels so much
better and it was pretty awesome to play

00:21:18.649 --> 00:21:18.659
better and it was pretty awesome to play
 

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:20.510
better and it was pretty awesome to play

you're good exactly because the thing is

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760
you're good exactly because the thing is

you're good exactly because the thing is
we will shrink that down until it's

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:39.260
we will shrink that down until it's
 

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.090
we will shrink that down until it's
about an inch wide

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.100
about an inch wide
 

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.080
about an inch wide
hmm and that's an inch wide being held

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.090
hmm and that's an inch wide being held
 

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.759
hmm and that's an inch wide being held
you know probably about 18 inches away

00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:45.769
you know probably about 18 inches away
 

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:49.470
you know probably about 18 inches away
from someone's face on a phone eye and

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480
from someone's face on a phone eye and
 

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.360
from someone's face on a phone eye and
you've got to have some pretty good eyes

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:52.370
you've got to have some pretty good eyes
 

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.389
you've got to have some pretty good eyes
to read run from the Sun off of that

00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399
to read run from the Sun off of that
 

00:24:55.399 --> 00:24:57.789
to read run from the Sun off of that
graphic when it's that size yeah I mean

00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799
graphic when it's that size yeah I mean
 

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:59.289
graphic when it's that size yeah I mean
you know run from the Sun is is useful

00:24:59.289 --> 00:24:59.299
you know run from the Sun is is useful
 

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:00.430
you know run from the Sun is is useful
because it actually tells you what the

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440
because it actually tells you what the
 

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.259
because it actually tells you what the
game is which is a runner so let's go

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:02.269
game is which is a runner so let's go
 

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:04.720
game is which is a runner so let's go
back to the game itself well and it

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:04.730
back to the game itself well and it
 

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.330
back to the game itself well and it
distinguishes you from all the other

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:06.340
distinguishes you from all the other
 

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.240
distinguishes you from all the other
Nosferatu titles out yes right the

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.250
Nosferatu titles out yes right the
 

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.710
Nosferatu titles out yes right the
weight I'm not sure we have enough we

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720
weight I'm not sure we have enough we
 

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.590
weight I'm not sure we have enough we
need some more so just this is a one

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600
need some more so just this is a one
 

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.879
need some more so just this is a one
control endless-runner I it is it yes it

00:25:18.879 --> 00:25:18.889
control endless-runner I it is it yes it
 

00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:20.289
control endless-runner I it is it yes it
actually I think might eventually get

00:25:20.289 --> 00:25:20.299
actually I think might eventually get
 

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:21.220
actually I think might eventually get
more than one control but initially

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:21.230
more than one control but initially
 

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.740
more than one control but initially
that's your goal is is you one control

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:23.750
that's your goal is is you one control
 

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.909
that's your goal is is you one control
and basically you can you can do

00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919
and basically you can you can do
 

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:28.149
and basically you can you can do
different kinds of jumps oh yeah nice

00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159
different kinds of jumps oh yeah nice
 

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:30.669
different kinds of jumps oh yeah nice
are your ears actually acting as wings

00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679
are your ears actually acting as wings
 

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:33.789
are your ears actually acting as wings
in this case or is um well I should say

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799
in this case or is um well I should say
 

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:35.500
in this case or is um well I should say
that there's um so what is interesting

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.510
that there's um so what is interesting
 

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.990
that there's um so what is interesting
is that there actually are two mode to

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000
is that there actually are two mode to
 

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.220
is that there actually are two mode to
this game there is running and flying

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.230
this game there is running and flying

small number of things that a lot of
 

00:27:13.719 --> 00:27:15.359
small number of things that a lot of
game developers get wrong we we

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:15.369
game developers get wrong we we
 

00:27:15.369 --> 00:27:17.009
game developers get wrong we we
mentioned it on the show here but the

00:27:17.009 --> 00:27:17.019
mentioned it on the show here but the
 

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:19.680
mentioned it on the show here but the
important thing is if you get these

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:19.690
important thing is if you get these
 

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.349
important thing is if you get these
things wrong you won't get featured on

00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:22.359
things wrong you won't get featured on
 

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.599
things wrong you won't get featured on
Google Play and if you do them right

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:24.609
Google Play and if you do them right
 

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:27.329
Google Play and if you do them right
your chances of getting featured rise

00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:27.339
your chances of getting featured rise
 

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:30.239
your chances of getting featured rise
astronomically because if you do them

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:30.249
astronomically because if you do them
 

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:32.669
astronomically because if you do them
right the first time you get to go to

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679
right the first time you get to go to
 

00:27:32.679 --> 00:27:34.499
right the first time you get to go to
the front of the line whereas all the

00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:34.509
the front of the line whereas all the
 

00:27:34.509 --> 00:27:35.729
the front of the line whereas all the
people that got them wrong go to the

00:27:35.729 --> 00:27:35.739
people that got them wrong go to the
 

00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:37.019
people that got them wrong go to the
back of the line so they get retested

00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:37.029
back of the line so they get retested
 

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:38.669
back of the line so they get retested
basically of all these two if you do

00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679
basically of all these two if you do
 

00:27:38.679 --> 00:27:42.089
basically of all these two if you do
something wrong even if people like your

00:27:42.089 --> 00:27:42.099
something wrong even if people like your
 

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:45.839
something wrong even if people like your
game someone have to go you did

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:45.849

there aren't many things in the queue

00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:00.249
there aren't many things in the queue
 

00:28:00.249 --> 00:28:02.759

then your chances of getting future too

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:02.769
then your chances of getting future too
 

00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:04.560
then your chances of getting future too

fish farm is what you guys been watching
 

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:35.759
fish farm is what you guys been watching
on the background if you've been

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:35.769
on the background if you've been
 

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:39.060
on the background if you've been
watching what's going on it and and I

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:39.070
watching what's going on it and and I
 

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.379
watching what's going on it and and I
would say there's anything you can't

00:28:40.379 --> 00:28:40.389
would say there's anything you can't
 

00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:42.629
would say there's anything you can't
really see from here the the tank is

00:28:42.629 --> 00:28:42.639
really see from here the the tank is
 

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:44.820
really see from here the the tank is
slightly lower resolution that I want it

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:44.830
slightly lower resolution that I want it
 

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:45.629
slightly lower resolution that I want it
to be there's a little bit of

00:28:45.629 --> 00:28:45.639
to be there's a little bit of
 

00:28:45.639 --> 00:28:47.789
to be there's a little bit of
artifacting you can tell that it's

00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799
artifacting you can tell that it's
 

00:28:47.799 --> 00:28:49.769
artifacting you can tell that it's
compressed but for the most part it

00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:49.779
compressed but for the most part it
 

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:50.850
compressed but for the most part it
looks pretty good

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:50.860
looks pretty good
 

00:28:50.860 --> 00:29:00.120
looks pretty good
and oh now hang on it's very a

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.130
and oh now hang on it's very a
 

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.149
and oh now hang on it's very a
scientific study hard to tell

00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159
scientific study hard to tell
 

00:29:03.159 --> 00:29:05.639
scientific study hard to tell
yeah it's a it's a little blurry and you

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:05.649
yeah it's a it's a little blurry and you
 

00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:06.870
yeah it's a it's a little blurry and you
can see here up in the corner you can

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880
can see here up in the corner you can
 

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.659
can see here up in the corner you can
see actually yes and some some very nice

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:09.669
see actually yes and some some very nice
 

00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:12.600
see actually yes and some some very nice
artifacting from on the background but

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:12.610
artifacting from on the background but
 

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.190
artifacting from on the background but
other than that it's pretty good my

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200
other than that it's pretty good my
 

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.149
other than that it's pretty good my
feeling is if you're gonna have one

00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159
feeling is if you're gonna have one
 

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:17.279
feeling is if you're gonna have one
screen of your game that's as important

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:17.289
screen of your game that's as important
 

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:19.019
screen of your game that's as important
as this one in this particular case it

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:19.029
as this one in this particular case it
 

00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:21.240
as this one in this particular case it
may make sense to upgrade the quality

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.250
may make sense to upgrade the quality
 

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.250
may make sense to upgrade the quality
just a little bit of that of that one

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.260
just a little bit of that of that one
 

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:30.419
just a little bit of that of that one
image so but what I do like about the

00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:30.429
image so but what I do like about the
 

00:29:30.429 --> 00:29:33.560
image so but what I do like about the
game is it has 3d fish which is so cool

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:33.570
game is it has 3d fish which is so cool
 

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.480
game is it has 3d fish which is so cool
it's very the fish are actually modeled

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:36.490
it's very the fish are actually modeled
 

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.700
it's very the fish are actually modeled
and as you can see they can spin in any

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:38.710
and as you can see they can spin in any
 

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.830
and as you can see they can spin in any
direction and they do it they do have

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840
direction and they do it they do have
 

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.509
direction and they do it they do have
behaviors you can do stuff like I want

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519
behaviors you can do stuff like I want
 

00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:44.039
behaviors you can do stuff like I want
to I want it so first of all this is the

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:44.049
to I want it so first of all this is the
 

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:45.690
to I want it so first of all this is the
way the deccan minues work by the way is

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:45.700
way the deccan minues work by the way is

I tap here there's this little plus sign

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:47.860
I tap here there's this little plus sign
 

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.950
I tap here there's this little plus sign
that brings up the actual menu and then

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960
that brings up the actual menu and then
 

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.690
that brings up the actual menu and then
you can do things like feed the fish now

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:51.700
you can do things like feed the fish now

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:45.809
which which is fun although this title
 

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:47.870
which which is fun although this title
screen is kinda cheeseball we just take

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880
screen is kinda cheeseball we just take
 

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.579
screen is kinda cheeseball we just take
the keyboard off because damn that looks

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:49.589
the keyboard off because damn that looks
 

00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:51.380
the keyboard off because damn that looks
kinda dumb yeah I know but we're not

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:51.390
kinda dumb yeah I know but we're not
 

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.670
kinda dumb yeah I know but we're not
we're not we're only showing the HD mine

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680
we're not we're only showing the HD mine
 

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.750
we're not we're only showing the HD mine
for right now that's working for you

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760
for right now that's working for you

galleon which is the first series of

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:09.089
galleon which is the first series of
 

00:41:09.089 --> 00:41:11.480
galleon which is the first series of
levels and so much cool as it tells you

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:11.490
levels and so much cool as it tells you
 

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.160
levels and so much cool as it tells you
which that you start off with that side

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.170
which that you start off with that side
 

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.779
which that you start off with that side
up when you'll see why that's important

00:41:14.779 --> 00:41:14.789
up when you'll see why that's important
 

00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:18.980
up when you'll see why that's important
because you rotating the screen actually

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:18.990
because you rotating the screen actually
 

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.859
because you rotating the screen actually
does change the physics does change so

00:41:21.859 --> 00:41:21.869
does change the physics does change so
 

00:41:21.869 --> 00:41:23.089
does change the physics does change so
we're up to rotate the screen to the

00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099
we're up to rotate the screen to the
 

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:25.579
we're up to rotate the screen to the
side now what we have to do is drag our

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:25.589
side now what we have to do is drag our
 

00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:28.910
side now what we have to do is drag our
crates over to get that so you just

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920
crates over to get that so you just
 

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.859
crates over to get that so you just
change the gravity yes

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:30.869
change the gravity yes
 

00:41:30.869 --> 00:41:33.410
change the gravity yes
but the ocean is still in the same place

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420
but the ocean is still in the same place
 

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.529
but the ocean is still in the same place
yes right no that's just a backdrop so

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:36.539
yes right no that's just a backdrop so
 

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.210
yes right no that's just a backdrop so
so the product is saying the world

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220
so the product is saying the world
 

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.519
so the product is saying the world
doesn't make sense the world doesn't

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:40.529
doesn't make sense the world doesn't
 

00:41:40.529 --> 00:41:43.190
doesn't make sense the world doesn't
make sense as much and also this game

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200
make sense as much and also this game
 

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.690
make sense as much and also this game
doesn't make sense is what I'm saying

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700
doesn't make sense is what I'm saying
 

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.579
doesn't make sense is what I'm saying
oh well that might be true but the world

00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:46.589
oh well that might be true but the world
 

00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:49.910
oh well that might be true but the world
definite doesn't make sense you know all

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920
definite doesn't make sense you know all
 

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.319
definite doesn't make sense you know all
you have to do is see so what happened

00:41:51.319 --> 00:41:51.329
you have to do is see so what happened
 

00:41:51.329 --> 00:41:52.400
you have to do is see so what happened
in a movie theater this week and you

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:52.410
in a movie theater this week and you
 

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.339
in a movie theater this week and you
realize the world doesn't make sense too

00:41:55.339 --> 00:41:55.349
realize the world doesn't make sense too
 

00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.999
realize the world doesn't make sense too
soon okay

00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:56.009
soon okay
 

00:41:56.009 --> 00:41:57.259
soon okay
no I don't think I really I think it's

00:41:57.259 --> 00:41:57.269
no I don't think I really I think it's
 

00:41:57.269 --> 00:41:58.640
no I don't think I really I think it's
clear that doesn't make sense alright so

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:58.650
clear that doesn't make sense alright so
 

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.049
clear that doesn't make sense alright so
now what we can do is move is we can

00:42:00.049 --> 00:42:00.059
now what we can do is move is we can
 

00:42:00.059 --> 00:42:03.230
now what we can do is move is we can
drag these over and and of course I did

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240
drag these over and and of course I did
 

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.170
drag these over and and of course I did
that completely wrong cuz yeah so

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:08.180
that completely wrong cuz yeah so
 

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.940
that completely wrong cuz yeah so
actually it sounds actually this is I

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:09.950
actually it sounds actually this is I
 

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:11.620
actually it sounds actually this is I
don't know I office level understand

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:11.630
don't know I office level understand
 

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.600
don't know I office level understand
what we're so whatever you need to get

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:13.610
what we're so whatever you need to get
 

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.490
what we're so whatever you need to get
the red crate on to the right yeah I see

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:15.500
the red crate on to the right yeah I see
 

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.900
the red crate on to the right yeah I see
if I drag the one underneath it physics

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:16.910
if I drag the one underneath it physics
 

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.920
if I drag the one underneath it physics
doesn't actually work they don't drag

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:17.930
doesn't actually work they don't drag
 

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:19.900
doesn't actually work they don't drag
together so I can drag it like that

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:19.910
together so I can drag it like that
 

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.790
together so I can drag it like that
we'll move the just frictionless cruise

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800
we'll move the just frictionless cruise
 

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.650
we'll move the just frictionless cruise
they are they are frictionless crates so

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:23.660
they are they are frictionless crates so
 

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.400
they are they are frictionless crates so
I've got to get it all the way over

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:24.410
I've got to get it all the way over
 

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.480
I've got to get it all the way over
there so what I need to do is actually

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:25.490
there so what I need to do is actually
 

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.240
there so what I need to do is actually
move go like that and then go like this

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:28.250
move go like that and then go like this
 

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.120
move go like that and then go like this
thinking outside of the box so that's

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.130
thinking outside of the box so that's
 

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.980
thinking outside of the box so that's
the way the game actually works and each

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:32.990
the way the game actually works and each
 

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.150
the way the game actually works and each
one of the little puzzle and I think

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160
one of the little puzzle and I think
 

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.230
one of the little puzzle and I think
it's really fun I think it's really

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240
it's really fun I think it's really
 

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.960
it's really fun I think it's really
about and it's fun where you act at

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:37.970
about and it's fun where you act at
 

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.040
about and it's fun where you act at
where you have to deal with kind of two

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.050
where you have to deal with kind of two
 

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.450
where you have to deal with kind of two
things rotating the screen and moving

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:40.460
things rotating the screen and moving
 

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.390
things rotating the screen and moving
boxes oh sorry we lost two HDMI again

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400
boxes oh sorry we lost two HDMI again
 

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.770
boxes oh sorry we lost two HDMI again
the whole reason for having this plugged

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:44.780
the whole reason for having this plugged
 

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.090
the whole reason for having this plugged
into the keyboard and looking lame as

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:46.100
into the keyboard and looking lame as
 

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.390
into the keyboard and looking lame as
you can see there you are is is so that

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400
you can see there you are is is so that
 

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.520
you can see there you are is is so that
I wouldn't pull out the HDMI too

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:51.530
I wouldn't pull out the HDMI too
 

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.050
I wouldn't pull out the HDMI too
terribly often as they rotate it doesn't

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:53.060
terribly often as they rotate it doesn't
 

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.000
terribly often as they rotate it doesn't
help all that much but okay yeah exactly

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.010
help all that much but okay yeah exactly
 

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.470
help all that much but okay yeah exactly
it really doesn't yeah we need to have

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480
it really doesn't yeah we need to have
 

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.360
it really doesn't yeah we need to have
like I would love to have an HDMI

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:58.370
like I would love to have an HDMI
 

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.040
like I would love to have an HDMI
connector that works like a BNC

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:00.050
connector that works like a BNC
 

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.830
connector that works like a BNC
connector yeah I would too I you know

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:02.840
connector yeah I would too I you know
 

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.500
connector yeah I would too I you know
that these all of these frictionless

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:05.510
that these all of these frictionless
 

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.010
that these all of these frictionless
kind of connectors are just so

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:08.020
kind of connectors are just so
 

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.850
kind of connectors are just so
everything that you're doing here seems

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:09.860
everything that you're doing here seems
 

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.940
everything that you're doing here seems
to be oriented around 90 degree

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:12.950
to be oriented around 90 degree
 

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.740
to be oriented around 90 degree
rotations is that yes you actually

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:14.750
rotations is that yes you actually
 

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.750
rotations is that yes you actually
rotated a different way no no just 90

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760
rotated a different way no no just 90
 

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.800
rotated a different way no no just 90
degree rotations so I feel like wow

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.810
degree rotations so I feel like wow
 

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.980
degree rotations so I feel like wow
you're making me rotate my device but

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:23.990
you're making me rotate my device but
 

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.690
you're making me rotate my device but
which normally is not this painful on

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:25.700
which normally is not this painful on
 

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.080
which normally is not this painful on
most devices well but you know still I'm

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:29.090
most devices well but you know still I'm
 

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.610
most devices well but you know still I'm
you know I feel like a little bit of an

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:30.620
you know I feel like a little bit of an
 

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.220
you know I feel like a little bit of an
idiot doing it alright well only if

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:33.230
idiot doing it alright well only if
 

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.690
idiot doing it alright well only if
you've got this keyboard attached to it

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:34.700
you've got this keyboard attached to it
 

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.610
you've got this keyboard attached to it
like I do I mean realistically I mean I

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:36.620
like I do I mean realistically I mean I
 

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.170
like I do I mean realistically I mean I
I have to say I'm I'm a big fan of

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:40.180
I have to say I'm I'm a big fan of
 

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.910
I have to say I'm I'm a big fan of
things that that take advantage of

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920
things that that take advantage of
 

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.980
things that that take advantage of
device rotation when it's a relatively

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:44.990
device rotation when it's a relatively
 

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.600
device rotation when it's a relatively
small rotation so I think driving games

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:46.610
small rotation so I think driving games
 

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.260
small rotation so I think driving games
for instance are make a lot of sense

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:49.270
for instance are make a lot of sense
 

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:51.340
for instance are make a lot of sense
other ones like I remember one of my

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:51.350
other ones like I remember one of my
 

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.220
other ones like I remember one of my
favorite games baguette you kind of like

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:54.230
favorite games baguette you kind of like
 

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.630
favorite games baguette you kind of like
you know rotate the device around a

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640
you know rotate the device around a
 

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.970

all the contents settle well but when
it's rotating fully all the way around I

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:03.830
it's rotating fully all the way around I
 

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.400
it's rotating fully all the way around I
don't know that's it's a little bit

with our plugged in you know because all
a lot I'll sit in bed at night and I'm

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:16.190
a lot I'll sit in bed at night and I'm

I think that this is the kind of game
 

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.790
I think that this is the kind of game
you play in the train only because the

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800
you play in the train only because the
 

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.110
you play in the train only because the
kind of game you sit in bed necessarily

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:30.120
kind of game you sit in bed necessarily
 

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.030
kind of game you sit in bed necessarily
play you know it's it's really not a bed

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040
play you know it's it's really not a bed
 

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.740
play you know it's it's really not a bed
game it's not a bad game it's not it's a

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:33.750
game it's not a bad game it's not it's a
 

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.480
game it's not a bad game it's not it's a
puzzle puzzle train it's like in a each

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:35.490
puzzle puzzle train it's like in a each
 

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:36.950
puzzle puzzle train it's like in a each
you want to solve each puzzle than the

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960
you want to solve each puzzle than the
 

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.570
you want to solve each puzzle than the
you know reasonably small amount of time

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:38.580
you know reasonably small amount of time
 

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.850
you know reasonably small amount of time
and make the fewest number of moves and

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:40.860
and make the fewest number of moves and
 

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.950
and make the fewest number of moves and
rotations to do that and I think it's a

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960
rotations to do that and I think it's a
 

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.210
rotations to do that and I think it's a
clever game I think they're in their

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220
clever game I think they're in their
 

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.670
clever game I think they're in their
presentation is cool I would like to see

presentation is cool I would like to see
them you know even even though I think

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740
them you know even even though I think
 

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.950
them you know even even though I think
that you know this this is kind of cool

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960
that you know this this is kind of cool
 

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.870
that you know this this is kind of cool
I think that their crates on deck could

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880
I think that their crates on deck could
 

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.940
I think that their crates on deck could
look a little bit the title screen here

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:55.950
look a little bit the title screen here
 

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.830
look a little bit the title screen here
could show that on the screen actually

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:57.840
could show that on the screen actually
 

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.660
could show that on the screen actually
oh yeah I don't know I mean yeah what

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:02.670
oh yeah I don't know I mean yeah what
 

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:05.240
oh yeah I don't know I mean yeah what
are you get a closer look here you got

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:05.250
are you get a closer look here you got
 

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.030
are you get a closer look here you got
that you have the shades on that just

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040
that you have the shades on that just
 

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.410
that you have the shades on that just
makes things better it's true well okay

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420
makes things better it's true well okay
 

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.380
makes things better it's true well okay
I mean this is not I I think that this

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:15.390
I mean this is not I I think that this
 

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.750
I mean this is not I I think that this
game it has a distinct artistic style

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760
game it has a distinct artistic style
 

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.180
game it has a distinct artistic style
right right and it's it's not like the

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:20.190
right right and it's it's not like the
 

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.400
right right and it's it's not like the
most professional artistic style but

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:22.410
most professional artistic style but
 

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.470
most professional artistic style but
that may be intentional I'm sure that

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480
that may be intentional I'm sure that
 

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.000
that may be intentional I'm sure that
that is intention I actually mostly wish

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.010
that is intention I actually mostly wish
 

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.370
that is intention I actually mostly wish
the logo it's longer sure I'm not sure

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380
the logo it's longer sure I'm not sure
 

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.840
the logo it's longer sure I'm not sure
because because you got all this stuff

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:29.850
because because you got all this stuff
 

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.280
because because you got all this stuff
that's a little bit playful and then you

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:31.290
that's a little bit playful and then you
 

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.740
that's a little bit playful and then you
got drop shadows and I asked myself what

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:33.750
got drop shadows and I asked myself what
 

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.540
got drop shadows and I asked myself what
professional designer would have said

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:35.550
professional designer would have said
 

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.800
professional designer would have said
you know what crates on deck needs a

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:36.810
you know what crates on deck needs a
 

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.100
you know what crates on deck needs a
drop shadow I would have done that it's

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.110
drop shadow I would have done that it's
 

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.230
drop shadow I would have done that it's
true I only put a drop shadow there but

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240
true I only put a drop shadow there but
 

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.600
true I only put a drop shadow there but
I'm not a professional designer yeah

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:44.610
I'm not a professional designer yeah
 

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.430
I'm not a professional designer yeah
yeah also also you know just having

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440
yeah also also you know just having
 

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.780
yeah also also you know just having
having buttons at dead that don't that

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:47.790
having buttons at dead that don't that
 

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.940
having buttons at dead that don't that
don't actually react well you have a

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:49.950
don't actually react well you have a
 

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.250
don't actually react well you have a
button that doesn't do anything I guess

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260
button that doesn't do anything I guess
 

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.600
button that doesn't do anything I guess
it does do something I just didn't I

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:53.610
it does do something I just didn't I
 

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.860
it does do something I just didn't I
couldn't tell it's just turning to

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:54.870
couldn't tell it's just turning to
 

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:58.580
couldn't tell it's just turning to
subtle colors okay so it is but but yeah

00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:58.590
subtle colors okay so it is but but yeah
 

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.500
subtle colors okay so it is but but yeah
so there's there's a little bit of

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:00.510
so there's there's a little bit of
 

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.240
so there's there's a little bit of
polishing probably good could be down

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.250
polishing probably good could be down
 

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.280
polishing probably good could be down
here mm-hmm

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:03.290
here mm-hmm
 

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.930
here mm-hmm
so is there anything else we want to

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940
so is there anything else we want to
 

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.170
so is there anything else we want to
talk about other than other than that

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180
talk about other than other than that
 

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.310
talk about other than other than that
other than making sure that people know

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.320
other than making sure that people know
 

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.630
other than making sure that people know
you didn't tune in for the beginning

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640
you didn't tune in for the beginning
 

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.040
you didn't tune in for the beginning
that we're gonna be changing the format

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:13.050
that we're gonna be changing the format
 

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.410
that we're gonna be changing the format
of this show yeah and so forth

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420
of this show yeah and so forth
 

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.270
of this show yeah and so forth
format exactly why we're still gonna

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280
format exactly why we're still gonna
 

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.710
format exactly why we're still gonna
drown out here even though I'm paying

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720
drown out here even though I'm paying
 

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.170
drown out here even though I'm paying
for it now again isn't that's right and

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180
for it now again isn't that's right and
 

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.210
for it now again isn't that's right and
that's the way we like things and also

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220
that's the way we like things and also
 

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.490
that's the way we like things and also
so so most importantly we're gonna be

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500
so so most importantly we're gonna be
 

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.590
so so most importantly we're gonna be
nominating different categories of games

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:27.600
nominating different categories of games
 

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.890
nominating different categories of games
so next week is going to be tower

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900
so next week is going to be tower
 

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.180
so next week is going to be tower
defense games we got

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:32.190
defense games we got
 

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.220
defense games we got
our driving games then we got that our

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:34.230
our driving games then we got that our
 

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.400
our driving games then we got that our
