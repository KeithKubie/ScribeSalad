NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.690
where we'll highlight
one of three

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.680
commonly missed opportunities
for applications

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.660
to deliver delight
to their users.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.030
This is the third and
last part of the 3 Steps

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.270
to Awesome series.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.950
I'm your host, Nazmul
Idris a developer

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.870
advocate passionate
about design and mobile.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.279
And I have, with me,
a very special guest.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.570
PATRICK LARVIE: Thanks, Nazmul.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm Patrick Larvie, I'm a UX
researcher here at Google.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.110
I've been working
on mobile for years.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.460
And I have lots to say.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.060
NAZMUL IDRIS: Awesome.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.680
So make sure to create
applications that are actually

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.760
useful and add value
to people's lives.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.380
So before thinking about
the best interaction

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.900
design, or the best visual
design for your application,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.554
or even the best engineering,
or the best feature set,

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:50.220
it's really important to, first,
validate your assumptions about

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.349
whether users actually need
your app in the first place.

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:56.140
It's kind of crazy.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.240
But you really have to value
that assumption first and set

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.090
the goals correctly.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.790
So build applications that
people actually want to use.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.041
And then delight them with
an amazing user experience.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.081
PATRICK LARVIE: Getting
the details of that right

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.560
is going to different series.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.330
But I think we can start
here with some real basics

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.610
that you can use to make
sure that this is true.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.090
And the first thing to
remember is usability really

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.300
is job one for every
app developer out there.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.740
Some of these things are
going to sound super basic

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.490
and you're going
to say, well these

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.830
are the things already do.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.660
But just check.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.810
Just make sure that you're
thinking about this.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.351
The first thing I
want to think about

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:33.100
is, what are the
physical constraints

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.290
and what the physical
possibilities of the form

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.790
factor I'm designing for.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.950
Tablet.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.950
Phone.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.220
What is it that
you're designing for?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.000
These are not similar.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.340
They are both
different from laptops.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.010
They're both devices that live
with app based ecosystems.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.200
That doesn't mean
that they're the same.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.287
Think about some of the very
first tablet-like devices

00:01:57.287 --> 00:01:57.870
they came out.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.580
The Kindle, these are
optimized for reading.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.430
They look very much like books.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.500
And, in fact, we
know this is why

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959
people are buying these tablets.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.000
They enjoy reading books.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.208
They enjoy reading magazines.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.060
They enjoy reading
all kinds of content.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.330
That's not necessarily
true for mobile phones.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.460
You can read a novel
on a smartphone.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.750
You're not going to
be reading that novel

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.990
on your mobile phone.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.729
And this is just-- this is
one of the subtle, but really,

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.270
really important
differences that you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.690
need to understand
about form factor.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.130
Think, not just about
how users interact

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.560
with what they see on a screen.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.580
But you can also think about how
information gets to the device

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.700
and comes back
out of the device.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.350
Text-to-speech and
voice input are really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.150
important to think about.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.090
They're really novel
ways of interacting

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.260
with a mobile phone.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.450
If you're not familiar with
it, familiarize yourself

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.590
with Google Now.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.596
It has some awesome examples of
how-- what the mobile device--

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:52.970
a kind of device
people are often

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.370
using while they're doing
other kinds of things.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.070
You can say, how long how
long is a Golden Gate Bridge,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.030
as you're, perhaps
peddling across it.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.170
And it will speak
back to you and say,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.540
it is-- I'm not sure, a mile
and a half, or whatever it is.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.160
So this is a novel, but
entirely appropriate,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.510
way of using text to
speech and voice input

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.200
on a device like that.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.380
May not be the best
thing to use on a tablet.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.230
It depends a lot
on the situation.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.380
But the form factor between
these two kinds of devices

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.550
has vast implications
that often people

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.950
are not thinking through.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.430
Do not attempt to just reuse
smartphone applications

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.990
for tablets.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.380
It's a fundamental mistake.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.546
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.280
I think, to your point
if the difference

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.380
in usage between smart
phones and tablets

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.710
on the go on mobile
devices, like smart phones,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.540
people have really,
really limited attention

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.400
to devote to these
particular devices.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.270
Because they're also taking in
their environment and so on.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.420
So it's not appropriate
to make big, big demands

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.700
of their attention
while they're on the go

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.030
and using their application.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.900
Whereas in a tablet,
maybe you're at home.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.460
The context is very different.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.530
And so you can then
optimize things

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.170
more for content consumption,
rather than content creation,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.250
or even things that
you need to do,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.462
tasks you need to execute o.

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:06.670
PATRICK LARVIE: That's right.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.820
You know, that's a
really good point.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.180
There are lots of studies
that show that the smartest,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.459
most switched-on user who really
wants to interact throughout

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.870
has a more limited attention
span, and more limited--

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.590
has just basically
less memory to use

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.820
when using a mobile
phone than when

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.240
using other kinds of devices.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.150
Keep this in mind.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.230
It's not that the
user is different.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.137
It's that the device
imposes this difference.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.720
When you've got a
mobile phone, you're

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.840
also attending to
the environment.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.631
You're tending to lots
of different things.

00:04:36.631 --> 00:04:38.190
This reduces the
amount of attention.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.060
This reduces the
amount of brain power

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.210
a person can bring to
whatever app they're using.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.877
So this is really
important to think about,

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:49.460
because I know a lot of you have
heard, or are thinking about,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.910
or are currently using
responsive design.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.430
And responsive design is a
fantastic engineering fix.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.930
But I do not think of
it as a design solution,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.310
because it is not.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.860
Just because you
can take that novel

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.380
and put on a mobile phone,
doesn't mean you should.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.770
Do not just reflow web pages
on a mobile because you

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.640
can use responsive design.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.660
Think-- going back that
novel, think about it.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.870
On a mobile phone, with a
person's reduced ability

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.270
to attend, a person's reduced
attention span, a person's

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.420
reduced memory, the
table of contents

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.030
is going to work really well.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.670
Something where you're going to
select between several options.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.620
And you go to some
other kind of content.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.900
The novel, the
inside of a chapter,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.800
completely inappropriate.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.510
So just because you can put
lots of text on a phone,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.810
does not mean you
have-- responsive design

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.280
does not, in any way, optimize
text for mobile devices.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.324
It simply puts that
text on mobile devices.

00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:49.740
That is the beginning
of your job.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.448
It's not the end.

00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:52.546
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:05:52.546 --> 00:05:55.220
PATRICK LARVIE: You
know, I think one thing--

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.060
this is-- I wanted to talk a
little bit about cowboy design.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.250
Lots of people like to
leave their signature.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.530
Lots of people like to have
a strong brand presence.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.704
It is a wild, wild west
out there without design.

00:06:06.704 --> 00:06:07.620
Lots of you know this.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.161
You've had lots of
apps that you look

00:06:09.161 --> 00:06:11.820
and you say, wow, I have
absolutely no idea what

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.370
this is, or what it does.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.027
This is not a way of making
your user feel welcome,

00:06:17.027 --> 00:06:19.110
because your user is not
going to feel in control.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.568
They're not going
to feel like they

00:06:20.568 --> 00:06:22.690
understand what's going on.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.346
If you-- the reason for
platform conventions

00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:27.970
isn't just to straight
jacket everybody

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.390
into a series of design patterns
that otherwise make no sense.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.530
The point is to make
everybody feel comfortable,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.470
everybody feel in charge
with what their doing.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.930
Internal-- learn and internalize
those design guidelines.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.820
You sometimes have
to deviate, as we've

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.221
said in the other episodes.

00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.470
Sometimes you have to deviate.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.470
You should do so purposefully
and thoughtfully.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.990
If you're not sure
how to approach this,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.190
find a coder buddy, and
go through the guidelines

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.670
until you thoroughly
understand them.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.940
Remember that users
expect objects

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.180
to behave in a certain way.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.040
And there's absolutely no
reason to confuse or befuddle

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440
your user.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.060
And when you're
going to deviate,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.030
do so, but do so in a very
thoughtful and purposeful way.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.810
The other thing about-- that
I just want to say about apps

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.730
is that you want to
know about location.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.230
And generally, when app
designers think about location,

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.860
they think GPS.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.990
I want you to think
about internal location.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.320
Does the user know where he
or she is within your app?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.153
Am I on my homepage?

00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:32.120
Am I on my content page?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.540
Where am I?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.410
Where can I go from here?

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.870
Where can I go next?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.660
And what will I do there?

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.750
This is actually a
fundamental heuristic.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.820
And you can and
should be applying

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.200
it to walk through your app
before it gets released.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.565
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:07:47.565 --> 00:07:49.190
PATRICK LARVIE: And
I know a lot of you

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.356
out there already know this.

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.250
This is super, super basic.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.100
But it's surprising
how many people

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.330
fail to attend to this
fundamental, super basic aspect

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.880
of design.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.300
Please be sensitive to the
48 DPI minimum touch target

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.560
size when building anything
on a mobile device.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.660
And by the way,
that 48 DPI, that's

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.770
for the actual touch target.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.360
You need a buffer zone
around that touch target

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.310
as well because you can't see
it out there in video land,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.087
but my fingers are kind of big.

00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:20.420
And if you don't have an
appropriate buffer around them,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.070
or you need a zone
around those tap

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.270
targets to keep your
user from inadvertently

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.490
touching the wrong thing.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.230
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.590
So I think along these
lines of touch targets,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.539
Prototyping on Paper is a really
good application for Android

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.900
and iPhone that I
encourage you guys use.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.679
You could basically
take pictures

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.830
with your camera off
actual screen shots,

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.562
or basically wire
frames, or anything

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:45.770
that you're drawing on paper.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.520
You, essentially, just
take pictures of them,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.061
and then wire them
together, and then

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.160
create a flow that
allows you to interact

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.100
with different parts of
those scanned images.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.970
So it's a really,
really good way

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.545
to test out your
design, to make sure

00:08:57.545 --> 00:09:00.462
that you've gotten some of
these touch targets right

00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:02.670
before you actually do the
expensive part of actually

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.610
protecting it and developing it.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.220
So I hope you got
your episode today.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.090
Just remember, by
following our three steps,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.960
you too can avoid
common pitfalls

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.480
and make awesome applications.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.940
Also, if you haven't already,
please join our UX community

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.920
on Google Plus, we
curate information

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.045
about all things
that are related UX.

00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:23.590
PATRICK LARVIE:
What's it called?

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.920
What's the community called?

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.570
NAZMUL IDRIS: It's called
UX Design for Developers.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.550
And the QR code is
actually on the screen,

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.686
along with a link for it.

00:09:33.686 --> 00:09:35.560
So thank you, Patrick,
for being on the show.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.900
PATRICK LARVIE: Thank you,
Nazmul, for having me.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.108
NAZMUL IDRIS: Thanks for
watching, join us next time,

00:09:39.108 --> 00:09:40.130
and goodbye.
