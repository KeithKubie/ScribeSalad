Ryan: Welcome everyone. 

00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:04.200
It is my pleasure today to introduce
two time Grammy nominated

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.600
singer, songwriter, producer
Eric Roberson to perform

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.300
as part of our Musicians@Google series.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.100
Eric's released seven albums
on his label called 'Blue Arrow Soul'.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.600
It's an independent label
which he started in 2001.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.033
In '07, he was the first Indie artist
to be nominated for a BET Award.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.900
His most recent album, 
'Music Fan First', has two songs

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.833
which were nominated for Grammys
including the song 'Still'

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.600
which was nominated for the upcoming
awards in February.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.067
Eric's been a force in the music industry
for over 15 years

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:40.867
and has worked with and written
for artists ranging from DJ Jazzy Jeff,

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.967
Will Smith, Jill Scott, Music Soul Child,
and many more.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:46.167
On a more personal note, 

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:50.233
whenever I make heartbreak mixes
Eric's songs are right in there

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:54.233
when my friends or myself
are goin' through that.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.933
His songs deal with that topic
and many more.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.500
He's a great story teller, a wonderful lyricist,
and genuinely a great guy.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.367
So please join me in welcoming Eric Roberson.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:09.667
[applause]

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:10.367
Eric Roberson: Hi everybody.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.500
I 'm Eric Roberson and I'm going
to name the band behind me.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.700
And right now, as we speak,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.100
we're gonna call them
"The Bomb Dot Com".

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.133

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.900

So I have seven albums. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.333
We'll talk more about
that as we keep going on. 

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.467
But this song is entitled 'Newness'.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.833

Eric Roberson: So my story was
I was a songwriter producer.

00:13:07.567 --> 00:13:09.700
I've written songs for everybody
and their mother.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.767
Ryan told you about some of them.

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:14.133
I wasn't happy with 
where my career was at.

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.400
Sure I was okay financially, 

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.667
but I had all these songs
I wasn't willing to sell.

00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:23.167
And-- and I started making a album
as a hobby.

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:26.567
And I really was willing to just sell it
to whoever wanted to buy it.

00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:28.800
If I sold two copies, 
I would have been fine.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.233
And my fans that I gained, 
all seven of them,

00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:40.267
challenged me to-- to take things serious
and to do more music.

00:13:40.267 --> 00:13:44.400
And the amazing thing is
that we made another album.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.300
And-- and now we're on
now album number seven.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.467
And we've had the fortunate opportunity
to have toured the world several times over.

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:53.100
We've done Russia.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.467
We've done Japan, and all over Europe, 

00:13:55.467 --> 00:14:00.067
everywhere you can possibly imagine
as well as all over the United States.

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:03.633
And recently, from a company
that we manufacture,

00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:08.533
distribute all of our music ourselves
with distribution deals in other countries,

00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:13.867
we were nominated for a Grammy which
you know is unheard of in R&amp;B music,

00:14:13.867 --> 00:14:15.833
two years straight. 

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:18.200
Thank you very much.
Alright. 

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.333
The beer hasn't got to them yet.

00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:22.200

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.567
But it's been a blessing. 

00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:25.567
And It's -- 

00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:27.567
I'm sure a lot of people here
can relate.

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:29.733
When you just follow your heart,

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:31.267
a lot of rewards can happen

00:14:31.267 --> 00:14:34.400
and it's very important that
we all be honest with ourselves

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.500
and we ask ourselves honest questions

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.167
and give ourselves honest answers. 

00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:41.300
So, with that said, 

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.700
I would like to dedicate this next song

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.967
to the young lady whose
middle name is [Lavet].

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:49.333
She didn't want everyone
to know that here --

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:50.367
D. Maurice "DMo" Macklin: Wow!

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:55.467
Eric Roberson: --but it's my personal
pleasure of letting the cat out of the bag.

00:14:55.467 --> 00:14:59.267
So when you see her tag
and it just says "L",

00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:01.767
you know that it's 'Lavet'.

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:02.267

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:06.467

[applause]

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.300
Eric Roberson: Thank you very much.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:21:00.633
Now, since I would safely say 90% of you
in here may not know these songs,

00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:02.500
I figure out let's do
something really special.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:09.733
Let's-- let's maybe make a song up that
we can all learn and know together.

00:21:09.733 --> 00:21:10.467
Yes. 

00:21:10.467 --> 00:21:12.933
So what we're gonna do
is we're going to --

00:21:12.933 --> 00:21:14.100
D. Maurice "DMo" Mackline: Yeah,
they were excited about that.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.467
Eric Roberson: They were--
they were really, really but let's,

00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:18.267
we're gonna treat it fairly you know.

00:21:18.267 --> 00:21:19.700
I'm sure you're very happy
with your jobs.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:26.200
But let me first say real quick one of my
favorite songwriters in the entire world,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.633
very, very amazing, amazing songwriter
has written songs

00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:31.367
for everybody and their mother is in
the room right here Gordon Chambers.

00:21:31.367 --> 00:21:32.267
He's in the black jacket.

00:21:32.267 --> 00:21:33.500
Wave your hand, Gordon.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.300
[applause]
D. Maurice "DMo" Macklin: Alright.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.400
Eric Roberson: Amazing, amazing
artist, singer, songwriter.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.733
And one of the reasons
when I started selling songs,

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:44.867
it was because I read an article
about this young man

00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:49.933
and said this can actually, 
I can pay rent by doing this.

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:50.733
So followed in his footsteps. 

00:21:50.733 --> 00:21:54.433
So in the theme of
writing songs, you know, 

00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:57.900
we're going to write this song
together right now.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.567
And we're gonna share the publishing.

00:22:02.367 --> 00:22:04.600
 All of us, every single person
in this room. 

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.433
We're gonna split it up evenly.

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:15.733
Like 83%  on the stage here and 17 --

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:18.200
well, we'll let the finance people
take care of all that stuff.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.800
But what I need is this.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.600
I need subjects from the crowd. 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:28.433
It could be literally anything you want
but let it not be anything like love --

00:22:28.433 --> 00:22:29.733
D. Maurice "DMo" Macklin: Please make it
difficult for him.

00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:33.400
Eric Roberson: -or peace or, you know,like don't-
don't like just, don't make it a simple song.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.933
A song is only as good as the words given.

00:22:35.933 --> 00:22:36.400
D. Maurice "DMo" Macklin: Yes.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.167
Eric Roberson: So we have one hand up.
Yes

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:41.133
