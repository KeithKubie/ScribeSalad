When the learner is ready
the teacher will appear.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.460
And when the learner no longer needs the
teacher, the teacher will be killed by

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.162
somebody and then you have to go off and
learn Kung Fu.

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:12.064
&gt;&gt; I think you're actually
taking the plot of Kung Fu.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:12.899
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I am, I am.

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:14.304
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Well anyway I'd like

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:15.910
to think Jordan Pollock for this.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.680
I really love this example.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.960
I was really the first example of kind
of mechanism design that really sort

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.740
of hit home for me.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.150
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
And it seems relevant to this kind of

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660
online teaching scenario
that we're in right now.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean it's not enough for,
I mean I know I'm sure some people

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.820
taking this class have
actually done peer grading.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.542
And there is always this question of
why won't everyone just give everybody

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:37.060
good grades.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.780
You have to construct something so
that that doesn't happen.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.430
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.142
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, I'm going to give
you one more example, I think.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.946
And then I think maybe we'll
sort of cover the space enough.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:47.835
What do you think of that?

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:48.535
&gt;&gt; That would be great.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:49.090
&gt;&gt; Okay.
