00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.260
 (painfully wailing) "I am sorry!" 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.380
 So, in the New York Times 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.440
 In the first sentence of the comment on the falling dog, 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.200
 Critic Vincent Camby wrote 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.320
 This is an unusual year, 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.940
 In the middle of the year, 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.120
 We found a new, first-rate film director. 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.720
 Then continue to list four by four 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.260
 You have not heard of the director’s shooting 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.020
 Movies you have not seen 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.060
 They have not lasted for more than ten years 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.040
 Make a movie before continuing 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.900
 Now add the name of Quentin Tarantino to the list. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.920
 I guess one fifth is not bad. 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.820
 (screaming) 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 "You will be fine!" 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 25 years after that comment, Tarantino 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.800
 Probably the most popular 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.300
 a living director who is still working, 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.080
 May be after Spielberg and Scorsese. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 His eight movies are over. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.340
 Global $1.5 billion, writing 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.560
 His work can fill a small library. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 This quarter-century milestone is a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.660
 Good opportunity to review 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.960
 The classic level of Tarantino's first film. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.160
 I am a little obsessed with the first time, 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.840
 How things start, and 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.540
 The first scene of the falling dog 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 Probably the first thing I think of first. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.040
 Ok, yes, obviously 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 I know this is not technical. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000
 The first movie, but 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.820
 I have been watching 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.500
 Before the beginning 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 Dinner scene as the whole movie of Tarantino 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.200
 A prelude. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.660
 The traditional prelude is the mood setter. 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.200
 A little bit of music is set up 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.860
 What is coming soon. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.220
 Only in the world of Tarantino, 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.140
 The prelude is a seven-minute conversation about the merits of Madonna's songs and tips 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 It is natural. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.360
 "But no, people say 'don't spend these people 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 Give those people a tip,' 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.060
 That is nonsense. ” 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380
 So the first shot of the story 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.300
 This is appropriate, it is the most exciting 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 One of the beginnings in the history of film. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.080
 Just like the first note in the first one 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.300
 Led Zeppelin album. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.080
 Before you have a chance to wink, 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.040
 You are involved. Your soul fan 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.520
 Go forward and back. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400
 In the film, actions are usually taken to produce consequences. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 But here, the consequences have actions; 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 The action you started to imagine. 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.700
 The robbery had a problem. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.760
 [Led Zeppelin's "Good Times Bad Age" is played in the background] 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.060
 Just like you used to be in the past 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.600
 You are also in the future, 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.160
 How long can this guy live? 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.260
 And what else? 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.340
 Can do to save him 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.920
 And of course, 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.780
 Bleeding like Mr. Orange, 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.980
 You can't get rid of now, 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860
 Because this is pain; 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.980
 Cruel and specific attention 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.960
 Until now. 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.100
 This is pain, the feeling of panic 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.500
 Time is running out, that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.380
 Put this movie with 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.860
 Other films that start with media resources are separated. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.820
 Whenever I create anything, 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.520
 I always compare it to the beginning of the drowning dog. 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.800
 My beginning 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.740
 Can you attract attention like this? 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.420
 Does it have the same kinetic energy 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 Let you enter the narrative? 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.480
 Of course, we are here too. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.100
 Jean Tarantino 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.720
 Famous way 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720
 Nonlinear narrative 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.820
 In the interview, Tarantino made a comparison 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.660
 Byzantine early film tracks 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.980
 Novel writing. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.780
 "There is always only one novel. 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.780
 Almost completely free 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.180
 Tell their stories in the way they see fit, 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.260
 Ok, that is me. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
 This is what I want to do. " 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.760
 But although I think the comparison 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.540
 The novel is very relevant, I also think there 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.800
 This is a relationship, 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.180
 With music. 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.380
 I think one of them makes 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.360
 The falling dog became so backward 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.380
 It is the instinct of Tarantino. 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.420
 Narrative power. 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.040
 For me, the order of the movies 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.260
 Much like a low-key aspect 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 Pop music; sorting of albums. 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.700
 One of the reasons I love Abbey Road, 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.120
 For example, one of the reasons 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.460
 I have listened to it many times. 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.900
 Along the way, because 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.620
 The song sequence took me through. 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.960
 Even in the first half, that is the first half 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.120
 There is no mixing and there is a thrust. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.660
 I mean, imagine this change. 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.160
 Feel if the album starts, let's say, 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.740
 Maxwell's silver hammer. 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.720
 [Beatle's "Maxwell's silver hammer, playing in the background] 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.680
 Now imagine the change in feeling 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.780
 The drowning dog starts here. 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.780
 "Greeting to a bastard inside. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.560
 Cabot is doing a job and doing big things 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.740
 Fat guy guess who he wants? " 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.280
 The order of falling dogs 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 Has the same natural rhythm as the natural rhythm 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.780
 Album cycle; 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.600
 Offers a variety of rhythms 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.460
 From intense, reflective, back, 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.240
 Link the corresponding scenes together. 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.480
 All Tarantino films are built this way. 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.320
 Like an album; prefer an album, 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.780
 I think, than the novel. 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.820
 Even those more 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.720
 Straightforward narrative. 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.100
 [Rick Ross' "100 Black Coffins", playing in the background] 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.280
 "When I got an idea, 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.400
 Part of what I have to do 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.920
 Is to check that recording room 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.300
 And check those records, 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.080
 And go 'find the music' 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.960
 Or the "personality" of a movie. 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.680
 It’s like I am looking for rhythm 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 This movie needs to be played, 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 I am looking for spirit and rhythm 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.880
 This movie needs to be played. " 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.240
 Tarantino is another thing 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.140
 The most famous is his dialogue. 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.380
 Of course there are some references 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.620
 The dog in the water is not so classic. 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.140
 "Do you know who she is like? 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.380
 She looks like Christie Love. 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.340
 Remember the TV show? " 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.440
 "Get Christie's love, love, love" 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.720
 "Get Christie's love, love, love!" 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.780
 "She is the police?" "Oh yeah!" 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.040
 "You were arrested, sugar!" 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.540
 (laugh) 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.300
 No one remembers this show today. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.100
 Get Christie’s love, 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.460
 But what is more important here is the concept; 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.320
 People are still talking about TV shows, 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.180
 Entertainment is still a universal language 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.360
 Between strangers. 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.160
 "Playing a type role in a type movie 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.580
 Ok, give them a real life length, 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 Let them sound like real people 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 Like, I know, my friend, my friend, 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.440
 And just other people, 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.180
 And quote other people's references..." 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.400
 Falling Water Dog translated into 2017 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.300
 Because of humanity and comedy 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.700
 Tarantino Breathing Types 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.940
 The whole Hollywood still feels. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.060
 "It’s all right; 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.820
 Among them, a great hero 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.840
 Kevin Bacon 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.680
 Teach the whole city that is all human 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.100
 Stick to their ass 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.040
 Dancing is the best thing. " 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.780
 I think the only one 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.680
 The dog is not so classic. 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.080
 It is Tarantino's own movie. 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.760
 On all the influences of film culture and popular culture 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.500
 , it is still very obvious 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.300
 His most amateur movie. 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.420
 If the film is released, how will it be recognized? 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.000
 Is impossible 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.100
 Because so many cinemas 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.140
 Received in the past 25 years 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.100
 The impact of this style. 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.880
 But I think Siskel and Ebert 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.380
 Their original comments are very close. 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.280
 "I like this movie, 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.920
 I hope it goes a step further and try more. " 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.860
 "I have the same reaction, that's it. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.400
 a lot - a style of practice, 呃

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.200
 But then I got it very quickly. 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200
 I mean, I understand what he wants to do here, 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.840
 This is what is shown in the crime movie. 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.140
 The crime movie is not shown. 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.080
 For example, hey, humor... 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.420
 But we get "in 15 minutes" 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.200
 Lost part of the falling dog 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.800
 Is a more profound character research and exploration 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.720
 You are in a vulgar novel 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.440
 Dangerous relationship, shameless bastard and 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.280
 The liberated Jiang Gezhong got a good idea. 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.460
 However, I do think 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.940
 Falling water dog 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.000
 Tarantino can indeed reach a deeper goal. 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.100
 Toilet story series. 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.800
 All the work of Tarantino is commenting 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.740
 Tell the essence of the story itself, 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.520
 But Mr. Orange, 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.340
 Undercover police, 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.560
 Learn fake stories to sell criminals 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.000
 His credibility 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.080
 Is one of the best examples 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.060
 In all his movies. 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.900
 He divided the sequence into four parts: 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.620
 Mr. Orange studied the scene, 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.080
 Mr. Orange rehearsed the scene, 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.360
 Orange shows the story to the audience. 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.940
 Finally, the story "lives" over. 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.340
 This is an elegant illustration, how to speak 

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.400
 Can become a story, 

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.400
 And the story becomes a reality, 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.440
 Or enter the movie. 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.700
 This is a good touch, the only thing 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.020
 This makes the police not notice the drugs 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.220
 Is a similar storyline, 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.700
 Because the story also makes us unable to see the reality. 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.020
 "Badi, I want to shoot your face with a gun. 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.620
 If you don't put your hand on the fucking flush button! " 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.760
 As a genre and style exercise, 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.800
 The falling dog is great. 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.380
 One of the best in the movie, and 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.940
 If it lags behind 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.840
 The remarkable height that Tarantino later had to achieve, 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.440
 That is not criticism, because, 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.200
 I mean, let's see you reach your goal. 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.340
 “Just lacking transcendence” 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.000
 Your first movie. 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.280
 I think this is a good rule of thumb. 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.140
 How classic is the movie? 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.080
 Simply put, do we keep 

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.800
 Look at them. 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.740
 25 years have passed, I am still watching the dog, 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.180
 I bet it is still true 

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.080
 More than 25 years from now. 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.660
 Hey everyone, 

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.180
 Thank you very much for watching. 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.520
 This episode was brought to you by VRV. 

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.840
 VRV is a combined service 

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.160
 Lots of great content channels 

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.700
 Like Rooster Teeth, Mondo, 

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.140
 After testing, cartoon hangover, 

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.640
 Crunchyroll and Funimation, having them cool 

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.320
 Two in the same place, 

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.780
 You can download the VRV app 

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.580
 Xbox, Playstation, iOS or Android, 

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.460
 If you get a VRV package 

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.840
 At this link you can get a 7 day 

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.440
 Free trial. 

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.580
 Once you get that combination pack, 

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.280
 I suggest you take a look 

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.940
 The show is called March like a lion. 

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.560
 At Crunchyroll, this is a revelation 

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.620
 A 17-year-old Shogi player 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.140
 (Shogi is a Japanese foreign variant of chess) 

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.900
 Really nice, very beautiful, very melancholic, 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.500
 I think you will like it very much. 

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.800
 Adam Savage’s day is built on top of the test 

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.260
 It’s a great time. 

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.040
 All shows are HD and no ads. 

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.960
 I definitely recommend that you check out the VRV app. 

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.620
 I will see you next time.
