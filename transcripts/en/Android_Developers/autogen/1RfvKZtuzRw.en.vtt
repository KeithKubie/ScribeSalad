00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.491
 HiROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: My name is Yoshi. 

00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:04.610
 I am the Head of Business Development in Japan, 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.189
 I also lead Go Global. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.350
 We will talk today as we have already indicated 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.660
 Google Play is a great place to distribute apps 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.510
 Media, and you can then choose what you want, 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.650
 Such as deploying the app anywhere. 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.610
 But today I want to discuss a framework 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.450
 Go Global. 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.470
 This process looks more like designing a framework for this segment. 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.660
 I would then explain each section in detail, 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.580
 And what should be thought about to achieve a global start. 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 After explaining the Go Global framework, 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.000
 Today we will invite the amazing participants 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.670
 To ask some questions about their Go Global strategies. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.660
 Let us follow the explanation. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.370
 The first point is choosing the right market. 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.200
 It is the most important point in strategy. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.580
 The market here is stable 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.620
 Which we call mature market. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.380
 There are also emerging markets, 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.030
 Which we call an emerging market. 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 For example, a stable market 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 Are the markets of the United States, Korea and Taiwan. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.240
 They contain a lot of special elements. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.930
 But the value of the item increases per user. 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.370
 The rising market is an investment market 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.630
 And quiet, compared to the US and Japanese market, 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.340
 The size of the investment is not great. 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.160
 However, the user base will grow rapidly, 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.080
 But is now growing very rapidly. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.130
 Thus, we have divided the markets into two categories. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 Also, as you know, each market has a different face. 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.950
 For example, the US market has different marketing areas, 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.370
 Such as different preferences for users and the Japanese market. 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.190
 The Korean market also has its own marketing areas. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 Therefore, each market segment differs from the other. 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.010
 Also, the same applies to each country, 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.610
 There are different faces for each. 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.490
 So, let's get to know each country by market. 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.920
 For example, the Japanese market. 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
 This is the top ranking in the Japanese market, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.590
 It seems that all or most Japanese developers 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.450
 At the top of the arrangement, it's supposed to be here. 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.100
 It seems that the use of attractive symbols is common in the Japanese market, 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.690
 So you may need to use attractive characters or attractive characters 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.490
 In your applications which is a good thing to attract Japanese users. 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.810
 Then we move on to the Korean market. 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.660
 It seems that a lot of Western developers 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.240
 They have done well, they are at the top of the rankings. 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.780
 At the top of the ranking were some applications with attractive characters, 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.990
 And also some applications with serious characters. 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.500
 This is for the Korean market. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.120
 Let's move on to an emerging market. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 It is the Brazilian market. 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.880
 It seems that a lot of Western developers have done 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.230
 Well done in the Brazilian market, 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.060
 Applications such as Clash of Clans and Clash of Kings appear to be 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.500
 And Summoner's War has been successful in the market. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.550
 Therefore, these types of competition applications between player and player (PvP), 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.820
 Applications from the import market look similar. 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.540
 This is in relation to the Brazilian market. 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.370
 We then move on to the Indonesian market. 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.030
 It looks similar to the Brazilian market, 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.940
 But we can see more apps with attractive characters and attractive icons here. 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.470
 So we can say it is a mixed market. 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.900
 So we must understand these specific elements of each market 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.800
 Then decide which of those markets 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.269
 You should go to it. 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.400
 So that we can choose the right market. 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.270
 We then turn to planning the methodology. 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.260
 Having decided to move to a certain market such as the Japanese market 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.880
 Or Korean, you will need to know 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.770
 How to feed this market. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.560
 Can original titles and original drawings be retained? 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.570
 When you move to this market, you must change graphics 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.610
 When you move to this market? 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.980
 This is a decision that needs to be taken. 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.930
 This is the Asian model and Western model. 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.710
 The Asian model is more attractive and has a complex user interface, however 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.790
 More efficient and the display is in vertical mode. 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.780
 The Western model is more like the user interfaces 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.600
 The most simple and which are displayed horizontally. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.500
 This is for games. 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.550
 Also, multidimensional design is well-coordinated everywhere. 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.780
 You will need to customize your services locally, 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.730
 However, the design must be wiser, and you will not need to know much about it. 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.240
 Use the multidimensional design because it is more efficient. 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.090
 We then move on to the next point. 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.010
 Your apps should be localized and not translated. 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.380
 This is also a very important part. 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.260
 Therefore, we define the first, second or third level 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.140
 According to local naturalization processes. 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.320
 The first level is simple. 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.020
 Just go to the market. 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.080
 Select your app quickly 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.740
 To post it to these markets, then note how things go. 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.610
 The second level is more local. 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.690
 For example, you will need to change the descriptions 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.630
 To local languages, or change screen shots 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.610
 Or change the symbols in a manner commensurate with the market, 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.850
 Then, change the application texts to local languages. 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.070
 This is the second level. 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.280
 The third level is the shift to offering the product as an original product. 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.440
 This includes providing more relevant local content. 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.350
 For example, place the appropriate content locally in 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.460
 Your application, like Japanese characters 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.970
 Or one of the Korean events at this third level. 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.245
 So, you can get more users - so think about local users. 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.860
 This is level I, II and III. 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.900
 Thus, you can scale from Level 1 to Level 2 or Level 3, 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.220
 Or move to the third level directly from the beginning. 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.070
 However, we recommend that you review the locally adapted description 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.980
 Using verification by native speaker. 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.600
 Therefore, if the check is not performed by a native speaker, 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.700
 The product will look from the point of view of local users 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.620
 Like those pictures. 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.530
 The graphics are good. 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.230
 The sound is wonderful. 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.990
 Localized versions have a question mark. 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.940
 This is from the point of view of local users. 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.740
 Therefore, we recommend using native language verification on this side. 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.480
 Native speakers provide more graphics and sounds and localization version 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.130
 Cool. 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.690
 This is just a metaphor, but it illustrates the point of view of local users 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.130
 On the release without a check. 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.520
 These are my suggestions for the stores. 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.270
 You've distinguished between your store listing and in-app games. 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.280
 Here we mention Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Brazil, Indonesia. 

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.760
 We have recommended the languages ​​that we need 

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.080
 Localized for users. 

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.260
 This is my opinion, which is very clear as you can see, 

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.000
 But make sure you move to this market. 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.590
 After that, the product must be adapted locally - and this is Musixmatch's success story. 

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.740
 Developers have locally adapted the application. We have discussed a lot of elements about the Japanese market, 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.950
 They have changed their video ad sections, titles and icons 

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.630
 Description and main images on the screenshot. 

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.870
 They put local talent and content, 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.480
 Then they put the local languages ​​in the screenshot. 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.800
 Thus they obtained the number one ranking 

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.535
 In the music category in Japan of the total 50. 

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.460
 I also recommend not only localization, 

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.910
 But also recommended thinking about communication 

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.080
 In each market. 

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.620
 If you want to move to an emerging market, 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.840
 You'll need to know the speed of the connection as well. 

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.550
 For example, a smaller APK may be 

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.920
 More suitable for those emerging markets. 

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.050
 After downloading, consider the size of a file 

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.100
 Content, or the appropriate data type for the user 

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.860
 And also taking into account domestic prices. 

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.540
 As we mentioned earlier, 

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:48.150
 These are the types of KPIs you should know 

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.690
 If you want to move to the emerging market. 

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.950
 We turn to the support of local users. 

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.740
 This process is easier, but should support local users 

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.150
 In their local languages. 

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:06.420
 This is an important fact to move to the local market. 

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.190
 This is a Korean developer 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.520
 Responds to users in Japanese. 

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.210
 This is important if you want to launch internationally. 

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.390
 Product introduction, testing and replication. 

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:26.610
 We talk at this point about things like testing and testing A / B, 

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.070
 Channel acquisition and localization processes as well, 

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.720
 This process means keeping up the work, 

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.340
 Keep up and improve. 

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.050
 So, this episode is also important to launch internationally. 

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.160
 Here's a good example of apps. 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.990
 Experiments have been conducted on the Play Developer Console, 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.010
 The winning application code was the most simple symbol, 

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.460
 Where the download rate was 41% in Korea. 

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.630
 Also this screenshot of the game. 

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.900
 Earlier, developers tried different types of screenshots, 

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.830
 They got a good number of results and then improved. 

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:15.260
 Therefore, it is an A / B testing procedure and testing 

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.560
 Something important to check localization versions 

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.080
 Or adapting English screen shots according to the global launch project strategies. 

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.970
 This screenshot before and after the final improvements. 

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:34.840
 They put in the game all the numbers of well-improved results. 

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.545
 Then change the screen shot. 

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.630
 You can take advantage of local market experts. 

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.640
 We have many people in this place. 

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.860
 So, please communicate with these people to take advantage of them, 

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.525
 You can then ask me about your strategy elements. 

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.800
 So, we get to the end of the presentation. 

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.670
 thank you 

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.270
 [clap] 

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.620
