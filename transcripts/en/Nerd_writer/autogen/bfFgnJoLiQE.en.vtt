00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.030
Detective fiction always turns on its revelations, on those moments when information

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.050
suddenly transforms into cause and effect.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.883
No one is better at achieving those revelations than private detective Sherlock Holmes,

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.650
and these days no one is better at

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.410
visualizing them than the creators of

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:30.789
Sherlock, the intoxicatingly inventive TV show that uses and imagines film editing as a

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.480
function of its main characters mind.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200
"You said your life turned on one word."

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.140
"Yes, the name of the person my father wanted to kill."

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.100
Today I want to look at how Sherlock gets from point a to point B, from problem to solution,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.660
mystery to clarity, in one of the show's most

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.500
extraordinary visual revelations.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.829
It's a sequence that lasts three minutes and 42 seconds with a fresh weird idea in almost every beat.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.640
It's a complete joy to watch unfold.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.169
"You said your life turned on one word." " Yes,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.240
The name of the person my father wanted to kill."

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.480
The background is this: the daughter of famous multi-millionaire Culverton Smith

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.900
knows her father wants to kill someone, but doesn't know who it is

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.650
"I need to kill someone."

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.569
She was told the name once but under the influence of a drug that wiped her memory

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.960
all she knows is that it's one word.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.610
"That's the impossible thing, just that, right there."

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.369
What's impossible?

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.880
"Names aren't one word, there're always at least two."

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.180
The added element here, one that's going to spin this revelation into a whole other gear, is that Sherlock Holmes is

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.420
on drugs.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.920
He's been shooting cocaine, a reference to the original Conan Doyle stories, and it's accelerating and twisting his mind.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.829
In fact it's the pain of withdrawal from his drugs that puts the entire sequence in motion.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
"You're not how I expected you."

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.600
"What? What am I?"

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.780
"Nicer."

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.240
"And who?"

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100
"Anyone."

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.300
In a mystery, a revelation on the part of the detective or the audience only works when it arises from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.106
information already known.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:24.860
What's new is the perspective, and that change in perspective is triggered usually by something that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.059
doesn't mean to. I mean this kind of revelation is a cliche by now

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.680
But what sherlock does differently is stage those perspective shifts in its camerawork and editing in.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.060
The first sub sequence we see sherlock from every possible angle even from one that's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.819
Impossible, thanks to his drug-induced state,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.050
punctuated by subliminal negative shots of the confession paper that Faith was holding and a compliment

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.830
"You're not what I expected you. Nicer."

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.200
It's not just that Sherlock recontextualizes old informations.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.200
The filmmakers take great pains to choreograph a relationship between old and new perspectives that is

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.820
Conversational, like the present and the past are speaking to each other.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.160
In this part for example Sherlock stocks the location of an old episode, the previous one, but now

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.199
verything is changed: instead of seeing the street from a different angle we see it from a totally different

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480
camera lens adding to that sense of

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.420
attenuated drugged-up disorientation. And here the conversation with the past is even more literal

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.420
It's a present shot past

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.780
Reverse shot.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.920
"There's only one way that I can solve it."

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.319
You've already moved the camera

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.020
and you've already changed the lens, why not transplant an entire set from earlier in the episode.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.240
"I need to kill someone."

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.940
"Who?"

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.040
"Anyone."

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.709
"Anyone."

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.009
"Don't think anyone else is going to save him because there isn't anyone."

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.160
Even more impressive than how Sherlock arrives at his revelation is how the hero

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.040
untangles what that means.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.320
What can only be called a leapfrog scene transition,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.197
maybe my favorite of all time.

00:04:20.197 --> 00:04:22.540
Sherlock awakes from his reverie.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.389
It goes like this.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.140
Sherlock realizes where he is, in the middle of a busy street.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.219
A man yells at him.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.560
Reverse shot: Sherlock.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.000
Reverse shot: that man is now his drug-dealing friend on the street

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.660
Reverse shot Sherlock.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.820
Reverse shot: his drug-dealing friend is actually speaking to him from Baker Street.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.700
Reverse shot: Sherlock still outside

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.140
Reverse shot drug dealer telling him that he's actually at Baker Street too.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.800
Reverse shot: cue the best location transition ever.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.060
Now let's watch that in real time.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.110
"Even know where you are? You drunk!"

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.720
"What are you doing here?"

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.420
"What are you doing in the middle of a bloody street?"

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.820
"You should be at Baker Street."

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.440
"I am. So are you."

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.658
It's hard to imagine a scenario where more could be accomplished with ten shots

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.739
As Sherlock's mind catches up with itself and he grapples with the thought of just how many

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.650
serial killers might be hiding behind wealth and fame like

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.720
Culverton Smith.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.029
The revelation, the drugs and the sequence reach their crescendo with the set itself

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.819
Turning on its axis. It's important

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:48.869
I think to remember that what we've seen here has taken place in the span of only three minutes and 42 seconds

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.340
I mean there are full movies with fewer original ideas. There is no cGI in the sequence. No digital fireworks

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.359
this is just great filmmaking just the laws of editing embodied brilliantly as the workings of an

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.699
extraordinary mind

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.430

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.720

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.139

Lives up to the amount of people who are watching and I hope when you tell people about the show you say it's something

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.279
That you've never seen on Youtube or TV or anywhere

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.019
That's the vision I have in my head, and that's what I'm always thinking about when I'm making new episodes

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.989
