00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.410
Okay, I hope you're enjoying the case study so far. What

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.180
I'd like to do here, is set us up for the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.109
portion of the case study where you're going to be cleaning

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.920
your data. Now, before we dive into the code, what I'd

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.560
like to do is just remind you where the documentation is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.470
for the OpenStreetMap data set. The easiest place to find it

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.230
is through the wiki and I purposely kept this page a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.210
little small so positionally you'll remember where to find the documentation.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
So what we are looking for here is the OSM XML link. Okay, and I'll just make

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.550
the page big enough so you can actually read

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.965
the documentation. Now what I am interested in, you

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.595
see, is the way in which the XML file

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:43.740
was organized into nodes and ways. And also, relations.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.500
Now the thing to note here is that our

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.010
data, is setup so that nodes can be tagged.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.560
As can ways, alright? And the semantics of this type of structure here,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.180
is that these tags, because they're nested within this node Actually tag this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.720
particular node here and the same is true with way tags that we find.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.360
So here we're seeing tags that are actually describing this particular way

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.040
here. Okay? So it's actually pretty straight forward,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.020
but in terms of parsing it, we have to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.870
remember that in order to understand exactly what a

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.360
given tag, tag describes. Okay, so what I'd like

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.080
to do in this example, is talk a little

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520
bit about cleaning street names. Now back in Lesson

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.080
Three, we actually looked quickly at an example of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.840
auditing street names. We're going to take that example

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.440
a little bit further. And here we're actually going to apply it to ways. Now

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.660
ways in this data set are streets. They're

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.290
essentially paths through a city of one kind

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.630
or another. So avenues, squares, commons, other sorts of areas that are a way of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.240
getting from one place to another is essentially

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420
how way is defined in this data set.
