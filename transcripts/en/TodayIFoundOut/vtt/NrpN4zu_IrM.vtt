00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.510
For those not familiar with this now popular
funny meme, the basic idea is to substitute

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.250
X with any perceived extremely powerful entity
that it would be futile to resist.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.570
A somewhat recent example of this can be seen
when Ken Jennings, after losing to IBM’s

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.169
Watson on Jeopardy! in 2011, wrote underneath
his Final Jeopardy answer “I for one welcome

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.050
our new computer overlords.”

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.710
While you’ll often read that this was originally
a line spoken by actress Joan Collins in the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.680
1977 film Empire of the Ants, this isn’t
correct.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.150
Nowhere in this movie does any actor or actress
say that line.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.120
(As I was reading conflicting accounts of
this from reputable sources, I confirmed it

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.120
is not spoken in this movie by watching the
whole amazing awful, yet surprisingly unintentionally

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.120
humorous horror film where “A heavenly paradise
becomes a hellish nightmare when a toxic spill

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.410
turns harmless ants into gigantic rampaging
monster insects.”

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.410
)

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.920
The closest thing to this statement anyone
says in the film is after Joan Collin’s

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.880
character Marilyn Fryser (a scammer trying
to sell worthless swampland as beach front

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.420
property to prospective clients) enters into
an enclosed space with the queen ant.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.350
The queen then sprays her with a mind controlling
pheromones.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.190
When Fryser went into the chamber, she was
screaming and trying to escape.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.190
When she stepped out, she looks back at the
rest of her party, who are also seemingly

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.510
about to be put into the chamber, and says,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.260
Don’t you see, we mustn’t’ disobey them.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.960
We must take care of them and we must help
them.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.280
While the line “I for one welcome…”
was never spoken in the film, when the authors

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.160
of this line came up with it, they were alluding
to Empire of the Ants’ plot of giant ants

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.990
enslaving humanity to work in sugar factories.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.730
The first instance of this phrase can be found
in the 1994, season 5 episode of The Simpsons,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.170
Deep Space Homer.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.280
In this episode, Homer is selected by NASA
to be sent into space.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.310
While in the space shuttle floating around
trying to eat potato chips before they “clog

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.560
the instrument panels”, Homer smashes into
the ant colony on board, breaking the glass

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.380
and releasing all the ants.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.200
When one of the floating ants gets close to
the camera, it makes it look extremely large,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.270
prompting Simpsons’ anchorman Kent Brockman
to think it is a giant ant.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.670
He then states the following:

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.650
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we’ve just lost
the picture, but what we’ve seen speaks

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.650
for itself.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.199
The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been
taken over — ‘conquered’ if you will

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.920
— by a master race of giant space ants.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.409
It’s difficult to tell from this vantage
point whether they will consume the captive

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.999
Earth men or merely enslave them.

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.349
One thing is for certain: there is no stopping
them.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.700
The ants will soon be here.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.120
And I for one welcome our new insect overlords.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.209
I’d like to remind them that as a trusted
TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.530
up others to toil in their underground sugar
caves.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.650
In an interview, Ken Jennings stated about
the Super Computer Watson, “Watson has lots

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.150
in common with a top-ranked human Jeopardy!
player: It’s very smart, very fast, speaks

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.969
in an uneven monotone, and has never known
the touch 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:27.309
of a woman.”
