00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.458
Hello, and welcome to this new lessons. In this lesson you will learn how your

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:07.458
programs can make decisions. Let's look at an example. Here you have a typical

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:12.078
elevator panel, and yes elevators are controlled by computers these days. And

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:16.236
if you look at the buttons, you will notice that there are buttons for 10, 11,

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:23.080
12 and then goes on with 14. so, there's no button for 13. and that's of course

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.176
because, many people are superstitious and don't want to be in the 13th floor

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:32.910
of a building. Now, contrary to popular belief, the 13th floor is not filled

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.046
with secret government offices. There actually is a 13th floor, they just call

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:43.942
it the 14th. So, the software that controls the elevator car needs to adjust

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:50.155
for this human foible. Here's how you can do that in Java. Let's say floor is

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:55.132
the number as provided by the user, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 or whatever, and now

00:00:55.132 --> 00:01:01.740
we want to compute that actual floor. Then we need to make a decision. In Java

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.519
you use the if statement to make decisions, and you enclose the condition in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.508
parenthesis. Then you use a pair of braces, and inside you put the statement or

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:16.435
statements that you want to have executed when this condition is true. So, if

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:21.290
the floor is greater than 13, then we want it to adjust by subtracting 1. On

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.322
the other hand, if the condition is false, then we'll carry out the actions in

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:30.631
the else part of this statement. In which case, the actual floor number equals

00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:35.195
the floor number without any adjustment. And that's all there is to it. Let's

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:39.970
go over the important parts again. The keyword if starts out the conditional

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.305
statement. The condition goes in here, and is surrounded by parentheses. If the

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:50.608
condition is true, then the part following the if is executed. And if the

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:56.060
condition is false, then the part after the else clause is executed. Alright,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.669
now it's your turn. In some Asian countries, it's not the number 13 that brings

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:04.498
bad luck, but the number 14. And those elevators wouldn't have a number 14. And

00:02:04.498 --> 00:02:10.544
in fact, just to play it safe, some property owners eliminate both the 13 and

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:15.833
14. So, go ahead and modify the program in the next exercise so that it

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:21.793
translates the user selected number to the actual floor number. And know, there

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:26.050
are no hidden floors with secret government offices.
