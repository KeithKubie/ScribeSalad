00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.126
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:08.000
SPEAKER: I want to thank
everyone for coming.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.240
This is our last event here at
Cambridge for our Black History

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.560
Month programming.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.770
And today we have
Rep Byron Rushing.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.260
If you're not familiar
with him, in 1982,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.240
Rushing was elected
as a Representative

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.090
of the Massachusetts
House of Representatives.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.300
And he was the chief sponsor of
the law to end discrimination

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.180
on the basis of sexual
orientation in public schools

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.270
and an original sponsor of the
Gay Rights Bill Massachusetts.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.730
Rushing also led the
Massachusetts State Pension

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.330
Fund to large community
development investment

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.500
of poor communities
in Massachusetts.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.290
Rushing is an elected deputy
to the General Convention

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
of the Episcopal Church, a
founding member of Episcopal

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.390
Urban Caucus, and serves on the
board of the Episcopal Women's

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.750
Caucus and the Episcopal
network for Economic Justice.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.420
In addition to being
a local politician,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.274
he is also a
phenomenal historian.

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:01.190
And he's going to give
a little bit of context

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.384
on slavery as it pertains
to Massachusetts.

00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:08.300
And I find this to be
particularly interesting

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.610
because I know that it's common
context slavery as a Southern

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.330
phenomenon.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.300
And people don't really talk
about the occurrence of it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.520
in the North, particularly
in the New England area.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.516
So I'm sure this will be a great
little talk, so here he is.

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:26.408
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:30.710
BYRON RUSHING:
Thank you very much.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.680
It's really good to be
with you this afternoon.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.220
And I understand
I got squeezed in.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.530
This is February 28.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.320
But I do want to say--

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.010
you've probably
heard this already.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.000
But I want to just
reiterate it because we

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.280
have a lot of discussion, both
inside the white community as

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.040
well as the black community,
about Black History Month.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.860
And so I want to just say a
word about the origin of Black

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.850
History Month.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:11.000
Black History Month derives
from what was clearly an attempt

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.360
to strengthen the
teaching of black history

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.840
not in white schools,
but in black schools.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.720
Black History Month's
origin goes back

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.290
to the segregated South.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.810
It actually
originated a few years

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.790
after World War I, when
a group of black teachers

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.000
went to a group of black
historians, scholars,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.140
academics, and
asked them for help

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.615
in what they should teach about
black history in their schools.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.730
A favorite word, title, for
black people, of course,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.220
in those days was Negro.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.310
And what was invented
was Negro History Week.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.810
And Negro History
Week was to be a time

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.390
when the teachers,
who had been teaching

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.950
Black History and Black
Cultural Studies all year round,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.790
would have a time when their
students could show off,

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.700
when their students
could come and talk

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.540
about what they learned
and write poems and read

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.382
short stories and read short
papers that they had written,

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:23.840
whether they were in elementary
school, junior high school,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.070
or high school.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.480
And one of the
things, of course,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.260
that those teachers,
most of whom of course

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.510
were African-American,
one of those things

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.530
that was new in that
segregated system was they

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.110
could teach anything,
as long as they didn't

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.360
teach about ending segregation.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.660
Then they'd get fired.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420
But otherwise, white
people didn't care

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.850
what they taught black kids.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.170
And so they used that
opening, that opportunity,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.270
to talk about black
culture to black kids.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.410
But they felt not
unprepared to do that.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.060
And the person who came
up with this whole idea

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.540
and advancing this
curriculum was

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.090
a historian at Howard University
named Carter G. Woodson.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.300
And he came up with the idea
of doing Negro History Week,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.370
and he came up to the idea
of creating a magazine called

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.250
"The Negro History
Bulletin," which

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.620
was designed for
teachers to help

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.080
them build their curricula.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.410
He chose this week in February,
this Negro History Week

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.080
in February.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.040
I suspect that if most of the
black historians who took part

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.350
in this whole program to advance
the teaching of black history

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.000
in segregated schools, most
of which were in the South,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.590
if they had been
all Northerners,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.960
we probably wouldn't
have picked February.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.700
But they picked February.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.080
And they picked February
because in February

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.230
two dates that they considered
good dates to celebrate

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.330
occurred.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.220
One was February 12, and the
other one was February 14.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.170
Now, I don't know if
is anybody here-- no

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.700
you're too young to know,
to remember, probably

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.730
that we had two holidays in
February, one for Lincoln.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.170
That was February 12.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.260
And the other one was for George
Washington on February 22.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.780
And then they got merged
into Presidents' Day, which

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.530
is truly the second silliest
holiday on our calendar.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.030
First is Columbus Day.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.700
And then following Columbus
Day comes Presidents' Day.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.040
All of you could make
a list of presidents

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.230
you don't think we should
have ever mention again,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.900
let celebrate.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.760
But the other date
that was chosen,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.450
that that was important and was
close to the 12th was the 14th.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.720
And February 14, anybody?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.270
No, don't say Valentine's.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.500
February 14?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.410
February 14 was the birthday
of Frederick Douglass.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.410
And of course, Abraham
Lincoln and Frederick Douglass

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.460
were contemporaries but lived
very, very different lives.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.270
Though they did have
an interesting group

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.350
of similarities.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.940
But Frederick
Douglass, of course,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.600
had run away from slavery when
he was enslaved in Maryland.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.630
And like a number
of slaves, he had

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.770
no idea what day he was born.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.610
And so when he was
free, he realized

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.390
that people had birthdays
and he wanted a birthday.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.680
And he chose the day, just
like many African-Americans

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.930
who escaped from slavery.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.690
They chose a day,
for whatever reason,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.690
that they would now
consider their birthday.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.600
And they didn't know
their birthday because--

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.880
and this gets into
what I'll be speaking

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.100
about for the next few minutes--

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.120
because, as enslaved
people, there

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.760
were records kept about them.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.330
But the records that were
kept about enslaved people

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.920
were generally not in
any official registry

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.400
at a county or city hall.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.990
They were not even in most
birth registries and churches.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.580
Where their records were
not with other human beings.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.670
Their records were with animals.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:38.580
They were treated by most
plantation owners as animals.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:49.670
And so if you go to today
Thomas Jefferson's farm books,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.120
all of his records of
all of the farming that

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.360
was done at Monticello,
if you go there now,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.320
they are preserved, his
records of how many sheep

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.750
were born, how many
cows were born,

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.640
how many pigs were purchased.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.030
And in those records
you will find also

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:15.200
how many slaves were born and
the records of their purchase

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.200
or sale, their
death, all in those

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.400
records because, of
course, they were property.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.590
And I want to start there
with this discussion

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:35.100
about the ending of slavery
by talking about first what

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.230
was ended, what was abolished.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:47.950
We don't talk a lot about
slavery in this country.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:54.490
We talk about slavery usually
in discussions of its ending.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.370
There's not a lot of discussion
about its beginnings.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.510
There's not a lot of
discussion about it's middle.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.420
Slavery and the slave
trade in the Americas

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.950
existed longer than
emancipation and civil rights

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.390
for the descendants of
slaves has yet existed.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:19.780
If you use one of the shortest
periods of slavery, where

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.800
most of the slave
masters were British,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.160
if you're talking about
slavery in North America,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.530
slavery started about 1619.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.870
And it's the approximate date
of the introduction of slavery

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.220
into the colony of Virginia.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.560
The slavery then, if
you use as its ending

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.260
in what became
the United States,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.020
slavery existed until 1865.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.661
Many of us always when we
think about the end of slavery

00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:55.410
think about the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.790
The Emancipation
Proclamation, of course,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.330
was a war proclamation.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.900
And it did not free
all the slaves.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.250
It only freed certain slaves.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.510
And that was done in 1863.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:13.090
But slavery ended in the United
States for the whole country

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.940
legally by amending
the Constitution.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:21.670
And that was the passage of
the 13th Amendment in 1865.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.270
And so if you quickly do
those numbers, that arithmetic

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:36.070
between 1619 and 1865, you
get to 246 years of slavery.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:42.250
Add 246 to 1865 and
you get what year?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.070
2111.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:51.310
So it will not be until 2111
that people of African descent

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.640
will have been free
in the United States

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.500
as long as they
had been enslaved.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.240
This is a defining
cultural aspect--

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.670
political, economic,
and cultural aspect

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.250
of American history.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.770
You cannot discuss American
history accurately without

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:20.200
spending that proportion of
time and energy and words

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:31.090
and pictures on slavery as we
do on the years after slavery.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.510
This is important
because slavery has

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.690
become, in many ways, mythic.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.920
And if we are going to move
from the myth of slavery

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.610
as an incidental occurrence
that just happened--

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.370
there were a few
people who decided

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.850
they wanted to own
people, but generally it

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.990
is not what moved this country
to become this country.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.110
If we are going to move
from the myth of slavery

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.650
as an incidental occurrence
in the early days

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.230
of the European
occupation of the Americas

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.250
to the true accuracy
of slavery as part

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.330
of the truth of the origins of
the nations of the Americas,

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.050
and specifically of the
origins and economic success

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.430
of the United States, it
will require the production

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.050
of a new history.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.520
It will require the production
of a more accurate history.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.680
It will require the
production of a new paradigm

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.605
about the invention of America,
the invention of the United

00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:37.105
States.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.100
And I'm using paradigm here in
the sense of the stories which

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.390
we combine into a set
of experiences, beliefs,

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:56.320
and values that affect the
way we perceive ourselves,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.200
perceive our origin.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.300
So let me start with an
origin story about slavery

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.940
in Massachusetts.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.860
So listen carefully, because I
want to get these words right.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.380
So I'm going to quote the
first colonial governor,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.390
the leader of the Puritans who
invaded Massachusetts in 1630.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.980
I start with the Puritans
because for a whole variety

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:32.110
of reasons, I think we should
all ignore the pilgrims.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.350
I hope there's no one here
from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:42.940
The pilgrims, of course, were
a small group of Protestants,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.720
literally from one
congregation, that decided

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.770
to come to the Americas.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.810
And of course, as
many of you know,

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.280
they thought they were
going to northern Virginia.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.640
Most people think the captain
knew where he was going,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.270
just didn't tell the people,
pilgrims who were on the ship.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:07.180
And of course, the Mayflower
gets to the coast, ends up

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.512
in Provincetown.

00:14:08.512 --> 00:14:09.970
Those of you who
go to Provincetown

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.640
know there's a big
tower in Provincetown

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.870
that is commemorating the
first landing of the pilgrims.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.540
And before the
captain takes off they

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.580
realize they have
no fresh water.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.647
And they insist that
he take them someplace

00:14:23.647 --> 00:14:24.730
where there's fresh water.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.830
And the place that
he takes them is

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.180
what becomes-- which is the
place that they name Plymouth.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.950
And if it wasn't for
a number of reasons

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:41.230
why pilgrims became part of the
mythology of the whole United

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.070
States, which mostly happened
after the Civil War, none of us

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.460
would know about them,
or maybe just the people

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.170
who live in Plymouth.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.560
One ship-- they didn't fill
up the ship, "The Mayflower."

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.500
A few years later,
the Puritans invade.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.430
The Puritans are a
party, both a church

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.300
and political party in England.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.930
And they are attempting to
overthrow both the government

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.870
and reform the church.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.140
This group that
comes to the Americas

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.910
lands in several places.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.220
And the most northern
place that they land

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.080
is what is going to become the
colony of Massachusetts Bay.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:33.050
When they are here about
6 and 1/2 or 7 years,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:39.350
they come to a serious conflict
with the indigenous people who

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.190
are here.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.680
The English always
knew there were

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.530
going to be indigenous
people when they got here.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:49.490
The English, when
they came, assumed

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.980
that they could take
the land that was here.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.170
It never dawned on them that
they should send ambassadors

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.310
over to negotiate with
the people who were here.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.360
We can't imagine that.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.590
We smile.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.380
Every time I say that
to audiences, everyone,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.780
well, not everyone, but
many people just smile.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:17.390
The idea is just completely out
of our paradigm thing, the idea

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.200
that we would have
asked to be invited.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.170
And so the Puritans come.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:31.550
And within 6 and
1/2 years, they are

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.170
engaged in serious
violent conflict

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:42.200
with some of the Indian nations
that are in Massachusetts

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.270
and south of Massachusetts.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.050
And they have a major
conflict which historians have

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.390
come to call the Pequot War.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:54.470
John Winthrop in his
journal writes this,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.880
"we had now slain and
taken in all about 700.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.400
We sent 15 of the boys and two
women to Bermuda by Mr. Pierce.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.589
But he missing it, carried
them to Providence Isle."

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.700
What has happened is that
the decision after that

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.170
this conflict is over,
the English have won.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.609
The next decision
that has to be made

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.430
is what to do with all
of the Native Americans

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.040
that they have
captured, the POWs.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.592
And they decide to
sell them into slavery.

00:17:27.592 --> 00:17:30.050
They understand that it's going
to be too difficult to sell

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.300
them into slavery,
right, in a land

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.760
that they have lived
in for generations

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.030
and the Puritans have only
known for less than a decade.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.290
And so they decide to sell
them into slavery away.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.490
Bermuda is one place that
they think about sending them.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.130
They had already
sent other Indians

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.770
that they had
captured to Bermuda.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.320
But the captain,
for whatever reason,

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.590
decides to go to a
Puritan colony that

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.020
had been founded a few
years before Massachusetts

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.670
off the coast of
Central America which

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.830
they call Providence Isle.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.300
He goes there.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.730
And then in February--

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.930
interesting-- 26, 1638
we have this notation

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.970
in Winthrop's diary.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.820
"Mr. Pierce in the
Salem ship the Desire,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.530
returned from the West
Indies after seven months.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.080
He had been at
Providence, and brought

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.330
some cotton, and tobacco,
and Negroes, from thence."

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.420
This is the first
record, written record,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.380
that we have of Africans
arriving in Massachusetts.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.940
There is so much to say
about these two notations.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:46.940
I will only note that
in this whole story

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.430
I can tell you the
name of the ship.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.100
I can tell you the
name of the captain

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.630
of the ship, Mr. Pierce.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.190
I can tell you where they went.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.920
I can tell you the dates.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.350
The one thing I cannot
tell you are the number,

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.720
the actual number, and the
names of the Africans that were

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.220
brought back.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.234
When Pierce gets
to Providence Isle,

00:19:09.234 --> 00:19:11.150
he might have seen
Africans for the first time

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.710
in his whole life.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.200
The Puritans on Providence
Isle had already

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.540
begun to engage in the
African slave trade.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:24.620
He sells the Indians and buys
Africans and brings them back

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.510
to Massachusetts.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.990
We assume all
entered into slavery.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.390
And these first slaves
in Massachusetts

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.180
were owned by the colony.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:45.250
The founders of what the
United States is today

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.260
are all in the story.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:54.020
This is an example of an
alternative founding story.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.280
It is a founding story
that you could probably

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.280
find other examples in
in almost every colony,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.130
be them French,
Spanish, Portuguese,

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.390
or as these North
America, British.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.550
The founders of
whom we are today

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:18.140
as a nation, the aboriginal,
the native people, the English,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.380
the Europeans, and
the Africans, what

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.760
in our language, in
our almost slang,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.320
came to be known as the red,
the white, and the black.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.230
And they all-- if we are to
have an accurate history,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.410
they all must be in
this new paradigm

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.440
if it is to approach the truth.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.370
Now, this new
paradigm is not going

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:56.496
to undo big chunks of the sacred
scripture of the old paradigm.

00:20:56.496 --> 00:20:58.120
So "we the people of
the United States,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.230
in order to form a more
perfect union" can stay.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.170
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident,"

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.780
that all can stay.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.390
Those were quite
remarkable statements.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.540
No one denies that.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.310
There's is a great book on the
history of 18th century slavery

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.820
called "Bury the Chains,"
in which the author says

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.110
that "at the end of the
18th century, well over 3/4

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:32.530
of all people alive in the world
were in bondage or were masters

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.600
of people who were in bondage."

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:42.010
So the basic idea of freedom
being innate to people

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.570
was an incredible, radical idea.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.890
But as Frederick Douglass
would say a few years later

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.770
when he was asked to comment
on the celebration of the 4th

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:01.420
of July in the United
States in a speech in 1852,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.140
"pride and patriotism,
not less than gratitude,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.660
prompt you to celebrate
and to hold it

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.640
in perpetual remembrance.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.390
I have said that the
Declaration of Independence

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.020
is the ring bolt to the chain
of your nation's destiny.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.050
So indeed I regard it.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.850
The principles contained
in that instrument

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.530
are saving principles.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.360
Stand by those principles.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.540
Be true to them on all
occasions, in all places,

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.200
against all foes,
at whatever cost."

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:39.460
And all of the minority groups
that have felt themselves

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.530
oppressed in the United
States have always turned back

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.730
on the majority group
their scripture,

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.330
their Declaration of
Independence, their United

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.760
States Constitution.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.520
But if we do not
include the other people

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.680
as people, not as
property, not as inferior,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.000
but people who
are innately free,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.840
then we look at the founders
in a very different way.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.310
Native Americans,
they were here.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:25.920
They were here and, of
course, as you know, here

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.710
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:37.410
But Europeans had developed a
politics and a theology that

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:42.960
allowed them to believe
that in their superiority

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.910
they could go anywhere in the
world that was not Christian

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.170
and claim it for themselves.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.380
If you had asked
these people why

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.000
did they think
they could do this,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.600
if you had asked Winthrop why
he thought he could do this,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.070
if you had asked the French and
the Spanish and Portuguese who

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.400
preceded him, why do you
think they could do this,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.550
they would not say
because they are white.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.800
They wouldn't say because
they are European.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.010
They hadn't gotten
that concept yet.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.430
They would have said
because we are Christian.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:23.010
And so when Europeans got
into a conflict over who

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:29.570
could take which land from what
they described as infidels,

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:35.480
they didn't go to their king
to ask him to resolve this.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.760
They had no law that they could
go to to have it resolved.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.570
Where did they go?

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.450
They went to the pope.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.640
They went to the pope
because the pope was

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.490
head of Western Christianity.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.100
And that was who would
make the decision

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.310
about dividing the world in
half between the Portuguese

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.335
and the Spaniards.

00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:05.700
Native Americans have
their land stolen.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.110
Sometimes that land was
stolen with warfare.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.610
Sometimes that war
was stolen by deceit.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.530
But essentially it was stolen.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:23.250
And when you steal
land, you want

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:29.340
to make sure that the owner
of the land that was stolen

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:36.300
has no place in the
legal or political system

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.410
where they can protest,
even at a later date.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.959
And so the only
good Indian is a?

00:25:44.959 --> 00:25:46.500
How many people know
the end of that?

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.870
Raise your hand.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.330
Where did you learn it?

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.240
It wasn't in your textbooks.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.680
Where did you learn it?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.600
It's part of the paradigm--

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.230
part of the paradigm,
part of the culture.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.452
And having stolen the land,
and of course, by the time

00:26:07.452 --> 00:26:09.410
the British were there,
it was a regular thing.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.930
There was nothing
they had to think up.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:16.670
Having stolen the land, a
remarkable thing occurs.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:21.440
And that in order to
exploit all of this land,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.490
these people from these
tiny little countries,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.190
principalities,
kingdoms in Europe,

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:35.130
struck by the amazing amount
of what was there cannot figure

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.420
out a way to exploit it to its
fullest with only Christian

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.580
labor, with only white labor.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.880
And so they steal people.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.010
They steal labor.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.070
They steal Africans.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.550
And that, of course,
is the origin

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.570
of the slave trade
in the Americas.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.290
So we don't have a
lot in this room.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.790
But probably watching we have
more people of African descent.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.270
I can tell you one thing
about your ancestors,

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.210
if your ancestors
came to the Americas.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:19.100
You belong to the only group
of people in the Americas

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.420
whose ancestors came
here fully employed.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.083
Slavery-- about labor for free.

00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:30.200
Now, how do you
break out of this?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.950
You break out of this
by first, I think,

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.730
probably even before you
do the theology, probably

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.260
by the logic.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.320
I think people who
first started to argue,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.500
white people who started
to argue against slavery

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.350
argued because of the logic.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:55.720
If you bought into the idea that
all people were free and then

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.530
immediately caught yourself and
realized you weren't talking

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:03.850
about all people, at what
point does logic hit you

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.630
over the head and say,
how can I not include

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.450
so-and-so, that group, those
people, that sex, women?

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.140
How can I not include
them in the all?

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.140
Unfortunately it was
not the majority view.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.880
But almost from
the beginning there

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.710
was protest to the idea
of enslaving people.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.380
And there was protest to the
idea of not including everybody

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.370
in the "all."

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:39.340
For the slaves in
Massachusetts, they of course

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.670
had no question
about the answer.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.830
They had no question
about the answer,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.320
but they had no power
to work it through.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.620
And so they, from
the very beginning,

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.610
began making alliances
with those Europeans,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.720
those Americans, those
white Americans who

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:03.430
felt that way, even though
they were in a minority.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:12.070
In Massachusetts, that
logical position fortunately

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.970
got to the level of our
state Supreme Court.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:21.880
And so three years after
the state of Massachusetts

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.160
adopted its state constitution,
which incorporated many

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.280
of the words of the
Declaration of Independence,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.590
had what it called itself
a declaration of rights,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:41.500
that constitution was being
interpreted by a brand newly

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.590
created supreme judicial court.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.060
And several of the cases
around ownership of slaves

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.650
came to that court.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.310
And eventually the court
decided that one judge

00:29:54.310 --> 00:30:00.580
could decide them, their Chief
Justice, Justice Cushing.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.110
And he writes an opinion that
under the state constitution,

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.810
obviously not the United
States Constitution,

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.360
but under the
Massachusetts Constitution,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.490
no one could be enslaved.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:17.320
It happened early in the 1780s.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.370
By 1790, when the first United
States census was taken,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.480
the only state in
Massachusetts of the 13

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.490
that recorded no slaves in
the census was Massachusetts.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:35.150
Only Massachusetts in
1790 enumerated no slaves.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:39.970
And of course, one of the
reasons for the census

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.620
was to determine
representation in Congress.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:49.420
And the Southern states, in
forming the Constitution,

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.090
had insisted that
they be able to count

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:57.880
the slaves toward the formula
for that representation.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.470
And the compromise was that they
could come up with a fiction

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.300
that for every slave they
had, who they did not

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.880
believe was human,
who could not vote,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.250
would be recorded
as 3/5 of a person.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.500
And so we had to know how
many slaves there were.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.130
And Massachusetts
comes out of this

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:26.110
in 1790 with its clear mark
that slavery is ended here.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.590
I have no doubt that there were
a few that were still enslaved.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.600
But when the census
taker came by,

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.790
they knew enough to say, oh,
no, Mabel's my servant, right?

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.724
But they did not get recorded.

00:31:41.724 --> 00:31:43.390
I hope there's no one
here from Vermont.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.217
Anyone from Vermont?

00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:47.800
Because all the Vermont people
always tell me they were first.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.090
Except they weren't a state.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.750
They thought they would
try to be a republic first.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.860
And when there were
republic, that is true.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.650
Vermont's constitution
as the republic

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.420
said that they would
have no slaves.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:04.420
They didn't come into the Union
until 1791 as the 14th state.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:10.420
This feeling of anti-slavery
grows in Massachusetts.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.570
But it has one huge
contradiction-- a lot

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.080
of little contradictions,
one huge contradiction.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:22.720
And that contradiction are the
people who dealt in the trade.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:31.510
And Massachusetts ports were
just ideal for harboring

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.040
and sending out slave ships.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:40.220
And so many capitalists
in Massachusetts

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:46.220
insisted on, although they
would have no slaves themselves

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.540
in Massachusetts,
in trading slaves.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:55.100
And the trade for
slaves went on until--

00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:01.310
legal trade for slaves
went on until 1808.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.960
The Constitution, in the
United States Constitution,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.470
slave trading was
given a 20-year break.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.180
So right in the
Constitution in says

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:19.980
that 20 years after the
ratification of this document,

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.810
then Congress
could begin to pass

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.140
laws ending the slave trade.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.770
That was done because
of the huge number

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.820
of slaves who ran away during
the American Revolution.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:38.900
There is one
historian who argues

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:45.080
that it was the largest slave
rebellion in United States

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.834
American history was
the American Revolution.

00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:50.750
Not only could they run
away, and most of them

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.420
got their freedom
by running away--

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.470
white people were
fighting white people.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.680
What a better time
to leave, right?

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.440
But they also negotiated.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.180
And they negotiated with both
the British and the Patriots

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:10.790
to fight and to help
them in their war effort.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.380
And as a reward be
given emancipation,

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.989
be manumitted if they survived.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.280
And many of them did--

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.610
approximately half with the
British and the other half

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.710
with the Patriots.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.530
And the British kept their
word for most of them,

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:31.070
and most of them who
were freed went to Canada

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:37.250
with a lot of Tory Americans
who went there also

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.070
after the American Revolution.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:48.530
Into the 1900s, emancipation
grows throughout the country,

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.960
throughout the northern
part of the country.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.320
And the issue becomes whether
we can survive as a state,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.770
as a country that is
divided between free states

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.870
and non-free states, if we
can survive as a country.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:12.260
And in that way, the first
set of political struggle

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.960
is over what to do with
all the new states.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.590
What to do with all the Western
lands that are becoming states.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.250
All the Western lands that have
been stolen from the Indians,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:31.430
should those lands be free or
slave in this growing country?

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:36.020
That is the argument that the
Lincoln-Douglas debates was all

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.530
about--

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.570
expansion of slavery.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:44.150
And finally, it comes to
a head in the Civil War.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:52.220
When the Civil War is
over, when the Africans

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:59.630
believe that they will be free.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.140
And many of them are free.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.830
Most of them for
moments are free.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.480
And as they struggle
to get the experience,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.530
as they struggle to get the
skills to live as free men

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:26.720
and women, the major population
in the South decide that they

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.040
cannot tolerate it.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:35.410
And so we have a period, a kind
of creative political hiatus,

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:39.060
which we call
Reconstruction, and then

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.210
white people in the
North and the South, who

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:46.320
have been killing each other,
at the end of that generation

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.910
decide that they want to unite.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:57.630
They want to reunite, and as
a condition of that reuniting,

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:02.250
the Southern white people argue
that they must have control

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.425
of the Africans in their midst.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.510
It is a difficult history.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:18.620
It is a history that
informs how we operate

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:24.980
as residents, members,
citizens of the United States

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.450
to this moment.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:35.210
There probably are no
major political arguments

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:42.710
in this country that do not
have strong, accurate analogies

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:48.740
in the history of Africans in
this geography and the history

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.450
of Native Americans.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:56.060
Except it is not approached.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.140
It is not directly taught.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.870
It is not directly thought
about as we go forward.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.070
The problem of
history, of course,

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.820
is that it can be like memory.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:18.490
And like memory, if you lose
it, you get disoriented.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.850
If you lose your
memory, you actually

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.670
do not know where you are.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:29.500
And this disorientation
makes it difficult to make

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:38.100
decisions about the future,
similarly in history.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:46.710
If we have a history that is
allowed to contain the gaps,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.250
that our history is
allowed to contain,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:56.480
that the decisions that we
make as citizens, as a people,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.950
are decisions made
from disorientation,

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:05.310
they're decisions
made from untruths.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:10.400
And so the task for
black history, of course,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.060
is not simply the
study of black history.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:20.360
The task of black history is
not to set aside a few days

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.580
or a month to think about it.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:28.220
The task of black history
is to drive the argument

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.720
that history has to be honest.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:39.610
And that when truth is
the criteria for history,

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.680
no one will have
to have a month.

00:39:45.152 --> 00:39:47.136
Thank you.

00:39:47.136 --> 00:39:51.929
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:51.929 --> 00:39:53.970
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about how many slaves there

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.620
were in Massachusetts when the
supreme judicial court gave

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.670
that ruling.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.617
BYRON RUSHING: Just under 5,000.

00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:02.700
AUDIENCE: Out of how many?

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.750
So what proportion?

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.780
That's larger than I
would have thought.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.160
BYRON RUSHING: That
would have been about 3%.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.930
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.399
BYRON RUSHING: Yeah.

00:40:13.399 --> 00:40:15.190
AUDIENCE: This kind of
a follow up to that.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.660
I sort of had this
idea in my head

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.101
that one of the reasons
why slavery was abolished

00:40:21.101 --> 00:40:22.600
so early in the
North was because it

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.320
wasn't as fundamental to the
economy as it was in the South.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.367
Is this an accurate
idea, or do you

00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:29.950
think things would
have been different

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:32.199
if there were a lot more
plantations in Massachusetts?

00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:34.240
Or am I thinking
about this wrong?

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.920
BYRON RUSHING: No, that's
a very good question.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:47.260
And I think that what slavery
in large numbers means

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:53.530
is that the whole society has
to adjust to having slaves.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.690
And some historians have
actually described--

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:01.300
they separate what they call
slave societies, like the South

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.930
before the Civil War,
all of the West Indies.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.640
That there was just
nothing that could

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.520
happen that could be
done without taking

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.610
into consideration
its effect on slavery

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.570
or slavery's effect on it.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.440
But that you could still have
the idea of owning people.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.240
It was just incidental.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.820
And so in Massachusetts, and
I think most of the North,

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.170
it was incidental.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.980
What is interesting
about Massachusetts

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.060
is even though it was an
incidental-- certainly helps

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.680
the argument about freeing.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.480
But then when you look at
all the other Northern states

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.450
at the time of the
Civil War, slavery

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.220
was still legal in half
of the Northern states.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:56.790
So people found an economic
advantage in owning people,

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.290
right?

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.700
And there were enough people
taking that economic advantage

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:06.550
and owning people who did not
find a political or economic

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:10.250
contradiction in doing that.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:17.800
And even in Massachusetts
probably the most--

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:23.270
but it is true that the
more economic advantage

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:28.000
there is for slavery, the harder
it is to build up the argument.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.010
And most slaves in Massachusetts
of that population by then

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.500
worked in houses.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.930
They worked as
servants and houses,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.180
or they worked in
small businesses.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.770
They worked in taverns.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:54.700
And our only large
agricultural use of slavery

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.890
was in the Connecticut
River Valley

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:01.442
when we grew tobacco
in Massachusetts.

00:43:01.442 --> 00:43:03.150
AUDIENCE: Do you think
the textbooks that

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.040
are used in
Massachusetts schools

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.290
accurately represent
true history?

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:12.120
And if they don't, why
do you think that is?

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.350
BYRON RUSHING: I think
the major reason why

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.260
we don't have that
accurate history

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.780
is because I think most of
us don't want to have it.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.330
See, I think most
of us are-- and it's

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.890
not like an active
thing that we do.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:32.280
But we think that the
founding stories that we know

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.650
make sense, that they
answer all the questions.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.920
So you have to make a
judgment call about--

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.030
you can make a philosophical
judgment call about accuracy.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.530
But you also have
to make a judgment

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:49.740
call of the connections--

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.040
of making sure you
see the connections.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.630
So I suspect that the average
person in Massachusetts

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.780
doesn't really care
that they've never met

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.910
an Indian from Massachusetts.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.440
They don't care.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.870
It's not like, oh, I've
never met an Indian.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.090
I wonder why.

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:13.630
So the most most of us know
about Native Americans,

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.750
the average person in
Massachusetts, is we

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:19.184
know all these places are named
after it, right, including

00:44:19.184 --> 00:44:20.100
the name of the state.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.500
We know that.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.290
If someone asked you,
you would say, oh, yeah,

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:35.420
that's an Indian word, right/
so it is a kind of intentional

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.780
judgment call that
we need to make.

00:44:41.541 --> 00:44:42.082
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:42.082 --> 00:44:44.200
I wondering if you can
compare or contrast

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.810
the form that white
supremacy took

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.910
before the Civil
War with the form

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.410
that it took after
Reconstruction

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.380
and the segregation era
and maybe even a connection

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.770
to the Christian imperialism
you were talking about earlier.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.650
BYRON RUSHING: Right.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:07.750
I think while there's slavery,
certainly the people who

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.030
support that economy--

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.580
and the people who support
an economy of slavery

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.580
are not only the
slave masters, right?

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:20.680
So a slave economy has a lot of
people working for it, right--

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:26.470
free labor that
is not immediately

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.740
engaged in owning
slaves, because someone

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.990
has to supply all the other
stuff for the plantations.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:39.760
But if in that group--

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:45.340
so the argument comes
up about the inferiority

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.030
of black people.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.730
White people can quickly
join in supporting that idea.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.670
It makes all the
rest of it easier.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.640
So what happens when
you end that slavery?

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.670
And there are two
things I think happen

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.110
when you end that slavery.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:06.790
One is you try to make
it as easy as possible,

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.550
and that did not happen
in ending slavery

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.320
in the United States.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.840
It was not easy.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.660
All the slave masters lost their
slave property-- all of them.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.020
And they got no
compensation for that.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.710
Even when the British abolished
slavery in the West Indies,

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.640
although the slave
masters complained,

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.270
that they didn't get enough
money, they were given money.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:39.550
They were given some money for
the slaves that were now free.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:44.590
And so you try to figure out how
you're going to make up that,

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:49.060
and so you shift the
nature of that prejudice

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.420
to keep black
people in a position

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.630
where you can still
exploit them economically.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.060
And that, of course, happened
not only in the South,

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.980
but happened in the North.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:05.140
But it took its most egregious
forms in the Southern states

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:11.260
by creating racial
segregation and insisting,

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:16.300
actually, on separation
that you didn't even

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.700
worry about with slaves.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.790
So slaves were intimately--

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:25.630
and I use that word intimately--

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.530
involved with white
people in a way

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:34.750
that was illegal after
the slavery ended.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:40.690
And so I think that
once the decision

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.960
is made that you are
not going to treat

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:49.180
people as free and equal,
or as you would say--

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.220
not you would say--
as one would say,

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.140
one white person
would say, you're not

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.490
going to treat people as white.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:03.550
Then that prejudice shifts but
is there for the same reason--

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.920
to maintain that society where
oppression of another group

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.710
is legal.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:12.750
I don't know if--

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:16.225
there used to be a phrase that
you don't hear much anymore.

00:48:16.225 --> 00:48:21.490
It came from a
1940s movie, where

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:25.000
a young woman is complaining
about the way she's treated.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.600
And her retort is, you
can't do that to me.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.590
I'm free, white, and 21.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.420
So two of those--

00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.800
two of those-- were
directly related to race.

00:48:41.204 --> 00:48:43.620
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
thank you very much for coming.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.070
This has been a very
interesting talk.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.650
One of the things I found
interesting that you mentioned

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.600
was how there's a
lot of parallels

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.530
between political issues
that happened 150 years ago

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.570
and things that happen today.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.844
And I was wondering if you
could expand a little bit on one

00:48:59.844 --> 00:49:01.010
of the things you mentioned.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.590
You mentioned how
slavery in Massachusetts

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.870
was basically abolished by
a single judge's decision.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:13.050
That, to me, sounds
like a very small thing.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.450
And I'm sort of wondering
how did something like that

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.610
actually get
implemented in practice.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.010
Because it seems
like today in 2017,

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:24.000
we also have situations where
judges' decisions are wide

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.551
reaching, and maybe it's not
so clear how they're actually

00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:29.050
implemented.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:32.450
So I was wondering if you could
talk about the process of how

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:37.680
we went from one judge's
decision to slavery actually

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.389
pretty much gone.

00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:40.305
BYRON RUSHING: You need
to become a historian.

00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:42.890
And you could go try to do some
more work on this because it's

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:45.480
a question that
keeps getting asked.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.500
And most of us guess,
see, that there just

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.100
was a kind of
anti-slavery feeling

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.140
that hadn't been articulated.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.590
You This was before
William Lloyd Garrison.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.630
So people weren't writing
about it and stuff.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:04.140
But there was just
a general idea

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.910
that we should get rid of this.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:09.690
So when it happens, one of the
things that could have happened

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:14.310
is that the owner of the
slave in the dispute that

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.110
got to the Supreme
Judicial Court

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.120
could have appealed
to the whole court.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.930
And he never does.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:26.970
So even he, right, decides
it's not worth it, right?

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:32.210
And so that feeling
was just there.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.590
Now, if you tried to
make a parallel to that

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:39.390
to the "Goodman" case a
few years ago on same sex

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:43.110
marriage in
Massachusetts, I think

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:48.480
the thing, of course,
that goes together here

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:53.790
is, of course, that we developed
a court that Massachusetts

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:58.710
citizens, to use a
conservative term,

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.320
were comfortable with
an activist court.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.400
They would fight it
every once in a while.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.980
But they were
comfortable that that's

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.560
an OK thing for judges
to say, that they

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.440
could dig into the
Constitution and come up

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.300
with this idea that's
not written directly

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.470
into the Constitution and make
it the law of the Commonwealth.

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:17.970
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm just sort
of thinking of the logistics

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:18.470
here.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.140
I mean, 5,000 people is
still 5,000 different cases

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.070
where you basically are turning
someone's life upside down.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.340
And maybe that it's the will
of 90% of the population

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.360
of Massachusetts.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.070
But it seems amazing
to me that even in 1790

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.620
that we could actually
have agreed enough

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.430
that we were able to, in
a short period of time,

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:43.555
actually cause all of those
sleeves to become free.

00:51:43.555 --> 00:51:44.429
BYRON RUSHING: Right.

00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:45.850
And so we assume that--

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:48.450
and we know this
in a lot of cases,

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:50.850
not all of them,
because, again, there's

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:53.760
lots of gaps in that
history, is that, of course,

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:59.340
the Africans, right, hearing
about this, of course, leave.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.217
So they say, I think
I need a salary.

00:52:03.217 --> 00:52:04.800
I think this means
I can get a salary.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.970
You have to pay me.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.930
And the master says, no.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.910
And he looks up the next day.

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:12.570
He's gone.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:13.980
The slave's gone.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.440
And there's no one.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.300
He can't get the sheriff
to go after him, right?

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.790
So I think that there was enough
activism among the Africans,

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.820
and then there was this
broader-than-we-thought

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:35.140
abolitionist feeling in
the general population.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.140
AUDIENCE: I'd like to
echo his thanks for coming

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:38.098
to speak with us today.

00:52:38.098 --> 00:52:39.154
I've really enjoyed it.

00:52:39.154 --> 00:52:41.070
I was wondering if we
could hear your thoughts

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:43.290
about the splitting
of Massachusetts

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.980
in what is now Maine in
the Missouri Compromise.

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.390
BYRON RUSHING: Well, I
think Massachusetts is--

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:52.680
well, so in the
Missouri Compromise,

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:59.640
of course, we decided
that the only way

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:05.820
we could keep the expansion
of the United States

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.420
from becoming the kind
of violent conflict

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.130
that eventually,
of course, it did

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:14.310
was that we would just
make sure that we always

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:19.580
had every time you invited a
free state, that you invited

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.970
a slave state.

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:25.330
And at that time there
was a movement in Maine

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.200
that they wanted to be
independent of Massachusetts

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:37.080
because they felt that the
people in Massachusetts

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.920
were simply using
Maine to make money.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.380
And we did.

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.790
If you go through the budget
of the state of Massachusetts

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:54.870
before, what year was
that, 1821, '25, right?

00:53:54.870 --> 00:54:01.290
We sold off huge amounts
of forest in Maine

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:05.470
and used that to support
the income of Massachusetts.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.960
So there were a lot of
people up there that

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.200
were looking for something.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.090
And this sort of
fell into their lap.

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:13.798
I don't know if they
could have done this

00:54:13.798 --> 00:54:21.180
without being able to tie it
with this national concern

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.024
and then getting the support
of Congress to do that,

00:54:24.024 --> 00:54:26.190
although there was still
opposition in Massachusetts

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.690
to it.

00:54:29.502 --> 00:54:31.210
AUDIENCE: Hi Thanks
again for being here.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:34.390
You referenced how in 1790
we were the first of the 13

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.880
to have no slaves
registered on the census.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.680
And I think
Massachusetts has long

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.304
been a very proud politically
blue state and thinks

00:54:42.304 --> 00:54:44.470
of ourselves as progressive
on many of these issues.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.560
But since 1790, there have
been a number of incidents--

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.210
I think about
things like busing--

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.420
that have not necessarily
reflected that reputation.

00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.430
And I think about
how often there

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.582
might be star athletes a Boston
team is trying to recruit.

00:54:57.582 --> 00:54:59.040
And you see that
they get counseled

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.829
that Boston won't necessarily
be a welcoming place for them.

00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:03.370
So I'm wondering if
you could comment

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:06.970
on the trajectory since 1790
and where we stand today

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:11.360
and perhaps what we can do
about that seeming reputation?

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.950
BYRON RUSHING: So I think that
if you look at that trajectory,

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:22.500
as you say, generally
it works out.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:28.300
And generally, I think
Massachusetts citizens

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:33.580
have a kind of optimism
about huge controversies.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.610
And I think it goes
all the way back.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:42.730
So of course, before there
was the big 19th century

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:46.600
controversy in Massachusetts,
a human rights controversy

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.450
in Massachusetts was
not around Africans.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.640
It was, of course,
around foreigners.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.280
And it was around Roman
Catholic foreigners,

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.740
and it's specifically
Irish foreigners.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.300
And so lots of the--
and very quickly,

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.910
many of the ideas
that people thought

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:08.290
they had settled
around civil rights

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:11.710
were challenged in
very negative ways

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:16.990
by the treatment of Roman
Catholics, and to the degree

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:21.370
that even for a few
years in Massachusetts

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:25.720
political history, an
anti-immigrant party

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.220
was able to gain control
of both houses of our state

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.400
legislature, the party that
became known as the Know

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.950
Nothings.

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.680
But it all got worked through.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.930
And that at some
point, we always

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:49.390
found compromises to make,
or the oppressed minority

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:50.787
group got bigger, right?

00:56:54.154 --> 00:56:56.320
AUDIENCE: Again, thank you
very much for coming here

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.510
to speak to us today
and also thank you

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:03.310
for your support on the Trans
Public Accommodations law.

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.390
So actually my
question is about--

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:09.400
so the 13th Amendment
accepts labor

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.870
as punishment for a crime.

00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:13.510
So I'm curious your
thoughts on prison labor.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.980
BYRON RUSHING: Well, let me
say about the 13th Amendment,

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.550
there's a movie
out, a documentary.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.490
Government Have you seen it?

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:23.690
AUDIENCE: I've been meaning to.

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.900
BYRON RUSHING: So it's
called "13" because--

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:31.090
and it's interesting
that for a lot of people

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.070
it seems like a
reasonable statement.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.380
And other people
argue, historians

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:39.160
argue that it was actually
a compromise even then

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.840
on emancipation.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.300
And that was that
the last sentence

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.590
of the 13th Amendment--

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.050
I don't have it memorized--
speaks to the fact

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.410
that this does not affect
people who are in prison.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:54.820
So the prisoners can't
argue, I can't be imprisoned

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.830
because you freed the slaves.

00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:02.890
And that sentence is in the 13th
Amendment of the Constitution.

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:07.090
So whether it was thought
about at that moment,

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:12.550
it quickly became a vehicle
for especially Southerners,

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:19.600
but other Americans,
to engage in control

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:24.740
of people of African
descent by criminalizing

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:32.950
a number of deeds, a
number of misdemeanors

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:37.350
essentially, or
creating all new crimes,

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.760
where you could quickly
arrest people and then

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.740
keep them in jail in
incredibly unjust ways.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.740
AUDIENCE: And that's still
going on to this day.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.810
BYRON RUSHING: Right.

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:52.930
And so where does that
place any kind of labor

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.510
that we ask prisoners--

00:58:55.510 --> 00:59:00.410
should prisoners get paid,
see, at the minimum wage

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:03.670
when they make license plates?

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.050
or furniture, which is done
a lot more in Massachusetts

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:10.120
than anything else
probably in our prisons?

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:14.980
And that raises an
excellent question

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.100
about the interpretation
of freedom,

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.955
and then where do you go forward
on that in terms of a reform?

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:28.020
AUDIENCE: So some of
the things you said--

00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:30.220
the background is I grew
up in Massachusetts.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.214
And so I had history
lessons here.

00:59:32.214 --> 00:59:34.630
And it was interesting to
notice which parts of the things

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:36.880
had said were very
familiar to me,

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.970
like talking about the
Missouri Compromise and things

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:40.700
like that.

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.090
But at other hand, the context
definitely wasn't there.

00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.770
For example, you
described the Puritans

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.085
as invading, which
completely fits

00:59:47.085 --> 00:59:49.210
with what I know now and,
even if I think about it,

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.010
what I knew then.

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:53.410
But that was never said, right?

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:56.240
They never quite put
it in those terms.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.654
So that seems like a really
important thing going forward

00:59:58.654 --> 01:00:00.820
to try to make sure that
the kids who are growing up

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.680
in Massachusetts have
that view, like you

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.580
said, that paradigm instead
of some of the other ones.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.296
I have no idea how to
affect that though,

01:00:08.296 --> 01:00:09.670
or even how to
monitor it, right?

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:10.780
I'm no longer in school.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.850
I don't have kids who I
can read their homework

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.830
and see, oh, that's what
they're being taught.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.290
Do you have suggestions
for how we as a state

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.204
can try to push education
in that direction?

01:00:20.204 --> 01:00:22.495
BYRON RUSHING: Well, see, I
would turn-- that question,

01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:25.390
I really should ask
everybody in this room.

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:29.230
So the question is
really for you here,

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.870
how could Google affect that?

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:35.740
See, what would you need to
do to just raise that up so it

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.430
sort of becomes viral?

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:42.550
I do think part of this--
there's small things that we

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.155
can all just do as individuals.

01:00:44.155 --> 01:00:46.030
And I think part of that
is we should be very

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:49.460
careful about our vocabulary.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.460
We should be careful about
what does "discover" mean.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.380
So this discover means that
I saw your car in the parking

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:57.880
lot.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.950
And you forgot to
close the door, right,

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.690
so I discovered your car.

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:08.860
And so how do we
talk about this past

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.890
in words that make sense, that
are as accurate as possible?

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.310
And so "invasion," of
course, is one of those words

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:17.620
that we need to use
more often, I think,

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.460
in talking about
these early periods.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.730
But I really leave it to you.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:27.190
See, I think that it's the
communication piece of this

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.270
that really it comes to.

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:30.160
How do I talk about this?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.730
How do I get other people to
engage in this conversation?

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.692
So I ask that to all of you.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.400
AUDIENCE: I'm interested
in your thoughts

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:46.820
on the role of this highly
biased, deeply gapped,

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.160
false history that is often
taught in the United States,

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.560
the role in the 2016 elections,
and the impact on sort

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.870
of the rise of more
publicly espoused racism,

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:04.530
the alt-right and
so on, and thoughts

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:08.310
about what we as individuals and
we collectively as society can

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:14.820
do to push back against
this resurgence of some

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.440
of these views.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:19.890
BYRON RUSHING: I'll say
two things about that

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.750
because this is a conversation.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:25.161
I was just in a meeting
to talk about what

01:02:25.161 --> 01:02:27.160
we should be doing in
Massachusetts about health

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.570
care, considering
everything that might

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.980
be getting ready to happen.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.330
And the person started off
by saying, anybody tells you

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.062
that they know what's
going to happen

01:02:38.062 --> 01:02:40.020
doesn't know what they're
talking about, right?

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.820
So we have to put
it in that context.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.160
But one thing to understand,
I think, about this

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:53.590
is how different white
people are in this country.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:55.830
And I think that
that is something

01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:57.660
that everybody in
this country needs

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.360
to think about but I think
white people especially

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.800
need to think about--

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.240
how little they know
about other white people.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.580
And so since the
election when I've

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.270
talked to predominantly
black audiences, I say,

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:17.490
I understand that we don't
know what's going to happen.

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:20.220
But generally it does
not look good, right?

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.890
But understand this.

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:24.510
You were surprised.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.310
All your white neighbors
were surprised.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:30.330
But there's one thing that you
were not, to black people--

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.580
you were not shocked.

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.740
Half of the white people
were shocked, right?

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:39.370
And you are not shocked
because you know that there

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.155
have been worse times.

01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:43.970
And in your paradigm,
in your history,

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.540
you know that black
people have recovered

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.220
from worse times than these.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.210
White people can't remember when
they recovered from worst times

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:53.095
than these.

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.720
So I think there are two things
that we need to do immediately.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.670
And I think one of
them is that we all

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:00.190
need to be talking
about white people

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:03.010
and learning more about them.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:07.180
And part of this is
not going to be easy,

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.400
and that is actually when
you learn more about them--

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:12.730
they're some good
books about that.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:17.260
Every white person needs to
take a White Studies Course.

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.710
How many of you taken Black
Studies courses, right?

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.780
You need to take a
White Studies Course.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.670
Then, how do we
talk to each other?

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:29.500
And those are huge questions.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.290
And I don't know the answers.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:34.000
See, I'm at the point
where I'm trying

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.410
to formulate the questions.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.000
But I don't know the answer.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.790
Thank you very much.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:46.540
[APPLAUSE]
