00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.433
 

00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.300
Hi.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.780
In the session, we'll
be solving

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.500
the Monty Hall problem.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.190
And this problem is based on
an old game show that was

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.930
called "Let's Make a Deal."
And the host of this game

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.170
show, his name was Monty Hall,
which is why this problem is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.570
now known as the Monty
Hall problem.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
And this problem is actually
pretty well-known, because

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.450
there was some disagreement at
the time over what the right

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.330
answer to this problem
should be.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.800
Even some really smart people
didn't agree on what the right

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.360
answer should be.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.040
And part of what might explain
that disagreement is that they

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.110
probably were considering
slightly different variations

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.220
of the problem, because as in
all probability problems, the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.930
assumptions that you're
working with are very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
important, because otherwise you
may be solving an actually

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.080
different problem.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.480
And so what we'll do first is
really layout concretely what

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.760
all the assumptions are, what
the rules of the game are.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.190
And then we'll go through the
methodology to solve for the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.350
actual answer.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.530
So the game is actually
relatively simple.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820
So you're on a game
show and you're

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.490
presented with three doors.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.720
These doors are closed.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.940
And behind one of these doors is
a prize, let's say, a car.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.840
And behind the other two
doors, there's nothing.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.790
You don't know which
one it is.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.170
And the rules of the game are
that, first, you get to choose

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.800
any one of these three.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.820
So you pick one of the
doors that you want.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.620
They don't show you what's
behind that door, but your

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.890
friend, who actually knows
which door has the prize

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.630
behind it, will look at
the remaining doors.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.640
So let's, just for example,
let's say you chose door one.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.900
Your friend will look at
the other two doors

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.240
and open one of them.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.370
And you will make sure
that the one

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.950
that he opens is empty.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.390
That is the prize not
behind that one.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.810
And at this point, one of the
doors is open and its empty,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.130
you have your original door plus
another unopened door.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.360
And you're given an option--
you could either stay with

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.789
your initial choice or
you can switch to the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.150
other unopened door.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.780
And whichever one is your
final choice, they

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.830
will open that door.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.830
And if there's a price behind
it, you win, and if there not,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.890
then you don't win.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.630
So the question that we're
trying to answer is what is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.290
the better strategy here?

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.790
Is the better strategy to stay
with your initial choice or is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.910
it better to switch to the
other unopened door?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.360
OK, so it turns out that the
specific rules here actually

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.600
are very important.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.010
Specifically, the rule about
how your friend chooses to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.750
open doors.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.460
And the fact that he will always
open one of the two

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.650
other door that you haven't
picked and he will make sure

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.000
that that door doesn't have
a prize behind it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.930
And let's see how that actually

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.890
plays out in this problem.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.880
So the simplest way, I think, of
thinking about this problem

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.050
is just to think about under
what circumstances does

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.900
staying with your initial
choice win?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.380
So if you think about it, the
only way that you can win by

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.450
staying with your initial choice
is if your initial

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.270
choice happened to be the door
that has a prize behind it.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.820
And because you're sticking with
the initial choice, you

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.000
can actually kind of forget
about the rest of the game,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.310
about opening of the other
door and about switching.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.650
It's as if you're playing a
simpler game, which is just

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.340
you have three doors, one of
them has a prize behind it,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.480
and you choose one of them.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.340
And if you guessed right,
then you win.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.440
If you didn't, then
you don't win.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.360
And because the another
important assumption is that

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.020
the prize has an equal
probability of being behind

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.500
any one of three doors so one
third, one third, one third.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.690
Because of that, then if you
stay with your first choice,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.980
you win only if your first
choice happened

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.740
to the right one.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.800
And that is the case with
probably one third.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.980
So with that simple argument you
can convince yourself that

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.400
the probability of winning,
given the strategy of staying

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.990
with your first choice,
is one third.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.050
Now, let's think
about the other

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.960
strategy, which is to switch.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.390
So under what circumstances does
switching win for you?

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.760
Well, if your first choice
happened to be the right door,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.740
then switching away from that
door will always lose.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.670
But let's say, that happens
with probably one third.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.920
But the rest of the time with
probably 2/3, your first

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.260
choice would be wrong.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.250
So let's give an example here.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.635
Let's say, the prize, which I'll
denote by happy face, is

00:04:44.635 --> 00:04:45.870
behind door two.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.090
And your first choice
was door one.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.390
So your first choice
was wrong.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.730
Now, your friend can open door
two, because door two has the

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.650
prize behind it.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.540
He also doesn't open the door
that you initially picked.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.930
So he has to open door three.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.110
So door three is open, and now
you have an option of sticking

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.520
with your first choice--
door one--

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.330
or switching to door two.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.030
So in this case, it's
obvious to see that

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.300
switching wins for you.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.020
And now, if instead, you picked
door one first, and the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.300
prize was behind door three,
again, you are wrong.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.120
And again, your friend is
forced to open door two.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.530
And switching, again,
wins for you.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.530
And so if you think about it,
switching will win for you, as

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.560
long as your initial
pick was wrong.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.610
If your initial pick was wrong,
then the prize is

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.540
behind one of the doors.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.050
Your friend has to open one of
the doors, but he can't open

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.820
the door that has the
prize behind it.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.030
So he has to open the other
bad door, leaving the good

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.490
door with the prize behind
it, as the one that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.810
you can switch to.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.020
And so by switching you will
win in this scenario.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.730
And what is the probability
of that happening?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.160
Well, that happens if your
initial pick was wrong, which

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.110
happens with probably 2/3.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.520
So the final answer then, it's
pretty simple, the probability

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.526
of winning if you stay is one
third, and the probability of

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:11.560
winning if you switch is 2/3.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.130
And so maybe counterintuitively
the result

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.500
is that it's actually better
for you, twice as good for

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.500
you, to switch rather
than stay.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.930
And so that was the argument,
the kind of simple argument.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.630
We can also be more methodical
about this and actually list

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.020
out all of the possible
outcomes.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.290
Because it's relatively small
problem-- there's only three

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.050
doors-- we can actually
just list out all

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.230
the possible outcomes.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.000
So for example, if you chose
door one first, and the prize

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.570
was behind door one, your
friend has a choice.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.870
He can open door two or
door three, because

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.740
they're both empty.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.440
And then in that case, if you
stay, you win, you picked the

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.250
door correctly.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.940
And if you switch to two or
three, then you lose.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.400
But if you chose door one, the
prize is behind door two, then

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.580
your friend has to open door
three, he is forced to do

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.510
that, then staying with lose
but switching would win.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.320
And so on for the other cases.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.920
And so again, this is just an
exhaustive list of all the

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.020
possible outcomes, from which
you can see that, in fact,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.520
staying wins, only if your
first choice was correct.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.850
And switching wins in
all the other cases.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.780
And so one third of the time,
staying would win, 2/3 of the

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.070
time switching would win.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.210
OK, so now, we have
the answer.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.880
Let's try to figure out and
convince ourselves that it is

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.780
actually right, because you
might think before going

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.870
through this process that
maybe it doesn't matter

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.410
whether you stay or you switch,
they both have the

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.910
same probably of winning, or
maybe even staying is better.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.950
So why is staying worse
and switching better?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.790
Well, the first argument really
is something that we've

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.430
already talked about.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.750
By staying, you're essentially
banking on your first choice

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.390
being correct, which is a
relatively poor bet, because

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.350
you have only one in three
chance of being right.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.340
But by switching, you're
actually banking on your first

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.600
choice being wrong, which is a
relatively better bet, because

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.100
you're more likely to be wrong
than right in your first

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.580
choice, because you're
just picking blindly.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.120
OK, so that is one intuitive
explanation for why

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.620
switching is better.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.320
Another slightly different way
to think about it is that

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.960
instead of picking single doors,
you're actually picking

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.770
groups of doors.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.780
So let's say that your first
pick was door one.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.510
Then you're actually really
deciding between door one or

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.120
doors two and three combined.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.365
So why is that?

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:56.560
It's because by staying
with door one, you're

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.950
staying with door one.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.360
But by switching, you're
actually getting two doors for

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.460
the price of one, because you
know that your friend will

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.170
reveal one of these to be empty,
and the other one will

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:11.950
stay closed.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.010
But switching really kind of
buys you both of these.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.640
And so because it buys you two
opportunities to win, you get

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.210
2/3 chance of winning, versus
a one third chance.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.930
 

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.920
Another way of thinking about
this is to increase the scale

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.570
of the problem, and maybe that
will help visualize the

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.890
counterintuitive answer.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.710
So instead of having three
doors, imagine that you have

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.890
1,000 doors that are closed.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:51.230
And again, one prize is behind
one of the doors.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.510
And the rules are similar-- you
pick one door first, and

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.720
then your friend will open
998 other doors.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.370
And these doors are guaranteed
to be empty.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.450
And now you're left with your
initial door plus one other

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.140
door that is unopened.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.590
So now the question is should
you stay with your first

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.540
choice or switch to
your other choice?

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.940
And it should be more
intuitively obvious now that

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.890
the better decision would be
to switch, because you're

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:27.450
overwhelmingly more likely to
have picked incorrectly for

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.250
your first pick.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.000
You have only 1 in 1,000 chance
of getting it right.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.240
So that is kind of just taking
this to a bigger extreme and

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.020
really driving home
the intuition.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:50.110
OK, so what we've really
discovered is that the fact

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.430
that the rules of the game are
that your friend has to open

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.840
one of the other two doors and
cannot reveal the prize plays

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.580
a big role in this problem.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.770
And that is an important
assumption.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.720
OK, so now let's think
about a slightly

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.980
different variation now.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.990
So a different strategy.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.550
Instead of just always staying
or always switching, we have a

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.540
specific other strategy, which
is that you will choose door

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.550
one first and then, depending on
what your friend does, you

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.680
will act accordingly.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.620
So if your friend opens door
two, you will not switch.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.130
And if your friend opens door
three, you will switch.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:33.150
So let's draw out exactly
what happens here.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.160
So you have door one
that you've chosen.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.980
 

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.780
And the prize can be behind
doors one, two, or three.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.590
And again, it's equally
likely.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.450
So the probabilities of these
branches are one third, one

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.220
third, and one third.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:57.970
And now given that, your friend
in this scenario has a

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.130
choice between opening
doors two or three.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.510
And so because of doors, you
chose one, the prize actually

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.400
is behind one, and so two and
three are both empty, so he

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.030
can choose whichever one
he wants to open.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.380
 

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.490
And the problem actually hasn't
specified how your

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.660
friend actually decides
between this.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.310
So we'll leave it in general.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.720
So we'll say that the
probability p, your friend

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.670
will open two, door
two, in this case.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.480
And with the remaining
probability 1 minus p, he will

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.270
open door three.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.340
What about in this case?

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.760
Well, you chose door one.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.490
The prize is actually
behind door two.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.010
So following the rules of the
game, your friend is forced to

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.920
open door three.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.530
So this happens with
probability 1.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.710
And similarly, if the prize is
behind door three, your friend

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.890
is forced to open door two,
which, again, happens with

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.460
probably 1.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.860
So now let's see how this
strategy works.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.300
When do you win?

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:02.300
You win when, according to the
strategy, your final choice is

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.900
the right door.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.160
So according to the strategy,
in this case, your friend

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.650
opened door two.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.560
And according to your strategy,
if door two is open,

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.330
you don't switch.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.660
So you stay with your
first choice of one.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.380
And that happens to the right
one, so you win in this case.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.500
But what about here?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.110
Your friend opened door three,
and by your strategy, you do

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.080
switch, which is the wrong
choice here, so you lose.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.750
Here, you switch, because you
open door three, and you

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.460
switch to the right door,
so that wins.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.910
And this one, you don't
switch, and you lose.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.110
All right, so what is the final
probability of winning?

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.130
And the final probably of
winning is the probability of

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.730
getting to these two outcomes,
which happens with probability

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:52.510
one third times p plus
one third times 1.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.670
So one third.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:57.010
So the final answer is one
third p plus one third.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.520
And notice now that the answer
isn't just a number.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.400
Like in this case, the answer
was one third and 2/3.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.930
And it didn't actually matter
how your friend chose between

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.220
these two doors when
he had a choice.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.680
But in this case, it actually
doesn't matter, because p

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.090
stays in the answer.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.420
But one thing that we can do
is we can compare this with

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.780
these strategies.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.545
So what we see is that, well p
is a probability, so it has to

00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:23.920
be between 0 and 1.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.000
So this probability winning for
this strategy is somewhere

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.130
between one third times 0 plus
one third, which is one third.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.460
And one third times 1 plus
one third, which is 2/3.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.530
So the strategy is somewhere
between 2/3 and one third.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.560
So what we see is that no matter
what, this strategy is

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.200
at least as good as staying all
the time, because that was

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.060
only one third.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.610
And no matter what it can't be
any better than switching,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.850
which was 2/3.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.850
So you can also come up with
lots of other different

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.970
strategies and see what the
probabilities of winning are

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.580
in that case.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.100
OK, so what have we learned
in this problem?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.380
What are the key takeaways?

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.680
One important takeaway is that
it's important to really

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.500
understand a problem and arrive
at a concrete and

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.530
precise set of assumptions.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.070
So really have a precise problem
that you're solving.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.460
And another important takeaway
is to think about your final

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.230
answer, make sure that that
actually makes sense to you,

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.740
make sure that you can justify
it somehow intuitively.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.030
In that case, you can actually
convince yourself that your

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.890
answer is actually correct,
because sometimes go through a

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.660
lot of formulas, and sometimes
your formula may have an error

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.040
in there somewhere.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.040
But you could take the final
answer and ask yourself does

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.100
this actually makes
sense intuitively?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.250
That's often a very good check
and sometimes you can catch

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.400
errors in your calculations
that way.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.160
OK so we'll see next time.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:03.000
