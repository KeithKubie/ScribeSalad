00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:04.813
Here the inverse is x + 4, all divided by +3.

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:07.309
Great work if you found the inverse.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.280
We'll start by writing our function

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.852
with the variables y for the output and x 
for the input.

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:16.317
Now we want to switch x and y.

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:19.904
This gives us a new equation that we can now 
solve for y

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:21.956
to find our inverse function.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.832
First we'll add 4 to both sides

00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:27.130
to get x + 4 = 3y.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.152
Then we'll divide both sides by +3

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:34.210
to get y = (x+4)/3.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.375
We change y into f inverse of x

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.858
to denote the inverse function.

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:42.927
So here is our final answer.
