00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:46.572
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.640
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.960
Hello, everyone, and welcome
to this exciting Talks

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.060
at Google event.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.710
We're so happy to
have you all here.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.156
Wasn't that
performance incredible?

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:41.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.640
I'm Bradley Horowitz, a
VP of product management

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.420
here at Google.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.980
And it's my pleasure
to welcome you

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.240
all to this very special
event with Cirque de Soleil.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.350
And it's about their
newest show, "Volta,"

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.440
which just opened in
San Jose, and especially

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.660
about the behind-the-scenes
work that goes

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.470
into creating a show like
"Volta" and each and every one

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.610
of their shows.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.156
So let's welcome
Ron and Bernard.

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:10.943
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:11.860
RON KELLUM: Over here?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.510
Great, perfect.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.800
Would you like us to sit?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.008
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Either way.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:17.350
RON KELLUM: Great.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.390
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Bernard, focus.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.470
BERNARD PETIOT: Oh, OK.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.550
Oh my god.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.560
All right.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.060
First step of casting.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.900
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I'm not
throwing away my shot.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.750
Am I in?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.040
BERNARD PETIOT: Yeah.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.805
You've passed the basics.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:38.680
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.360
The basics?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.860
OK.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.420
All right, well,
it's our pleasure

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.720
to welcome you here today.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.840
Thank you so much for coming.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.090
And I think we'll just start
with some introductions.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.720
I gave a very brief introduction
of your titles and roles,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.220
but we don't know
what that means.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.870
So maybe, Ron, you could start.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.503
Tell us first a little bit
about your background, and then

00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:59.670
a little bit about what you
do for Cirque du Soleil.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.420
RON KELLUM: Great.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.890
Well, first of
all, it's thrilling

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.120
to be here on a personal level.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.540
My first job out
of college in 1987,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.080
I actually was across the
street on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.730
So it's I'm thrilled to be back.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.230
It's a sports
entertainment company.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.022
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We
own that building now.

00:06:15.022 --> 00:06:17.470
RON KELLUM: I realize that.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.550
I was a college gymnast and they
killed our gymnastics program,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.680
so I became a
college cheerleader.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.180
And so the company
that I worked for

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.620
was called United
Spirit Association.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.495
They were based here.

00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:29.070
And they're now one of the
largest sports entertainment

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.170
and corporate companies,
entertainment companies,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.400
in the United States.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.140
And then I went
off to do Broadway.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.540
I performed on Broadway in
several shows for many years

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.560
and toured around the country
and the world for 15 years,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.330
stopped performing, became a
choreographer and a director,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.720
worked with lots of big
sports entertainment events.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.970
Like, I've been doing
the NFL Pro Bowl halftime

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.020
shows for the last 19 years,
and choreographed Iron Man 2

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.140
with Robert Downey Jr. and
directed a lot of theater

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.990
around the country.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.250
And then Cirque came calling.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.480
And it's been a pleasure to
work as an artistic director

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.440
for the company.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.310
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
And just a little

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.102
bit-- we'll get into
this more, of course--

00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:06.280
but what does an
artistic director do?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.780
RON KELLUM: That's
a great question.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.880
It can be a bit confusing.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.550
What I do, there
is the creatives,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.320
the conceptors of a show.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.843
So they build and
basically deliver the show.

00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:18.510
Then there's the
management of the show,

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.970
so that's where the
artistic director comes in.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.430
I take on the show as it is.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.370
And what our job is is to
basically maintain a show

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.860
that we can do 8
to 10 shows a week

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.810
with all the different
changes and challenges

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.268
that we have to
deal with in moving

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:35.610
the show, while at the same
time, evolving the show.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.610
We want to make sure that if
the audience has seen that show

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.650
a year ago, that if
they see it again--

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.110
which we hope that they will--

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.597
that they actually will see the
same concept, but new elements.

00:07:46.597 --> 00:07:48.180
So that's how we
keep our shows fresh.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.960
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: No, I
can't wait to dig into that.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.630
But first, Bernard,
tell us a little bit

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.770
about your background.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.320
And what does a
casting director do?

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.380
BERNARD PETIOT: My
background, I was a gymnast.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.970
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.480
BERNARD PETIOT: I had a
education in physical education

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.240
and then a master's degree
in performance analysis

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.590
and a doctorate in cognitive
sciences, which was not

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.270
completed because I got an
offer by Cirque de Soleil

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.730
at one point of my career.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.120
I've been coaching for
22 years and teaching

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.250
Montreal University 18 years.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.910
And now it's 20 years
at Cirque de Soliel.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.040
And I was hired to basically
implement a whole system

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.140
in Montreal at
the headquarter so

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.039
that we could sustain
or help the show

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.380
to be sustained in
their performance,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.908
and also help the
creation of the new shows.

00:08:36.908 --> 00:08:38.700
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: No
shame in dropping out.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.480
Larry Sergey-- it's what we
do here in Silicon Valley.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.960
So let's get into some of
the behind-the-scenes magic

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.210
that you guys are responsible.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.810
For so Ron, every Cirque
show is imaginative,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.760
from the storyline
to the costumes

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.330
to the themes to the
acrobatics and performances.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.850
So how is the theme
for a show decided?

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.740
Like, what is the process?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.630
Where do you start,
and how does it

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.730
evolve into this
amazing production

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.920
that we can go see in San Jose?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.590
RON KELLUM: I think the
best way of answering

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.050
that is that it starts with,
where are we in reality,

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.040
in time?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.810
Right now we're dealing
with pop culture.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.180
We're dealing with
instant gratification.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.720
So what Cirque has,
I think, done so well

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.650
is take what's happening
right now, or in the past,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.010
and bring it forward.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.920
So the idea right
now with "Volta"

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.880
specifically is really
about acceptance,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.010
and that every single
person's individuality

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.700
is very important.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700
We've sort of found
ourselves in this world

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.970
of capturing and
creating the narrative

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.360
and sort of hiding behind
what we want people to see.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.220
What's very special
about "Volta"

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.820
is the [INAUDIBLE] let's get
back to who we really are

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.240
and how uniquely special
every individual is.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.770
And that's what
our show is about.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.780
BERNARD PETIOT: And
that's the reality, also,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.300
of Cirque de Soliel
is that diversity.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.970
And it starts
supporting, let's say,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.630
the idea, the initial idea.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.870
Then it starts,
also, with casting

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.520
who you would select, actually,
for the various acts that you

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.515
have to build around this
big idea and this concept.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.140
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
What is amazing to me

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.320
is that the show is, at
once, extremely topical

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.400
and on point to what's
happening in the world.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.320
But it's also timeless and spans
cultures and spans generations.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.960
So it has this universal appeal.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.920
And it does all of this sort
of without being on the nose

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.270
and over the top about it.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.540
So it's an amazing
art to sort of convey

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:44.830
all that without lyrics
or necessarily verse.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.358
It's all done and conveyed
through choreography.

00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:49.150
BERNARD PETIOT: Yeah,
and it's interesting,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.480
because when you look at that
reality of creative reality,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.910
is that Cirque du Soliel
is really good at inviting

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.240
creators, people that have
an experience of background,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.970
and inviting them around
the table, around a team,

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.440
and then managing
that environment

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.910
and supporting them
so that they go

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.910
through the journey
of the discussion

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.010
and the development
of the ideas.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.620
And when you add on
top of that, the team

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.900
would be around 20 to 25 people.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.200
And part of that,
maybe four or five

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.630
are only from internal creators.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.940
And everybody else is
from outside and invited

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.470
for that specific project.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.265
And then you add
after that the artists

00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:27.640
that are coming from various
background, various culture,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.370
also.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.570
OK, you saw this actor
coming from Japan.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.790
In "Volta" you will
see also the BMX people

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.430
that are coming from
this urban activity that

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.800
is also free in
spirit and supporting

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.000
the idea of the show.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.280
And they are contributors
to the journey of creators.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.363
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah, I
imagine they have to be,

00:11:44.363 --> 00:11:47.170
because you can't
basically say, let's

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.710
get someone who can skip
at six skips per second

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.360
and then find out
if that's feasible.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.970
You sort of have to be in
dialogue with what's possible.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.630
And I want to talk to
you about that process.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.130
How do you survey all
that's out there, you know?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.370
So it's a big world and
there's, from Japan to San Jose,

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.400
there's a lot of
interesting things going on.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.657
How do you keep a pulse
on what's cutting edge

00:12:12.657 --> 00:12:13.490
and what's possible?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.080
BERNARD PETIOT: It's two ways.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.240
There's the traditional
way that you

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.448
will find in the casting
process, which is basically,

00:12:18.448 --> 00:12:22.270
in our case, is going to
the various circus festival,

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.170
doing the audition, as we
normally do in casting,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.870
and also--

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.000
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: When
you say circus festivals,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.730
there is like a
conference circuit for--

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:34.250
BERNARD PETIOT: No,
those big festival, you

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.757
know, where you can find,
actually, circus professionals.

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:39.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: You're going
to other circuses and poaching?

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.573
Is that what you're telling me?

00:12:41.573 --> 00:12:43.990
BERNARD PETIOT: And then we're
also going to competitions.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.507
And then I have a
specific agreement

00:12:46.507 --> 00:12:48.340
with the International
Gymnastics Federation

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.370
so where I can go to all of
these worlds, and Olympics,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.260
and so on, and then
keep that relationship.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.330
Because what you have
to understand is nobody

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.360
has an obligation to produce
the talent for Cirque.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.345
We have to find a way--

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:00.970
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
There's no farm team,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.770
really, that's sort of--

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.230
like you're saying, maybe
some of the things you do

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.620
is look at adjacent
things, like BMX, right?

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.486
And--

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.720
BERNARD PETIOT: And
so there's that way,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.580
but also there is
the technology.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.570
There is YouTube.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.460
So we scan through the YouTube.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.440
And we also have our web.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.420
We have also
created a community.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.400
And then we're
extending now and we're

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.770
looking at new strategies and
sort of open source, whereby

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:32.170
people could actually inform
us of some specific talent

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.870
that we haven't discovered
yet, or a person that

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.905
has a craft or something that
would be interesting for us.

00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:39.530
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
we're very honored

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.960
and glad you use YouTube.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.080
These folks built
it, some of them.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.790
And it is amazing.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.270
How do you feel about little
snippets of Cirque performances

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.290
ending up on YouTube?

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.090
Is that OK so long as it's
appropriately tagged and--

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.215
BERNARD PETIOT: It's very
interesting, because it's

00:13:55.215 --> 00:13:58.270
so key in terms of an indication
of what's happening out there,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.800
what's on YouTube, that could
also serve as an inspiration.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.210
But we need to go further.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.740
We need to meet these people.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.130
We need to see if they do
is sustainable over time.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.930
See, if you take a
touring show, it's

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.300
about 360 occasional
performances.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.440
If you go to our permanent
show, it's 470 times.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.690
OK, so you need to
select people that

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.225
have the ability to sustain
that level, in consistency.

00:14:23.225 --> 00:14:24.850
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Reliable, repeatable.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.210
BERNARD PETIOT: Absolutely.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.200
Yeah.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.240
RON KELLUM: And it's
actually really exciting,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.150
the YouTube platform, because
for someone like myself,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.780
who is creative always and
having to evolve a show, that's

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.280
why I do a lot of
my research, where

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.160
I go find these amazing artists
that don't have the platform.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.250
If they're living in
a small rural village

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.710
in a small country
that doesn't have

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.290
the access to this
performing world,

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.920
we can find them because
they can post instantaneously

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.210
what they do.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.770
And it's amazing what we find.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.043
It also helps us to stay
innovative, excuse me.

00:14:56.043 --> 00:14:58.210
BERNARD PETIOT: And yeah,
and the other thing, also,

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.090
because I am responsible
of a team that

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.910
is doing equipment and
performance development,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.930
and then we scan what's
happening out there.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.855
And then we use that
as an inspiration

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:10.230
to see if there is a new tool
or something that we think,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.480
OK, we say, if we
modify that, if we go

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.790
and push it a bit further,
OK, if we meet these people,

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.290
then if we establish a
project, then we can actually

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.325
push the performance.

00:15:19.325 --> 00:15:21.950
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: This is one of
the questions I wanted to ask.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.320
How much do you focus on
augmenting the performance

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.250
with, whether it's a
bicycle or a wheel?

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.030
I've seen all kinds of things.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.470
Like, could it be
a robot or bionics?

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.530
Like, is there a limit to how
far you would apply technology

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.820
in service of the performance?

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.650
Or do you like to
keep it a little more

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.930
grounded in the human
aspect of our own bodies?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.400
BERNARD PETIOT: I'll
start, Ron, if you want.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.610
Actually, yeah, looking
at the technological part,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.270
it should be there
to help to enhance,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.850
to ensure that it's sort of
giving a new opportunity.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.990
It's not replacing the human
because fundamentally Cirque du

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.970
Soleil is based on
that human presence.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:12.220
And basically, we've ventured
ourselves working with robots.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.500
And it's very interesting
because we created, also,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.920
an act with, let's say, a kuka
robot, comic act with that.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.990
So there is a lot
of possibilities,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.530
as long as it's integrated
in the performance

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.960
and it's kind of
helping the performance

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.875
to even look better,
or to surprise

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:33.250
with something
that you would not

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.363
expect as a physicality
of the relationship.

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.280
RON KELLUM: And I would
only add that it helps

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.840
with the theatricality of it.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.520
I think as long as it stays
in that space of, wow,

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.390
we're evolving.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.540
We're raising the consciousness,
while at the same time

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.460
inviting people into this story.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.580
I think it's a great
partnership and synergy when

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.705
we accomplish those things.

00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:57.497
And I think it helps
us stay on the cutting

00:16:57.497 --> 00:16:59.497
edge of entertainment,
which is really exciting.

00:16:59.497 --> 00:17:01.872
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Let's talk
a little bit about the tech,

00:17:01.872 --> 00:17:03.520
because a show like
"Volta" doesn't

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.609
happen without a tremendous
amount of back office

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.390
technology.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.569
We sort of see the end product,
but the synchronization,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.900
the lights, the
music, the performers,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.180
can you speak a little
bit about what's

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.843
sort of going on
behind the scenes?

00:17:18.843 --> 00:17:20.260
RON KELLUM: Well,
you know, I have

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.369
an amazing team-- our artistic
team, our technical teams,

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.420
it is critical.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.190
It's really like
air traffic control.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.200
There's one person
who's our GSM who's

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.150
calling a show in real time.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.880
And literally, the
conversations are cue to cue.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.060
For example, we're using high
level technology and music

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.700
together.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.540
And what we're doing is if an
artist is going for a trick,

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.720
for example, and
they're on the BMX

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.540
and we know that we want
to coordinate lighting,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.660
video, at the same time,
music with the accent

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.720
of this incredible trick that
the artist is about to do,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.060
many times the artists will
miss the trick-- not fall,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.640
but they don't execute it
in a way that they want to.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.650
The artists will indicate that
they're going to do it again.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.760
So we're actually performing in
real time with live musicians.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.310
And we will get a cue from our
general stage management that

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.970
says, we're going back to
measure for our bandleader cues

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.480
to the musicians that we're all
going back, lighting and video,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.303
so that we nail it
at the right moment.

00:18:18.303 --> 00:18:19.720
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So in real time,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.837
you've got to be able to skip
back four measures and-- wow.

00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:24.670
BERNARD PETIOT: And in
terms of performance,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.080
it's interesting, also,
because we are using

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.970
a lot of motors and automation.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.940
And there is this
relationship between the guy

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.348
that is controlling the motors
and then the performers.

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:35.890
Let's say strap, as
an example, where

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.170
people will fly up in the
air and then come back

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.750
on the stage very, very
smoothly, that rapport

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.470
and using this instrument of the
motor and all of the technology

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.363
is very important
for the performance.

00:18:46.363 --> 00:18:48.280
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Is
there a single conductor?

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.380
Is there someone
with a baton who is

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.740
sort of running that timeline?

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.240
Or--

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.590
RON KELLUM: That would be
considered the general stage

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.570
manager, but there is
the musical director,

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.390
the bandleader.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.330
And they're in
great communication.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.630
We also use a signal
that's very pedestrian now,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.690
but it still works.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.550
It's the red light, green light
system, for all departments.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.650
So technically and
musically, automation,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.110
every department knows that--
and even the artists when

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.210
they're performing
in real time--

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.440
if we're not set up and
all elements aren't safe,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.780
there is a red light in four
different places onstage.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.300
And until they see the green
light, no one goes further.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.760
So that's how we
also communicate

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.870
with the artists on stage.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.953
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Amazing.

00:19:29.953 --> 00:19:31.750
And I assume safety
is paramount.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.730
I mean, what you're
doing is no joke.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.330
And you know, you
guys must put that

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.802
at the forefront of all thought.

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.510
BERNARD PETIOT: Yeah,
and safety, for me,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.920
when I look at it from
a global perspective,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.060
it starts from the
first casting steps.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.890
I mean, we're
selecting an individual

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.050
that has a proven
ability to perform.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.770
In other words, they're
not developing themselves

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.780
from the scratch when
they arrive at Cirque

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.780
and then start from there
with that specific profile.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.110
And after that, we go through--

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.010
especially in creation, we
go to all of these steps,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.860
OK, in terms of making the
appropriate progression,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.910
testing every steps in
every component of an act,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.220
and then ensuring that
we do that in training.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.820
Then after that, we do that
in show condition by the time

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.985
it ends up on the stage.

00:20:16.985 --> 00:20:18.610
And then you have
the same thing, also,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.950
with integration, where you're
taking all of these steps

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.040
to control the security
aspect and the safety aspect.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.020
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So all
Cirque shows are moving.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.260
I think some of them
are very dreamlike

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.980
and sort of touching
deep parts of ourselves.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.830
There's a little bit of a dark
side to them sometimes, right?

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.180
Like, it's not all
Disney and fairy tale.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.290
There's sort of some--

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.450
it's a show that
can be very adult.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.790
Can you talk above
that shadow aspect

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.720
or sort of the blend of the
uplifting and positive message

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.082
around tolerance, but also
sort of the darker side?

00:20:56.082 --> 00:20:56.790
RON KELLUM: Yeah.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.170
I think that it's
really important to--

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.860
it's sort of that
commentary on reality,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.260
that our shows sort
of push the envelope.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.460
We make people think.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.380
We make people walk away
going, I'm not sure.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.580
And I think so often
in entertainment we

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.530
want it to have a happy ending.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.530
I think sometimes it's really
important as storytellers,

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.680
as innovators, that we leave
a space where you're going,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.910
what was that?

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.950
Or what does that make me feel?

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.045
Or how am relating to that?

00:21:25.045 --> 00:21:26.670
Because then out of
that, we're pushing

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.790
everyone's consciousness.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.910
I think that's what Cirque
does brilliantly without being,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.640
we're just going to be esoteric.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.790
It's more about, let's put
on this dreamlike reality

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.060
that we walk away going,
I felt like I had a dream.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.530
And we go, right.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.438
Now, what was that
dream for you?

00:21:42.438 --> 00:21:43.980
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Yeah, I really have

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.990
had that experience as
you're leaving where

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.850
you debrief with everyone.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.960
What did you take away?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.080
And it's fun to sort of see
how personal the experience can

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.510
be for everyone, and how
different people pick up

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.030
on different aspects of that,
which just really speaks

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.350
to the richness of the show and
how much thought goes into it.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.330
Tell us a little bit
about the costuming,

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.140
because that's something that
is integral to the performance.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.260
And the costumes we just
saw are absolutely amazing

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.540
and almost hard to
parse, you know,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.580
there's so much going on there.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.290
How are the costumes developed?

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.390
And is that, again,
from the inception?

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.025
Or is that done
later in the process?

00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:21.900
BERNARD PETIOT: No,
it''s from the inception.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.330
And again, we go through
that with the creative team,

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.790
so we'll find the
costume designer.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.060
And the costume designer will
work with our costume shop.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.500
And within the costume shop,
there is an R&amp;D department.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.050
And basically, they will
go from [INAUDIBLE] ideas.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.700
And then they will test
various possibilities.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.860
And all of the
craftsmen, the people

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.990
that are used to
create our costume,

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.970
will contribute with
the creator finding

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.233
the appropriate solutions.

00:22:49.233 --> 00:22:51.150
What we have developed
now with the technology

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:55.775
is we use the 3D print
in order to scan and so

00:22:55.775 --> 00:22:58.020
on, which actually
accelerate the process,

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.140
or allow to test the idea and
see if it's going to work.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.870
And so all of that
process is combined

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.860
with the whole team in
terms of the training that

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.990
is being done, and
also all of the costume

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.310
that is being developed.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.930
And every steps leads to
decisions and acceptance

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:18.630
of what is being designed so
that it fits with the concept.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.920
And that was all
done in Montreal.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.160
And then after that,
when it's on the road,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.060
then Ron is continuing
the journey with everybody

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.610
that is being replaced, and
actually-- or even the costume

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.760
that you can talk about.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.802
RON KELLUM: That's right.

00:23:31.802 --> 00:23:35.250
So once we get the actual
wardrobe on onstage,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.430
then it has to be durable.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.970
It has to be sustainable,
because we're moving--

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.510
we're doing upwards of 360
shows a year, 10 shows a week

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.010
sometimes.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.200
You have to make sure
that it's working.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.170
For example, the double dutch
team that was out here today,

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.490
that's neoprene.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.340
And it's also the
same kind of texture

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.470
that you would find in a
diving suit, a wetsuit.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.520
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.470
RON KELLUM: And also, they can
only be worn on one artist.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:00.990
What a lot of
people don't realize

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.070
is once we create these shows
and we cast these artists,

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.800
to replace one
artist is thousands

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.360
of dollars of investment.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.010
Once we find this
young artist in Peru,

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.370
for example, we go
through immigrations.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.480
We go through medical.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.800
Then we go through trainings.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.140
And then we go through the
costuming of that one artist.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.970
So by the time they get to
us eight weeks later on tour,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.693
there's been a huge investment
once they put on that garment.

00:24:26.693 --> 00:24:28.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: I would
like to see you guys going

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.700
through the TSA pre line and--

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.750
there must be some fun
you guys have in airports.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.632
But also, the dry cleaning
bill for that must be terrible.

00:24:39.632 --> 00:24:40.340
RON KELLUM: Huge.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.010
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
If you can even

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.380
find someone to-- but
these are the things

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.400
you have to think about.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.110
So not only do they
have to be sustainable,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.080
but you have to have
sort of enough inventory

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.390
you can rotate through them--

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.730
BERNARD PETIOT: Yeah.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.188
And some of the
costume, also, have

00:24:52.188 --> 00:24:55.260
to be designed so that they are
integrated to the performance

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.280
so they become also a
performance component.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.675
Let's see if you have to
wear something on your head.

00:25:00.675 --> 00:25:02.550
And if it's too heavy,
then it will influence

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.440
the mechanic of the movement.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.630
Or if you need some
protective areas,

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.220
then that has to be developed.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.930
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Costume's
probably the wrong word,

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.430
really.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.772
I don't know what the right
word is, but it's integral.

00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:13.730
RON KELLUM: Absolutely.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.540
And also, there's
another layer to it

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.570
is that we have inventors
right here on site with us.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.300
For example, on our team,
we have a wardrobe--

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.060
our head of wardrobe, Karen,
who is absolutely amazing.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.280
We're also dealing in
real time when something--

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.660
a piece of wardrobe
malfunctions or--

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.420
they're having to be
innovators and recreate.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.150
This past week we
had a great reality

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.450
where we had to restructure
a piece of the wardrobe

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.303
that the conceptor conceived.

00:25:40.303 --> 00:25:41.970
So there's a lot of
checks and balances.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.050
But she was smart enough and
fast enough with her team

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.050
to redesign this element,
also come up with a prop

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.635
that everyone goes, we should
sell that in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:52.635
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Bonus.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.120
Do you guys have--

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.590
I talked about
the airport thing,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:59.210
it made me think,
like, are there

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.570
any rituals that you guys have?

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.100
Do you travel as
a crew like all--

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.660
how many did you
say, 300 some people

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.150
in a production like this?

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.250
Do you hang out
before and after?

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.680
Or do you sort of meet
onstage and disperse?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.505
What's the behind-the-scenes
culture of Cirque like?

00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.880
RON KELLUM: It
truly is a family.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.500
I mean, it's a circus culture.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.510
And the tradition is real.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.280
We are family.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.607
Typical days for most
of us start at noon.

00:26:24.607 --> 00:26:26.690
Our technical team will
arrive on site at 9:00 AM.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.420
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
That's just like us.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.170
RON KELLUM: Right.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.893
Exactly.

00:26:29.893 --> 00:26:31.310
You spend your
whole day together.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.140
We eat together.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.265
Literally, we have three
chefs that travel with us.

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:35.932
We have a full--

00:26:35.932 --> 00:26:37.570
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
That's just like us.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.340
RON KELLUM: We're the same.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.960
That's why we're
working together.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.110
And you're together.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.230
All the artists train
every single day.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.340
We're evolving this show.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.040
And we typically end
our days around 11:00.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.350
And we travel
together, most of us.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.080
So yeah, it's quite intense.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.445
There are no secrets.

00:26:55.445 --> 00:26:56.870
And if there are, good luck.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.370
BERNARD PETIOT: And
that's the model

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.610
of touring as you have now
with the big [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.370
But also, there is
arena shows that

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.900
are even faster in
terms of their change

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.470
of different cities.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:12.480
And then we've got,
also, the model of Vegas,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.900
which is a resident show.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.750
And then people come in and out
and they go through their house

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.820
after that, which is
also a different model.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.195
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: How many
Cirque shows are in production

00:27:22.195 --> 00:27:24.357
at any given instant?

00:27:24.357 --> 00:27:25.940
BERNARD PETIOT: This
year in operation

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.300
we have more than 20
shows in operation.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:36.250
And then for 20 and 19,
we will have nine premiere

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.630
that we will be spreading
throughout the year, which

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:44.420
is the biggest number that
we have ever done so far.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.960
So we're all nervous about it.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.750
We will be delivering
a show in April

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.260
and then a new show also in
China and then one in Germany

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:54.762
and so on.

00:27:54.762 --> 00:27:55.970
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Incredible.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.410
That's really prolific.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.140
I mean, it's enough to put
on one show like "Volta."

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.210
But to do synchronously
as many shows

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.910
as you were doing,
it's really stunning,

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.410
the scale of which
you guys operate.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.720
BERNARD PETIOT: Also, the
thing that you have to look at

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.780
is when you have the cast that
is currently doing the show,

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.340
then you've got to look
at how you will establish

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.660
a system that will allow the
turnover, the replacement.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.170
And currently it's
about 14% a year

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.880
that I have to replace, so over
1,300 artists that is currently

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.800
in performance on our stage.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.310
So--

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.480
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: You
guys really are Google.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.890
You're dealing with attrition.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.500
You're dealing with hiring
and finding suitable talent,

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.820
you know, the best of the best.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.090
A lot we have in common here.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.320
So tell me about Cirque's
role in the performing

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.260
arts altogether.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.010
You really did come out
of a circus tradition,

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.100
but you really created something
that is unlike anything else,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.360
even to this day.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.730
But have you moved the industry?

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.620
Is there evidence that
you've sort of changed,

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.680
both everything from
theater to circuses

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.630
to other aspects of
the performing arts?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.433
What is the sort of greater
historical context of Cirque?

00:29:09.433 --> 00:29:10.850
RON KELLUM: You
know, what I would

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.420
say is the influence that it's
had in the world of artistry.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.920
I mean, you can't
go to a concert

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.710
nowadays without some
influence of Cirque.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.190
When I do a halftime
show, I'm enrolling

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.110
that aerial acrobatic level.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.990
I mean, when you see the opening
ceremonies of the Olympics,

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:28.400
Cirque is there.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.610
And its really
set the foundation

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.390
of how far you can go in
the entertainment industry.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:38.100
Even in theater, you know, the
Broadway model has changed,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.120
which is very exciting.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.010
So we've made our mark,
which is very exciting.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:47.780
You know, and I think the goal
always is to stay relevant

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.980
and to stay current, and really
keep telling great stories that

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.000
move people.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.480
And I think that as a result
of that, everyone sort of jumps

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.950
on board.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.230
BERNARD PETIOT: We've
influenced a lot also

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.050
what I would say the
physical practice.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.890
So there is now a big wave
of innovation in young people

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.490
that are basically being
influenced by us in developing

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.730
new acts or new ways
to actually present

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.990
their craft and ability.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.700
So that's quite interesting.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.490
And this is very also
interesting from my group

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:22.220
and casting and looking
at these new disciplines

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.833
or these new performances
that are emerging.

00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:26.250
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
One thing that's

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.190
hard, given the
ridiculously high bar you've

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.070
set for yourself,
where do you go next?

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.840
I mean, obviously there's more.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.690
And you sort of have
covered the world

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.570
in terms of number
of performing shows

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.880
and in residence in Vegas.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.980
And then they're sort
of moving the quality

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.980
and nature of the performance.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.830
Are there other things you're
thinking like new modalities?

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.260
Like is VR a possibility?

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.050
Can I sit on my couch
and experience Cirque?

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.970
Like, where do you go from here?

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.130
BERNARD PETIOT: It's a
really good question.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.310
It's a big, big challenge is
how do we reinvent ourselves,

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:10.990
or what kind of other avenues
that we could look at.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:12.840
In fact, we're
developing new product,

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.940
like CREACTIVE is
an example that's

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.140
been done in the Club Med.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.050
And it's basically in
participation in nature.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.260
But using technology to
VR, also, we use that

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.570
and we've created possibilities
for people in Vegas

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:31.230
in some of these permanent
show to experience

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.687
the show from the inside,
using VR, as an example.

00:31:34.687 --> 00:31:36.270
And then we're
venturing and exploring

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:38.070
all sorts of these
possibilities.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.800
But broader than that,
also the company,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.280
even though it keeps
its core product, which

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.600
is human-based circus
space as an example,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.490
then we're broadening.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.720
As you know, I mean, the
company has been bought.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.900
And then we've also
acquired new groups that

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.090
are also doing performances.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.420
The works, as an example.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.280
There is more in
the magic world.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.645
So then we're looking
at these areas, as well.

00:32:06.645 --> 00:32:08.270
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Anything to add, Ron?

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.980
RON KELLUM: Yeah, you know,
what I would say is that just--

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.630
I would say that the
company is always

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.270
looking for the new
innovation and innovators.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.020
And I think for me
today, when I came here

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.930
on campus for the first time,
I had the same excitement

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.813
that I have when I go to our
headquarters in Montreal.

00:32:24.813 --> 00:32:26.730
You just watching and
seeing these things that

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.880
are happening that you
recognize that people

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.102
are changing the way we
do things right here.

00:32:33.102 --> 00:32:34.560
And I think Cirque
is the same way.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.930
When I walk into the
wardrobe department

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.210
and I see the wardrobe with
the technical department

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.370
and they have this
beautiful dress that they're

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.500
creating that will bloom
in front of an artist--

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.180
the audiences eyes.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.270
That's very exciting.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.140
I think it's just about
forward innovation

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.080
and not trying to outdo
ourselves, but keep

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.827
pushing the envelope.

00:32:53.827 --> 00:32:55.410
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So for each of you--

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.290
and if you don't have an
answer, that's OK-- but is there

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.120
something you've
been itching to do,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.100
like some element
you want to introduce

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.950
or some direction you want
to take Cirque that you're

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.490
willing to share with us now?

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.090
And if you'd rather surprise us
next year, we'll wait and see.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.540
But is there something
that's personal for you

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.540
that you want to
sort of see happen?

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.970
BERNARD PETIOT: From a human
performance perspective,

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:23.410
which is my core
responsibility, there

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.680
is a part of that integration
of all of the illusion world

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.210
and the technological world
and the human performers

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.530
that actually we're
pushing to another level,

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.550
and especially with the
show that is coming up

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:41.280
in Orlando soon
with Walt Disney,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.830
I think we will have something
that will be surprising.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.600
OK, so you were all
invited to go there.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.510
I think we've pushed it--

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.990
the frontier of some
of the performances.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.120
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Exciting.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.370
RON KELLUM: For me,
it's very personal.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:00.720
I feel like we've gotten
so far in innovation, which

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.220
is very exciting all of us.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.710
And we were led
by our smartphones

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:05.710
and all of those things.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.550
And when I go to a concert
or I go to an experience,

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.730
I recognize that we're really
quick to pick up our phones

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.679
and capture the moment.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.580
For me, as a baby
of the theater,

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.020
I love when people put
them down and they're

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.797
impacted by what we do.

00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:22.380
So on a personal
level, I want to help

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.460
keep creating theater, a
circus, that is pulling people

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.290
in and away from
their technology,

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.320
while experiencing technology
right in front of them and art

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.280
come together.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.102
That's sort of my own
personal sort of ambition.

00:34:35.102 --> 00:34:36.060
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.280
I think, as I understand
it, that's one

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.830
of the themes of "Volta" is
a little bit how technology

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.650
can become a barrier
towards human connection.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.150
It's something we
think about a lot

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.590
here in terms of digital health.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.510
We both create the
phones, but we also

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.810
want to create the tools that
let people use them responsibly

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.239
and interact at a
very human level.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:57.150
So we very much resonate
with that mission.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:01.560
And we're appreciative of
the work that you're doing.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.560
We're going to turn it
over to some questions

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.310
from the audience.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.630
And you know how we do it here.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.340
There's mics in both aisles.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.190
And in order to be efficient,
it would be helpful

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:12.570
if you guys could line up.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:14.310
Start thinking
about what questions

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.360
you might want to ask.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.110
And as we do that, we will
invite some of the performers

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.150
back up on stage to do
that in just a minute.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.930
But before we do that,
is there anything else

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.690
that you guys would want us
to know about your process,

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.500
about Cirque, about anything
we've talked about here that we

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.190
didn't touch on?

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.820
BERNARD PETIOT:
From my perspective,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.840
I think I have to
commend the work that

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.252
is done with the artistic
director and the whole cast

00:35:43.252 --> 00:35:44.710
when they are
actually on the road,

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.950
because that first step that we
do in creating the show which

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:52.360
is contained in terms
of time and money

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.600
then is being after
that supported,

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.650
let's see, for 10
years as an example.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.980
And then you have this
the surrounding system

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.140
that is supporting
the individual

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.300
and creating the best
possible environment,

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.830
either from a
training perspective,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.090
from a performance
medicine perspective,

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:13.036
from a performance safety,
and then from an artistic eye.

00:36:13.036 --> 00:36:16.780
I think that's one of
the thing that it's

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.890
important to understand all of
this effort that is being done

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.440
in order to allow
these performers to be

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.440
at their best every
day, considering

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.622
there is a lot of variability
and the show is never the same.

00:36:29.622 --> 00:36:30.580
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.880
I really, again, draw
parallels to Google.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.610
We work really hard to
make an experience which

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.120
is effortless and seamless and
instant and magical for you.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.130
Behind the scenes,
there's so much

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.380
work that goes into
creating something

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.600
so delightful and simple.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.150
So we definitely
appreciate all that you do

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.590
and all that the performers
do to make that possible.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.930
Ron, anything you want to add?

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.055
RON KELLUM: Yeah, you know,
and thank you, Bernard.

00:36:55.055 --> 00:36:59.290
I think when you see
these amazing artists,

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.020
their level of commitment
is unbelievable.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.910
I mean, they're world class.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.220
And when we find them and
they come into this culture,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.810
we really try to create this
family, this level of support.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.960
If you were ever to come
backstage at one of our shows,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.100
I'm always amazed that after
a show, or maybe two shows,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.610
it will be 10:30, 11:00 at night
and these artists are still

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.050
training.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.230
It's unbelievable.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.160
They will walk right off
stage with our coaching team

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.980
and in real time on
the playback watch

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.800
their performance
and self-evaluate.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.290
That level of commitment
and dedication,

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.350
week after week, I think that
so often we get caught up

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.470
in the performance of the
show and we walk away from it

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.300
and we got wowed by it.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.510
But there's a real stamina
and a real dedication

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.733
that I think we sometimes
forget because we

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:49.900
might make it look too easy.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.067
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Is that
sort of a practice you do,

00:37:52.067 --> 00:37:54.850
a post-mortem, sort of review
the show, see what worked,

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:55.922
what didn't?

00:37:55.922 --> 00:37:56.880
RON KELLUM: Absolutely.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.380
But you know, it's driven by
the artists, believe it or not.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.530
Our job is to manage and
maintain show quality.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.810
But their commitment is--

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.540
they actually push
us, their expectation

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.680
and what they need to deliver.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.887
And they are frustrated
if we-- for example,

00:38:11.887 --> 00:38:13.720
we were in San Francisco
a couple months ago

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.210
and we had high winds,
and to the point

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.000
that we have safety
protocol in the big top

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.220
that when those gale force
winds, if they get up

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.880
to 60 miles an hour, we have
to decide, are we going to cut?

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.320
The artists want to keep going.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.990
They have that show
must go on reality.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.060
And our job is to help support,
while at the same time protect.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.410
So it's a fascinating dichotomy
that we're working with.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:35.840
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.640
Wow.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.110
Let's invite the
artists back up.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:54.901 --> 00:38:56.526
RON KELLUM: You want
to introduce them?

00:38:56.526 --> 00:38:57.460
SPEAKER: OK.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.352
Hello, guys.

00:38:58.352 --> 00:38:59.060
Nice to meet you.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.940
We are skippers from "Volta."

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.080
How was our act?

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.502
You guys enjoy?

00:39:04.502 --> 00:39:08.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.420
Thank you very much.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.962
We are from Japan,
some are from Japan.

00:39:12.962 --> 00:39:15.420
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Anyone--
well, they're watching on video.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.440
SPEAKER: Oh, that's all?

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:21.990
Thank you.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.090
RON KELLUM: OK, great.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.460
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Do you have
names you want to share or not?

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.440
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.850
My name is [NON-ENGLISH].

00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:34.100
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Cool.

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.930
Thank you.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.100
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.987
Nice to meet you.

00:39:37.987 --> 00:39:40.070
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK, let's
get to some questions.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.413
Green mic first.

00:39:41.413 --> 00:39:43.580
AUDIENCE: One topic of
conversation always at Google

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.240
is trust--

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.220
trust with our users,
trust with our peers,

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.200
trust with our executive.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.240
Unless I miss my
guess, trust is sort of

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.970
fundamental to the Circus world.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:56.600
Are there things that
you do within the family

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.300
to help you build trust,
either at the head office

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.800
or on the road,
things like that?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:07.480
Like, are there tricks that
you use or things that you do?

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.700
BERNARD PETIOT: Maybe I
can talk with that process

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.760
that we use when we're
developing an act.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.010
I'll take it as an example.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:17.177
You know the teeter board,
you know where the people

00:40:17.177 --> 00:40:21.250
are bouncing from both sides.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.740
In Montreal, I am
in charge of what

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.390
we call the training before
they actually go on the show.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:30.620
So we are inviting people coming
from the trampoline world.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.640
And we could have
maybe people coming

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.300
from France, from the US,
from Russia and et cetera,

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.930
and they will meet
together right there.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:44.140
And then they have
to work together.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.980
And teeter board is
a very dangerous act.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.930
So what we do in order to
make sure that actually we

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:58.900
create that trust is we go step
by step in terms of processes,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.120
having them to go through
all of the basics,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.120
all of the language.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.330
We also provide--

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.630
I may have two or
three translator

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.890
there to provide the appropriate
communication between all

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.850
of them.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.640
I will have an artistic
coach, an acrobatic coach

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.080
at the same time surrounding the
entire environment to make sure

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.370
that they develop their own
dialogue and communication

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.825
and they understand each other
in terms of who should do what

00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:33.940
and when and what kind of
reaction they should have.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.570
And they will go through weeks
of training and developing

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:38.200
that.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.080
And then step by step,
OK, then the coach

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.360
will step back, step
back, and then transfer

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.580
that responsibility
of the group to manage

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.300
the performance, to
dialogue between themselves,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.720
to brief and debrief.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.170
And that's what
Ron was saying is

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.140
we develop, also, that
debriefing culture

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.710
as part of the process.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:59.510
So then when the
performance is done,

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.590
then they will revise it, look
at the video and the replay,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.310
and then talk about
it and self evaluate.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.780
RON KELLUM: Trust is number one.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.610
I mean, it's
unbelievable how critical

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.470
these checks and balances are.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.120
And we take them daily.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.440
For example, when we have to
put a new artist into the show,

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.670
they will never come to
us and go right on stage.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.605
We have to do a full show
validation in the reality

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:26.230
that they're going
to be performing in.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.315
Just a change of the lights
can change their world.

00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:30.940
And if they don't
understand that, they

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.640
haven't had a chance
to prepare, it

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.720
can become a challenge for them.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.590
So absolutely.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:39.480
And that's how we build that
into our systems and balance.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.050
Yeah.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.590
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH].

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:43.923
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: This is a
slightly different question,

00:42:43.923 --> 00:42:47.920
but these artists who are at
the top of their game and rock

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.960
stars in their
respective disciplines,

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.200
sometimes rock stars can
develop rock star attitudes

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.302
and be a little bit
diva-like or Prima Donna.

00:42:56.302 --> 00:43:01.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.210
Have you ever-- like, do you
have to work on that, too?

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:07.720
Like, have you asked
people to leave that can't

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.820
get with the family--

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.600
we all have strange
uncles, but is

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.560
that part of this, sort of
making sure that people really

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.110
do have the right attitude,
as well as the right talent?

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.000
RON KELLUM: That is a
key part of the job,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.360
as well, is really maintaining
the family environment,

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.680
that there is no--

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.180
if you think about
Cirque de Soleil,

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.855
there is no name other than Guy.

00:43:30.855 --> 00:43:31.730
You know what I mean?

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.780
You don't hear of the
artist performing in--

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.970
Cirque is the stars.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.540
Cirque is the brand.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.030
We want the artists to
understand that we all

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.870
bring a contribution to it.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:45.460
And there are times that
some artists can't fit inside

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.560
of this bubble.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.277
And we respect that
because we always

00:43:48.277 --> 00:43:50.110
encourage people to
find where your light is

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.700
going to shine the brightest.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.590
That's the most important thing.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.870
If it doesn't feel
like it's bright here,

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:58.300
we will support you in finding
that place that's right.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.236
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That is a
great way to give feedback.

00:44:00.236 --> 00:44:00.736
Thank you.

00:44:00.736 --> 00:44:01.736
We're going to use that.

00:44:01.736 --> 00:44:03.778
BERNARD PETIOT: It's a
very interesting question,

00:44:03.778 --> 00:44:05.830
because if-- and I look
at the casting at large,

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.372
we've got circus
professionals, we've

00:44:07.372 --> 00:44:11.190
got people coming from the arts,
singing, dancers, and musicians

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.690
and so on.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.190
But we also have more than
30% coming from sport.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:18.112
And from sport you
want to be the best.

00:44:18.112 --> 00:44:19.320
You want to be on the podium.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.240
So when you leave
that culture and you

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.000
come to our
environment, then you're

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.620
becoming part of that family.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.640
So you're engaged to
develop that ability

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.970
to actually sort of
personally disappear and be

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:35.710
a contributor to the show.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.980
And we ensure that
this process is also

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.973
part of what we do in
Montreal to make sure

00:44:40.973 --> 00:44:42.890
that these people that
we are coming with that

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.240
see gold medal at
Worlds or Olympics,

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.090
they will put that here.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.390
And now they will adopt the
culture of Cirque du Soleil.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.525
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Amazing.

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:55.660
OK, yellow mic.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.672
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you for
coming and talking to us.

00:44:58.672 --> 00:45:00.130
I was wondering,
how much time does

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.130
it take from the time
you conceptualize

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.470
a show to the time it opens?

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.320
And within that time
period, how much time

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.810
is spent in choreography and
training and things like that?

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:17.340
BERNARD PETIOT: It could take
from the initial team and then

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.100
the selection of
the stage director

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.370
and a couple of other creators,
the director of creation

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:27.450
and so on, from
two to three years.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.000
Then that is
basically developing

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.070
from the idea the whole concept,
and through that journey,

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:38.640
is also identifying, OK,
the different profiles

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.352
of artists that will be needed.

00:45:41.352 --> 00:45:43.560
And then, so that we can
proceed through the casting,

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.600
because casting
takes a long time.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:50.970
And sometimes also it's also
being influenced by immigration

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.338
and all sorts of obstacles.

00:45:53.338 --> 00:45:55.380
And then after that, we
have the training period.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.297
The training period,
let's see, as an example,

00:45:57.297 --> 00:46:00.270
the big top that we will
be producing in April,

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:04.200
then we started the training
period last September,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.030
last year in 2018.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:11.550
And then from fall to December,
then we only did the training.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.030
And at the same time,
then the costume

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.110
were designed,
developed, and so on,

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.390
and all sorts of other
technical aspects

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.650
were developed, and
equipment, and so on.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:23.460
And then January, then
you start the rehearsal.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.730
And the rehearsal
continues up to the moment

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:31.200
that we transfer in April,
in March, under the big top.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.900
And that whole rehearsal
is being done in Montreal,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.333
in a big, big studio.

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:36.750
That's so we could
do that inside,

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.590
because it's cold in Montreal.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.080
And then after that,
we transfer in April.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.750
And then we will be
opening, let's see,

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:48.125
this new show
"Allegria" by mid-April.

00:46:48.125 --> 00:46:49.500
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Great question.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.540
Yes, green mic.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.580
AUDIENCE: I watched
the show last Saturday.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.980
It was amazing.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.380
So I have a question.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.010
So I remember in the
show there is an artist,

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.500
I think her name is Danila Kim.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.630
She was dancing along on
the stage with her hair tied

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.400
and the hand on top.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.630
That part was very different
from the rest of show.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.580
So from the perspective
of storytelling,

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.400
could you help me understand
how this part fits

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.410
the rest of the story?

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.450
RON KELLUM: I don't know
if I got the question.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.033
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
From the perspective

00:47:23.033 --> 00:47:24.900
of sort storytelling,
how does that element

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.340
fit in with the
rest of the show?

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.300
Because she found it
to be very different.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.300
RON KELLUM: I love that
you asked that question.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.240
The idea, the
conceptor is always

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.660
thinking, for us as
individuals, we put on a mask

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.560
or we put on our armor every day
when we walk out of the door.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.230
And the goal is,
take off the armor.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:44.700
Take off your mask.

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.673
And then fly higher.

00:47:46.673 --> 00:47:48.840
So when we get to the part
of the show with the hair

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.690
suspension, it's all
about fly as high

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.830
as you can and let it sort feel
like you're in outer space,

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:57.570
where there is no gravity.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.797
You know, that's the
idea of hair suspension.

00:47:59.797 --> 00:48:00.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:01.500
RON KELLUM: Did that help?

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.156
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:02.156 --> 00:48:04.590
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Beautiful.

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:05.220
Yes.

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.928
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:48:06.928 --> 00:48:09.900
I can imagine with the degree
that safety is important

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.900
and the degree that all of this
is transpiling in front of us

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:15.720
live that it can be
very difficult to make

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.988
the go or no go call.

00:48:16.988 --> 00:48:18.780
And that's something
that the general stage

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.540
manager, the performer, is
that ever a difficult thing

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.420
with this feeling of
the show must go on

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.520
to be able to negotiate
what is possible

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.150
and what's impossible as things
go, as people miss tricks,

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:32.950
as people say, I can
do it the next time?

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.080
RON KELLUM: Great question.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.430
100%.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.620
There is that moment
where we all have

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.970
to make a collective decision.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.630
And I always say more
heads together are better,

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.930
because when we get to those
moments where it can be

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.250
we've pushed too hard.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.140
Fatigue could be setting in.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.920
Or the environment that we're
in just not sustainable, we do

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.090
have to make that decision.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.835
The show does not go on.

00:48:55.835 --> 00:48:57.210
It's something
that we don't like

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.940
to do because we respect
that our audiences come

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.240
from all over to see a
Cirque de Soleil show.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.300
We respect that many times,
when someone comes to our show,

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.780
it's for a 50 year wedding
anniversary, a birthday

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.440
celebration.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.240
They're very
special moments what

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.190
gets people under the big top.

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.820
So we want to deliver.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.420
But at the end of the day,
safety, safety, safety.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.510
And we take that into
consideration every day.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.260
BERNARD PETIOT: And
the phase of creation,

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.400
it's interesting, also, of the
safety management, especially

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.960
when we create an act.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.480
We will develop the equipment.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.190
The equipment will be
tested, engineered,

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:34.140
and then we'll also
develop the act

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:39.180
by selecting what
is sub-maximal.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.390
We're not in a competition.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:45.360
So we're not trying to
do the one best one time.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.550
We're making sure
that the content

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.130
is being selected so that
it's within the resource

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.610
of that individual.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.110
And then we will also
test these over time

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.080
to ensure that when it's
integrated in the act, then

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.520
it will be sustained.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.620
So in fact, I
mean, your question

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:03.790
is very, very interesting.

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.270
And it's a preoccupation
of mine right

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.950
from the onset of creation.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:11.470
How far should we push?

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.970
Obviously, we're doing circus.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:16.280
So there is a risk there.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.120
And then we're creating
every processes

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.210
that is possible to ensure that
not only we select people that

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.670
are really good from
the onset, but also we

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:27.550
make all the progression
and the steps

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.220
to verify and validate
these performances

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.860
under various circumstances
up to the show

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.670
condition with lighting
and music, and so on.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:38.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.173
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Yes, green mic.

00:50:40.173 --> 00:50:41.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for coming out.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.110
My question is, when there's
a creative difference

00:50:44.110 --> 00:50:46.725
or disagreement, how
do you resolve it?

00:50:46.725 --> 00:50:48.100
BERNARD PETIOT:
First of all, you

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.410
have to look at the globality.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.660
So we are inviting
these creators

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:54.880
to come in Cirque du
Soliel, but we're also

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.240
assigning what we call
a director of creation.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.640
This person is to
manage the environment

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.140
and manage that dialogue.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:06.200
And sometimes this tension,
it's not nice every day.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.320
There's sometimes all
of these tensions.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.150
And eventually, this group will
have to come up to an agreement

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:14.260
or take an option.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.890
Obviously, the stage
director has a lot of power

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.580
because he wants to protect
the basic or the intent.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.360
On my side, I have an equipment
designer and a performance

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.020
designer.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:30.470
And as soon as it steps
into the exposure of risk,

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:32.950
which could be life
threatening, then that's

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.620
where the buck stops.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.630
And so then it will be a no no.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.180
Everything else after that
is open for discussion,

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.430
open for dialogue,
open for conversation.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.950
And obviously, as you go
up to the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:52.090
there will be time by which then
you realize that this is not

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.730
possible, or this
could be dangerous,

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.540
or this will not render what
you're looking at in terms

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:02.132
of the expectation
of performance.

00:52:02.132 --> 00:52:04.590
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Just in terms
of decision making process,

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.660
do you have a
traditional hierarchy?

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.340
Or do you have a whole-ocracy?

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.000
Is there someone whose job it is
to make a call about what's in,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.530
what's out?

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.960
Like, that's well-defined
and established?

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.210
BERNARD PETIOT: Somewhat,
although it has a little bit

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.860
of a holistic approach.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:24.120
When it was [NON-ENGLISH]
as the sole owner,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.430
I would have to say to being
present that he would say, OK,

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.570
I will give you
another three weeks.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:36.790
And if you don't convince me,
then that's the end of it.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:38.812
Now that has changed
a little bit.

00:52:38.812 --> 00:52:40.270
[NON-ENGLISH] is
not there anymore.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:45.540
So the director of creation is
exercising that responsibility.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.990
And then eventually
the executive producer

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:51.368
may at some point
also exercise that.

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:52.410
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Got it.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.650
OK, we have time maybe for
one or two more questions.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:58.320
I wanted to prioritize if
anyone has any questions

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.700
for the performers.

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:03.060
We didn't just bring you up here
to look at you, although we do

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.217
enjoy looking at you, as well.

00:53:05.217 --> 00:53:07.050
But if there's a question
for the performer,

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.008
could you come forward?

00:53:08.008 --> 00:53:10.363
Yes, please.

00:53:10.363 --> 00:53:11.030
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.890
Thank you for coming
out here today.

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:16.130
I'm very curious kind of in the
process of developing your act

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.500
or in training
this act, was there

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.390
a particular
difficulty or a story

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.360
that you'd like to share about
kind of where you ran into kind

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.850
of a crossroads and you had
to make a decision, how you

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.340
overcame that to create the
wonderful performance you had

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.620
today?

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.630
SPEAKER: We are kind of
like new skipping team.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.090
We have been together
for two years.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:39.080
Then we have a specific
trick each other.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.740
Then we create the
act, what you can do,

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.380
what you want to do in our act.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.000
Then we talk each other.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.920
Then we-- that's important
is how we connect each other.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.940
Like, we use the ropes.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.840
Then how are you turning?

00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.340
That's a very important.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:06.840
If someone is slowly and faster,
we cannot jump in the ropes.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.828
That's the very hardest point.

00:54:10.828 --> 00:54:13.120
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So the main
problem is the damn rope.

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.680
OK, I think we have
time for one more.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.658
Yes, please.

00:54:19.658 --> 00:54:20.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.300
This is-- thank you
very much for visiting.

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:25.840
I have a casting question
that's mainly for Bernard.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.960
I'm wondering, when you see
a performance, whether it's

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.520
on YouTube or in person or
whatever other venue, what

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.020
makes you think that maybe that
person would make a good Cirque

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.740
Du Soleil performer?

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.830
And at that point, do
you have a job interview?

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:42.680
Or what happens?

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.882
Like, how does that happen?

00:54:43.882 --> 00:54:45.340
BERNARD PETIOT:
That's interesting.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.350
That's a really good question.

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:51.790
Basically, the way I will
answer is within my casting team

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:55.690
I've got scouts that are
specialized in various areas,

00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:59.590
either be in dance or
in musicians or singers,

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:00.710
and so on.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.840
If they see
something on YouTube,

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.320
then two things will
come to their head.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:09.280
One is, would I select
that person because

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.580
of what is being done
reaches that level

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.920
that I'm looking for?

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.370
Then they're more in a selection
mode based on their specialty,

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.650
so I've got people
specialized in trampoline,

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.290
in tumbling, in
acro, and et cetera.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:26.580
So they'll take that decision,
or they will look at that

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.750
and they will say--
they will basically

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:30.940
because of their education
and their background,

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.490
they'll say there is
an indication here

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:36.370
that there is a
potential that if we were

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:40.960
to tap into what I see, that
we could eventually push it

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.610
further.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.940
So they are going to be
more on a detection mode.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.400
And then when they are
in the detection mode,

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.100
they will present that to
the new creative group.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.610
Or then we will venture
on our own decision

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:57.730
to meet these people,
to spend time with them,

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:01.600
to get to know them better,
and to look at any opportunity

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.000
to venture or
collaborate together,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.265
so that because of the
indication of the potential

00:56:07.265 --> 00:56:09.850
or the detection
of that possibility

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:12.820
that we can eventually
venture and develop something

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.507
with them.

00:56:13.507 --> 00:56:15.340
RON KELLUM: I would
just add one last thing,

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.757
because this
happened in real time

00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:19.400
and I love how our worlds
are colliding today.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:26.080
So then Bernard's team will then
send me a particular profile.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.580
So I'm looking to replace
an artist right now.

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.980
So I get them, they're
uploaded onto a platform,

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.210
sometimes YouTube.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.440
But yesterday, in real time.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.210
I talked to three
different artists--

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:41.290
one in Tel Aviv, one
in London, and one

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.050
in New York, all on Google
Chat, because all I got to see

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:45.470
was their performance.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.200
So we asked them,
can you jump on?

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.630
In 30 minutes, I
was able to identify

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:51.340
who my next candidate would be.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.673
So that's how we're working
together, which I love it.

00:56:53.673 --> 00:56:55.340
I didn't even think
about that till now.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:56.423
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Awesome.

00:56:56.423 --> 00:56:58.690
On that note, there's
sort of one group

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:00.310
of people I'd like
to thank before we

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.760
thank Cirque, which is our
own behind the scenes staff.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.330
This magic of scheduling this
event and lighting this event

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:09.800
and producing this event
doesn't happen by accident.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.940
So let's take a moment to thank
the people behind the scenes

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.930
at Talks at Google.

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:17.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:22.420
And most of all, let's
thank the amazing performers

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:25.540
and production team and
executives of Cirque Du Soleil

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.765
for doing what you do,
not only for coming here,

00:57:27.765 --> 00:57:29.390
but for doing what
you do in the world.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:30.490
Thank you so much.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.090
BERNARD PETIOT:
Thank you very much.

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.007
RON KELLUM: Thank you.

00:57:32.007 --> 00:57:35.340
[APPLAUSE]
