JASON SILVA: So we
talk a lot about how

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.150
we want the answer, right?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.949
We're bliss junkies,
chasing the ultimate truth.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:22.740
But think about it.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.650
Aren't we more happy when
we're seeking the truth?

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.220
Aren't we all secretly
wonder junkies?

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.540
Isn't our addiction to the
question itself, you know?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.996
Once you find the answer,
you risk completion.

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:40.370
You know, we talk about
wanting to find ourselves.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.780
We talk about being found, but
isn't it more fun to get lost?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.410
Aren't we all
wanderers, ultimately?

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.180
Aren't we wandering,
aren't we seeking?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.290
Why do we love open spaces?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.098
Why do open spaces
have more appeal

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:58.540
than beautiful,
cozy, small spaces?

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.460
Why do we look at
the infinite ocean

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.840
and actually feel a sense
of reverence and awe?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760
Instead of being
afraid, we look at it

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.200
as it beckons us to the
unknown, to the mystery,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.540
to the question.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.590
See, that's what it's
really all about.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.170
That is the state
of consciousness

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.640
that we want to be at, right?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.230
We want to be the traveler
in search of signification.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.780
When you find, it's
over, you know?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.110
it's not about the answers,
it's about the better questions.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.432
You know that quote,
and that's really it.

00:01:27.432 --> 00:01:29.265
That's what I'm looking
for in these spaces.

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:33.300
That's the JASON and the ring
landscape, New Zealand brochure

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.560
fantasy.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550
I'm getting lost in it, right?

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.522
Hm.

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:44.060
Only when we're
lost, we're found.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.750
All right, guys, so
be sure to check out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.530
our sister network, Seeker,
where we explore travel,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.420
adventure, culture, and amazing
stories from around the globe.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.030
As human beings, exploring
is in our nature.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.905
We want to learn and
discover until we

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:01.410
are able to better
comprehend not

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.770
only the world, but ourselves.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.820
What is without becomes within.
