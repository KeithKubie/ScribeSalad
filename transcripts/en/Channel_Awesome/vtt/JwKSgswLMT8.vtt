00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.580
It's ironic that Disney decided not to do any more of the "Fantasia" series, because for the next couple of films,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
they'd be trying endlessly to try and recreate it.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.860
"Make Mine Music" was probably the first attempt to try and do that.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.580
It follows sort of a similar formula to what "Three Caballeros" was doing:

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.900
Just tying together a series of shorts with a certain kind of music.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.440
Although "Three Caballeros," where they had a character at least tying the stories together, though loosely--this one, they just show the shorts.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.260
Again, much like "Fantasia."

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
Except the music isn't classical music; it's more music that was popular at the time.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
In fact, some of it, if I understand correctly, was left over from "Fantasia."

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.840
The animation for "Blue Bayou" actually makes it into this one, which was originally supposed to be featured in a sequel to "Fantasia."

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.940
Except instead of using the classical music, they used a song instead.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
Later, the original would be released on DVD, and it's a lot better.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.220
"Make Mine Music" is probably closer to what "Three Caballeros" was trying to be:

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.140
sort of a fun series of short stories that are very loosely tied together with one theme.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.660
In this one--you guessed it--it's music.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.200
Though some classical does make it in--for example, we do have "Peter and the Wolf"--though it does have a narrator as well, but it works okay.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.760
We also have a short that really seems to have nothing to do with music.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.940
Remember the cartoon "Mighty Casey Up to Bat"?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.760
Yeah, it's from this. It's a great story and it's hilarious, but what's it have to do with music?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.100
Is talking and rhyming really the same?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.020
Well, however you want to take it, it's still great to watch.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.060
Here, the short stories work a lot better. Some just create atmosphere, others tell a full narrative.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.160
And they're all pretty solid; I can't think of any part I particularly didn't like.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:48.040
Favorite moments include "Casey;" again, "Peter and the Wolf;" by far, my favorite is the singing whale with all the singing voices done by one person throughout the entire thing.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.660
That is awesome.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.680
- [singing] "For whoever heard of an operatic whale?"

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.680
-[singing] "I don't believe it!"

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.400
-[singing] "I don't believe it."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I know a lot of people probably haven't seen this cartoon, so uh, not giving anything away, let's just say that sad face? Yeah, big clue.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.280
It's another one of those bittersweet moments that probably leaves a few kids confused.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.840
But I like that.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.840
It wasn't totally sad, but it's definitely not happy either.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.180
And on top of that, you're getting some great music.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.720
And one hell of a great singer.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.560
Modern to classic to jazz...they cover a pretty impressive gambit.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.720
And while nothing hits quite as potent as "Fantasia" does, it is still pretty enjoyable.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.500
This is another example of a bunch of cartoons that were taken from this movie and then chopped up into shorts.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.860
And there's a reason. They work really well.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.940
So, if you ever want to see 'em all together, check this movie out.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.500
It's a good one.
