00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.440
ADAM SKOLNICK: Dean's Blue Hole.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.580
Long Island, Bahamas.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.020
November 17th, 2013.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.636
The warm Atlantic sloshed
in Nicholas Mobley's ears

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.260
as he floated into
the competition zone

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.960
at Dean's Blue Hole.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.460
He looked calm, but
appearances can be deceiving.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.090
When Vertical Blue
kicked off, he

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.680
had ambitions for a bronze medal
and two more American records.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.900
Yet after a year of
intense preparation,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.229
and winning an overall gold
in another competition only

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.350
weeks earlier, plus silver at
the world championship a month

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
before that, he proceeded
to flub every single dive

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.900
that week.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.805
This was the Wimbledon
of freediving.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:43.930
Aside from Worlds, it was
the only competition that

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.270
mattered to him and most
others in the sport,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.960
and Nick was out of juice.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.700
Every muscle in his body hurt.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.980
Even his lungs hurt.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.740
But he wasn't about to give up.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.380
It was game day and
he was preparing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.360
to descend to 72
meters, or 240 feet,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480
and back on a single breath.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.246
Six minutes, announced
Sam Trubridge,

00:01:02.246 --> 00:01:03.620
a theater director
from Auckland,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.270
New Zealand, and the older
brother of William Trubridge,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.350
the greatest
freediver of them all.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.540
Standing on the
platform, Sam loomed

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.110
over Nick, who lay on his back
clipped to the competition

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.120
line.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.570
His eyes stayed mostly closed,
but when he opened them,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.660
they flashed with focus
and determination.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.220
The competition
zone was delineated

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.180
by a set of white PVC pipes
that formed a six meter

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.220
square within the
dark blue of the hole.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.240
Inside were a photographer, a
videographer, and three judges,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.180
including lead
judge Grant Graves,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.280
one of the longest tenured
professionals in the sport.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.150
Also within the zone were
five safety divers, clad

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
in long bi-fins led
by Nick's friend

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.300
Ren Chapman, a former
college baseball

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.265
star from Wilmington,
North Carolina.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:47.870
It was the safety divers job to
meet the athletes once they'd

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.000
reached a depth of 30
meters while ascending

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.194
from their dive.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.860
That's where pressure
underwater shifts,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330
and where lactic acid build up,
and hypoxia, or lack of oxygen,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.352
can begin to cause problems.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.810
Clinging to the
floating boundaries

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.510
were a handful of fans and
several of Nick's rivals.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.030
Folks like Mike Board,
44, the UK record holder,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.950
and a former royal marine.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.540
Half Chinese, half-English,
six feet tall and all muscle.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.250
Mike patrolled the infamous
Baghdad Airport Road

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030
as a private military
contractor during the Iraq war.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.334
And earned good money
dodging suicide attacks

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:21.250
and ferrying high dollar
clients to the safety

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.710
of the green zone.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.830
Afterwards he used his earnings
to build a flourishing freedive

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.180
center in Indonesia's Gili
islands, which enabled

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.870
him to train year round.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.970
In terms of global
standing within the sport,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.620
Mike and Nick were among the
elite national record holders,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.450
and both hoped to be contending
for a world record soon.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.220
Also in the water
was Junko Kitahama,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.410
another national record
holder from Japan.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.782
She watched him carefully.

00:02:43.782 --> 00:02:45.740
Their conversation on
the beach had thrown her,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.260
and she was worried.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.640
Five minutes.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.337
So were his friends and family.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.920
They were aware that
Nick was hurting,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.919
and they also knew that
when others took breaks,

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.450
he doubled down on training.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.140
While many kept a less
ambitious competition schedule,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.037
Nick Mobley took every
opportunity to dive.

00:03:02.037 --> 00:03:04.370
That's what made him the best
American freediver in less

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.280
than two years of competition.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.350
But mulling past victories
wasn't going to help him now.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.390
Frustrated, he
clenched his eyes tight

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.150
to silence his brain speak.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.120
To switch off and calm down.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.470
He took a cleansing
breath and leaned back.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.610
Submerging his face, stimulating
the nerves around his eyes,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.050
and sparking the
mammalian dive reflex,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.670
a physiological response
that, if developed,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.040
helped an average
man become Aquaman.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.930
Capable of freediving
to unheard of depths

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.950
for minutes at a
time, without feeling

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.210
any anxiety, or the
slightest urge to breathe.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.440
Four minutes.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.480
He inhaled long and slow
and exhaled twice as slow,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.770
twice as calm.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.300
Each time purging his system
of negativity and carbon

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.640
dioxide, the buildup of which
spurs that urge to breathe

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.570
and can turn a relaxed, peaceful
adventure into excruciating

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.600
toil.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.930
If a stray bolt of fear
bloomed in his mind,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.946
he'd slow its breath
down even more.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:56.820
That was the only way
to lower his heart rate

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.630
and keep his demons at bay.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.810
Three minutes.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.530
He knew them well, his demons.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.330
They had trailed
him his entire life.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.590
They fueled him.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.610
His broken home.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.210
His feelings of inadequacy.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.600
His frustration with a society
attuned to greed and waste,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.150
what drove him into the
water in the first place.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.750
They also blessed him
with uncommon generosity.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.950
On land, Nick wasn't the fierce
competitor he was on the line.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.290
And beneath all of that anxiety,
pain and loss, brain chatter,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.170
and sea water
sloshing in his ears,

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.890
he knew something else, too.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.350
He had one more
dive left in him,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.850
and he was going
to tear that Velcro

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.290
tag from the bottom plate, come
up clean, and claim his record.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.520
Two minutes.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.896
He visualized the dive.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.520
Something his friend
William Trubridge,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.330
a 15 time world record holder,
and owner of Vertical Blue,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.830
taught him when
they roomed together

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.610
during the Caribbean Cup in
Honduras, the previous May.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.360
Where Nick made the
dive of his life,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.840
and became the first American
to swim the 100 meters

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.870
on a single breath.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.580
He used a monofin that day.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.530
On Sunday, November
17th, he would

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.340
dive without fins, which
ratcheted up the difficulty

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.800
several degrees.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.360
Will stood on the beach,
barefoot as usual,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.270
watching Nick breathe up.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.890
Typically he stayed away from
the hole when he wasn't diving,

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.850
but he didn't miss Nick's dives.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.330
Nobody in the history of the
sport had gotten to 100 meters

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.780
so fast, and Will knew he was
witnessing someone special.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.290
Someone capable of breaking
world records one day.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.210
And going deeper than
any human had before.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.440
One minute.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.105
As the clock ticked
below 30 seconds,

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:23.480
Nick's breathing
pattern changed,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.720
and he began sipping
the air, attempting

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.304
to fill his lungs to the limit.

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:28.970
From the depth of his
diaphragm to those

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.010
little used air pockets between
and behind the shoulder blades.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.310
And in so doing,
pack as much oxygen

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.940
into his system as possible.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.079
He would need it.

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.370
If all went according to plan
he wouldn't breathe again

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.924
for nearly three minutes.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.090
Dean's Blue Hole bloomed
out of the freediving scene

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.550
in 2005, when Will began
living and training there.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.150
At the time, he was not yet
a champion, but an aspirant.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.830
Frustrated by the
lack of accessibility

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.480
to deep water and
good conditions

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.070
on a consistent basis.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.100
He found both on
Long Island, Bahamas,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.870
and within a few short years
he became one of the best,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.320
if not the best
freediver on earth.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.580
Freedivers soon flocked
to train alongside him,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.130
and those that were
instructors, brought students.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.929
That's how Nick
found it in 2012,

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:10.970
when he was about to come
out of nowhere to break

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.180
his first American record.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.300
81 miles long, but less than
four miles across at its widest

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.830
point, Long Island is
splayed like a twisted egg

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.840
noodle between the
frothing blue Atlantic

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.345
Ocean, and the placid
turquoise Caribbean Sea.

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:27.000
Etched from limestone
by wind, surf, and rain,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.030
its stubby hills and
plains are blanketed

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.770
in thick tropical scrub.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.230
Rustling with wild
boar and feral cats.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.470
Stitched with mangroves,
and blessed with a series

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.700
of exquisite virgin beaches.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.580
On his maiden voyage in
1492, Christopher Columbus

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.690
navigated the northern
tip of Long Island.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.490
He named it
Fernandina, anchoring

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.990
on the Caribbean
side of what became

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.050
known as Cape Santa Maria.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.960
A single strip of
asphalt leads from there

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.500
towards the southern terminus.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.600
And after about an hour's
drive, in the town of Deans,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.810
a gravel and dirt road branches
east over low lying hills

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.640
and around a bend to Will's
beloved Blue Hole, where

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.280
the wind is almost
always muffled,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.290
and the current ever gentle,
even in stormy weather.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.690
That's because it's sheltered
by a concave semicircle

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.170
of thick limestone that
rises over 50 feet high.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.160
It's insides, grooved with
giant primordial brushstrokes,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.240
are drilled with shallow
caves and punctuated

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.932
by phallic stalactites that
dangle over a sea so dark blue,

00:07:19.932 --> 00:07:21.390
it has no business
being just three

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.000
steps from a silky
white sand beach, where

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.470
Will stood watching.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.070
As the clock wound down
on Nicholas Mobley.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.920
Sam ticked off the seconds.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.880
10.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.050
Nine.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.110
Eight.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.020
When he got to zero,
Nick submerged face first

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.220
with his arms extended.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.990
He looked like a human arrow
shooting into the darkness.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.040
Dean's Blue Hole is an
underwater cavern flip

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.230
vertically, shaped
like a carafe.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.310
As Nick swam, he
passed a rugged reef

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.200
which sprouted from
sloping white sand that

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.730
led to a ring of sheer limestone
10 meters below the surface.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.380
He'd reached the rim
of the hole, where

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.160
sand spilled over the edge in
a series of mesmerizing sand

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.810
falls that look exactly like a
photo negative of a waterfall.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.500
Within five powerful
breast strokes,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.270
those cliff walls receded
beneath a sloped ceiling,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.230
where small schools of giant
tarpon or silver barracuda,

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.070
often hunkered in the shadows.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.820
After another few strokes,
and another 10 meter drop,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.200
there was a second
set of cliffs,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.180
and the walls receded again.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.070
Soon the hole was
darker than midnight,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.150
and about twice as
wide as the entire cove

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.800
appears from the surface.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.840
The rim of the hole has
a 35 meter diameter.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.500
Below 20 meters, the
diameter is estimated

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.110
at more than 150 meters.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.059
Nick had stopped
swimming by then.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.100
His arms at his side,
his chin tucked,

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.590
he became as
streamlined as possible.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.309
It was time to freefall.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.100
The part of a dive that
feels like floating

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.780
through outer space.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.100
He closed his eyes
and surrendered

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.904
to the soft slow
sink into dream time.

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:55.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:57.164 --> 00:08:58.541
That's how the book starts.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.170
And I was at the
Blue Hole that day.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.450
I was there covering Vertical
Blue, the competition,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.617
for the "New York
Times" sports page.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:13.200
It's a roundabout
way how i got there,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.302
but I was there just to
do a mid-week feature.

00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:17.760
There wasn't even really a firm
deadline on the assignment,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.920
it was going to
run at some point

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.740
during the football
playoffs, they were

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.270
going to have this feature.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.730
And when Nick died, obviously it
became something else entirely.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.730
Became breaking news story
for a couple of days,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.670
and ended up all over the world.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.620
It went crazy viral.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.530
Because people are
interested in the sport,

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.145
interested in what
freediving is, I think.

00:09:37.145 --> 00:09:39.610
Not just because it's extreme,
but because it's something

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.770
that we've all tried to do.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.056
So I thought, when Ben
and I met last year,

00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:45.430
and then he started
working here,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.400
I just thought it was a
really great opportunity,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.570
we both did, to talk
about it because it's

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.182
a captivating sport
where people are doing

00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:54.390
things we've all tried to do.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.370
Hold our breath as
long as possible,

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.290
and maybe swim the
length of a pool,

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.890
or kick down when we're
snorkeling to a reef.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.380
And here are people going
deeper than scuba divers can

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.600
go with a tank.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.500
Much deeper.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.732
It's not even close.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.190
And they're doing
it on one breath.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.450
So I thought we'd talk a little
bit about what freediving is.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.210
And Ben can help with
that since he's as much

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.352
a freediver as a Googler.

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.060
BEN: That's true.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.765
I've been freediving
for about eight years

00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:27.890
now, and then scuba diving
for probably eight years

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.690
before that.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.060
It is a very intellectual sport.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.770
You have to do a lot of fine
tuning, and a lot of thinking.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.160
It's mind over matter to
do some of these things

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.240
that you need to do freediving.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.780
I tried, at first,
to teach myself.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.457
I was scuba diving
a lot, and then

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:50.040
on the last day of
a scuba trip you're

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.380
not supposed to dive
and fly on the same day.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.710
So I would go out and snorkel
some of the same reefs,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.762
and see something
30, 40, 50 feet down,

00:10:58.762 --> 00:11:00.220
that I wanted to
go take a look at.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.300
And I'd try to go down,
and I'd get 20 feet down

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.270
and feel like I had to breathe,
and have to turn around.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.061
My ears would hurt.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.111
It was something where there
was more to it than that.

00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:13.610
I knew that some people were
able to do really amazing stuff

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.730
underwater, and I really
wanted to figure that out.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.480
So when the dive shop that
I do my scuba diving with,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.160
Malibu Divers, hosted a
freediving course, just

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:30.290
a weekend course with an outfit
called Performance Freediving,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.740
I signed up for that.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.180
And in one weekend I
doubled my breath hold time,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.360
and I doubled my depth I was
able to get to in the ocean,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.149
and just got completely hooked.

00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:41.690
And so from that
intermediate course,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.460
then I went onto
an advanced course,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.190
and from there went on to do
some local competitions, which

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.230
eventually led to
joining the US team.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.930
And I competed in the
world championships in 2010

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.240
through 2012.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.820
After that was a safety diver
for various competitions,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.860
especially at Vertical Blue.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.690
I was a safety
diver in 2011, 2012.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.650
I actually was supposed to
go 2013, and I missed it.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.190
So I was not there when the
incident with Nick happened.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.720
But I was there in
2014, the year after,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.850
where the safety was suddenly
taken just amazingly seriously.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.335
And we had a
wonderful safety team.

00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:26.710
Grant Graves is
here, by the way.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.310
He was the head judge for a
lot of these competitions,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.540
and has been part of the
sport for a very long time.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.450
Probably the most experienced
freediving judge and expert

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.690
that there is.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.145
Also Tank [INAUDIBLE]
is here, who

00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:42.951
was a friend of Nick's and
an Australian national record

00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:43.450
holder.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.057
So they could take questions
at some point as well.

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:46.890
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.420
I think, to set up
what the sport is,

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.130
and what he's talking about,
I think it's important.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.280
Who here has tried to hold
their breath in the pool

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.920
as long as possible?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.720
And who has tried to swim from
one end of the pool and back,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.050
on a single breath?

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.560
And either done it, or not?

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.060
Everybody.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.270
It's this universal
human activity.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.010
And freediving has been
going on for millennia.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.010
Even though there's this
growing popularity that

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.400
has happened, ancient
Greek and ancient Rome,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.809
they had these early underwater
Navy SEAL team type things

00:13:17.809 --> 00:13:20.350
that they deploy, and they would
build underwater barricades.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.490
They're sponge divers.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.660
Pearl divers.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.320
Spear fisherman.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.550
People still live
off of spear fishing

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.040
in Indonesia, and Africa,
and in the Mediterranean.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.510
All over the world.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.180
This is something
humans have always

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.430
been able to do, and have used.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.560
What competitive freediving--
that started in the '40s.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.170
And originally, the
competition was using weights

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.600
to get down as deep as possible.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.910
So it was always
who's the deepest?

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:47.430
Who's the deepest?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.970
And often, they
would be weighted,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.480
they would drop weights,
and they would swim back.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.480
That's a discipline that
we call variable weight

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.090
now in competitive freediving.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.850
The competitive
freediving that we

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.120
depict in this book,
which is really,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.890
these are the six
events that are

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.550
used in competitive freediving.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.020
There's three that
are in the pool.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.800
There's static, which is holding
your breath as long as you can,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.010
face down in a pool.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.370
The world record is 11
minutes and 54 seconds.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.900
That's pretty long.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.330
The second is
dynamic, which you're

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.670
wearing a monofin, which are
those dolphin like tail fins

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.330
with two feet in one fin.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.380
And dynamic, that
record I think is still

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.030
281 meters, right? [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.960
And then there's dynamic with
no fins, which is the same idea.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.646
Trying to go as
long as possible,

00:14:34.646 --> 00:14:36.020
not as deep as
possible, from one

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.010
the end of the pool and back.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.960
And you do as long as
possible without fins.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.340
And that's a breast stroke.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.230
And again they're under water.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.670
They're weighted
with their neck,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.960
so they are not
allowed to eclipse

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.090
the surface of the water.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.140
That's what Tank was
so good at as well.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.460
The pool disciplines.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.270
But pool disciplines are also
training for the deep divers.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.080
The reason you want to build
up your static, as a diver,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.840
is if you hold your breath for,
say, five minutes in static,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.050
or at the surface, you can
swim for 2 and 1/2 minutes

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.320
on one breath, down below.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.760
And that's the simple formula.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.920
And so you want to develop
that static ability

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.180
if you want to dive deep.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.670
And same with dynamic, because
you're training your body

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.650
to withstand lactic
acid build up,

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.910
and carbon dioxide buildup
in your body, and so

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.440
the deep divers do
the pool for training.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.310
But the three disciplines
in deep freediving

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.192
are constant weight.

00:15:30.192 --> 00:15:32.150
They call it constant
weight because any weight

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.690
you bring down with you,
you have to bring back up.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.400
But constant weight
is with a monofin.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.290
And that record is 128 meters,
held by Alexey Molchanov

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.740
and Will Trubridge has
the two other world

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.300
records on the men's side.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.950
And those are with
free immersion.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.370
Which is, you pull down
on a line down to depth,

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.370
and then you pull
back to the surface.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.210
No fins.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.000
And then constant no
fins, which is what Nick

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.550
was doing when he passed away.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.450
And that record is 101 meters,
and that's a modified breast

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.730
stroke down and back.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.850
The free immersion
record's 121 meters.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.790
On the women's side,
it was dominated

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.920
by Alexey Molchanov's mother,
Natalia Molchanova who

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.910
was the most decorated athlete
in the history of the sport.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.980
The greatest female
freediver of all time.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.900
Has every single record.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.800
And she passed away last year.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.300
And she passed away in
a very different way

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.730
than what happened with Nick.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.520
What happened with Nick
was-- and it obviously

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.990
gets into the book--
he was diving injured.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.910
And then he went down and came
back on his own at the surface.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.760
And appeared to be
breathing for a full minute

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.430
before he blacked out.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.810
Blacking out is
not that uncommon

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.152
in competitive freediving.

00:16:43.152 --> 00:16:44.860
It doesn't happen a
majority of the time,

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.820
at all, but in
competitive freediving,

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.100
especially at places like
Vertical Blue and the world

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.600
championships, where people are
really pushing their limits,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.900
and the pressure is high,
you can use your oxygen

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.520
store prematurely,
even if you've

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.620
trained to a certain level.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.734
People do blackout.

00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:00.650
And that's why there are
safety divers around.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.358
And because of the
physics of freediving,

00:17:02.358 --> 00:17:04.069
you're not going to
black out of depth.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.460
It's always when you're coming
back towards the surface,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.650
or at the surface.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.369
90% of freedivers will
black out at the surface.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.160
9% of them will be
shallower than 10 meters.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.359
And less than 1%
will be below that.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.079
But the safety divers will
swim down to about 30,

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.750
or sometimes even 40
meters, to meet a diver,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.600
and swim back with them
on the way back up.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.700
That's why there are
safety divers there.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.550
And people do get
blackout underwater,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.247
and they're brought up, and
they come around right away.

00:17:31.247 --> 00:17:32.830
But usually, you're
going to black out

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.810
in the first or second
breath at the surface.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.489
And Nick didn't.

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:37.530
And so, what happened to
Nick is something nobody

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.120
had ever seen before in
the history of the sport.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.300
What happened with
Natalia was something

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.770
that happens to something like
100 spear fisherman every year.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.320
She was diving virtually alone.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.150
The people that she
had been diving with

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.800
were not equipped to safety her.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.110
She got caught in an underwater
current, and came up,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.030
and blacked out, shallow water,
and they never found her.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.440
So that's more like how
a lot of spear fisherman

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.860
do pass away doing this sport.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.569
It's not because of
the extreme of depth,

00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:06.984
it's because they're holding
their breath a little bit too

00:18:06.984 --> 00:18:07.560
long.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.050
Maybe they've done too many
dives that day, they're tired,

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.341
could be any number of reasons.

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:13.580
But there's nobody
there to protect them.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.280
The blackout itself
is not dangerous,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.520
it's blacking out alone
that is so dangerous.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.060
But with Nick's
story, it's different.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.850
That's what made it such
an interesting story

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.930
to write about.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.370
You start with his death and you
go back through his life story.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.180
And his life story is
so interesting, too.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.380
And then you get back
and forth from 2013

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.069
to the 2014 freediving
season, where

00:18:36.069 --> 00:18:37.235
the whole sport has changed.

00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:39.030
And we're trying to figure
out what happened to Nick,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.390
and what the sport can do.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:46.670
And that's when Ben and I met
in Vertical Blue that next year.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.870
I just wanted to give you
guys the whole picture

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.830
of what this competitive
freediving world is all about.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.490
Competitive freediving
is just one aspect of it.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.120
It's also just recreational.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.960
So anywhere that you
might go scuba diving

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.600
in the world, where there's
a bunch of scuba centers,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.058
there's also now
freediving centers

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.960
popping up all over the world.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.630
Do we know how fast it's
grown in the last few years?

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.480
It's just grown exponentially.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.170
I know that.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.718
Are there numbers
on that, at all?

00:19:12.718 --> 00:19:13.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:20.370
ADAM SKOLNICK: Tripled.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:32.265
And then also PADI, which is
the scuba diving association,

00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:33.640
they now have
certification body.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.440
Now they have a freediving
curriculum, too.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.887
So it just shows you
that as it's growing.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.720
And some of those
hobbyists become athletes.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:45.990
Before I turn back to Ben, one
thing about these competitions

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.280
is, they're kind of like
the triathlons would be,

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.637
or runs would be.

00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:53.220
There's weekend
warriors that are just

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.740
trying to get their own personal
best a little bit better,

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.670
and they're serious about it.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.120
But they're not real contenders.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.080
Then there's the national record
holders and the world record

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.690
holders.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.720
But what's unique
about this sport is,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.190
if you are a world
record holder,

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.910
you might also have to be the
guy blocking off the roads

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.950
if you are a triathlete.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.158
Imagine the best triathlete
in the world blocking off

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:12.129
the roads in Kona
before the Iron Man.

00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:13.920
That's basically what
these guys are doing.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.340
They're elite, elite athletes.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.980
In my opinion, the
best of them are

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.080
on par with Olympic swimmers.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.730
That's the athletic ability
we're talking about here.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.047
You can always tell when
an elite freedivers is

00:20:26.047 --> 00:20:27.880
in the room, it looks
like an elite athlete.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.450
Covering athletes like
I have, you can tell.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.290
That's how I feel about it.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.870
And that's the sport.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.620
BEN: I was just going
to mention something

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.520
a little counter-intuitive about
freediving in the ocean, which

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.810
is that for most people, the
limiting factor in how deep you

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.390
can go is not about breath hold.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.200
I think that it
would seem intuitive

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.740
that it's about how long
you can hold your breath,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.410
and the longer you can hold your
breath, the deeper you can go.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.710
But actually, adapting to
the pressure as you go down

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.510
is really the limiting
factor for most people.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.910
And through most of the
history of the sport,

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.450
everyone figured out,
mostly for themselves,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.297
how to go about
acclimating to the pressure

00:21:11.297 --> 00:21:13.130
as they went deeper,
and figuring out tricks

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.330
to get deeper.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.450
And that changed a few years
ago when some people developed

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.270
techniques that were
more teachable for how

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.150
to use certain tricks to get
down to depth a lot quicker.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.497
And so suddenly beginners
were able to use

00:21:28.497 --> 00:21:30.330
these techniques to go
much deeper than they

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.650
were really ready for.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.256
And I think that's gone over
extensively in the book.

00:21:34.256 --> 00:21:35.380
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah, it is.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.240
And we should talk a little
bit about what the appeal is.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.945
Why would you?

00:21:40.945 --> 00:21:43.780
If it's just an ego trip,
what's the point of writing

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.590
a book about this
group of weirdos

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.340
that are trying to go
as deep as possible,

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.620
just for their own ego trip.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.352
That's not what this is.

00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:55.510
I like to talk about what
happens on the dive itself,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.940
to give you an idea of
why these athletes want

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.790
to dive over and over again.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.509
When you start at the
surface-- actually

00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:07.550
an athlete will prepare
to dive for up to an hour

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.770
before the dive itself.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.220
And they'll just relax
as deeply as possible.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.404
Get the heart rate down
as slow as possible.

00:22:14.404 --> 00:22:16.320
Because the breath that
they're going to take,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.872
that peak inhalation where
they will fill their lungs,

00:22:18.872 --> 00:22:21.330
and then they'll continue to
pack air, and use their tongue

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.880
as a piston, to push more
air down into their lungs,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.450
so they over inflate their
lungs, some of them up to 20%

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.860
above their normal lug capacity.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.790
They're doing that, and
that's their oxygen tank.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.230
That's all the
oxygen they've got.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.090
We all know, oxygen
is how our cells work.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.350
That's our fuel.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.690
That's all they've got
to get down and back.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.860
And then they'll kick.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.490
And you have to kick hard
to get down, because you're

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.457
dealing with positive buoyancy.

00:22:48.457 --> 00:22:49.290
We've all done that.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.820
We've all tried to kicked
down and you're like, whoa,

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:51.861
I'm not getting anywhere.

00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:53.230
And they have to kick hard.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.836
Till about neutral buoyancy.

00:22:54.836 --> 00:22:56.460
And it depends on
how they're weighted,

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.930
but it's around 10 meters.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.710
And then they can kick
softer, and they'll

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.070
continue to go down.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.294
And after 20, 25 meters,
they'll stop kicking altogether.

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:06.460
And they will start sinking.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.740
That's that freefall.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.090
And they'll sink at
about a meter per second.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.450
So this slow, soft, sink.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.280
And most will just
close their eyes

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.080
and surrender to it, because
thoughts also burn oxygen.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.260
So you want to keep
that brain blank.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.400
And then the physiological
hacks start coming in,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.290
and that's what is known as
the mammalian dive reflex.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.870
And it's called that because
that's how seals and sea

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.110
lions dive deep, too.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.820
The same thing can
happen in the human body.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.380
And a few things that happen
is that the veins and arteries

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.030
in your arms and legs constrict,
and it floods the blood

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:48.100
to your core, because your
lungs are also compressing.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.490
At the surface we have
100% of our lung capacity.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.420
At 10 meters, because
of barometric pressure,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.230
we have half that lung capacity.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.400
20 meters, it's a third, and so
on, all the way down the line,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.960
till your lungs are the
size of a tennis ball.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.730
And so that blood starts to
engorge the pulmonary arteries,

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.040
the veins in your
core, and that,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.570
also, contributes to a
reduction in heart rate.

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.750
About half your
resting heart rate.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.480
So we're talking
about elite athletes.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.560
So they're going to be
in the 50's probably,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.684
so now, all of a sudden,
you're having a heart rate

00:24:17.684 --> 00:24:19.895
in the 20's and 30's
as you sink down.

00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:21.520
And that's something
that's really only

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.280
been recorded in Buddhist
monks in the laboratory.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.970
That's the level
we're getting at.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.590
And so then they keep
sinking, they keep sinking.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.630
And if you go super deep,
nitrogen narcosis can pop in.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.730
Which is, if you've ever
scuba dove, and you've

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.480
gone to any depth,
you might feel that.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.050
And it's like this psychedelic
thing that's happening.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.510
They're super relaxed,
their heart rates down,

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.790
they get to the bottom
plate, they pull the tag,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.647
and they have to kick back
against that negative buoyancy.

00:24:46.647 --> 00:24:49.230
That pressure that has shifted,
and it's started sinking down,

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.896
now they have to kick
back against that,

00:24:50.896 --> 00:24:53.100
which is like kicking
through a swift current.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.910
And they've already
been underwater

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.250
for half the amount of
time they're planning,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.790
and so now's the time to kick.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.210
And that's the athletic portion.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.640
So now they're kicking
hard, they're kicking hard,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.570
they're kicking hard.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.130
And as they get
back to the surface,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.920
and if they can get
back to the surface

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.147
under their own power,
which is almost every time,

00:25:10.147 --> 00:25:11.980
they take that first
breath, all of a sudden

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.860
that endorphin rush comes on.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.560
So you've had this psychedelic
spiritual experience augmented

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.430
by this endorphin rush, and
it's a euphoric, exhilarating

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.410
experience, obviously.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.260
It's this feeling that vibrate
your body and your mind.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.260
And it's why people
are addicted to it.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.590
And it's why people,
like Nick, or like Ben,

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.390
you feel that one time.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.250
Or even a beginner like me,
when I first started doing this,

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:40.180
it took 15 instructors to get
me down to a decent depth.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.030
I ended up getting to 100 feet.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.670
But I remember this one
time when I went down

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.690
to about 50 feet,
and all of a sudden I

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.232
didn't have to
breathe at that point.

00:25:50.232 --> 00:25:52.273
I didn't have to go up,
I didn't have to breathe.

00:25:52.273 --> 00:25:53.260
I was so comfortable.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.676
And for the rest of the day,
every time I'd close my eyes,

00:25:55.676 --> 00:25:58.435
I'd see that blue world.

00:25:58.435 --> 00:26:00.380
When divers go even
deeper than that,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.600
when they're below 50 meters,
time slows down even more.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.190
Often it feels like the
sea is squeezing them,

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.480
and they become just a
speck of consciousness

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480
in this vast abyss.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.130
And it's all part
of that allure.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.520
That's why people do this.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.290
Because it's a
beautiful experience

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.710
you can only get this way.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.220
And I think that's really
important because not only are

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.889
they great athletes--
like you said,

00:26:23.889 --> 00:26:25.180
it's this intellectual problem.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.070
It's a problem that
continually needs to be solved.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.486
You talked about
limiting factors.

00:26:28.486 --> 00:26:31.374
Maybe you can talk about
how everyone might have

00:26:31.374 --> 00:26:32.540
a different limiting factor.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.620
And how you try to
always solve the equation

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.250
of going a little bit deeper.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:37.290
BEN: Sure.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.601
Some of it can be
psychological, where

00:26:39.601 --> 00:26:41.100
you can get down
to a certain depth,

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.100
then suddenly have the thought
of I'm 100 feet under water,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.440
and you freak out
and turn around.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.390
There's various
physiological aspects

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.710
that can kick in
the urge to breathe,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.420
even if you have plenty
of oxygen. So overcoming

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.430
some of those limitations.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.930
Just getting to that point
where you can just relax and not

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.210
fight against the pressure
that's pushing on you,

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:11.450
takes a while to get calm
enough to adapt to that.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.890
I will second the fact that
the freefall stage, when you've

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:21.770
kicked down 50, 60, 70 feet,
and you can just start sinking

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.260
is just completely addictive.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:28.390
Probably the same way that
freefall would be in skydiving.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.060
And so being able to get
to the point-- and it

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.207
takes quite a bit of
work to get to the point

00:27:33.207 --> 00:27:35.290
where you're going deep
enough to experience that,

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.760
but it really is magical.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.790
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.200
And it takes reps, also.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.010
Life is reps, in my opinion.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:45.640
Life is reps.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.560
You need to have the reps.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.360
You need to get in the water.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.850
You need to do it over and over.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.183
The more you do it, the more
you love it, kind of thing.

00:27:51.183 --> 00:27:54.530
I think that's how I would
put it, don't you think?

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.280
BEN: Sure.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.240
It is.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.400
And when you've been out
of the water for a while

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.770
and you go back into it, usually
the first day or two or three,

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.650
you have to start much
shallower than you

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.970
were doing the last time.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.070
When I'm at my
peak in freediving,

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.690
I've been down
close to 70 meters,

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.970
but when I start off on a
dive trip the first day,

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.740
I'll go to maybe 30 meters.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.890
And that will feel
like a lot of work,

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.870
because my body has
not adapted to it yet.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.280
And so it can be depressing
the first day on a dive trip.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.020
But usually it comes
back fairly quickly.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.860
And then pacing yourself
to reach your limits again.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.510
Yeah, for these guys like
William Trubridge who

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.140
lives at the Blue Hole and
trains there 11 months out

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.170
of the year, or
trains freediving

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.700
a huge amount of the
time, he can just

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.460
adapt to the point
of going-- I mean,

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.400
he has he's been down
over 120 meters, which is

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.765
almost double what I've done.

00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:50.540
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah
, but 67 is no joke.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.311
67 meters is 200
feet plus, right?

00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:54.810
BEN: 220.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.830
ADAM SKOLNICK: 220.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.860
That's heavy duty.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.860
BEN: On the breath hold
front, my deepest dive,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:07.320
which was 67 meters-- it took
about a minute and 15 seconds

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.770
on the way down, and about 50
seconds on the way back up.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.290
So the whole dive time
was just over two minutes.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.010
So a dive like that is really
less about breath hold,

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:21.090
and more about just
adapting to the pressure.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.720
I felt comfortable on that
dive all the way to the bottom.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.710
I think I could have
gone a little deeper.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.670
And that's the other
aspect of the sport.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.144
Once you successfully make
a dive to your-- especially

00:29:30.144 --> 00:29:32.560
if it's a personal best-- and
you come back and you think,

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.480
oh I could have gone just a
tiny bit deeper than that,

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.688
and that drives you to just--

00:29:35.688 --> 00:29:36.650
ADAM SKOLNICK: Right.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.480
And it's a brain loop, right?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.341
So that's what I think another
interesting point of the book

00:29:41.341 --> 00:29:41.840
is.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.990
Where Nick was a perfect
example of what a lot of divers

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.800
feel is, no dive is good enough.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.030
There's always another
dive out there.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.065
Some just crunch numbers.

00:29:53.065 --> 00:29:54.690
William Trubridge is
a perfect example.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.940
He'll stare at his computer
and his dive profiles

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.730
for hours to try to
edge out another meter.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.500
Because it's part of
this self feeding loop.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.290
With Nick it was a
little self-destructive.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:14.741
There's a lot of reasons that
what happened that day-- there

00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:16.240
were about eight
or nine things that

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.406
could have gone differently.

00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:20.180
Some of them were in Nick's
control, some of them were not.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.687
And that's what makes
it-- any sort of tragedy,

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.520
whether it's a plane
crash or anything else,

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.357
often you hear that.

00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:26.690
Eight or nine things went wrong.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:27.630
Not one thing.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.520
And with the Nick's death,
that's certainly true.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.000
But Nick's life was
really rich as well.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.140
He came from a broken home.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.710
The great story is
when he was a year

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.001
and a half old, his family
dog pushed him in the pool,

00:30:41.001 --> 00:30:43.000
and his grandmother went
looking around for him,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.458
and saw him at the
bottom the pool.

00:30:44.458 --> 00:30:50.110
And he had his cheeks
puffed out, his eyes open,

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:51.170
with a smile on his face.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.794
And his grandmother
saw him down there,

00:30:52.794 --> 00:30:54.082
he was perfectly comfortable.

00:30:54.082 --> 00:30:56.290
And as parents started
fighting as he was growing up,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.490
he'd hold the ladder
in the family pool,

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.660
and hold himself down until
the fighting had subsided.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.140
The water was always
his safe place.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:08.950
It was always where he'd go
for calmness and serenity.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.910
As he grew up, he was
a great BMX rider.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.380
He was going to try out for
the X-Games before an injury.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.840
He ends up in Philadelphia
in 2000 for the GOP National

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.420
Convention, when
it was basically

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.579
everyone went from
the Battle of Seattle

00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:23.870
to the Philadelphia Convention.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.610
So he's with the
same people that were

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.150
working in the WTO protests.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.780
And he was doing that.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.940
From there, he met a woman,
and moved to New York

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.700
to try to be an actor in film.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.170
He wrote and directed his
own film with his girlfriend.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.510
He ended up in Williamsburg
right after 9/11,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.720
right before Williamsburg
became a thing.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.820
When he got to
Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.790
the downstairs bar
at his apartment

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.952
is where you went to get coke.

00:31:48.952 --> 00:31:50.410
That's where the
New York cops went

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.990
to do coke on their off hours.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.660
And he'd see them
come in and out.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.590
So he was in Williamsburg when
it was still totally derelict.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.460
And then he ends up
working in production,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.790
and one of his first
jobs in production

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.200
was to work on a
show that was a DC

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.920
comic that people hadn't really
heard of yet, Dave Chapelle.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.430
And so he was on the
whole Chapelle Show run.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.137
His life, all the way up
until the point of him

00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:16.720
discovering freediving
is interesting.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.670
And so it weaves in and out.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.430
And it talks about
his pull to the sport.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.090
But it also profiles
the other athletes

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.035
that you saw in the
video, Natalia included.

00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:30.250
That's why I wanted to
talk to you guys about it.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.541
Because it's a sport people
don't know that much about,

00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:34.695
but it's something
that we can all do.

00:32:34.695 --> 00:32:37.980
I swim in the ocean a
lot, so I love the ocean.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.270
And I've done some tech
diving and scuba diving.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.910
But when it came
to freediving, it

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.035
was harder for me to do
than I thought it would be.

00:32:44.035 --> 00:32:46.780
I mean, I'm in the ocean like
four to five days a week,

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.550
but when it came
to freediving, it's

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.510
a different type of experience.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.200
And it takes a
different attention,

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.187
and different mechanics, but
when you do it, you feel it.

00:32:58.187 --> 00:32:59.395
BEN: You feel like a dolphin.

00:32:59.395 --> 00:33:02.250
When you get to the point
where you can dive down 50,

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:05.450
60 feet and just be
comfortable down there

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:12.036
for an extended amount of time,
then you feel like a superhero.

00:33:12.036 --> 00:33:12.660
Aquaman, right?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.610
ADAM SKOLNICK: You are.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.970
I'm not.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.300
BEN: Yeah.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.175
There's some places--

00:33:15.175 --> 00:33:16.895
ADAM SKOLNICK: I'm
beginner Aquaman.

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.177
These guys are real Aquamen.

00:33:18.177 --> 00:33:19.760
BEN: One of my
favorite places to dive

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.700
is a spot called
Honaunau Bay, that's

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.000
near Kona on the Big
Island of Hawaii.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.930
And it's where the spinner
dolphins come in during the day

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:28.570
to go to sleep.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:32.340
And they swim in these big
circles around the Bay.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.890
And if you're out
there freediving,

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.040
you can anticipate by
watching where they are, when

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.250
they're going to get to you.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.300
And so 20 or 30 seconds
before they get there you

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.240
can go and swim down 20 meters,
and just hover in the water

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.990
and wait for them.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.448
And you'll see this entire pod
of spinner dolphins come out

00:33:50.448 --> 00:33:51.270
of the blue at you.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.290
And the little baby
dolphins want to play,

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.080
and they can play with
bubble rings and stuff.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.360
It's just incredible.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:57.580
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.180
And that kind of
recreational freedive

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.250
is what most people do.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.580
You can love freediving
and never compete.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.000
Like me, for instance,
who will never compete.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.210
But you can still
get a lot out of it.

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.480
We want to take questions.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.563
But before that, I want
to talk just a few minutes

00:34:13.563 --> 00:34:15.230
about marine plastic pollution.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.100
And I brought little
props up here.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.739
Last summer I did
a story on 5 Gyres.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.790
5 Gyres is, I think, one of
the world leaders in fighting

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.290
marine plastic pollution.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.500
They're a nonprofit based here
in Santa Monica, actually.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.920
And I went on this voyage
through the North Atlantic

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.429
gyre-- which we went for
an expedition from Bahamas

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:37.650
to Bermuda.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.190
And along the way
we were trolling

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.705
through some of the most
beautiful blue water

00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:43.330
I've ever seen.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.163
Trawling, excuse me.

00:34:44.163 --> 00:34:46.280
And we have these little trawls.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.969
Fine mesh trawls
that they designed.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:51.120
And in the bluest
water I've ever seen--

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.547
and also on that voyage were
people like Kimi Werner,

00:34:53.547 --> 00:34:55.630
who's a champion spear
fisherwoman and if you have

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.660
a chance to Google her
Kimi K-I-M-I Werner.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.590
She's got amazing
footage online.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.190
You'll see her riding the tail
fan of a great white shark,

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.810
among other amazing things.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.520
And there were some pro surfers.

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.170
Jack Johnson as well.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:13.390
A lot of these people have
seen some of the most beautiful

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.640
ocean scapes in the world.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.130
And here we were in one of them.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.710
None of us ever
seen bluer water,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.830
and we would trawl
through the water

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.750
and we'd come up
with micro plastics.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.900
You know, micro plastics.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:28.010
Because everywhere in the
world now, every inch of ocean

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.510
has micro plastics.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.720
Every inch of ocean.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.200
And what 5 Gyres does is,
tries to study it, and then

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.260
raise awareness.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.604
And the gyres are
these current systems.

00:35:37.604 --> 00:35:39.020
There's five of
them in the world.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.880
And they're giant
wind and water current

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.040
systems that take
all the garbage that

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.710
has been in rivers, whatever
dumped in the marine system,

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.380
however it is, and they
end up in these swirling

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.670
gyres at the surface.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.480
And then they sink.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.730
This plastic sinks.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.920
And it breaks down.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.860
Because plastic never goes away.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.350
Metal, glass, paper, all
that stuff disintegrates.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.380
Plastic never
disintegrates smaller

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.880
than these micro pieces.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.532
They get eaten by fish.

00:36:06.532 --> 00:36:08.150
Those fish get eaten
by bigger fish.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:11.920
We eat the other fish, so it
gets into the food system.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.170
They bioaccumulate
toxins in the water.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.710
Then they sink to
deep sea sediment.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.452
It's been found in
deep sea sediment.

00:36:17.452 --> 00:36:19.410
They get in under water
currents and distribute

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.201
all over the world.

00:36:20.201 --> 00:36:23.120
It's been found in
Arctic ice cores.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.840
I don't really want
to preach to heavy,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.506
but I will say that it's in
my opinion the number two,

00:36:27.506 --> 00:36:29.130
second only to climate
change, in terms

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.280
of environmental disasters
happening on this earth

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.070
right now.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.590
It's completely man made.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.980
And the only way to
stop it, is to stop

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.510
using single use plastic.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.640
A better way is to stop
producing single use plastic.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.520
Go into any grocery store,
Whole Foods included,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.390
it's hard to find stuff
that's not wrapped in plastic.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.330
It's really hard.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.970
And that's that
single use plastic.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.370
And there's no reason for it.

00:36:54.604 --> 00:36:56.520
I have these little
things, these are nurdles.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.220
This is what most
plastic comes--

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.180
that's the initial
compound of the plastic

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.952
that they use to make
bottles or anything else.

00:37:02.952 --> 00:37:03.639
Nurdles.

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.930
And the other thing we should
know is 90% of single use

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.060
plastic cannot be recycled.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.750
And even the non recycled stuff
get shipped to India and China

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.080
from here, often.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.240
And gets sorted out.

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.590
And ends up in the
water systems out there.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.490
And then ends up in
our marine environment.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.950
So it's a really broken loop
system-- it's not a loop

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.340
system, it's a broken system.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.770
And the only way is
to stop using it.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.840
I encourage you to
look over there.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.450
There are some 5
Gyres brochures.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.700
And you can take a look at it.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.500
5gyres.org is the organization.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.230
The number five gyres dot org.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.110
And I'll let you guys
look at these things, too.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.090
It's something that's
really close to my heart,

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.890
as someone who loves the ocean,
and I think we can fix it.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:46.840
And we will fix it.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.580
And then 20, 30 years
after we fix it,

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.580
when archaeologists go
back and take ice cores,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.490
they'll see all this
plastic, and they'll

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.930
be like, what were these guys
using so much plastic for?

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.920
This is like the Plasticine
age that we're in now.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.260
Not to alarm you too
heavily, but it's true.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.010
So here.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.660
We'll leave these.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.650
And you guys can ask
questions if you like.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.770
BEN: Just briefly.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.890
A tradition at the
Vertical Blue competition

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.922
is that one of the days
before the comp starts,

00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:12.880
they will take everyone
out to the beach, which

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.980
is about a quarter of a
mile stretch of beach,

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.450
and do a beach cleanup.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.897
And so everyone
gets garbage bags,

00:38:17.897 --> 00:38:20.230
and you fill it up with as
much plastic as you can find.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.727
And it's absolutely shocking.

00:38:21.727 --> 00:38:22.560
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.726
And Long Island is right
in the middle of that gyre.

00:38:24.726 --> 00:38:27.480
We went by it, and it's
right in the middle.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.854
So all this plastic
is getting washed up

00:38:29.854 --> 00:38:31.520
on these beautiful
beaches, and it's not

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.620
being generated by Long Island.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.280
It's generated offshore.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.262
Or different islands.

00:38:37.262 --> 00:38:37.970
Different places.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:41.417
Mainland America, most likely.

00:38:41.417 --> 00:38:42.000
BEN: So, yeah.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.390
Particularly the single use
plastic water containers.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.276
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:38:47.276 --> 00:38:49.650
That's why you see me slipping
out of this behemoth thing

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.110
and dripping all over myself.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.510
Because that's an easy way.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.180
There's easy fixes
that we can do.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.920
I don't want to put it all on
the consumer, because really,

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.790
this product should
be phased out.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.110
But obviously we can all
do better, myself included.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.770
AUDIENCE: I was
curious about how

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:10.830
the sport translates-- we're
talking about elite athletes.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.310
Can professional freedivers
also run a half marathon,

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.940
no problem?

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.894
Is their use of oxygen
just like someone

00:39:16.894 --> 00:39:18.060
who is training at altitude?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:22.120
I'm just curious on how it
translates to other sports.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.730
BEN: It depends, somewhat,
on which disciplines

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.360
the athlete is focused on.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:32.520
Some of them, more or less,
would translate differently.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.620
For instance static apnea.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.370
There are some people
that specialize just

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.910
in the pure breath hold.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.700
And that's the
opposite of cardio.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.810
And they've trained their
system to conserve energy,

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.810
rather than to burn it.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.080
And so for them, it might not
translate into a long distance

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.920
run.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.500
I think a lot of the athletes
do more weight training,

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.630
and they taper off the cardio
before they would really

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:59.460
do a freediving competition,
because the physical systems

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.650
used are much different.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.500
But in general, the best
freedivers are in killer shape,

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.950
if you were to go and see them.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.033
ADAM SKOLNICK: And will
often come from a swimming

00:40:09.033 --> 00:40:10.170
background of some kind.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.990
Alexey and Natalia
are perfect examples.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.390
They were competitive
swimmers all their lives.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:18.260
And then, in Natalia's case,
she tabled it for 20 years.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.080
And in Alexi's
case, he went right

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.310
from swimming-- one of the
elite Russian youth swimmers.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.700
And ended up being
a fin swimmer.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.908
Which is this other sport
we don't really know about.

00:40:26.908 --> 00:40:30.460
But there's actual people who
sprint with monofins in pools.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.800
It's big in Europe, and
Eastern Europe especially.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.670
And so he did that, and that
led him into this sport.

00:40:39.749 --> 00:40:41.790
I think a lot of people
in competitive freediving

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.850
are interested-- what if
a guy like Michael Phelps

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:45.030
decided to start doing this?

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.960
And there are some
college swimmers

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.859
that have made progress.

00:40:49.859 --> 00:40:51.400
Those guys though,
will still come up

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.120
against the same kind
of limiting factors

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.360
that any average
freediver might have.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.240
Can I equalize below
a certain depth?

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.920
Are my lungs flexible enough?

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.780
It takes time to
get down to depth,

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.990
otherwise you can
injure your lungs.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.300
So they'll bump up against
those same roadblocks

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.620
that will delay them,
even if they are athletic.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.840
I think it's more likely that
a great athlete might also

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.000
do some freediving vs.
freedivers that will then

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.920
go on to do other sports.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.045
And a good example
are big wave surfers.

00:41:20.045 --> 00:41:22.420
So a lot of big wave surfers
now do apnea and breath hold

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:22.920
training.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.490
And most freediving
instruction, PFI included,

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.630
and others will do surf safety
schools where they'll actually

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.520
work with big wave surfers
who might get two wave hold

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.290
downs or minute hold downs after
paddling for a minute, where

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.760
they're anaerobic and they still
have to relax, and endure it.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.350
And so that's probably
the best correlation.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.230
AUDIENCE: Is there
much crossover

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.110
from competitive
divers to people

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.700
who do recreational snorkeling?

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.710
I think the abilities
that you developed

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.730
would help, as a snorkeler,
give you more time or depth

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:58.182
to see more stuff?

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.770
[INAUDIBLE] surface.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.270
BEN: Yes.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.180
Absolutely.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.290
That's a large part of why a lot
of freedivers do what they do,

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.670
is because they do love
the snorkeling aspect,

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.090
and just the recreational aspect
of getting out on the water,

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.720
and just looking around
or playing with fish

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.240
or dolphins or something.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.050
You can interact with wildlife
a lot better as a freediver

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.010
than as a scuba diver,
because the bubbles tend

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:24.260
to scare the fish away and
you're not as maneuverable.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.570
Yeah, doing it
recreationally is a big draw.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.460
And I mean, for me,
personally, it certainly is.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.100
I mean, the competitive
aspect is something

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.500
that I do to have an excuse
to go somewhere and be

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.990
able to freedive for a while.

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.500
It's just that there happens
to be a competition happening.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.960
But really, I do it leaning more
towards the recreational end

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.620
of the spectrum.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.470
And so it really is
advanced snorkeling, really.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.130
ADAM SKOLNICK: And
for spear fisherman,

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.960
it's a vital tool as well.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.580
Which is basically
what you're saying.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.920
But sometimes in blue water.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.300
BEN: Yeah, William
Trubridge is interesting.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.040
He's pretty much a
vegan, except for fish

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.115
that he spears himself.

00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:02.990
If he wants protein,
he's got to work for it.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.950
AUDIENCE: On the
snorkeling thing.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.310
I did do some PADI work with
a chap whose point of view

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.260
was, the nice thing about doing
freediving practice before you

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.012
go down with a tank, is that you
don't breathe very often when

00:43:19.012 --> 00:43:21.345
you are on the tank, and it
doesn't scare the fish away.

00:43:21.345 --> 00:43:23.272
So he used his
freediving as a way

00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:25.480
of building up his tolerance,
so that he can just not

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.271
breathe for two minutes
while he's at depth

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.800
with a tank on his back.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.240
Seemed a useful thing to learn.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.880
The thing that I
mostly have trouble

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.140
with when I'm snorkeling,
trying to get down to depth,

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.290
because there is work that
I'm doing with a camera,

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.150
and I can't see a damn
thing without a mask.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.470
Or at least not enough
to take a photo, anyway.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.790
So are there any
recommendations for how

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.790
to handle the fact
that-- I end up

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.505
putting an awful lot of the air
that was in my lungs in my mask

00:43:51.505 --> 00:43:54.230
in order to be able to still
not have water in my mask

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.030
and be able to see
for the camera.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.199
I've seen low volume
masks, but they

00:43:59.199 --> 00:44:01.240
don't seem to be particularly
low volume compared

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.448
to what my lungs are like
by the time I'm down there.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.170
BEN: A lot of
competitive freedivers,

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:12.600
when they're doing particularly
deep dives, actually

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.520
transfer to using fluid goggles
instead of an air filled mask.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.750
So the idea is you just
have regular swim goggles,

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.040
you put in very
thick lenses in them,

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.550
so that when you flood them
with saline, or with sea

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.780
water at depth, and you
can still see clearly.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.950
And so that's one
way to go about that.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.980
Some of the freediving
masks-- there's

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.120
one type of mask called
a Sphera that's common.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.110
It's like $50.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.755
It's a fairly cheap mask,
but it has plastic lenses.

00:44:40.755 --> 00:44:45.040
It scratches if you breathe on
it, but it is very low volume,

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.570
and it's curved.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.640
So it warps things a little
bit in your peripheral vision,

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.900
but it does squeeze right
onto your face as you go down,

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.730
and it uses very little
air to equalize it.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.620
And so that's one a lot of
the competitive freedivers use

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.790
if they're doing medium depth.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.830
And some divers have set
world records in masks.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.870
Martin Stepanek did
120 something meters.

00:45:11.082 --> 00:45:13.540
ADAM SKOLNICK: You just breathe
out your nose a little bit,

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.051
that's enough with a Sphera.

00:45:17.974 --> 00:45:19.140
AUDIENCE: That was riveting.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.340
A couple of questions.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.530
One, you talk about the
danger when you're coming up,

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:32.800
but it seems like when you
are negatively buoyant,

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.750
it sounds like you don't have
the rescue divers down there,

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.250
either.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:37.125
ADAM SKOLNICK: Right.

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:39.720
AUDIENCE: You're all on
your own to get back up.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.200
Is that a problem?

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.420
Or do people typically
have enough experience not

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.656
to exhaust themselves.

00:45:44.656 --> 00:45:47.030
ADAM SKOLNICK: Well it's not
a problem because of the way

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.890
physics works with pressure.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.810
The way physics works is, as
you go down deeper and deeper,

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:54.120
your lungs are shrinking.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.666
And so the brain feels like
you have plenty of oxygen.

00:45:57.666 --> 00:45:59.790
Your partial pressure of
oxygen in your bloodstream

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.890
is actually up.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:05.200
So with every atmosphere
of pressure that you add,

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.550
the partial pressure goes up.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:08.290
And so your system
is like, OK, we

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.840
have plenty of oxygen.
We're going to be fine.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.235
We're going to keep operating.

00:46:12.235 --> 00:46:14.360
And then at the depth, when
they start coming back,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.740
the reverse happens.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.312
And the reason you wouldn't have
divers on tanks at that depth

00:46:20.312 --> 00:46:22.770
is because, as you know, you
can get decompression sickness

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.655
if you are on a tank
and you're way deep.

00:46:24.655 --> 00:46:26.780
So you wouldn't able to do
anything with that diver

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:27.440
anyway.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.780
There are some competitions.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.250
Deja Blue, which is run by
Performance Freediving that

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:35.300
does have tech divers on
tanks at those deep depths.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.880
And they'll shake the line if
something horrible happens.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.690
And there is the line, too.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.120
If a safety diver goes
down to 30, 35 meters

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.580
and doesn't see
his diver coming,

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.780
and knows that the
diver is supposed

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.640
to come at a certain
time, because there's

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.800
a time estimate that they know,
then they can shake the line.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.842
And the diver is attached
by lanyard to the line,

00:46:52.842 --> 00:46:54.550
and they can pull the
diver out that way.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.428
AUDIENCE: That answers
my second question of how

00:46:56.428 --> 00:46:57.260
the heck do you navigate.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.270
ADAM SKOLNICK: Yeah.

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.680
And there are issues like that.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.810
In the book, I
talk about a diver

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:08.510
in the Caribbean competition
in 2014, his lanyard,

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.216
it wasn't a quick
release, often they

00:47:11.216 --> 00:47:12.840
have quick release
Velcro lanyards that

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.430
can pull if it gets knotted.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.460
And he gets knotted
at the bottom plate,

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.670
and can't get out.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.350
And for a minute you don't
know what's going to happen.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.520
And that happens.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.745
And that's when you shake the
line, and you pull him up.

00:47:25.745 --> 00:47:27.120
BEN: There was
one crazy incident

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.780
in a comp a few years ago, where
a diver went to go do a dive,

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.862
and on the way down, the lanyard
got disconnected from the line.

00:47:34.862 --> 00:47:37.070
And so as he's falling down
towards the bottom plate,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.540
he's drifting away from the
line, just off into the blue.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:45.620
And at some point
realized that he was lost.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.769
And started to turn around,
started trying to swim back up.

00:47:48.769 --> 00:47:50.560
But he was a little
disoriented down there,

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.940
and was actually
swimming sideways,

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.420
and not making any
vertical progress at all.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.770
And by sheer luck, managed to
swim into the next competition

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.570
line over, climb up that line
all the way to the surface,

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.170
and was in good enough shape
to get all the way to the top.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.100
So yeah, if you come
unclipped, that's a problem.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.350
ADAM SKOLNICK: It's a problem.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:14.340
And it just shows
that with this sport,

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.435
there's already a very
thin margin for error.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.280
Some people just lose
track of priorities.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.310
I think Nick did
that towards the end.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.440
And you can operate
where all of a sudden

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.195
there's no margin for error.

00:48:29.195 --> 00:48:31.320
And that's what happened
also with Natalia, though.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.040
So it's not just upstarts.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.970
You know, Natalia is the
most decorated athlete ever,

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.500
and she also had it.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.006
I think it's important for all
of us to look at our lives.

00:48:41.006 --> 00:48:43.890
Where are we overvaluing,
and what are we overvaluing?

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:47.490
And try to maintain perspective.

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:51.560
That's a lesson for
everybody, I think.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.150
BEN: Yeah.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.733
Even if you try to
dive safely, if you

00:48:53.733 --> 00:48:56.270
try to set up your dive so
that you say that there's

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.495
a 1% chance that something
will go seriously wrong,

00:48:59.495 --> 00:49:01.120
if you do 100 dives,
chances are you're

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.810
going to hit that 1%
on one of the dives.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.822
It's a reason to be--

00:49:05.822 --> 00:49:07.030
ADAM SKOLNICK: Last question.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.120
My question is about
recreational diving.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.140
With scuba, say
I'm on a dive trip.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.507
Your limiting factor is build
up of oxygen and nitrogen

00:49:17.507 --> 00:49:18.090
in your blood.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.740
So when you're
freediving on a trip,

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.680
assuming you're well within
what your comfort level is,

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.410
say 30 meter or whatever.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:28.690
How many dives do
you do to that depth?

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:33.760
What's a regimen of a normal
recreational dive trip?

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.190
BEN: It depends on
your level of fitness.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.360
There's a lot of
spear fisherman that

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:44.340
will go out and do 20, 30 of
those type of dives in a row.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.295
Tank can probably answer
that question as a spearo.

00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:52.050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:53.785 --> 00:49:55.660
ADAM SKOLNICK: Correct
me if I'm wrong, guys,

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:57.409
because I don't really
cover that in this,

00:49:57.409 --> 00:50:00.480
but if you're in the
20 to 30 meter range,

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.190
you would have to do a lot of
dives to get the kind of bubble

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.920
build up in your blood like you
would if you're on air tank,

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.000
breathing at depth.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.870
That's where decompression
sickness is much more likely.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:13.830
I only saw decompression
sickness once

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:16.180
in the entire
research of this book,

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.540
and it was with a diver who
had done repeated 100 meter

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.420
plus dives, day after day.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.370
It was last year.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.970
And he did 100 meter plus,
day after day after day.

00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.870
And so that build up of
that, is what gave him

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.630
some very minor decompression.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.900
He didn't have to do
a chamber, or he maybe

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.190
did a day or two in
the chamber in Nassau,

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.910
and then he was completely fine.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.470
So decompression
sickness can happen

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.280
if they're weighted
on sleds, and they

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.810
are going 200 plus meters,
or something like that.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:43.830
Then it can happen.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.750
But it's much more
common in breathing air.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.594
That's why often
freedivers will say

00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:50.510
it's actually more
dangerous and statistically

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:53.770
it is more dangerous to
be on a tank at depth,

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:56.160
than it is to be
off a tank at depth.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.952
BEN: Because if you
need to go up quickly--

00:50:57.952 --> 00:51:00.368
ADAM SKOLNICK: Because you can
go out quickly and you wont

00:51:00.368 --> 00:51:01.035
hurt yourself.

00:51:01.035 --> 00:51:02.410
BEN: But for
recreational diving,

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.400
even if you're diving
within your limits,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.594
that assumes that every dive is
going to go according to plan.

00:51:07.594 --> 00:51:09.010
And the problem
is, if you go down

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.480
and you get distracted
by something

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.063
and you're down
longer than you think,

00:51:12.063 --> 00:51:16.090
and suddenly you realize I'm 50
feet down, and I'm out of air.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:19.680
That's when trouble can happen.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.550
It's so important to always
have somebody watching you,

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.240
when you're diving, who knows
how to do a rescue, and so on.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.990
ADAM SKOLNICK: One up,
one down, they say.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:29.260
And before we go, I just
wanted to say thank you.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.155
I want to thank Google, because
writing is a team sport.

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.280
It seems like the most
solitary thing in the world,

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.900
but especially a
book like this where

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.000
it relies on so many
sources to be so open,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.200
including these guys here.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.130
Everyone here.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.460
And obviously readers and book
stores, and that kind of thing.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.360
But Google spending time doing
this, and inviting me here,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.850
and having you guys
take your time.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:50.230
That's right there with it.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.355
And I really appreciate it.

00:51:51.355 --> 00:51:52.290
I'm so grateful.

00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:54.827
I know every author that
comes here must feel that way.

00:51:54.827 --> 00:51:57.410
I certainly do, so I really want
to thank you guys for coming.

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.451
And if you want, I'll sign
some books over there.

00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:01.697
And I'll have these little
plastic toys for you

00:52:01.697 --> 00:52:02.780
to check out, if you want.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.680
BEN: OK.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.430
Yeah.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:06.646
[APPLAUSE]
