1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,450
The Joe Rogan experience.
It's only 30,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,570
only 30 maybe.
What are you gonna do?

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,370
Blake Griffin's get a
murder in front of you.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,470
It's a weird muscle
stand up to weird muscle.

5
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,910
Joey Diaz isn't exactly like
Joey Diaz is high by, by noon,

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,030
but he's funny as fuck it. And
Connie say before noon. Yeah.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,060
Comedy is a weird thing.
Comedy is a very,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,850
there are some fuckups Chilean Joey Diaz,

9
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,060
Mike and high all the time that mother
Fucker fucker works on this act.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,470
Joey works on is, it's a mindset you're
always writing. You're always peaceful.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,950
Joey Diaz is a pro. Like people see
Joey and they see that, you know,

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,490
he smokes a lot of weed
and he's crazy and they,

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,720
they assume that he just gets up there
just rants and raves. No, no, no, no.

14
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,640
That guy always has new material. Oh,
always. Always working on something. Yeah.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,900
Yeah. He's, I think that's what
it takes to, I think that, um,

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
this kid was younger and he told me he
hadn't written a joke in two years and I

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,380
went, well, you're talking like a
loser. You know, you, you can't,

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,330
I think stand up is relentless.
Especially if you develop a following.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,450
That's where he's at.
He's probably depressed.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,290
There's something probably wrong with,
well, we talked about that too is like,

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,900
yeah, but I'm saying that,
you know, again, you know,

22
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,850
depression is a very real thing,

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,110
but I always said a kind of younger
people who seem like they're in a Rut.

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,801
I had to,

25
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:21,801
I'm a huge believer in just just take the
steps of getting better at one type of

26
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,560
language. Start. It doesn't matter
if it's a guitar, it doesn't matter.

27
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,590
Just just get better at one little thing.
Just start practicing.

28
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,110
It'll motivate you to do other things.
I'm not saying depression,

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,600
clinical depression is a very real thing.
I don't know enough about it. Well,

30
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:37,860
the thing is it is real. Yes.
But it's different with every
person. Yeah. It's like,

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,580
it's one of the rarest of diseases in
that like you really can't put it on a

32
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:45,810
scale. Yeah. Like use the
spectrum. You feel like shit
or you don't feel like shit.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,030
You're depressed. You're not
depressed. Yeah. But what,

34
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,690
what level depressed are you,
are you suicidal? Are you
just like kind of Shitty?

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,000
Could you fix it with like running or,

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,510
or do you need like real chemical
intervention and in, do you know,

37
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,500
do you know the difference?

38
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,300
Like w what's your community like
what are your friendships like? Yeah.

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,820
What does your family life? Huge
questions. Huge questions. By the way,

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,390
how are you eating? How are you
exercising? What is your community like?

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,030
These are things where the in people
who live the longest and those studies,

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,600
what does it, Spain I heard
and I don't know if I'm right,

43
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:20,520
has the longest per capital lift people
right now and yet huge alcohol and

44
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:23,400
tobacco consumption.
But they are connected to community.

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,470
They're there and they do a lot of
that. They get nit in, you know,

46
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,890
taken cs as long lunches. Yes. Yes.

47
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,070
D and drinking red wine. Woo. Yeah.

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,900
Why not enjoying their life and dancing
salsa and sings? I'll, I, I've done,

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,400
I bet that maps to what is this Spain to
lead Japan and global life expectancy.

50
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,410
You go us continues to slide.
Yeah.

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,050
Cause we're eating shitty food and we're
getting fat. We're also isolated. Yeah.

52
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,480
There's a price you pay for as
a capitalist, as a capitalist,

53
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,800
as somebody who believes
in the free market,

54
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,970
there's a price you pay for the
praying to the god of and progress.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,840
There is [inaudible] it as we as we are,

56
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,730
we're ruthlessly competitive Americans.

57
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:11,320
Rue Americans are fucking ruthlessly
competitive and insanely aggressive.

58
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,200
Football is a game of war. It's
simulated war. You're, you're, you're,

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,440
you're capturing territory
and everything else it,

60
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,220
we are so aggressive that way and
look and makes us a great country.

61
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,520
We also pay a price for it. No
question about it. Like I get,

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,880
I do get sort of the
notion that we need there.

63
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,590
There is this idea that we're the left,
a lot of the left says, look man, this,

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,490
this capitalism stuff that seems to
be creating isolation and depression.

65
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,530
Like how's it going?
Is there,

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,570
is there a conversation to be had about
how we figure out how we structure our

67
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,600
lives, where our community takes more
of a precedence where job security,

68
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,420
it takes more of a precedence.
All these things. Well,

69
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,020
the minute I start hearing socialism,
I start to freak out, but I just said,

70
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,740
I know what you're saying. Yeah. But
here's the thing about socialism.

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,700
Socialism in general sounds like a
terrible idea because a lot of people are

72
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:08,780
lazy and because of De incentivizes
people from action and there's a certain

73
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,780
thing that people should
have motivation to succeed.

74
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,420
They should have some drive and they
get some satisfaction out of achieving

75
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:14,901
goals.

76
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,290
And those are all things that I would not
want to deny any young person problem.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,050
I think those, those are really
important things for happiness.

78
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:22,280
And one of the things that they've,

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,160
they've studied when they've
studied happiness and people,

80
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,130
people that are goal
oriented and that set,

81
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:29,870
they set goals and achieve those goals.

82
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:31,730
It's one of the best
markers for happiness.

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,420
And it doesn't necessarily mean money.
You know,

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,410
the problem is we like to think of
it as money as it's a money thing,

85
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,390
but in athletics and art,

86
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:44,540
when it without finance
attached to it at all,

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
when people set out to do
something and then do it,

88
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,360
they achieve a sense of self
worth and happiness. Yes.

89
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,000
And understand understanding of yourself,
who you are.

90
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,150
This is what's missing from a lot
of people. And, and, and again,

91
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:59,750
I'm not a clinical psychologist. I don't
really understand depression. I don't,

92
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,610
I don't suffer from it,
but I,

93
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,970
I've known enough people that have to
know that there's a lot of different kinds

94
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,590
of it. It's all different. And
I think some people just have,

95
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,990
they have a broken brain.
There's something wrong in there.

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,860
And it would be nice if there was a
chemical that could fit into that slot and

97
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:16,430
fix it.

98
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,760
And sometimes there is for those people
and sometimes it changes their lives.

99
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,800
And then I've known people
that were on the wrong meds,

100
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,690
like Ari was on probation. It was
fucking with him. It gave him depression,

101
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,770
you know, and sometimes people, they'll
change their diet. And you know,

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,860
one of the things that Rhonda Patrick was,
she posted something,

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,390
I think it was on her Twitter
account and how inflammation, um,

104
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,900
led to impulsive decision making,

105
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
led to cheating on your diet and lead to
poor decisions in terms of like overall

106
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:51,860
lifestyle, just from having higher levels
of inflammation. So eating shitty food,

107
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,460
not getting enough sleep,
drinking all those things,
lead to inflammation, accents,

108
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,840
all those things cause to
make more impulsive food
choices, shitty food choices,

109
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,840
bad dietary choices,
bad la lifestyle and rest choices.

110
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,590
Like they're all it almost like
inflammation wants more of it. Here it is.

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,880
Study finds an inflammation even at sub
clinical levels in healthy participants

112
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:15,380
may provoke impulsive behavior and
an inability to delay gratification.

113
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,090
Isn't that amazing? Yeah. I start,

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
I pull back with all this stuff and I
always think to myself like I think I

115
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,160
think what you and I are after,

116
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:30,140
like when the reason I'm happy and the
reason I feel so fulfilled is I'm able to

117
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:34,700
express myself re fully like fully.
Like I told you the other day,

118
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,000
like I certain developments in my life.
Like I was like I,

119
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,320
I want radical honesty in the sense
that I don't have to lie about anything.

120
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,570
I don't want to lie about anything.
I want to be very honest.

121
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,360
You and I have been always been
so honest with each other. Right?

122
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,460
And well that's why we know each other's
so. Yes. Wow. Yes. In the middle,

123
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,660
we start fucking bullshitting. And you're
like, Oh, why? Why do what? But that,

124
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,330
that's where you have your friends and
hold you accountable because they know

125
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:02,840
exactly who you are. And it's
very important. Exactly that. So,

126
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,170
so what that allows you to do is to
express yourself fully and completely

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,130
original self expression is my
whole, my credo, my idea. But,

128
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,180
but so w w eating well if eating well,
see,

129
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:19,730
I don't want my body to get in the way.
I don't want it to get in the way.

130
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,910
So I investigate how to feel optimal so
that I can just not have it get in the

131
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,690
way and I can do the things I
love. Yeah. That is a form of,

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,640
of expressing myself fully. I
always wanted a box. I was so,

133
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,590
it was such a mystery to me.
And I'll be,

134
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,650
I'm nervous today cause I gotta go spar
some fuck the whole time and doing it

135
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,370
now. How many years? Almost
five years now. But, but,
but, but I don't care about,

136
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,660
you know, I'm not going
to enter, you know,

137
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm not gonna Wayne wants me to
fight and I want you to find it,

138
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,940
but I'm not going to do
I want to, I want to, uh,

139
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,320
I don't want to be an
actor who takes a fight.

140
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,980
It's hilarious to me doing that to you
because he's a fighter and he's a maniac.

141
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,310
Mine difficult to get in there. Lace
up the gloves and his one time, right.

142
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,380
You can fight, you can fight,
you can fight. Come on, throw
the old left, right, left.

143
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,260
Yeah.
And then I put,

144
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,050
I put on headgear and he just puts in a
mouthpiece and it's telling me you, yeah,

145
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,180
he puts his gloves wherever he
wants. Woo. Which is annoying, but,

146
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,460
but my point is that I, I feel like
I'm expressing myself in that vein.

147
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,420
I always wanted to do it.
