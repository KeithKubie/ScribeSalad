YOUR MAIL WASN'T DELIVERED TODAY
AND EVERYONE WAS BEING

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.316
EXTRA SELF-RIGHTEOUS ON SOCIAL
MEDIA?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.019

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.275
BETTER THAN COMMEMORATING SOME
ITALIAN THAT BROUGHT SYPHILIS TO

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.210
THE NEW WORLD.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.811
LET'S HEAR YOUR PITCHES FOR
SOMEONE WE SHOULD DEDICATE A

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.481

HIS NAME IS NOT CHRIS.
