(banjo music)

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.947
(phone ringing)

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Mother On Phone]
Hi honey, how are you?

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I don't know, things
aren't going well.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Mother] They're not?
- No.

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:20.053
- [Mother] What happened?

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:21.254
- I'm on the Tennessee River.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.455
- [Mother] Well how did you get

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.723 align:start size:84% position:16%
on the Tennessee
River, I thought you

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:24.891
were supposed to be
on the Mississippi?

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.359 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Apparently Mississippi
was too dangerous,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.927 align:start size:97% position:3%
so now we got to the Tennessee
River and it looks like--

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.129 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Mother] I know,
there's supposed to be

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.964 align:start size:84% position:16%
really, really bad
weather like flooding,

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start size:88% position:13%
and tornadoes, you've
got to get out of there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.969
- I do have to get out
of there, thanks mom.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.504
I love you.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.840
- [Mother On Phone] Alright,
well, love you baby, bye--

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.409
- We gotta get out of here!

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.144
(jet ski revving)

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.079 line:0%
- The Mississippi was
running hard and high.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.348 line:0%
Storms can get really rough.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.683
You notice we never saw
any other pleasure boats

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.419 line:0%
on that river at all.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.854 align:start size:88% position:13%
Dead bodies, everything,
I mean, you know,

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.990
it's just the, it's the
nation's sewer system,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.059 align:start size:84% position:16%
you might see a dead
cow floating by.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean you know, the people
that live on the river

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.763
just roll their trash down
the hill and in the river.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.732
I mean God only knows
how many stolen cars

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.069
are on the bottom of
that river somewhere.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.738
(dubstep music)

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.880
(banjo music)

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.695 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Li'l Minnow.
- Yes?

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.530
- How many goats have we
sent to Africa so far?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.466
- 173 goats.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.935
- I gotta inspire people,
what gets people money?

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.436
- Gangs.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.270
- Gangs?

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.941
I got an idea, throw me a phone.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.147
Throw me another phone.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.753
Kyle, it's Kurt.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.821
- [Kyle] Hey, what's up?

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.022
- How you doing, man?

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Kyle] I'm doing great
man, just being dry.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:08.027 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Listen, I'm thinking about
starting a jet ski gang,

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.563
I was wondering if you're busy.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.299
- [Kyle] Well yeah but
do it buddy, let's do it.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.034
- I'll see ya soon, buddy.

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:16.636
Let's do this shit.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.907
(jet ski revving)

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.742
- God I love that man.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.914
- So we start a jet ski gang,
we're called the Wet Ones.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.918
We had little pleather
vests that we would wear.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.621 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Jet Ski Riders] Live
free and die moist!

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.290
(Spanish music)

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.009 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Kurt On Stage]
Boom, just like that,

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.444
I had my very own jet ski gang.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.514
- [Kurt] Wet Ones are
mopping up hunger!

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Kurt On Stage] And
very quickly, I realized

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.719
I had no idea what
to do with them.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.755
- [Kurt] What does
a jet ski gang do?

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.723
- I think we gotta do
a brunch comedy show.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.125
- If there's nothing
I don't like more,

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's 11:00 a.m.
stand-up comedy show.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.095
- You don't wanna
hit 'em at noon,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.730
they're picking out their
food, by one they're full.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.467 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Let's do an 11:00 a.m.
stand-up comedy show,

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.070
in the middle of Lake Pickwick.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.439
- [Kurt On Stage] So of course,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.042
we headed to the first
biker bar we could find,

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.645 line:0%
because I'm sure we'd
totally fit in there.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.418
Now, this place Freddy T's
is kinda like if you took

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.187 align:start size:84% position:16%
an Applebee's, and
then crammed it inside

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.656
a teen dance club from Miami,

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.191
and then filled it with bikers

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.460
and then put it in the
middle of Tennessee.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.697
It is a real fucked up place.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.232
- I think before
they start the show

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.734
they oughta take a moment,
and thank all the veterans

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.769
in the United States of America,

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.406 align:start position:0%
because if we didn't have
these freedoms that we got now,

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:04.244
we'd be in a communist
motherfucking country.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.813
- And so the whole
audience is bikers,

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:10.049
and we're wearing
pleather vests,

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.619
made to make fun of bikers.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:17.190 align:start position:0%
So it's a very difficult
situation we found ourselves in.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.691
- I can't believe
you guys all aren't

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.361
at work right now, bike gang.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.396
(audience laughter)

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:26.099 align:start size:94% position:6%
We got the gang out, we
got Big Bear, we got Earl.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.635
We got Glitter Steve over there,

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.603
we got Sparkle Dave.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.838
We got 'em all out.

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.673
We got Kissy Lips.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start size:94% position:6%
Did I get the names right,
or was I wrong on 'em?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.646 align:start size:94% position:6%
Is everybody just nervous
or was it not funny?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:43.283
(audience laughter)

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.185 align:start size:94% position:6%
I rode with the Dance
City Prancers for a while.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.087
I got tickled into that gang.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.056
You ever get tickled in?

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.792
You don't wanna see what
they do to get you out.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.963 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
They just make you a big
cake, and they wish ya well.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.304 line:0%
What's that?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.805
Don't come out gay.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.409 align:start size:97% position:3%
What's gonna give it away,
this plastic vest I'm wearing?

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.413
There's a guy wearing the
same thing over there.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.449 align:start size:81% position:19%
Just don't be gay,
let's all wear

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.885
the same leather colors together

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.888 align:start size:88% position:13%
and ride our
motorbikes around town.

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.891
(audience laughter)

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.694
Hey, it's all just
pink engine parts

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:31.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
when you get down to
it, what does it matter?

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
Who cares, I've been watching
a lot of gay porn lately.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.837
I'm not gay, but I watch it,

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.539
because I want to be
objective you know?

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.874
Like I'll watch it after
the stuff I like to watch,

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.976
because that's when
I can be open minded,

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.679
like once I get my demons out.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:50.850
Click over, see what the
fellas are up to, you know?

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:55.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's way tougher than any
sport you can possibly like,

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.724
is two dudes banging each other.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.460
It is way, way more tough.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.261 align:start size:88% position:13%
Imagine watching
football where everybody

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:04.197
on the field got along.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.268 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's nothing to be
scared of, it's two dudes,

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:11.437
doing MMA the right way.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:14.841
(audience laughter)

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.276
If you're worried about your
dick wiggling there Big Bear

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:20.413
that's on you man,
I got no problem.

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.347 line:0%
I'm picking on ya Big Bear,

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.316 line:0%
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.650
Because you're the scariest one,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.619
I'm going prison rules.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.756
I'm not gonna punch ya, I'm
just gonna make jokes at ya,

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:33.025 align:start size:88% position:13%
and hope that everybody
gets on my side.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.561
It's a matter of
respect right now.

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.964
(audience laughter)

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:41.000
This has been awesome,
get back out for Kurt.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Kyle Kinane
everybody, give it up!

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
Thank you guys so
much for coming out,

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:48.207
let's get wet for goats!

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:52.445
I walked into that place,
thinking we're gonna die.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.181
But Kyle won these
guys over in a way

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.250
that I never could have.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.818
And then at the end of the show,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start size:84% position:16%
Kyle just gets on
the back of the bike

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.321
with this dude named Big Bear,

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.823
and they take off.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.059
Hey I don't know, is he
going to the airport,

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.029 align:start size:94% position:6%
they're gonna go make meth
together, I don't know.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.399
But Kyle Kinane is one of
the fucking good ones, man.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.334
It was an amazing show.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:17.904
Well here I go again on my own,

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:20.406
time to get back on the water.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.076
What'd I do this morning?

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.645
Formed a jet ski gang,

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.947
and then we did a stand-up
show for a bunch of bikers

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.149
in one of the weirdest
bars I've ever been to.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.418 align:start size:97% position:3%
We lost Kyle Kinane because
he became best friends

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.153
with a biker, but
that's how it goes

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
when you're on the
road, I don't judge him.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.624
But I still got a job to do.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.727
I gotta send 500 goats and
1000 chickens to Africa.

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:44.864 align:start size:97% position:3%
In order to do that, I gotta
make it 100 miles today.

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:46.199
Roustabout.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:54.607
(dubstep music)

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hey, I risked my
life in a biker bar,

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.892
but you don't have to do that.

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.861
All you have to do
is click on this link

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.330
and donate to Heifer right now.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.732
Come on, give 'em some money.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:23.102
Bwah.
