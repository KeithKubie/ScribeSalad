KAY: Hi, everyone, my name is Erik Kay. This

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.240
is Aaron Boodman. And we're really excited
to be here for launching Chrome Extensions

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.070
into beta after a year of hard work. So, 15
months ago when Chrome was first launched,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.320
one of the first things we heard from our
users was asking us about extensions. And,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.439
in fact, it's the oldest open issue in our
bug database, issue 18th. So, it got filed,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.760
literally, minutes after we launched. And
FIT was soon filled with hundreds--a hundred

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.589
comments or more of people saying, “Yes,
plus 1, me too.” You know, all the really

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.799
helpful comments that, you know, that people
really want this. So, after it got a little

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.190
bit out of hand, we locked down the bug for
further comments and finally said, “Yes,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.240
okay. We’re working on extensions.”
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Somebody commented in the times

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.449
since we opened this up.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Uh-oh. Well, so today, I'm glad to

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:18.280
say that we're finally marking the bug fixed.
So, when we announced that we were starting

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.420
it, we got a lot sort of surprise reactions
from people saying that, “Not only don't

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.670
you have extensions, but you haven't even
started them yet.” Like, and the reason

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.750
that reaction was there was because a lot
of pioneering work that Firefox and the Mozilla

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.909
community have done to really make extensions
to be unexpected feature for the browser.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.810
So, it's now something that people demand
and people want in browsers. However, the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.560
problem with extensions is that when you build
them, they really depend on all the lowest

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.880
level parts of the browser. So, when we were
developing Chrome before we launched, lots

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.600
of stuff was moving around. It was pretty
chaotic and it wasn't really a good place

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.531
for us to start building extensions. It wasn't
until we released, that things got a little

00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:07.979
bit more stabilized, that we really had a
solid foundation to start building on. So,

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.150
one of the interesting side effects of waiting,
the way we did, was that we were open sourcing

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830
public from day one. With that means is that
our very first design document about extensions

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.670
was published from the Internet directly.
It was about a year ago in November. And since

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.150
then, we've been continuing to publish updates
and examples and sample code and get feedback

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.990
from the community, which helped keep us on
the right track. One of the other interesting

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.680
side effects of this is that a lot of you
in the audience probably got much earlier

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.361
access to the code than you would have otherwise
gotten. And in fact, the first extension that

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:44.000
was written outside of Google was written
literally hours after we checked in the code

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.189
that enabled it. It's been really exciting
to work this closely with the community and

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.769
we're really excited to keep working that
way going forward. So, when we started designing

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.330
Chrome Extensions, how do we start? We started
with Chrome’s design principles and said,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.850
“How can we make extensions that fit into
that?” Well, first, basically, we built

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.310
on the open Web. We worked hard to make them
Webby, this makes some fun and easy to develop.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.030
People can use their existing skills and it
grows with the Web platform. We kept the UI

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.760
streamlined. Chrome is all about wrapping
powerful functionality and a streamlined user

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.650
interphase. We believe that a fast browser
enables richer set of applications than could

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.819
be done before, and keeps people more productive.
And that's especially important today because

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.200
we're all spending a lot more time in front
of our browsers. Not only are we spending

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.970
more time but we're doing lots of things at
same time. We got a lot of Tabs and Windows

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.879
opened. So, it's important that the browser
remains stable. You don't want it to crash

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.360
and lose all your work, and so it's important
that a single extension can't take down your

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.299
browser. Further today, we're doing many more
of our more sensitive activities online as

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.500
well, whether it's just email or paying bills
or doing your taxes. It's important that the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.310
browser stays secure. So, an extension that's
insecure shouldn’t be able to compromise

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.670
this core security of the browser itself.
So, what are extensions anyway? Extensions

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.250
are just Zip files that are collections of
Web pages and their associated resources,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.590
like, images and CSS files. So, if you remember
one thing from today's presentation, this

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.380
should be it. Extensions are just Web pages.
And a lot of really cool things fall out of

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.370
this as a result. First, extensions are really
easy to write. It's easy as writing a Web

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.690
page. If you're a Web developer, you get to
reuse all your existing skills and knowledge.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.760
You can use all of the powerful tools that
you’re used to using to develop Web pages

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.900
to build extensions. You can also take advantage
of the largest developer community in the

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.501
world for any platform. The Web platform has
more developers than any other platform. On

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:59.390
top of that with Chrome, you can take advantage
of future looking technologies. Things that

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.810
are--that are--that normally wouldn’t necessarily
see as much of in the WildWeb, HTML5, Workers,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.250
Canvas, video, Web sockets, things from WebKit,
CSS3, you know, reflections and gradients,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.220
lots of cool stuff that we take for granted
on the Chrome team, but maybe you're out seeing

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.160
in the WildWeb. And you get to depend on having
lightning fast JavaScript in your browser

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.440
with V8.
