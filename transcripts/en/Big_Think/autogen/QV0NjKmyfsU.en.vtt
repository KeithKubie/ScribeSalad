so this question about the inevitability

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370
so this question about the inevitability
 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.340
so this question about the inevitability
of evolution the extent to which the

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350
of evolution the extent to which the
 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.560
of evolution the extent to which the
outcomes we see in the world today were

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570
outcomes we see in the world today were
 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.480
outcomes we see in the world today were
destined to occur has a number of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490
destined to occur has a number of
 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.520
destined to occur has a number of
implications I mean just most generally

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530
implications I mean just most generally
 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.609
implications I mean just most generally
it is it tells us whether how fated

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
it is it tells us whether how fated
 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.040
it is it tells us whether how fated
evolution was to occur how how the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050
evolution was to occur how how the
 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.549
evolution was to occur how how the
outcome today was destined in a way but

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:24.559
outcome today was destined in a way but
 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.799
outcome today was destined in a way but
it has other implications as well that

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:26.809
it has other implications as well that
 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.630
it has other implications as well that
people have long speculated about and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640
people have long speculated about and
 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.150
people have long speculated about and
that is what would life be like on other

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160
that is what would life be like on other
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.610
that is what would life be like on other
planets if it is evolved would it be

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620
planets if it is evolved would it be
 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.979
planets if it is evolved would it be
like the world today here on earth or

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989
like the world today here on earth or
 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.890
like the world today here on earth or
would it be completely different and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900
would it be completely different and
 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.830
would it be completely different and
this this question has taken on some

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840
this this question has taken on some
 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480
this this question has taken on some
increased urgency or at least interest

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490
increased urgency or at least interest
 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.400
increased urgency or at least interest
in recent years because we now realize

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410
in recent years because we now realize
 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.130
in recent years because we now realize
that there are many planets out there

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
that there are many planets out there
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.840
that there are many planets out there
that are like earth we used to think

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850
that are like earth we used to think
 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.670
that are like earth we used to think
that earth was perhaps unique and so

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680
that earth was perhaps unique and so
 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.550
that earth was perhaps unique and so
perhaps life as we know it is unique

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560
perhaps life as we know it is unique
 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.050
perhaps life as we know it is unique
because we're the only place that it

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060
because we're the only place that it
 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.550
because we're the only place that it
could evolve but quite the contrary

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560
could evolve but quite the contrary
 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.680
could evolve but quite the contrary
we've now discovered that there are lots

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690
we've now discovered that there are lots
 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.229
we've now discovered that there are lots
of what are called habitable exoplanets

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239
of what are called habitable exoplanets
 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.479
of what are called habitable exoplanets
some people estimate millions even

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489
some people estimate millions even
 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.940
some people estimate millions even
billions just in our own Milky Way

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950
billions just in our own Milky Way
 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.819
billions just in our own Milky Way
galaxy so if that's the case if there

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829
galaxy so if that's the case if there
 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.219
galaxy so if that's the case if there
are that many earth-like planets and by

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229
are that many earth-like planets and by
 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.010
are that many earth-like planets and by
earth-like I mean about the same size

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020
earth-like I mean about the same size
 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.050
earth-like I mean about the same size
temperature atmosphere somewhat similar

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
temperature atmosphere somewhat similar
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.690
temperature atmosphere somewhat similar
running water roughly similar conditions

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
running water roughly similar conditions
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.370
running water roughly similar conditions
if there are really that many earth-like

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380
if there are really that many earth-like
 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.709
if there are really that many earth-like
planets many people think that it's very

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719
planets many people think that it's very
 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.289
planets many people think that it's very
likely that life has evolved on them and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299
likely that life has evolved on them and
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.300
likely that life has evolved on them and
so the question is what will that life

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310
so the question is what will that life
 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.929
so the question is what will that life
look like well there are those who argue

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939
look like well there are those who argue
 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.269
look like well there are those who argue
that because from the argument of

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279
that because from the argument of
 

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.559
that because from the argument of
convergent evolution they argue that

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569
convergent evolution they argue that
 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.779
convergent evolution they argue that
that species facing the same conditions

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789
that species facing the same conditions
 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.120
that species facing the same conditions
here on earth evolved the same so the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
here on earth evolved the same so the
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.969
here on earth evolved the same so the
same solutions by natural selection they

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979
same solutions by natural selection they
 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.129
same solutions by natural selection they
extrapolate to say if conditions on

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139
extrapolate to say if conditions on
 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:50.379
extrapolate to say if conditions on
other planets are similar to here then

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389
other planets are similar to here then
 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.449
other planets are similar to here then
we would see very similar life-forms

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459
we would see very similar life-forms
 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.330
we would see very similar life-forms
that plant that you arrive on whatever

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
that plant that you arrive on whatever
 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.059
that plant that you arrive on whatever
planet you'll see animal animal and

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069
planet you'll see animal animal and
 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.429
planet you'll see animal animal and
plant like organisms that look very

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439
plant like organisms that look very
 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.859
plant like organisms that look very
familiar some people have gone so far as

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869
familiar some people have gone so far as
 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.669
familiar some people have gone so far as
to say that in fact human type organism

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679
to say that in fact human type organism
 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.800
to say that in fact human type organism
humanoids will occur on other planets

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810
humanoids will occur on other planets
 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.240
humanoids will occur on other planets
that there will be intelligent beings

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250
that there will be intelligent beings
 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.250
that there will be intelligent beings
that if we saw them they would be

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
that if we saw them they would be
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.080
that if we saw them they would be
recognizable which of course is what

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
recognizable which of course is what
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030
recognizable which of course is what
Hollywood tells us if you watch almost

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040
Hollywood tells us if you watch almost
 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.490

the intelligent life forms bipedal a
 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.310
the intelligent life forms bipedal a
couple of arms a mouth I mean maybe they

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320
couple of arms a mouth I mean maybe they
 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.840
couple of arms a mouth I mean maybe they
only have three fingers and pointy ears

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850
only have three fingers and pointy ears
 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.310
only have three fingers and pointy ears
and they're green but they're pretty

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320
and they're green but they're pretty
 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.080
and they're green but they're pretty
humanoid and so some people say yes

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090
humanoid and so some people say yes
 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.230
humanoid and so some people say yes
that's actually very likely that that

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
that's actually very likely that that
 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.230
that's actually very likely that that
humans are a very successful life-form

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240
humans are a very successful life-form
 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.240
humans are a very successful life-form
here on earth that we are extremely well

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250
here on earth that we are extremely well
 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.130
here on earth that we are extremely well
adapted to our environment which

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140
adapted to our environment which
 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620
adapted to our environment which
ancestrally was occurring on the plains

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630
ancestrally was occurring on the plains
 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.470
ancestrally was occurring on the plains
of Africa but we adapted so exquisitely

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480
of Africa but we adapted so exquisitely
 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.420
of Africa but we adapted so exquisitely
that we now dominate the world so if

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
that we now dominate the world so if
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.370
that we now dominate the world so if
this is such a good adaptation here on

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
this is such a good adaptation here on
 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.530
this is such a good adaptation here on
earth it would similarly be a good

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
earth it would similarly be a good
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.290
earth it would similarly be a good
adaptation on another planet and

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300
adaptation on another planet and
 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.610
adaptation on another planet and
evolution would would be likely to take

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
evolution would would be likely to take
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530
evolution would would be likely to take
the similar course that is the argument

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
the similar course that is the argument
 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.620
the similar course that is the argument
that is being made in some quarters now

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630
that is being made in some quarters now
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.940
that is being made in some quarters now
not everyone is convinced by this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950
not everyone is convinced by this
 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.340
not everyone is convinced by this
argument that evolution is deterministic

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350
argument that evolution is deterministic
 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.230
argument that evolution is deterministic
we recognize that convergent evolution

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240
we recognize that convergent evolution
 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.780
we recognize that convergent evolution
does occur more than we used to realize

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790
does occur more than we used to realize
 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.300
does occur more than we used to realize
but still it is argued and I agree with

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
but still it is argued and I agree with
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.730
but still it is argued and I agree with
this viewpoint it's not inevitable and

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740
this viewpoint it's not inevitable and
 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.340
this viewpoint it's not inevitable and
the reason is that there are often

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350
the reason is that there are often
 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.040
the reason is that there are often
multiple ways to adapt to the same

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050
multiple ways to adapt to the same
 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.380
multiple ways to adapt to the same
environmental circumstance and so even

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390
environmental circumstance and so even
 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.720
environmental circumstance and so even
though species are faced with the same

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730
though species are faced with the same
 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.030
though species are faced with the same
conditions they may find different ways

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
conditions they may find different ways
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.820
conditions they may find different ways
to adapt to them and my favorite example

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830
to adapt to them and my favorite example
 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.800
to adapt to them and my favorite example
of that has to do with a bird that

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810
of that has to do with a bird that
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.600
of that has to do with a bird that
everyone knows the woodpecker and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610
everyone knows the woodpecker and
 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.400
everyone knows the woodpecker and
everyone's heard that cat that that of a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410
everyone's heard that cat that that of a
 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.590
everyone's heard that cat that that of a
woodpecker on a tree or on your on your

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600
woodpecker on a tree or on your on your
 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.870
woodpecker on a tree or on your on your
garage siding or whatever people don't

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880
garage siding or whatever people don't
 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.520
garage siding or whatever people don't
actually know what the woodpecker is

these chiseling incisors that are very
 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.390
these chiseling incisors that are very
strong and they bite their way through

strong and they bite their way through
 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.220
strong and they bite their way through
the wood and bite into the wood until

the wood and bite into the wood until
 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.050
the wood and bite into the wood until
they get the tunnel and then once they

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060
they get the tunnel and then once they
 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.940
they get the tunnel and then once they
get there they then use their finger

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950
get there they then use their finger
 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.710
get there they then use their finger
again they stick it in there and they

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720
again they stick it in there and they
 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.530
again they stick it in there and they
snag the larvae and pull it out and so

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540
snag the larvae and pull it out and so
 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.060
snag the larvae and pull it out and so
they're doing the exactly the same thing

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070
they're doing the exactly the same thing
 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.830
they're doing the exactly the same thing
that the woodpecker is doing but they've

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840
that the woodpecker is doing but they've
 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.690
that the woodpecker is doing but they've
evolved a completely different set of

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700
evolved a completely different set of
 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.880
evolved a completely different set of
adaptations and so that's just one

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890
adaptations and so that's just one
 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.130
adaptations and so that's just one

the same thing in very different ways
 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.020
the same thing in very different ways
and we we see many examples of that in

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030
and we we see many examples of that in
 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.770
and we we see many examples of that in
the world conversely we also see many

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780
the world conversely we also see many
 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.260
the world conversely we also see many
examples of species that have no

that is very well adapted to where it
lives but no other species has done the

same thing and my favorite example of

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990
same thing and my favorite example of
 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.780
same thing and my favorite example of
that is the duck-billed platypus this

is exquisitely adapted to living in the
 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.540
is exquisitely adapted to living in the
streams in eastern Australia and so it

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550
streams in eastern Australia and so it
 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.630
streams in eastern Australia and so it
has very lush fur that allows it to swim

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640
has very lush fur that allows it to swim
 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.280
has very lush fur that allows it to swim
in the water that's basically almost at

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290
in the water that's basically almost at
 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.980
in the water that's basically almost at
freezing it has a powerful tail it's got

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
freezing it has a powerful tail it's got
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.380
freezing it has a powerful tail it's got
webbed feet for swimming and then most

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390
webbed feet for swimming and then most
 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.990
webbed feet for swimming and then most
extraordinarily it has this duck bill

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000
extraordinarily it has this duck bill
 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.120
extraordinarily it has this duck bill
now it's not actually it kind of looks

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130
now it's not actually it kind of looks
 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.710
now it's not actually it kind of looks
like a duck's bill but it's not hard

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720
like a duck's bill but it's not hard
 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.060
like a duck's bill but it's not hard
like a duck's bill it's actually

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.070
like a duck's bill it's actually
 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.570
like a duck's bill it's actually
leathery

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
leathery
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.150
leathery
but more importantly it's covered with

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160
but more importantly it's covered with
 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.700
but more importantly it's covered with
thousands of little receptors and these

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710
thousands of little receptors and these
 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.620
thousands of little receptors and these
receptors there's two types of them one

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630
receptors there's two types of them one
 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.230
receptors there's two types of them one
of them can detect slight variation in

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240
of them can detect slight variation in
 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.300
of them can detect slight variation in
ripples of water and so if something

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310
ripples of water and so if something
 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.580
ripples of water and so if something
goes swimming by they can detect it in

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590
goes swimming by they can detect it in
 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.810
goes swimming by they can detect it in
the water more but in addition they have

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820
the water more but in addition they have
 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.250
the water more but in addition they have
electro receptors they can detect very

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260
electro receptors they can detect very
 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.250
electro receptors they can detect very
slight electrical discharges and so when

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.260
slight electrical discharges and so when
 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.960
slight electrical discharges and so when
an animal moves its muscles there's a

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:53.970
an animal moves its muscles there's a
 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.640
an animal moves its muscles there's a
little bit of electrical activity and

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650
little bit of electrical activity and
 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.439
little bit of electrical activity and
the platypus can detect

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:57.449
the platypus can detect
 

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:58.790
the platypus can detect
that and so when it's swimming

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800
that and so when it's swimming
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.339
that and so when it's swimming
underwater it closes its eyes its ears

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:01.349
underwater it closes its eyes its ears
 

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:03.379
underwater it closes its eyes its ears
in its mouth but based on the receptors

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:03.389
in its mouth but based on the receptors
 

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:04.999
in its mouth but based on the receptors
on its bill it can find its way around

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:05.009
on its bill it can find its way around
 

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.610
on its bill it can find its way around
and it can locate its prey remarkable

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620
and it can locate its prey remarkable
 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.249
and it can locate its prey remarkable
adaptation to eating crayfish and and

00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259
adaptation to eating crayfish and and
 

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:12.769
adaptation to eating crayfish and and
other food items like that well so the

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:12.779
other food items like that well so the
 

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:14.390
other food items like that well so the
platypus lives in these streams that are

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400
platypus lives in these streams that are
 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.429
platypus lives in these streams that are
in no way remarkable there are streams

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:16.439
in no way remarkable there are streams
 

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:18.260
in no way remarkable there are streams
like that behind the house I grew up in

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.270

platypus evolved why is it that it

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620
platypus evolved why is it that it
 

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.989
platypus evolved why is it that it
evolved in Australia and nowhere else

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:26.999
evolved in Australia and nowhere else
 

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:29.739
evolved in Australia and nowhere else
well there are many examples of species

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:29.749
well there are many examples of species
 

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:32.209
well there are many examples of species
extremely well adapted but no parallel

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219
extremely well adapted but no parallel
 

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:34.670
extremely well adapted but no parallel
things like the chameleons elephants

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680

evolutionary Singleton's in fact humans

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.510
evolutionary Singleton's in fact humans
 

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.600
evolutionary Singleton's in fact humans
are an evolutionary singleton if we are

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:41.610
are an evolutionary singleton if we are
 

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.120
are an evolutionary singleton if we are
so well adapted to our environment why

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
so well adapted to our environment why
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.040
so well adapted to our environment why
didn't something like us evolve anywhere

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.050
didn't something like us evolve anywhere
 

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.480
didn't something like us evolve anywhere
else in the world why didn't they evolve

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.490
else in the world why didn't they evolve
 

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.670
else in the world why didn't they evolve
on Madagascar or in South America where

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680
on Madagascar or in South America where
 

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.100

monkeys colonized 40 million years ago
 

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.199
monkeys colonized 40 million years ago
and so this is the counterpart to the

00:08:54.199 --> 00:08:54.209
and so this is the counterpart to the
 

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:57.370
and so this is the counterpart to the
argument of evolutionary determinism and

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.380
argument of evolutionary determinism and
 

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.990
argument of evolutionary determinism and
and the convergence we could probably

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000
and the convergence we could probably
 

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.780
and the convergence we could probably
make a list just as long of species that

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:02.790
make a list just as long of species that
 

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.360
make a list just as long of species that
have not converged and so in many cases

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:05.370
have not converged and so in many cases
 

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.670
have not converged and so in many cases
evolution seems not to be deterministic

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680
evolution seems not to be deterministic
 

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.100
evolution seems not to be deterministic
that problems posed by the environment

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.110
that problems posed by the environment
 

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.230
that problems posed by the environment
may elicit different evolutionary

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240
