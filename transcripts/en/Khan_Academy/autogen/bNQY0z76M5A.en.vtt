00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440
 . 

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.930
 In this presentation, I will explain to you a method called 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.310
 Complete the box 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.490
 The wisest chin in this style is that it will succeed for any 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.210
 Quadratic equation, which is actually a basis 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 Quadratic formula 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 In the following presentation or presentation following this I will prove 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.630
 The quadratic formula is used by completing the square 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.450
 But before doing so, we will need to understand 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.470
 All about him 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 It really consists of what we did in another 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 View, where we solve the quadratic equations 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.130
 Using the Complete box 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.900
 Let's assume that I have the square equation x ^ 2 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.880
 - 4x = 5 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.490
 I will put this vacuum for a certain reason 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.680
 In the last presentation, we saw that these could be 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.200
 To be solved directly if the left side 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.500
 Full square 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.050
 As you can see, completing the box is a conversion 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.900
 The quadratic equation to a square is complete, to be engineered 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.190
 Add and subtract from both parties to become 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 Full square 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.710
 How can we do that? 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130
 Well, to make the left side a full square 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 There must be a number 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.510
 We must have a number here so that if you 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.910
 By quadrature I will get that number, and if I have 2 × 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.890
 Number, get -4 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 Remember that, I think it will 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.700
 It is clear through several examples 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.230
 I want x ^ 2 - 4x + something to equal x 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.740
 - a ^ 2 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.010
 We do not know what a value is after, but we do 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.110
 We know many things 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.180
 When I squirt things - this will be x ^ 2 - 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.330
 2a + a ^ 2 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.640
 If you look at this pattern here, it should be 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 - sorry, x ^ 2 - 2ax-- this should be 2ax 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.530
 This will be a ^ 2 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.690
 If this number, ie a will be half-4, that is a must 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.370
 That's -2, is not it? 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.570
 Because 2 × a is -4 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.330
 a = -2, and if a = -2, what is the value of a ^ 2? 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.550
 Well, a ^ 2 will be positive 4 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.220
 Perhaps all this seems complicated now 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.910
 But I will show you the rationale 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.080
 You look at this parameter here 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.670
 And you say, well, what is half that coefficient? 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.920
 Well, half that coefficient is -2 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.230
 We can say that a = -2 - same idea here - 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.720
 Then you square it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.100
 Ie you are squaring a, and you get a positive 4 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.540
 So add 4 positive here 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 Add 4 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.990
 Now, as we have done in the first equation 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.240
 You have to know that you can not do anything for one side only 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.900
 Of the equation 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 You can not add 4 to one side of the equation 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.710
 If x ^ 2 - 4x equals 5, then when we add 4 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.720
 Will not equal 5 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.950
 But will equal 5 + 4 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.430
 Add 4 to the left side because we want it 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.435
 To become a full square 

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:15.210
 But if we add something to the left side, we do 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.320
 To add it to the right side 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.630
 Now, we've got an issue 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.410
 The issues we solved are similar to the last 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.960
 What is this left side? 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.000
 Let me rewrite everything 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.020
 We now have x ^ 2 - 4x + 4 = 0 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.380
 All we did was add 4 to the sides of the equation 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.070
 But we added 4 for a specific goal, which is to become the left side 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.080
 Full square 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.760
 What is this now? 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.340
 What is the number that when you beat it yourself will be 4 and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.770
 When I combine it with the same output will be -2? 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.000
 Well, we've already answered that question 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.040
 He-2 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.310
 If we get (x - 2) (x - 2) = 0 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.350
 Or we can skip this step and write (x - 2) ^ 2 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.990
 = 0 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.280
 And then take the square root of both ends, and get x 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.840
 - 2 = + or - 3 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.870
 We add 2 for both sides, and we get x equal to 2 + or - 3 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 This tells us that x can be equal to 2 + 3, ie 5 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.960
 Or that x is equal to 2-3, ie -1 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 We're done 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.840
 I want to be clear now 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.300
 You can solve them without resorting to completing the box 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.640
 We can start with x ^ 2 - 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.850
 4x = 5 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.970
 We can subtract 5 from both sides and get x ^ 2 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.160
 - 4x - 5 = 0 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.940
 It can say, if I have -5 × 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.190
 Positive 1, so the result of their multiplication is -5 and their sum is 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.000
 4 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.800
 So I can say that these (x-5) (x + 1) 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.480
 = 0 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.810
 Thus we will say that x = 5 or x = 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.700
 -1 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.350
 In this case, this is probably 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.450
 Be a quicker way to solve the issue 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.140
 But the neat thing about completing the box is that 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.770
 Always succeeds 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.580
 Will always succeed regardless of transactions or 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.385
 Regardless of how difficult the matter is 

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:25.400
 Let me prove this to you 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.440
 Let's solve the issue 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.140
 Tough if we try to solve it 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.200
 Analysis of factors, especially if we solve them using aggregation or 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.020
 something like that 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:45.070
 Let's assume that we have 10x ^ 2 - 30x 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.530
 - 8 = 0 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.060
 Now, through the above, we can say, see 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.280
 Maybe we can divide both sides on 2 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.800
 This simplifies the equation slightly 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.450
 Let's divide both sides on 2 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.150
 If we divide everything on 2, what do we get? 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:11.990
 We get 5x ^ 2 - 15x - 4 = 0 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.540
 But again, we now have 5 in front of this 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.810
 The labs have to be solved using assembly, which is 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.410
 It is a tired method 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.410
 But we can now go directly to complete the box, even 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.500
 So I will divide both parties on 5 to get 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.870
 Parameter 1 here 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.660
 You will see why this is different from what 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.010
 We have done it traditionally 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.730
 If I divide everything by 5, I will be able to 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.050
 I swear on 10 from the beginning but I wanted to go to this 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.030
 Step up to make it clear to you that this 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.800
 We did not receive much 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.660
 Let us divide everything on 5 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:52.693
 If we divide everything by 5, we get x ^ 2 - 3x 

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:58.720
 - 4/5 = 0 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.020
 So maybe you'll say, why do we analyze the factors 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.630
 By aggregation? 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.140
 If we can always divide this factor 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.220
 We can get rid of that 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.840
 We can always convert this to 1 or -1 if we divide 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.910
 On the correct number 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.410
 But note, when you do this we'll get 4/5 here 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.630
 If it is very difficult to use analysis to factor here 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.500
 You'll have to say, what are the two numbers 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.100
 Their score is equal to -4.5? 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.210
 It's broken and when I take their total, it is 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.140
 -3? 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.310
 It's a difficult matter to analyze into its factors 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:36.860
 It is difficult to use analysis to factor here 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.080
 The best thing to do is to use the completed box 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.720
 So let's think a little bit about how we can transform this 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.950
 To a full box 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.080
 What better to do - you'll see the solution in several other ways 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.040
 I will explain to you all the ways because you will see that the teachers are using 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.880
 All the ways - better put the 4/5 on the other side 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.900
 So let's add 4/5 to both ends of this equation 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.980
 You do not have to follow this method, but I prefer to put the 4/5 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.160
 Away 

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.010
 Then what will we get if we add 4/5 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.250
 For both sides of this equation? 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.350
 The left side of the equation becomes x ^ 2 

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.800
 - 3x, without having 4/5 here 

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.660
 I'll leave some space here 

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.790
 This will equal 4/5 

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.990
 Now, as in the last issue, we will turn this 

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.350
 The left side of a double-edged equation is a square 

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.740
 how to do that? 

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.360
 Well, we say, what is the number we multiply by 2 and the sum is 

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.110
 -3? 

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.309
 Number of x 2 = -3 

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.330
 Or we take -3 and divide it by 2 

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.370
 This is equal to 3/2 

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.554
 Then we make positive 3/3 

00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:44.840
 If in this example, we will say that a = -3/2 

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.380
 If we squared 3/2, what do we get? 

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.100
 We get positive 9/4 

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.810
 I took half of this lab, and I squared it, and we got the 

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.010
 Positive 9/4 

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.720
 The purpose of doing this is to turn left side 

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.920
 To a full box 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.530
 Now, we do for a part of the equation, we have 

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.600
 We do the other side 

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.030
 If we add 9/4 here, so let's add 9/4 there 

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.850
 How do you become an equation? 

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:22.530
 We get x ^ 2 - 3x + 9/4 = - Let us see if 

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.460
 We can get a uniform denominator 

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.120
 4/5 equivalent to 16/20 

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.880
 We hit the rugs and the place with 4 

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.820
 + / 20 

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.960
 9/4 is equivalent to multiplying 

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.150
 Spread the B5 to get 45/20 

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.970
 How much is the product of 16 + 45? 

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.020
 As you can see, it becomes complex, but 

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.930
 I think it's fun 

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.380
 Complete the box at certain times 

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.420
 16 + 45 

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.780
 See that it's worth 55, 61 

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.750
 This is equal to 61/20 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.680
 Let me rewrite it 

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.480
 x ^ 2 + 3x + 9/4 = 61/20 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.030
 Complex number 

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.630
 Now this, at least what is on the left side 

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.970
 It is a complete square 

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:21.610
 This is equivalent to (x - 3/2) ^ 2 

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.200
 It has been for a purpose 

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.590
 -3/2 × -3/2 = positive 9/4 

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.790
 -3/2 + -3-2 = -3 

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.960
 If this box equals 61/20 

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.090
 We can take the square root of both sides and get x- 

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.820
 3/2 = + or - 

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.320
 Square root of 61/20 

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.640
 Now we can add 3/2 to both ends of this equation 

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.600
 We get x = positive 3/2 + or - 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.300
 Square root of 61/20 

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.290
 This number is complicated and I hope it is clear that you 

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.430
 You will not be able to - at least, I will not 

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.250
 I would be able - get this number by analyzing the factors 

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.260
 If you want its current value, you can extract it 

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.510
 Calculator 

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.620
 You extract the calculator 

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.510
 Then let me erase all this 

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.950
 . 

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.760
 And 3/2 - Let us deal with the positive image first. If we want to 

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.710
 We find 3 2 2 + the second square root 

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.050
 We will choose the yellow square root 

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:46.480
 The square root of 61 2 2, equals 3.24 

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.760
 This is a complex 3.2464, which will type only 3.246 

00:11:52.760 --> 00:12:02.230
 This is roughly 3.246, and these were 

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.110
 Positive image 

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.710
 Let's solve the subtraction 

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.180
 We can put the entrance - if you deal with the second and 

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.535
 Followed by the entrance, so that we want the entrance to be yellow, for this 

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:12.465
 Cause you press the second button 

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.130
 If you press the "Apply" button, I have put it where you put it, we can 

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:23.400
 We change the combination to subtract 

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.970
 We get -0.246 

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.800
 We get -0.246 

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.200
 And you can make sure they check 

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.360
 The original equation 

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.050
 The original equation was above here 

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.840
 Let me check out one of them 

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.400
 - Let's assume that we have-- 

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.130
 If the second answer on the graph machine is 

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.760
 The last answer we used 

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.160
 If you use a variable answer, that is the number 

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160
 Here 

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.090
 If I have a square answer - I use the answer 

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.380
 Which represents -0.24 

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:11.975
 Answer box -3 × Answer -4/5 - 4. 

00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:16.030
 5 - equals 

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.490
 - This is some clarification 

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.860
 It does not store the entire number, it turns into 

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.880
 Fairly rounded 

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.910
 It stores a certain number of homes 

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.930
 So when you calculate it using this number stored here 

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.240
 You get 1 x 10 ^ -14 

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.980
 If this equals 0.0000 

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.100
 13 0 and then followed by 1 

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.870
 Decimal point, followed by 13 zero and 1 

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.060
 There are many zeros 

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.550
 Or in fact, if you get the exact answer here, if 

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.480
 You made an infinite rounding here, or 

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.050
 Maybe if you keep this root image, you'll get 

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.390
 That 's really worth 

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.300
 I hope you have found this assistant, any concept 

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.160
 Complete the whole box 

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.670
 Now we will expand it to the current quadratic equation formula 

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.510
 Which we can use, we can connect 

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.610
 Things to solve the quadratic equation 

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.266
 .
