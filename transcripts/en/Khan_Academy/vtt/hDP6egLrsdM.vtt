00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.650
- So I have an interesting system over here.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.520
I have two compartments, on the left compartment

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.750
I have a gas that is at a temperature of T sub a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.550
and on the right side of this I have gas

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.050
that is a temperature of T sub b

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.850
and they are separated by a wall of depth, d,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.020
or I guess you say of thickness, d,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.420
and the contact area of the wall,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.820
or the contact area of the gas onto the wall

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.890
that area is A, and I'm just drawing

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.520
a section of it, we're assuming that

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.750
these two compartments are completely separated.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.390
Now what I am curious about, and we're

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.580
going to assume that the temperature on the left

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.950
is higher than the temperature on the right,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.290
and so because of that you're going to have

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.850
a transfer of thermal energy from the left to the right,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.890
and that thermal energy that gets transferred

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.320
we call that heat, and we'll denote that with the letter Q,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.420
I'm curious about how does the rate

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.020
at which heat is transferred, or so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.550
how much heat is transferred per unit time,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.090
that's the rate at which heat is transferred,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.150
how would that change depending on

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.680
how we change these different variables.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.560
So for example, if our, if our area,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460
if our contact area were to go up

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.150
what would that do for Q over t?

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.490
Well then Q over t would also increase per unit time

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.520
'cause I have, I have more area for these

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.290
hot molec--these hot air particles or hot air molecules

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.080
to bump into and they'll heat that wall

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.820
and then there will be more heated wall

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.890
to heat up the colder air particles.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.120
So in that case our rate of heat transfer would also go up.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.420
Well what if we, what if we, and obviously if I made

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.520
my area smaller, maybe I should just write that explicitly,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.820
if I made my contact area smaller then my rate

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.350
of heat transfer, my rate of heat transfer

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.520
would go down, and that feels like common sense.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.320
Now what about, what about the thickness?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.850
If I were to make it, if I were to make

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.150
the thickness larger, if I were to make this a thicker wall,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.490
what would that do to my rate of heat transfer?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.250
Well then I would have, I would have more

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.950
things that I would have to heat up to get it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.530
to a certain temperature before I can,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.720
which then can heat up the particles on the right,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.250
and obviously this is a continuous process,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.390
it'll always be happening, but there will just be more

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.720
stuff to heat up and it's going to take longer

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690
and more of that, and more of that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.520
more of that kinetic energy, that average

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.550
kinetic energy is going to get dissipated

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.210
in this wall so if this wall becomes thicker,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.200
if the wall becomes thicker then the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.150
rate of heat transfer is going to go down,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.920
or if you, if the wall became thinner,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.890
if this depth decreased then the rate of heat transfer,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.550
then the rate of heat transfer would go up.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.780
So you could say the rate of heat transfer

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.240
is going to be inversely proportional

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.120
to the thickness of this wall.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.850
Now what else could we think about?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.450
Well we could think about the temperature differential,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.880
the temperature differential, that's T sub a minus,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.400
minus T sub b, minus T sub b.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.890
Well if this temperature differential, if this

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.090
temperature differential were to go up,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.720
well what's going to happen?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320
Well it's common sense that well if this is super hot,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.890
if this is super hot over here, this is way hotter

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.080
than what we have on the right,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.320
well we're going to have more heat transferred

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.650
so the rate of heat transfer, you're going to have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.050
more heat transferred per unit time,

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.890
your rate of heat transfer is going to go up.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.810
And likewise, if this differential were to go down

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.920
and you could take the extreme case

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.620
if there was no differential,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.550
if T sub a was the same as T sub b

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.920
then you would have no heat transfer

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.050
frankly in any unit of time.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.920
So it makes sense that the rate of heat transfer

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.050
is going to be proportional to the temperature differential.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680
So how can we encapsulate all of this intuition

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.770
into maybe a formula for describing

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.350
thermal conductivity, for thinking about

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.720
how quickly some, how quickly this heat

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.350
will be transferred, the rate of heat transfer?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.650
Well we could say the rate of heat transfer,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.050
and this is really, hopefully you know comes out of

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.250
a little bit of common sense or intuition

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.970
of what would happen here, the rate of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.190
heat transfer, I could say it's going to be proportional to

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.150
well, what are the things it's going to be proportional to?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.090
It's going to be proportional to the area,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.990
the more surface area we have on this wall,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.820
more contact area, the more heat we're going

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.649
to have transferred per unit time,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.420
so it's going to be proportional to that contact area.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.680
It's also going to be proportional to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.990
the temperature differential so let's multiply

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.190
this times the temperature differential,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.690
so T sub a minus T sub b,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.370
minus T sub b,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.050
and it's inversely proportional to

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.150
the thickness of the wall so all of that

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.450
over the thickness of the wall.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.820
And now another thing that you might be saying,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.780
okay I have this proportionality constant

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.920
but wouldn't this be different for different materials?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.920
For example, if this was a metal wall

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.990
wouldn't this conduct the heat quicker

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.750
than if this was a wood wall?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.960
And you would be correct, a metal wall would

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.790
and so this K, this K right over here,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.650
this is dependent, this is dependent on

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.150
the material, so what is the wall made of.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.740
So material...

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.580
material of the wall,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.250
and you can actually, you can actually

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.560
measure this thing and different materials

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.850
will have different thermal conductivities,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.610
which this, which this variable

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.120
right over here would actually represent.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.720
So going through a little bit of intuition

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.350
we were able to come up with what looks like

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.150
a fancy formula, and you will sometimes see

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.920
this formula, formula for thermal conductivity

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.320
through a solid barrier but it really comes out of

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.120
hopefully common sense, the rate of,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.420
the amount of heat transferred per time

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.020
is going to be proportional to,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.620
and the proportionality constant is going

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.450
to be dependent on the material.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.550
Styrofoam for example would be very low here,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.830
that's why coolers are made out of Styrofoam,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.890
and it's going to be dependent on the area,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.420
it's going to be proportional to the area,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.920
the temperature differential, and then

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.320
inversely proportional to the thickness.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.010
So if you wanted to really insulate something

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.520
you would want to minimize the surface area

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.750
and you would want to, and you would want to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.010
maximize the thickness and you would want to

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.290
have something with a very low thermal conductivity,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.860
so a thick Styrofoam wall that's maybe shaped in a sphere

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.740
might be a pretty good container for keeping

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.401
something hot or for keeping something cool.
