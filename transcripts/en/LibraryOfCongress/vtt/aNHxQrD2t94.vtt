00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.170
&gt;&gt; Nicholas A. Brown: We're very
pleased to have you this evening

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.020
for a special talk
which is well time

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.410
for Valentine's Day this
weekend and if you're skeptical

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.250
about Valentine's Day,
that's fine too,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.910
it's going to provide a very
simulating intellectual experience

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.210
to learn about the
history of something

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.890
that we've often put
into a kitsch category.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.520
So we're very pleased to have

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.190
with us today Musician
and Scholar, Ted Gioia.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.100
Ted has published nine nonfiction
books related to various topics

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
in music and he's most known
for his writing on jazz.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.560 position:56%
His recently released book is called
"Love songs, the Hidden History,"

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.470
published by Oxford
University Press,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.230
the Dallas Morning News
puts forth that Ted is one

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.960
of the Outstanding Music Historians
in America which is a very bold

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.230
and fitting statement for his work.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.980
He has served on the faculty of
Stanford University and written

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.000
for many publications both digital

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.470
and print including the
New York Times, L.A. Times,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.900
Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.110
and he's currently a
columnist for The Daily Beast.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960
His major work that has sold

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.780
over a hundred thousand copies
is called The History of Jazz

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.240
and it is one of the foremost,
if not the foremost survey

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.020
of jazz that exist in print.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.480
Luckily enough this evening,
Ted is going to sign some books

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.240
for us all if we're interested.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.820
We have for sale over there Love
Songs and the History of Jazz,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.150
History of Jazz is
available for $18 discounted

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.300 position:56%

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.780
Ted has a wonderful
and varied background

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.850 position:56%
as you can see in his extensive Bio.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.570 position:56%
He's also accomplished as a
performer and has several recordings

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.770
and he also has a new book coming
out soon called "How to listen

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.270
to Jazz" which will be
released this Spring,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.510
without further ado, Ted Gioia

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.650
[ Applause ]

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.500
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: Good evening,
thank you for coming out on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.870
such a chilly night, as Nick
said, I've done many things

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.440
but my primary vocation
is music historian.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.280
And as a music historian,
my responsibility is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.320
to ask the big questions on music.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.780
So I'd like to start tonight

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.400
by asking what I think
might be the biggest of all.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.950
And it's a simple one.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.460
Can music change your life?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.480
Can songs change your life?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.640
Or let me raise it to a
slightly higher level.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.530
Could music change the
life of the community?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.510
Or let me raise it to
a still higher level,

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.330
could music change the
life of a whole society?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.620
And if I put this question in
the biggest, broadest terms,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.370
it's can music change
the course of history?

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.140
Now I think that's an
important question,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.010
but it's not a question
we're familiar with.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.170
We rarely hear people ask this kind
of question, even music scholars.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.080
And I think there's
a reason for that.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.450
In our society we tend to view
music as mere entertainment.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.780
It's a diversion, it's a past time.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.480
It's something we do when
we want to escape from life.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.370
We don't look at music
to change our life.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.820
We more often look at music
to get away from life.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.390
It's something we do
after the responsibilities

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690
of the days are done.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.200
But if you push that
view to an extreme,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.590
you get to some strange endpoints.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.720
For example, there's a professor
at Harvard Steven Pinker,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.730
a very eminent professor and what
he says is that the sole purpose

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.080
of music is to stimulate the
brain, brain stimulation.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.500
In fact, he calls music
auditory cheese cake.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.040
That's his term, auditory
cheese cake.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.350
And he says that listening to
music is essentially no different

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.640
than drinking a martini or
playing a video game or to cite one

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.040
of his specific examples
choosing recreational drugs,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.210
recreational drugs.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.400
And I think a lot of us are uneasy
about that kind of comparison.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.190
I think those of us who
really care about music,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.600
those of us who have devoted our
lifetime to music we're uneasy

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.070
with the idea that there's
no essential difference

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.500
between a Beethoven Symphony and
say a line of cocaine or LSV,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.040
and we just-- something about
that doesn't feel right.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.220
And I disagree with
Steven Pinker on this

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.040
but I do believe he has
captured the zeitgeist.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.240
I believe he has captured the
way music is perceived nowadays

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.370
in most cultures.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.640
Music is not something of
transcendent importance,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.510
it's just entertainment,
it's just diversion.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.130
But as soon as you walk away
from contemporary culture,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.640
and you take a bigger view, if
you take a larger view of music,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.050 position:56%
you'll see something very different.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.550
You find a very different
attitude towards music.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.030
I would like to quote an individual
named James Chalmers [assumed

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.670
spelling], he was a missionary that
many years ago lived in New Guinea.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.980
And while he was there,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.120
he was trying to document
the local culture.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.470
And he was talking to one
of the musical performers,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.140
a drummer of the Motu tribe,
asking about the music.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.670
And the drummer said
something to him I like.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.020
He said, "The drums are
never beaten uselessly.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.050
The drums are always
played with a purpose.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.260
No dance is ever danced uselessly.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.870
Every dance has its purpose".

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.400
Now this is a very different view

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.900
from the auditory cheese
cake view, no?

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.710 position:56%
And if you look at other traditional
cultures, traditional societies,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.500
you see the same thing, no matter
where you are, whether you walk

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.570
to South America, Asia, Africa.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.870
You take for example
Native American culture.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:31.510
I often turn to the works of
three female ethnomusicologist,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.190
who wrote extensively about Native
American music, Natalie Curtis,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.320
Alice Fletcher and a woman who
is a particular hero of mine,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.640
Frances Densmore who
devoted decades of her life

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.380
to documenting Native
American music.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.050
And at home, I've got a
whole shelf of her books.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.240
And it's sad to say every one
of these books is out of print.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.090
Every one of these books
is out of print, just sad.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.500
But she went over period
of years from community

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.990
to community documenting songs
that she saw were disappearing.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.350
And she wanted to document
them before they disappear.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.650
And over the course of her life,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.230
she probably documented
thousands of songs.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.920
And every one of them
had its purpose.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.940
Some of these songs
helped the crops grow.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.160
Some of the songs prepared
warriors to go into battle.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.010
Some of the songs were
involved in healing.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.220
Some of the songs preserved
tribal war,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.430
or used to educate
the next generation.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.730
Some of the songs were involved
in courtship and marriage.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.310
But every song had its purpose.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.740
Every song had its meaning.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.710 position:56%
And if you look at other traditional
cultures in music in most times

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.500
and places, you see the same thing.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.960
You see exactly the same thing.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.440 position:56%
And I know that most of us nowadays,
we feel that we're too sophisticated

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.450 position:56%
for this, we're too sophisticated
to believe that music heals the sick

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.250
or that music helps the crops grow.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.060
But speaking on the basis
of a person who has looked

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.610
at these issues for almost
25 years, I can tell you,

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.540
you might be surprised at
the scientific evidence.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.840
You might be surprised.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.100
You know, a couple of years
ago, my son was is in 8th grade

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.700
and he had to do a science project.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.600
And I don't know about what
it's like here but where I am,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.510 position:56%
science projects usually involve the
parents, the parents are the ones

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.310
that are doing a lot of
these science projects.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.820
So I said to him, why don't you
see if music helps a plant grow?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.160
So we set up two plants.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.670
We had plant A, plant B and
one the plants got music.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.970
I think it was Glenn Gould
playing the Goldberg Variations.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.320
The other plant got no music.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.490
And surprise, surprise, the
plant that got music grew more.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.290
But it's not really surprising
because there's been a huge amount

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.680
of scientific evidence that
has studied exactly this.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.200
Plants like music.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.320
They actually have
musical preferences.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.020
Sometimes they will lean towards
certain music or they'll lean,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.230
like heavy metal music, they
will lean away against you know,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.470
but some songs they
will lean towards.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.330
And if you move the speakers,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.000
the plant will change
the direction it grows.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.090 position:56%
So maybe, music does help the plants
grow or does music heal the sick?

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.350
I know we think we're above those
superstations but once again,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.690
you might be surprised
at the evidence,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.460
for example Dr. Barry Bittman did a
study a few years ago and he found

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.230
that just playing the
drums in a drumming circle

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.860
for 10 minutes changes
your body chemistry,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.080
your immune system strengthened,
the white blood cell count goes up,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.610
the body chemistry
changes completely,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.030
just playing the drums
for 10 minutes.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.800
Now, I'd like to say that music
is technology for cultures

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.790
that don't have semi-conductors
and rocketships.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.710
Music is the first technology.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.630
And if I had time, I could give
you hundreds of examples of music

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.130
as technology, solving
problems for cultures.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.230
And even if we go back to
the heart of Western Culture,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.780
if we go back to the origins

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.500
of western culture,
we see the same thing.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.010
Now let's go back to Aristotle,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.300
you can't get much more
old school than Aristotle.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.070
Aristotle wrote a book
called "The Politics".

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.750
This is one of the two foundational
books in political science.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.450
If you study ancient
political science,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.340
you'll read "Plato's Republic"
and Aristotle's "Politics".

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.320
And in Aristotle's "Politics",
he talks at length about music.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.400
Now that's surprising
to begin with, isn't it?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.480
That in a book in politics,
Aristotle will write about music.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.010
And you wouldn't see that nowadays.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:47.670
You wouldn't tune into
these candidate debates,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.510
these interminable
candidate debates.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.220
And hear them talking about music.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.280
You wouldn't tune in to
CNN on election night

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.120
and hear them talking about songs.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.060
But Aristotle thought that
politics and music went together.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.750
And for a very good reason,
he thought that music was one

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.160
of the four planks of a good
education to prepare people

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.020
to participate in society.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.920
They were verbal skills
in rhetoric, gymnastics

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.260
and athletics, visual
arts and music.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.860
Aristotle thought those were
the four planks of education.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.130
And he writes at the link
why music is so important.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.430
And it gives us reasons.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.730
So I think these are
important to consider.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:32.230
He says first of all, that
music instills virtue in people,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.650
he says music built our character.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:43.170
He says music makes work less
toilsome with the worker.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.450
Music uplifts our spirits.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.810
He goes on and on and then at
the very end, at the very end

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.330
of his list, he says and
yes it is entertaining.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.080
But this is at the end so
you can see for Aristotle,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.370
this is almost the least important
thing, the entertainment value.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.240
All these other things
are more important.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.180
And if I had to describe my
vocation as a music historian,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.300
I would say I have tried to take
Aristotle seriously because I think

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.910
in society today, we have
flip-flopped Aristotle.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.980
All these other things
we've forgotten about.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.380
We know that music is entertaining

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.170
and there's a whole
entertainment industry,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.250
multibillion-dollar
entertainment industry

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.820
that controls how we
think about music.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.240
But it misses all these
other factors.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.920
It misses them.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.530
Even the word Aristotle uses
sounds strange to us now.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.490
When is the last time you're
in a conversation with somebody

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.790
and you used the word virtue.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.480
When is the last time you were
in a conversation with somebody

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.260
that uses the word character?

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.880
Those words have disappeared
from our discourse.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.710
But that's a-- that's
a different talk.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.240 position:56%
That's a subject for a different
day, I'll just talk about music now.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.500
So I've tried to take Aristotle
seriously and I've tried to focus

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.560
on the way music has these ardor
power, these transcending powers,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.860
because I believe music is a
source of enchantment in our life.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.540
I believe music is a
source of transformation.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.380
I believe music is a change agent.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.780
It changes things.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.060
And I can still remember
when I first got this notion.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.840
I can still remember when
I first got this notion.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.680
This was sort of a turning
point for me as a music writer.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.980
And this happened many years ago.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.820
And it was due to a person who
really changed my mind about music.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.230
It was a person I never
met, a person I never met.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.980
His name Arthur Danto
[assumed spelling].

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:50.050
And Arthur Danto was
an interesting fellow.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.860
He had two careers,
two separate careers.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.350
On the one hand, he
was a philosopher,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.030
a very good philosopher.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.300
He taught philosophy
at Columbia University.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.950
He was one of the great
philosophers of this generation.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:07.270
But in his 60's, he
embarked on a new career.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.080
He decided he wanted
to be an art critic.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.880 position:56%
So at the age of 63, Arthur Danto, a
famous philosopher, started writing

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.650
about painting sculpture.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.230
He visit art galleries,
he'd write an art

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.860
for the Nation and
other periodicals.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.170
So very and he's a very
good art critics then.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.520
And when he wrote about art, it was
with a sophistication and a depth

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.640
of understanding you
rarely encounter in critics.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.690
And I think it's because
he had this large amount

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.100
of philosophical thinking
in his head.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.330
And he wrote an essay
at the end of the 1980s.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.690
So we're just going
back some time here.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.250
That really shook me out.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.080
The essay was about the
end of the history of art.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.230
And Danto was saying the history
of art was coming to an end,

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.650
which is a strange thing to say.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.370
And I'm reading this now, what
does he mean that the history

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.970
of art is coming to an end?

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.130
Is he saying that people aren't
going to paint pictures anymore?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.810
No, he's not saying that.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.990 position:56%
Is he saying that all the good
paintings have already been painted,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.860
that there are no more
good paintings to paint?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.160
No, he's not saying that either.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.460
What he is saying is that art

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.230
as a historical progression,
is going away.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.720
We have this notion in our minds

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.200
that art progresses
almost like a science.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.960
If you look at the words we
used when we talked about art,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.520
some art is avant garde, it's
ahead of everything else.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.990
Some art is progressive.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.540
We have this idea on our head
that art progress like a science.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.650
This idea has been
around roughly 500 years.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.180
If you go back before that, people
didn't believe art progresses.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.420
If you go into the medieval times,
and you ask an expert about art,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.830
and there were not
many experts on art

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.170
but maybe some monk doing some
illuminated manuscript or whatever.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.610
They would say art
is not progressing.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.400
Art was better back
in the old times.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.240
We're trying to preserve
what happened

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.460
in Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.650
There was no idea that
art progressed.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.590
But in the Renaissance,
things started to change.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.090
And the person who changed our view

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.190
on art is a fellow named Giorgio
Vasari who was an art historian.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.470
He was writing about
Renaissance art and he saw

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.300
that things now were
progressing, and he isolated

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.870
on a painter named Cimabue,
who we thought was the person

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.870
who really broke away from
the constrains of medieval art

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.550
and started making
painting more realistic.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.180
And then the next generation came,
there was a painter name Giotto

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:42.280
and Giotto took what Cimabue have
done and added new techniques

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.930
and passed these onto
Posteres [assumed spelling],

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.110 position:56%
and then you get Massaggio [assumed
spelling] who brings in new elements

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.940
of perspective, new
mathematical findings.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.500
And you see arts is progressing,
and then Leonardo da Vinci comes

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.130
with a golden triangle
and step by step,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.720
every generation, the
art progresses.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.690
And the same thing, you could say
it was happening in music as well.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.380
It's no exaggeration to say
that Mozart took what he learned

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.770 position:56%
from Haydn and added new techniques,

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.210
almost like if sciences would
have no findings and passed it

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.030 position:56%
on to the next generation, and then
Beethoven took from Mozart and added

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.070
to it and Moeller took from
Beethoven an added to it.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.670
And art, it looked like for
about 500 years progressed,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.970
but what Danto said is this all
stopped in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.510
Art stopped progressing.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:33.320
He was looking at Andy Warhol

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.760
and you see Warhol was painting
pictures of Campbell's Soup cans.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.010
So you can't say this is
progressing over Jackson Pollock,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.820
you know Jackson Pollock a
few years earlier was doing

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.120
abstract expression.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.050
He was actually taking cans of
paint and throwing it on canvasses.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.410
Well you can't say the soup
can is progressing from that.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.920
You can't say that Jackson
Pollock is progressing

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.850
from Salvador Dali's surrealism.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.120
I mean, art is changing but
it's changing the way the

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.420
weather changes.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.570
There's no more progress in art.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.510
And the same thing is true
in music he would claim.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.170
You can't say John Cage is building

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.340
on the foundations if
you're in Copeland.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.590
You can't say that
Philip Glass is building

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.980
on the foundations of John Cage.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.970
And so what Danto said is the
history of art as a progression,

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.150
stopped in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.270
There's no more progress in art.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:32.580
It might fluctuate the way
fashions out of Paris fluctuate.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.890
But there's no more progress.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.750
And then Danto said the
thing that shook me up.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.890
He said, "What do you do
now if you're an artist?"

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.530
If you're an artist
nowadays, what do you do?

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.350
He said well art has to go back

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.160
to what has always been
its primary purpose.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.290
Art has to go back to what has
always been its primary purpose.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.710
You're wondering what
is, what is this?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.600
What has always-- What is art?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.780
He says, art has to go back
to fulfilling human needs.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.450
Art has to meet human needs.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.750
Now I'm reading this back in 1989.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.130
I was a much younger man then.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.810
And I really have no idea
what he is talking about.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.100
You know, I'm trying to learn
to be a jazz pianist then,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.280
so I'm practicing how to play "I
Got Rhythm" changes on all 12 keys.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.960
Now what human needs,
am I needing doing that?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.830
I turn on the radio and
there's a Beatles song,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.100
you know what, human
needs being met.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.060
And I thought that Arthur
Danto was a smart guy

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.950
but I have no clue what
he is talking about here.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.520
But you know over the
next few years,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.950
as I researched music more
deeply, as I researched the history

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.680
of music more deeply, I understood
that Danto in fact was correct,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.170
that Danto was right that
in most times and places,

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.410
musicians are not trying
to be scientist,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.860
they're not trying
to create progress.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.030
They're integrated in the
life of their community.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.500
They are meeting human
beings on a daily basis.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.460
And then I began asking
myself this question.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.580
What would the history of
music look like if we wrote it

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.760 position:56%
from the perspective of human needs?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.110
What will the history of
music look like if we wrote it

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.980
from the perspective of everyday,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.560
people and how music entered
their life and changes their life,

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.100
you could just-- most music
history just focuses on Superstars.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.690
Most music history is
just about somebody

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.140
who wrote a work of
music for the king.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:37.140
I was hired by the Pope to write
a work or it's about somebody

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.300 position:56%
who plays at Carnegie Hall, or maybe
it's about a rock band that plays

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.150
on a foot ball stadium in front of
a hundred thousand screaming fans,

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.750
but that's just a tiny
slice of our musical lives.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.700
That's just a tiny slice
of our musical lives.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.880
You know, if we write music
history from that perspective,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.790
we miss most of what
music is all about.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.260
And so I've started saying
could I write music history

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.710
in a different way that
captures what really happens

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.320
in people's lives?

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.970
And so I can see the
first glimmerings of this,

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.240
I can see my own journal started
in 1991, it was 25 years ago.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.640 position:56%
I began studying and researching how
music changed the lives of people

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.990
in different societies,
different historical periods.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.010
And it was difficult,
it was complex.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.240
I was immersing myself
into all sorts of research

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.060
that normally musical historians
don't look at from ancient history,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.970
anthropology, folklore,
mythology, et cetera, et cetera.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.540
And gradually I began putting
together specific studies,

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.110
isolating specific strands
of our musical lives.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.660
And this first came to
fruition 10 years ago,

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.000
I published two books
on the same day.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.950
And also that is something
I will never do again,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.790
try to publish two
books on the same day.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.330
That is just too hard.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.470
But one was called work songs.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.660
It was the history of
music as it relates

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.880
to human labor throughout history.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.880
Then I wrote a second book called
"Healing Songs" about the role

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.350
of music in wellness and health.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.490
Once again throughout all
of human history starting

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.230
from pre-historic times
to present day.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.120 position:56%
And I published these and at that
point I said to finish this project,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.000
I have to go after
the biggest subject

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.470 position:56%
of them all, which is the love song.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.980
The love song, because if
you take seriously the notion

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.500
that music can change
people's lives, you really have

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.800
to look at the love song.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.450
You know at the very beginning
of my talk, I asked you,

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.060
can a song change your mind?

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.950
And I bet a lot of you
thought about love songs.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.340
I bet a lot of you thought about
love songs because that's a song

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.190
that has changed many
people's lives.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:47.710
You know, my younger
brother is a DJ.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:55.560
Actually he said many careers
that he's pursued over the years,

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.780
we have one thing in
common, anything he does

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.240
for job involves going to a party.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.880
So he's been like a bartender.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.510
He was a rapper.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.710
He would run casino nights, but
for the most part, he was a DJ

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.530
and he would play music
at gatherings.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.610
And he would tell me
when you provide music

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.360
at a wedding reception, the
most important thing is to go

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.060
to the couple and say
"What is your Song?"

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.390
What is your song because
every couple has a song.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.520
It's some song that brought them
together and if you are going

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.480
to be providing music at
their wedding reception,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.580
where I went they never
have live bands anymore,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.900
I don't know why no one hires live
bands anymore, what's going on?

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.350
And I got a teenaged
son in high school.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.770
He has never been to a dance
that had a live band performing,

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.070
it's always a DJ playing.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.080
Well anyway, if you provide
music at a wedding reception,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.150
you've got to play
the couple's song.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:50.970
The song brought them together,
and I think many of us have songs

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.760
like that too, that
brought us together.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.060
That I'll go further.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.320
I will say that many of
us would not be here today

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.700 position:56%
if our parents have not heard at a
certain point in time the right song

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.450
that created the right mood.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.900
You know, I was saying music
was technology for people

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.490
who didn't have semi-conductors.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.000
Well before they had those
little blue pills, and you needed

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.010
to create the right mood,
what did you rely on?

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:19.720
It was music.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.330
It was music, and there's a
lot of evidence to back this.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.170 position:56%
You know, I just read this morning,
just this morning I read a new study

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.710
that showed that when people
listen to music together,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:38.990
the hormone oxytocin is released in
their brain and it creates a sense

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.370
of trust and bonding
between the two of them.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.880
So the idea that the love
song brings people together,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.580
this is not just a wild
idea, this is body chemistry.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.010
Once again, music is a technology.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.660
It makes things happen.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.580
So I decided I would write
the history of love songs.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.500
And one of the first things
I found that surprised me is

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.550
that no one had written a book
on the history of the love song.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:10.490
There was not a single book on
the history of the love song.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.820
There were books about
specific kinds of love songs,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.500 position:56%
like troubadour songs or disco songs
or whatever, but there was no book

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.960
to cover the full servile,
now this surprise me

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.790
because the most popular
kind of song

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.350
for the last thousand
years is been a love song,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.930
for a thousand years the love song
has been the most popular kind

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.890
of song and there's
no book about it,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.270 position:56%
and I found that there were reasons.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.760
First of all, it's a very
difficult subject to encompass.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.840
That's why it took me so
many years to write the book,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.080
in such a difficult subject
because to tell the history

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.300
of the love song you need to
understand the history of marriage,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.340
courtship, romance, sexuality,

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.980
you need to understand there
were legal issues involved

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.280
in these things.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.860
There was censorship,
there were prohibitions.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.210
It's a very complex subject.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:58.870
But there was another reason
why scholars do not write

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.850
about love songs.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.150
It's a simple one.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.770 position:56%
They are embarrassed by these songs.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.560
They are ashamed of these songs.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.530
When I would tell people,
what I was writing about,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.830
I'd get an interesting response.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.510
You know, I mean, the other
people that are music writers

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.070
and there's some in
the audience today.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.550
And they would call out to me Ted,

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.970
what's your next book
going to be about?

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.540
And I would say, "I'm writing
a book about love songs",

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.170
and they would give me this look.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.200
And they wouldn't say anything

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.700
but you could tell what
they were thinking.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.960 position:56%
That's a wimpy thing to write about.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.690
You're going to write about
those sappy love songs.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.770
They would have more respect for me
if I was writing about heavy metal,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.680
the 12 tone row, but love songs?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.480
Yet I know that if you saw their
albums, if you saw their playlist,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.400
it's full of love songs,
just like all

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.970
of our play lists are
filled with love songs.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.270
I know these love songs.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.590
You know these love songs.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.950
We all know these love songs.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.070
We all know the words,
200 of love songs.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:09.210 position:56%
Don't we? And when we're in the car
alone and no one can see us and it's

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.000
on the radio, we will
leave and sing along,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.300
just look in your rearview mirror,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.710
you can see people
[inaudible] love songs.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.290
But were ashamed of them.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.640
It's interesting there's
a music critic I

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.210
like named Dave Hickey
and he said something.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.370
He said 90% of music is about
love but music critics want

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.050
to write about the other10%.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.170
Ninety percent of the music
out there is about love

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.310
but music critics want to
write about the other 10%.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.790
And I think that's true.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.090
Where did we get this shame?

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.390
Now Darwin would have told us,

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:41.690
there's nothing to
be embarrassed here.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.320
Darwin thought that all
music was a love song.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.590
He thought the sole purpose
of music was courtship.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.560
If you read his book "The
Descent of Man", he spends a lot

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.880
of time talking about music.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.660
And he believes music is part

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.080
of sexual selection,
brings couples together.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.110
It's the sole biological
evolutionary purpose

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.920
of music in Darwin's mind.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.590 position:56%
But you know, when I first read
Darwin about this, I was unconvinced

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.620
because if you read it, all
he talks about is bird songs.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.150
That he spends more time writing
about bird music than human music.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:20.870
And he doesn't even mention
gorillas, chimps, monkeys,

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.250
you know this hierarchy,
all our closer relatives.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.690
He just skips them completely.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:29.380
And for a good reason because
they don't have love songs.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.190
There are no gorilla love
songs or something like that.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:37.330
There's a guy, Leonard
Williams, a musician,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.490
he's father of the classical
guitars, John Williams,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.280
not the film composer, not the
Star Wars, not that John Williams

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.820
but it was a classical
guitarist John Williams.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:51.700 position:56%
His dad Leonard Williams was a great
musician and also lived with monkeys

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.660
for many years, was
an expert on monkeys.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.570
And he had the privilege of
being able to hear monkeys

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.230
on a regular basis fornicating.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:07.830
I perhaps should say he
had a dubious privilege

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.520
of hearing monkeys
fornicating on a daily basis.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.580
And he said "they do not sing',

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.950
there is no singing
in monkey courtship.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.840
They might grumble or growl or roar
or murmur but there is no singing.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.220
So I was very skeptical of Darwin.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.730
I was very skeptical with Darwin

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.130
because I thought his
reasoning didn't hold up.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.330
But you know in the
last five, ten years,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.820
a lot of new evidences
come out to support Darwin.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.760
And it's all about body chemistry,
you know this study I just talked

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.090
about the other-- at
the beginning of my talk

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.420
about the oxytocin release,
you know, the hormones.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.060
We now know involved
in sexual behavior

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.390
and courtship are the
same ones correlated

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:54.840
with musical receptivity
and musical talent.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.980
There's a growing body of
evidences I write about in my book.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.360
I'm not going to go at length
here but there's a growing body

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.260
of evidences that to some extent,

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.980
survival of the fittest is
survival of the most musical.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.930
So, I have come to accept
that Darwin is right.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.230
I have come to accept that.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.540
But you know, I should've
figured that out long ago.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.130
I should've figured out long ago

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.990
that music was linked
to sexual behavior.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.120 position:56%
All you need to do is read the
biographies of these rock musicians.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.160
You know, you read about
Mick Jagger who had had what,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.340
3000 sexual partners and Gene
Simmons actually keeps a list,

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.640
the singer of "Kiss".

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.220
Who knows what he looks like
behind that kind of make up

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.590
but he's actually kept a list
of the 5800 and whatever women

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.890
that he slept with, whatever.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.490
So I should've figured
this out long ago

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.910
that there is some connection here.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.110
And there have been studies
now to document this.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.410
This is an interesting study.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.710
This was done a few years ago.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:51.010
They had a guy go up to random
women on the street in France

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.230 position:56%
and ask them for their phone number.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:57.150
He would ask them for
their phone number.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.230
You look so lovely, which I
don't do a good a French accent

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.990
but would you give
me your phone number?

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:08.260
What he found was that 14% of the
women would give a total stranger

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.120
who approached them on
the street a phone number.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.670
The next day, the same guy
went to the same neighborhood,

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.280
same question only now he's
carrying a guitar case.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.050
Do you think that shames
the results?

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.650
&gt;&gt; Day one, 14%.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.310
Day two, 31%.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.600
[ Laughter ]

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.110
I see some guy writing down back.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.560
This is useful information.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.960
You're glad you came out on
a cold night to learn this.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.260
Here's the best part of this day.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.220
The third day they tested the
same guy, same neighborhood,

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.280
only this time he's
carrying an athletic bag

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.240
like he just worked out.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.210
Only 9% of the women gave
him their phone number.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.860
So guys, if you think
by working out,

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.510
you'd become more attractive
to women, forget it.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.800
Don't go to the gym,
learn to play the guitar

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.230
or actually just buy a guitar.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.350
Just hold the case, you
don't even need to learn.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.300
There was another study done,
a very similar one based

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.750
on Facebook friend request.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.140
And in this study,
a guy sent a woman

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.920
who was a complete stranger
a Facebook friend request.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.850
And what he found was that 9%

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.630
of women would accept a
Facebook friend request

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.350
from a total stranger.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.210
But when the picture of him

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:33.650
in his profile show him playing
guitar, it went up to 28%.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.870
So once again, Darwin
was probably right.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:43.240
There is some connection between
music and sexual selection

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.180
that we only, did we understand.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.550
We only do we understand now.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.850
But we're ashamed of it.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.150
Where do we get this shame?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:52.000
I think the shame came
from the Romans.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.530 position:56%
I think our embarrassment about long
songs came from the ancient Romans.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.060
You know, C. S. Lewis
wrote a book in the 1930s.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.860
Now, you probably know who C.
S. Lewis from his Narnia stories

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.810
which have been made into
these blockbuster movies.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.370 position:56%
We may know his writings on religion

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.160
but C.S. Lewis was also a
great scholar, taught at Oxford

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.100
who was an expert in
medieval literature.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.680
He wrote a book in the 30s
called the "Allegory of Love".

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.310
And in this book, he makes
an amazing caima [phonetic].

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.840
He says, there was no
romance in ancient times.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.100
He said, the Romans did not
know about romantic love.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:39.250
That's extraordinary
because the word romance come

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.550
from the word Roman.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.460
So, if the Romans didn't
know about romance, who did?

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.740
But C.S. Lewis know the
romantic love was not discovered

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.820
until the troubadours did and
it rounded up in the century.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.330
There was no romantic love
in the world before that.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.310
And then he goes on to
make other strange claims.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.330
He says even today, now you got
to realize he's talking in 1936.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:04.490
He said even today, there is
no romance in India, Japan,

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.030 position:56%
he lists these countries where
according to him there's no romance.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.300
So these are extraordinary
things to say.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.780
They're extraordinary things
to say and I disagree with much

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.640
of what C.S. Lewis says here,
but there's a grain of truth.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.010
There's a grain of truth if
you sift through the evidence.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.320
I've spent a lot of time
studying ancient musical practices

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.380
and ancient culture
and I can tell you,

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.900
the Romans did know
about romantic love.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.570
They did know about
it but they hated it.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.150
They feared it.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.670
They felt that falling in
love was like an illness.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.250
They felt that falling in
love was like insanity.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.510
No sane person would want to have

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:48.980
that helpless feeling
of falling in love.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:55.860 position:56%
The Romans like to conquer and when
you fall in love, you are conquered.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.910
Now they understood that were
benefits to having a good marriage,

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.890
particularly marrying
into a powerful family.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.030
They understood the
benefits of sexual union.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.090
They understood the advantages
of having a soulmate and people

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.320
that would be your
partners for life.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.940
But this idea of falling in love,
they feared, particularly for men.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.240
It was unmanly.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.720 position:56%
You can read what Cicero and Seneca,
and people talked about love.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.100
And they talked about
love songs too.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.630
They were worried about
these love songs.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.700
And the lover in these
love songs is often held

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.740
up as a figure of ridicule.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.440
Most of the love songs that have
survived from ancient Rome come

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.750
from the Roman comedies
and the lover

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:36.400
in these comedies is
someone you will laugh at.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.700
Falling in love was shameful

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.710
and I believe we even
inherited that to some extent.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.830
And even when you get into
the era of Christianity,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.300
it doesn't get any
better for the love song.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.220
For the first 1000 years of
Christianity, the church tried

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.250
to eradicate the love song.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.980
The church tried to
eradicate the love song.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.410
And the best way of proving
this is like you go to Scotland

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.490
and say show me love songs in
Europe in the vernacular languages,

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.600
not in Latin and Greek but the
language of the common people

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.800
in France, Italy, Spain, England.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.760
Show me the love songs in
the vernacular language

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.580
from the first 1000
years of Christianity.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.000
And they will not be
able to find one.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.210
You can't find one that has
survived in its entirety.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.510
Well we'll get a few lines.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.700
You know, someone will be
doing an illuminated manuscript

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.840
and they'll be writing the epistle
of Paul and the book of revelation.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.780
And in the margin, you'll find a
few lines of a dirty love song.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.130
I mean, you'll never
get the whole song.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.200
You just get a couple of lines.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.110
So do we surmise that there were no
love songs among the common people

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.540
of Europe?

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.840
It was the opposite.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.510
The experts on this
believed there were tens

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.090
of thousands of loves songs.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.670
They just haven't survived.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.970
How do we know they existed?

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.730
The best evidence is from the--

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.760
how frequently the church
attacked and criticized them?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.510
Priests were always giving
sermons attacking love songs

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.460
and usually they were
singing-- singling out women.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.500
And so, we got to stop these women
from singing these love songs.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.630
And church councils would
issues proclamations,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.100
women have to stop
singing love songs,

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.010
nothing more dangerous
than these love songs.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.020
In third century, the pope
prohibited these love songs.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.140 position:56%
In the eight century, Charlemagne
passed a law making these love songs

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.280
illegal even as late as Abelard,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.450
and when the late medieval stage
then he was the most famous

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.050
theologian to this date but
he also sang these love songs.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.460
We are told that everybody knew
his love songs and could sing them

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.750
but not one of them had survived.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.520
So the church tried to get rid
of all of these love songs.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.050
In fact, are these books,
these are fascinating books.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.320
They're called penitentials.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.400
The penitential was a guide to
a priest hearing confessions.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.050
So if someone came to you with
a confession and said, "Father,

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.500
I stole my neighbor's chicken" or
I lusted after my neighbor's wife.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.890
The penitential would tell the
priest what the pennant should be.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.920
OK. If you say, five "Our fathers"
three "Hail Mary's" you're OK.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.750
And these penitentials are our
best source of information.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.490
Actually, about the
sex lives of people

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:07.160
in medieval times,
this is a side note.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.420
What sexual sin do you think
is mentioned most frequently

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.060
in these books?

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.360
Sex with animals.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.990
That is the most frequently
mentioned sex.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:19.720
It was [inaudible] but anyway,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.420
three of these penitentials
mentioned love songs and say

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.830
that singing love song is a
sin that cannot be forgiven.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.930
It cannot be forgiven.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.230
Using that love song, you're
going to burn in hellfire.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.320
Now, you go up with that sheep
and the goat, we can handle that

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.830 position:56%
but you can't sing these love songs.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.130
It's extraordinary.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.540
So you get an idea for 1000
years, the church tried

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.800
to eradicate the love song.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.130
But finally, the love song
came out into the open.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.530
Came out into the open with the
troubadours and why is that?

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.990
It's because now, the king
was singing love songs.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.510 position:56%
The nobility was singing love songs.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:59.810
You know, the inventor

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:03.200
of the troubadour love
song we're told was a duke.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.390
So what do you do when the
duke starts singing love song?

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.110
So the church lost this battle.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.740
The love songs come out into the
open and the nobility in the south

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.700
of France is given credit

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.170
for inventing the western
love song but did they really?

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.470
Did they really?

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.150
What about all these women that
were chastised by the church

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.580
for 1000 years or even
more interestingly,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.660
there's a whole chapter of this
that's never been written before.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.090
And I got a whole stack of books
at home when the troubadours,

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.950
none of them mentioned the female
slave singers in the Muslim world.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:35.240
Who 100, 200 years before the
troubadours were singing love songs

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:39.270
almost identical to the ones
that were supposedly invented

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.920
in the south of France
in the 11th century.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.110
In the Muslim world, female slave
singers would sing about love.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:47.110
The epicenter was Baghdad.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.420
These songs spread through
North Africa and then

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.700
after the Muslim conquest to
Spain, they came into Spain.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:59.430
And then, finally just a few
miles away in the south of France,

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.670
the nobles start signing
almost the exact same songs

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.090
that these female slave singers
in the Muslim world were doing.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.690
And historians have
not picked up on this.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:09.990
They've ignored this.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.480
They give the credit to the nobles

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.880
but they forget this whole
hidden history of the love song.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.130
And all of a sudden, when you see
these things start making sense,

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:21.640
the king is singing love songs,
the nobility is singing love song

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.490
and they're talking about
being a slave to love.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.800
Well how can the king be a slave?

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.330
But it starts to make
sense when you realize

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.980
that the people they
took these songs

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.880
from were actually slaves,
were actually slaves.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.700
You would be surprised
how much of the history

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.030
of the love song was
created by slaves.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.780
You go back to ancient
Rome, you remember I talked

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.100
about these Roman comedies, that
music was all played by slaves.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.190
The music was written by slaves.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.340 position:56%
Often, they would have
performances and the slave would get

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.070
on stage and sing the song.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:58.250
Because it was not respectable
for a Roman citizen to sing.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.930
You remember that story about
Nero fiddling while Rome burned?

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.580
You know what a scandal it was?

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.940 position:56%
The scandal wasn't that Rome burned,
because you can't stop a fire,

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.480
the scandal was that the
emperor was playing music.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.780
It was scandalous.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.760
So the innovations and love songs
in ancient times came from slaves.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.860
The innovations in the middle ages
came from slaves in the underclass.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.330
Now what about more recent times?

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.630
What about more recent times?

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.910
What about United States?

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.120
I'll ask you a question, what
was the most popular love song

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.910
in America in 1850?

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:35.770 position:56%
By far, the most popular love song
in America in 1850 was "Oh Susanna".

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:40.160
[Singing] Oh Susanna,
oh don't you cry for me.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:46.040
Because I come from Alabama
with the banjo on my knee.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.410
That's right, written
by Stephen Foster.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.290
White guy from the north.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:53.880
But he was imitating the
slave songs of the south,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.450
and those slaves didn't have
access to music publishers

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.110
and copyright, but
Stephen Foster did.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:02.070
And this was a great
innovation in the love song.

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.500
Came out of the slave community
then fast forward to later times.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.250
And I would say the most important
innovations in the love songs

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.540
in the 20th century came from
the descendants of slaves.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:19.090
In the year 1900, if you
had gone experts on music,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:23.650 position:56%
people who really knew music in the
year 1900 and ask them what is going

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.910
to be the future of popular
music in the 20th century?

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.460
Predict the future of popular
music in the 20 century,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.080
what would they have said?

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.890
What they would've said is
the exciting popular music

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.960
in 1900 is all coming from Europe.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.850
You got to go to the cabarets in
Berlin, the cabarets in Paris.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:47.530
The music halls of London, people
are saying these sexy songs

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.110
and controversial songs and
they're filled with satire

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.680
and humor and they're daring.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.510
They're bold, they're gay.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.040
Meanwhile in the United States,
the hit songs in 1900 were boring.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.720
You know, I've studied the love
songs of 19th century America

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.940
and no one ever kisses
in those songs.

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.340
No one ever hugs.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.630
It's just I feel a great
sentiment for you my darling.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:12.180
I mean, they're the most
boring songs you can imagine.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.280
There was all this exciting stuff
happening in the Paris cabarets

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.840 position:56%
and anyone who was smart in the
year 1900 would saying Europe is the

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.690
future of popular music, but
they would've been wrong.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.530
And why would they have been wrong?

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.510
Because they didn't understand the
contributions that would be made

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.160
by the descendants of slaves

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.860
by the African-American
community in the 20th century.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.680 position:56%
With jazz and the blues, all these
new ways of singing about love birds

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.340
that no one had seen before,
and it was even more exciting

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.170
that what was happening
in France and Berlin

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:42.570
and all those other places.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.240
And so the United States
dominated popular music

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.820
in the 20th century as we all know.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.810
And it was because the innovations

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.940
in love songs again came
from the underclass.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.300
What about more recently,
in our own lifetimes,

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.300
where have the innovations
in love songs come from?

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.030
The ruling class or the underclass?

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:02.090
What about rock and roll?

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.790
Let's talk about Elvis from
the poorest state in the union.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.960
From Elvis Presley,
he learned his music

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.460
from the blues singers
in Mississippi.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.250
What about the British innovation?

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.820 position:56%
The Beatles, the British innovation?

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.520
The British innovation come
from Buckingham palace.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.360
He was in the docks in Liverpool.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.470
Once again, it was the poor,
the underclass, the outsider.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:28.570
What has been the most
shocking change in love songs

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.000
in the last 30 or 40 years?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.380
Got to be hip-hop, don't you think?

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.640
That come from the ruling class?

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.280
It's a pretty easy
question to answer.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.360
This is the hidden
history of the love song.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.930
This is the hidden
history of the love song.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.450
Eventually, all this music is
accepted by the upper class.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.210
Eventually all of this was
controlled by the White House.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.930
Eventually rock and
roll was mainstream,

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.130
eventually hip-hop will
be mainstream as well.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:56.180 position:56%
But when the new innovations in love
songs come out, they always come

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.640
from the Bohemian, from slave, from
the underclass, from the outsider.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.720
And I think as we peer to the
future, we should expect the same.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.510
There will be more innovations
in love songs in the future.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:08.810
It will continue to change.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.730
There will be new ways
of singing about love.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:14.780
There will be revolutionary
new ways of singing about love.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.580
And they will come from the
place we least expected.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.820 position:56%
It will come from the outsider, from
the bohemian from the underclass.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.930
The songs will come and
they will change our lives.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.510
Thank you very much, I'll
now answer questions.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:35.350
[ Applause ]

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.180
Anybody have a question?

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.970
So microphone will be going
around if you have a question.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:56.700
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if you could
just give a very general definition

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:01.170
of what you mean by love song?

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:05.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: This is a very, again,
it's a very complicated question.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.690
Let me give you an example.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:13.110
The oldest love songs in my opinion
come from ancient Mesopotamia.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:17.040
And they were involved in
these fertility rights.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.480
And there was this thing called
the sacred marriage ritual.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.900 position:56%
And the sacred marriage ritual
every year, the king had to have sex

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:28.710
with the Goddess so
the crops would grow.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.990
The crops would grow, the
kingdom would be prosperous.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.490
Now, this is difficult, you know,
guys know how difficult it is

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.790
to get a date on a Saturday night,

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.090
but how do you get a
date with the Goddess.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.390
You know, and this is not easy.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:44.730
So the high priestess had to
step in and perform this ritual

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:48.250
with the king and the scholars
debate endlessly whether they--

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.750
do they actually have sex
and this is the debate.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:55.140
They go off to the temple, the
king and the high priestess

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.340 position:56%
and the sacred marriage ritual
takes place and then the crops grow.

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:02.310
And now these songs, their
songs that are associated

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:05.320
with the sacred marriage ritual
which I call the first love songs,

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.360
but a lot of people read
these songs and say this isn't

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.910
about love, it's just about sex.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.940
You can't call that a love
song, it's just a sex song.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.800 position:56%
But I will point out, people say the
same things today about Miley Cyrus,

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.760
Madonna, you know,
Beyonce, whatever.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.070
So I'm going to-- in many
ways, we just come full circle.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.810
We're back to ancient Mesopotamia.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:28.780
My view was I define
the love song broadly.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:33.940 position:56%
Songs that bring people together in
various romantic ways and some ways,

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.630
sometimes just sexual
ways, it's very hard

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.760
to distinguish the difference
between a love and sex in a song,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.640
but it's hard in life, isn't it?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.930
I mean now, we've all had
relationship with [inaudible].

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.980
Now what kind of relationship
am I actually in, you know?

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.380
So, you know.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:54.380
So I didn't try to, you
know, slice hairs in half.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:48:00.190
I took a broad view and anything
that brings people together,

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.810
even if it's an ancient
king and a high priestess

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:08.120
in a sacred marriage ritual,
I call it a love song.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.420
Yes?

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.720
&gt;&gt; What is it about--

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.020
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: You know, speak
to the microphone, here.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.670
&gt;&gt; What is it about music
that is so evocative?

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.180
I mean it's not just love songs.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.610
I mean, you can hear a
song from 30 years ago

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.380
and basically you are
and know what you hear.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.110
So now it's serious
[inaudible] and you can see

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:28.580
that yes, it was in 1967.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:32.620
And it's not necessarily
positive, you know,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.200
it might be something
from a sad event.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.260
But I think there must be
something actually between music

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.100
and memory here, I mean
I'm thinking that, so.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.400
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: No, you're
absolutely right.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.070
I remember this song I
heard on my first date.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.640
And it's an awful song.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.910
I hate this, but every time we
hear on the radio, I know that song

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:52.250
on my first date, you know.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.340 position:56%
And so, you know, you're [inaudible]
just really think in our memory.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.810
And we respond to this
music and it is one

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.720
of the grandest mysteries
of physiology.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.310
I mean for example,
just take something

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.660
as simple as dancing to a beat.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:04.960
Every society does it.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.260
But you know, no animal does it,

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.690
you cannot teach a dog
to dance to the beat.

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:11.270
You can't teach a horse, you know,

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:14.040
it's just very interesting,
for us it's instinctive.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:19.190
Now, neuroscientists are
starting to unlock this.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:23.090 position:56%
And they're finding all sorts of
interesting things about brainwaves,

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:28.490
body chemistry, parts of
the mind that process music.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:32.540
And I think overtime, we will
eventually learn more about this.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.320 position:56%
But I do suspect there's going to be
something that's always mysterious.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.980
But you're right, I do
believe we respond in music

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.730
in a way that is magical.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.270
That's one of the reasons
why I hate to just think

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:44.570
that a music is entertainment.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.790
You know, music is magical, it's
transformative, it's change agent.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.090
It changes our lives.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.390
We're not just passive listeners.

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.060
I'm just going to give
you an example.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.860
Tia De Nora is a sociologist.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.310
She did a study a few years
ago about what happens

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:03.670
when you bring someone over to
your home for a dinner date?

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.640
You bring in someone
over to your home,

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.940
they've never been
in your place before.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.830 position:56%
You've invited them over for dinner.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.130
You're thinking romance,
what do you do?

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.430
Well, the first you do is you clean

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.310
up your place, I know
you're all slugs.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.010 position:56%
So the first you're going to do is--

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:21.530 position:56%
Then the second thing you worry
about, what food am I going to cook?

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.000
You know, for me this is a panic,
you know, I have to do take out.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.730
It's going to be like
Chinese, or pizza, you know.

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.540
But then the third thing is music.

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.150
The third thing is music and
she documented this talking

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.590
to people how they
choose what music to play

00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.200
when someone is coming
over for a dinner date?

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.800
So it shows you that the-- we're
not just passive listeners,

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.360
we believe in this magic of music.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.540
I feel sorry for these people
that are really in the hip-hop,

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.700
and then someone's coming
over in, oh I got these--

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.790
I'll go about these bulgur lyrics.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.650
You know, you got to go, I got
to buy a Frank Sinatra album,

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.460
you know what I, you know.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:59.700
So we, in our hearts we
believe in the magic of music.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.960
I believe scientists
will unlock some of it,

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.510
but some of it will
always be in this strand

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.070
of beautiful mystery,
a beautiful mystery.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.370
Any other questions?

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.660
&gt;&gt; Hi. Yes, I've always
thought of the Beatles and much

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.500
of the British innovation
as an outgrowth

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.880
of the great American songbook,
does everyone agree or disagree?

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.590
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: Well yeah, you know,
the people at that time thought

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:24.570
that the Beatles were such a
radical break, but not really.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:29.680
If you go back when the Beatles
run the Ed Sullivan Show,

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.880 position:56%
the Beatles run the Ed Sullivan
Show, and I've actually done a count

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:39.410
of the songs, they played 80
% of them were love songs.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.940
And it went really-- that outrage
just say I want to hold your hand?

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.240
Was that really such an
outrageous thing to say?

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.180
So you're right, and in many ways,
a lot of those songs showed a lot

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.990
of this craftsmanship
that you've [inaudible].

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:53.510
So yeah, it wasn't as big
a break as people think.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:59.790
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.760
There was some connection, but if
you take Glen and McCartney try

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.420
to figure out what influenced
them is a wide range of things.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.080
I do think McCartney
was listening to a lot

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.240
of music hall songs in London.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.220
Here's a song like when
I'm 64, it's almost ready

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.950
for the music hall stage in
London, but I believe, yeah.

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.230
In fact, when you and I
before-- we've got on tonight,

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:23.620
we talked about Nat King Cole.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.720
There's a case to be
made that McCartney song

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.100 position:56%
"Yesterday" is a restatement of a
Nat King Cole song he heard that was

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.500
in his dad's record
collection when he was a kid.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:39.700 position:56%
So I mean, the connections there
went deeper the most people realize.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.240
Yes, any other question?

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.500
There was someone back there
and I'll get to you next.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.680
&gt;&gt; The history of the love song
and I'm curious, in this country,

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:53.510
Western tends to be about,
as you took the [inaudible].

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.530
And we're not deemed-- I don't
know if that's considered blues

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:00.420
or if you've been able to
track down that style of music

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.060
or something like that came from.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.380
And if you see that
in other cultures,

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.570
you talked about male Americans
or things in Europe, possibly Asia

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:13.730
and there's a similar country
western style of love song.

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.030
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: You know,
it's interesting.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.220
When I was in my 20s, I got
a scholarship that allowed me

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.650 position:56%
to go study at Oxford for two years.

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.850
So I'm an American--
Most of my life,

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.780
I grew up in South Central
L.A. So you bring me

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.620
to Oxford, it's like culture shock.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.880
And I just-- People there-- I
would say, why do you do this?

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.630
This is-- Because we've
always done it that way.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:32.930
Well that's not a reason.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:34.530
You can't say and, you know.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.930
But what I found, I was
amazed how many people

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.050
in Oxford were listening
to country music.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:46.730
How many people, particularly the
people that worked in the college

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:49.220
that weren't students, but the
people that sort of like served

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.640
at the dining hall or whatever?

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.520
And there was this message that
country music spoke to them

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:57.140
in a way that I had not expected.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.380
It was very surprising
and you find--

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:05.480
if you take some sappy company
song like "Achy Breaky Heart".

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.020
That was like the number
hit in Finland, Denmark.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.280
I mean, it's amazing
how this music travels

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.370
to places you don't think it would.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.760
And I believe there's
a reason for this.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.510
How do I try-- let
me articulate this.

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.310
And I think it explains a lot of
what's happening in music nowadays.

00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:25.880
I believe that music today
and the love song today more

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:32.420
than at any point in history is
embedded in people's fantasy life.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.890
And it expresses not so
much the life they have

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:40.820
but the life they wish they had.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.600 position:56%
And let me give you another example,

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.230
there are all of these
retro jazz albums now,

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:48.390
like Lady Gaga is doing an
album on with Tony Bennett

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.360
and Queen Latifah is
doing with [inaudible].

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.490
Everyone is doing this
retro jazz stuff.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:56.840
And I know people like
the old jazz songs.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.140
I don't think it's just that.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.460
I think they like the romance.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.740
They look at this old
jazz and they associate it

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.650
with people getting dressed up and
going out on romantic evenings out.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:09.560
And here's something.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.460
I've got a son who is in college.

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.890
And as far as I can tell,

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:20.020
his friends in college
do not go on dates.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.410
The younger generation
does not go on dates.

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.710
Now, how sad is that?

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.010
Now, it's just interesting.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.790
They had a lot of sex
as far as I can tell.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.970
And that's the exact opposite.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:31.270
When I was in college, you know,

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:32.980
that getting the sex part
was the hard part to get.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.430
But going on a date
was easy, you know.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:37.760
It is flip flop now where
there are a lot of people

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.130
out there hungry for romance.

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:45.380
A lot of people in the younger
generation I believe are hungering

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.760
for romance.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.170
And that's why they go into
this country western music

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:53.480
or these old jazz songs
because the romantic ethos

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.040
of that music expresses
something they want to know

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.540
like it's hard to find nowadays.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.420
That's a controversial view
but that's what I believe.

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.360 position:56%
He's got a question here, so let's--

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.950
and then we'll take two more
questions and then wrap up.

00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:08.250
Yup?

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I read about the history of jazz,
what do you think of the future

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.780
of jazz in terms form and
its place in the larger seam

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.250
of things in the music world.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: I've got a book coming

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:23.540
out in May called how
to listen to jazz.

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.650
And I focus a lot on that issue.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:30.050
Because I hear people all
the time say jazz is dead.

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:33.800
I must have seen 20 articles in
the media over the last five years,

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.510
the headline is jazz is dead.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.140
And I don't believe that at
all, I believe jazz is fine.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.780
And now jazz is hurting
from an economic standpoint.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.470
Because they never put it on TV,
they never put it on the radio.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:52.680
It's-- The coverage in all
the media has disappeared.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.360
And so, it's not surprising to me

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.170
that jazz musicians are
struggling economically

00:56:57.170 --> 00:57:00.190
because this global mass
entertainment industry

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.350
that dominates everything
has marginalized jazz.

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:07.210
But, if you actually
dig deeply into it

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.980
and I listen to new jazz everyday.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.680 position:56%
During the course of a typical year,

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.720
I've listened to around a
thousand newly-released albums.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:23.510
This is the first day-- This year
I have listened to a new album.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:24.810
Before I got in a plane yesterday,

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.540
I've listened to four albums
during the course of the day.

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.310
And then most of the
albums have been released

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:29.850
in the last two or three weeks.

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:35.050
So I try to keep my hand on
the pulse of music today.

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.400
There are maybe music critics
who listen to more new music

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.540
than I do, but I haven't met them.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:41.640
I will say, if you dig
deeply into the music,

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.060
there are great things happening.

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.040
There's actually more
good music happening now

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.760
than ever before, but it is hidden.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.500
It is hidden.

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:51.620
I will-- Every week, I
will hear some great album

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.900
and almost every instance,
it's something that's not going

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.200
to get any radio [inaudible].

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.840
Because it doesn't
fit into the format.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.250
And someone is not
going to get on TV

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.390
because they don't
fit into the format.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.520
So I would say there's a
lot of great jazz happening.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.140
Unfortunately, you have to dig it

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:09.340
out because the media
is hiding it from you.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:14.860
And I'll have a lot more
about that on my next book.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.500
OK. This guy knows more
about jazz than I do.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.800
So I can be--

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.100
&gt;&gt; Pull on me.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.400 position:56%
Ted, thank you for our terrific talk

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.720
and could you share some
your thoughts about the role

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.570
of Jewish-American composers

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:30.790
in establishing the body
of American love songs?

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:32.560
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: Well,
they had a huge role.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.730
They had I mean, because
if you look at the people

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:41.000
that really pioneered the American
love song, it tended to be people

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.050
like the Gershwin Brothers,
George and Ira,

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:44.850
Irving Berlin, you
just go on and on.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.300
Harold Arnold was the-- it was
the Jewish songwriters who tapped

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.390
into the African-American
jazz stuff.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.350
And I understood that
they mixed it in with many

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:56.600
of their own musical traditions
and there's a huge amount

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.630
of Jewish music that filtered into
popular music or [inaudible] music,

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:02.360
but you can hear that filtering in.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.670
And it's interesting
even, take Cole Porter,

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:09.100
he was one of the few songwriters
there who wasn't Jewish.

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.170
And he was having a conversation
with someone once and he said,

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:14.090
"I'm going to write Jewish songs".

00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:15.390
That's right, I'm going
to write Jewish.

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:18.960
That was his idea how to
write a love song in America.

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:22.770
So it was this extraordinary,
but really, it was--

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:24.750
I'm going to go to this whole thing

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.940
where I say the outsider
has more freedom to sing

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.030
about new ways of love
than the inside.

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:37.970
If you are a member of the ruling
class, you have to be respectable.

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:39.270 position:56%
You're a member of the ruling class,

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:41.770
you have to watch everything
you do or say.

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:44.750
And so the members of the ruling
class are never good at tapping

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:46.650 position:56%
into new ways of singing about love.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.060
It's always someone on the fringes.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:51.850
So you get these children
of Jewish immigrants hanging

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:55.100
out with jazz musicians in
Harlem, I'm not surprised at all

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.290
that they came up with innovation.

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:59.280
Because they didn't have this--

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.090
That's the sense of
shame I'm talking about.

01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:05.760
They had this more-- a
greater way to experiment.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.350
So yeah, we wouldn't
have the modern love song

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.740
without the Jewish-American
promoters.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.210
One last question?

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:13.600
&gt;&gt; Hi Ted, great discussion.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.350
I had-- my question to you
was regarding, you'd mentioned

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:23.560
about how music, a love music
came from slaves and primarily

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.670
in the Muslim culture and how that
kind of affected certain things.

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:31.050
But I'm curious in your
research, was there any--

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:36.290
did anything come up with regards
to African, sort of music and--

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.970
because I grew up in Africa
and a lot of the love songs

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.850
when I was coming up, you'd
never knew them as love songs.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.900
I didn't know what they meant.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.710
You know, adults are just singing
and you just kind of sing along

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:51.190
but you didn't know what-- I
thinking about older, you're like,

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:54.270
oh, that was what they
were talking about.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:59.130
But, in any case, I'm curious
to see, to hear from you

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:03.080 position:56%
in your research, was there any, you
know, correlation with, you know,

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:08.800
Africa and African-American slaves,
you know, that kind of cycle?

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.470
&gt;&gt; Ted Gioia: If you go back in the
historical sources, first of all,

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:16.960
the great tragedy is this-- the
scarcity of historical sources.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.990
Because one of the great questions
is if you had grown around Africa

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:24.950
in the year 100, 1200, 1400
what music would you have heard?

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:28.130
And the sources are not good
ones, you can read what Herodotus,

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.170
a Greek said there's a great
book by a guy named Mungo Park.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:34.860
He was an African traveler
and he went--

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:36.160
was exploring the interior Africa,

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.760
this would have been 500 years
ago, 400 to 500 years ago.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.310
And he was sold into
slavery in Africa.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:45.200
And was traveling from community
to community and eventually,

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.750
two years later, he got back to
the cost to a European settlement

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:52.400
in tatters of clothing and with
some paperwork he had written,

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.640
everything he had seen
in those two years.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.210
And it's called-- Travels with
Mungo Park, and this book,

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:02.580
he encounters music everywhere
and all kinds of music.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.880
It's extraordinary.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.770
And he's just, wow.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.190
And there are other just these
little snippets of information,

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:10.540
we have for example if you go
back in the late medieval period,

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:17.340
there's a writing from a Christian
source about an African musician

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.730
who had traveled into Spain
and was singing a love song

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:24.050
that they found shocking
and scandalous.

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:28.610
There are paintings from Spain
in the late medieval period

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:32.670
that will show bands playing and
there will be black musicians

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:36.650
and white musicians in the painting
and the black musician is sort

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:40.130
of the center of prominence where
the leader of the band would be.

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:43.600
So you have these, you have all
these little snippets of clues

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.310
and you'd love to have a bigger
picture where the preponderance

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:54.740
of evidence suggest that there was
an extraordinary musical culture

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.320
in Africa throughout
this whole period,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.540 position:56%
and a lot of it was focused on love.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.710
A lot of them was focused on love.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.710
And when I say these
Muslim slave singers,

01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:07.320
I have to say these slaves
were not Muslims themselves

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.620
for the more part.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.920
These were people from conquest.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.580
So a lot of them were from parts
of Africa, Ethiopia or whatever,

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.130
and they were the innovators
in the love songs.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.470
So even though when I call
them Muslim slaves singers,

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:22.640
that's misleading, in many ways,
a lot of them were Africans

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.190
who were bringing their own
musical traditions together

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.490
and singing these songs.

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.670
So that's the history but still
that's not been adequately written.

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.100
It still has not been
adequately written,

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.650
but there's a rich
history there to be found.

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.950
Any other questions?

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:37.930
I'm happy to answer
afterwards or sign books.

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:39.230
Thank you for coming.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:41.030
You've been one [inaudible].
