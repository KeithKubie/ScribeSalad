00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.060
Simplify the cube root
of 125 x to the sixth y

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.280
to the third power.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.890
So taking the cube
root of something

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.760
is the same thing as raising
that something to the 1/3

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.330
power.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.720
So this is equal to
125 x to the sixth y

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.430
to the third power
raised to the 1/3 power.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.480
And if we take a product
of a bunch of stuff

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.320
and raise that to
the 1/3 power, that's

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.140
the same thing as individually
raising each of the things

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.750
to the 1/3 power and
then taking the product.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.310
So this is going
to be equal to 125

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.970
to the 1/3 power times x to the
sixth to the 1/3 power times

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.390
y to the third to the 1/3 power.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.990
And then we can think about how
we can simplify each of these.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.109
What's 125 to the 1/3?

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.650
Well, let's just
factor and see if we

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.100
can have at least three
prime factors of something

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.860
and maybe more than
one prime factor

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.460
that shows up three times.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.690
So 125 is 5 times 25.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.780
25 is 5 times 5.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.310
So 125 really is
5 times 5 times 5.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.581
So if you multiply 5 times
itself three times you get 125.

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:18.410
125 to the 1/3 power
is going to be 5.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.470
So this is going to
simplify to 5 times.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.820
And then x to the sixth
to the 1/3 power--

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.944
we saw this in a
previous example--

00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:28.360
if you raise a
base to an exponent

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.740
and then raise that whole
thing to another exponent,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.400
you can take the product
of the two exponents.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.480
So 6 times 1/3 is 6/3 or 2.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.660
So this part right
over here simplifies

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.580
to x to the sixth divided
by 3 power or x squared.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.440
And then finally over
here, same principle.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280
Raising y to the third power,
and then that to the 1/3 power.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.270
So that's going to
be y to the 3 times

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.150
1/3 power, or y to
the first power.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.360
And then times y.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.310
And we are done.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.685
And if you don't want to write
this little multiplication

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:12.890
here, you could just write
this as 5x squared y.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.197
And we have simplified.
