00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.120
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and this is Crash
Course Statistics.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.610
Welcome to a world of probabilities, paradoxes
and p-values.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.370
There will be games.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.820
And thought experiments.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.820
And coin flipping.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.520
A lot of coin flipping.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.220
Statisticians love to talk about coin flipping.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.460
By the time we finish the course, you’ll
know why we use statistics.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
And how.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.670
And what questions you ought to be asking
when you run across statistics in the world.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.500
Which is ALL THE TIME.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.800
Statistics can help you make a guess whether
or not you’re going to be accepted to Harvard.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.640
Marketers use them to sell us gold-lame pants.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.820
Netflix uses stats to predict what show we
might want to watch next.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.820
You use statistics when you look at the weather forecast and decide what to wear--dress or jeans.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.200
Policy makers use them to decide whether or
not to invest in more early childhood education,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220
whether or not to spend more on mental health
services.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.220
Statistics is all about making sense of data--and figuring out how to put that information to use.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.980
Today, we’re going to answer the question
“What IS Statistics?”

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:07.160
INTRO

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.740
The legend says that during a late 1920’s
English tea at Cambridge, a woman claimed

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.200
that a cup of tea with milk added last tasted different than tea where the milk was added first.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.660
The brilliant minds of the day immediately
began to think of ways to test her claim.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.000
They organized eight cups of tea in all sorts
of patterns to see if she really could tell

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.010
the difference between the milk first and
tea first cups.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.270
But even after they had seen her guesses,
how could they really decide?

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.450
Because, she’d get about half the cups right
just by randomly guessing either milk or tea.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.150
And even if she really could tell the difference,
it’s completely possible that she would

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.440
miss a cup or two.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.869
So how could you tell if this woman was actually
a tea-savant?

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.810
What is the line between lucky tea guesser
and tea supertaster?

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.869
As fate would have it, future super-statistician
and part time potato scientist Ronald A. Fisher

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.360
was in attendance.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.700
During his lifetime, Fisher began work that
set the stage for a large portion of Statistics

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.140
which is the focus of this series.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.960
These statistics can help us make decisions in uncertain situations, tea-taste-tests and beyond.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.440
Fisher’s insights into experimental design
helped turn statistics into its own scientific

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.240
discipline.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.300
And, although Fisher didn’t publish results
of this tea-test...the story has it...the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.080
woman sorted all the tea cups correctly.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.349
Just in case you were curious.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.410
At this point, it’s worth mentioning that
there are two related--but separate--meanings

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.690
of the word statistics.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.709
We can refer to the field of statistics...
which is the study and practice of collecting

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.340
and analyzing data.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.690
And we can talk about statistics as in facts
about... or summaries... of data.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.930
To answer the question “What is statistics?”,
we should first...

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.780
...ask the question “What can statistics
do?”

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.240
Let's say you wake up at your desk after a
long evening studying for finals with a cheeseburger

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.110
wrapper stuck to your face.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.050
And you wonder... "why do I eat this stuff?

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.300
Is fast food controlling my life?"

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.350
But then you tell yourself, "No.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.080
It's just super convenient.."

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.769
But you're worried, you're thinking about
how great it is that McDonald's serves breakfast

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.450
all day RIGHT NOW.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.580
But maybe that's normal, finals are this week
afterall, so you google the question “Fast

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.330
Food consumption” and you find the results
of a fast food survey.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.209
The first thing you might do is start asking
questions that interest you.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.720
For example, you could ask, Why do people
eat fast food?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.080
Do people eat more fast food on the weekend
than on weekdays?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.020
Does eating fast food stress me out?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.580
Now that we have some interesting questions,
we need to ask ourselves an even more important

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.440
one: Can these questions be answered by statistics?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.300
Like I mentioned earlier, statistics are tools
for us to use, but they can’t do all the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300
heavy lifting.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.370
To answer the question about why people eat
fast food, you can ask them to fill out a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.100
questionnaire, but you can’t know whether
their answers truly represent what they’re

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.160
thinking.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.040
Maybe they answer dishonestly because they
don’t want to admit that they scarf McDonalds

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.680
because they’re too tired to cook dinner,
or because they are ashamed to admit they

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.720
think Del Taco is delicious, or because none
of the given answers represented their reasons,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.980
or they may not really know why they eat fast
food.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.750
Armed with the results of the survey, you
could tell you that the most common reason

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.120
that people reported eating fast food was
convenience, or that the average number of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.729
meals they eat out each week is five.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.039
But you’re not truly measuring why people
eat so much fast food.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.300
You’re measuring what we call a “proxy”,
something that is related to what we want

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.439
to measure, but isn’t exactly what we want
to measure.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.919
To answer whether people eat more fast food
on the weekends, or whether eating it more

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.990
than twice a week increases stress, we’d
not only need to know how much people are

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.099
eating fast food, which our questionnaire
asked, but also which days they eat it.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.770
And we’d need an additional measure of “stress”.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.509
You can use statistics to give a good answer
about whether you’re going through the drive-thru

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.650
more on the weekend, but even the question
of whether eating fast food is associated

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.479
with higher levels of stress is hard to answer
directly.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.680
What is stress and how can we measure it?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.449
And are people eating fast food because they
are stressed?

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.879
Or does eating all those calories make them
stressed?

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.499
It’s often the case that some of the most
interesting questions are the ones that can’t

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.800
be directly answered by statistics--like why
people eat fast food.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.059
Instead we find questions that we can answer--
like whether people who eat fast food often

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:16.369
work more than eighty hours a week.

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:20.110
The tools we use to answer these questions
are statistics-plural--and there are two main

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.460
types: Descriptive and Inferential.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.280
Descriptive statistics, well... they describe
what the data show!

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.340
Descriptive statistics usually include things
like where the middle of the data is--what

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.909
statisticians call measures of central tendency--and
measures of how spread out the data are.

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.139
They take huge amounts of information that
may not make much intuitive sense to us, and

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.610
compress and summarize them to ...hopefully...
give us more useful information.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.319
Let’s go to the the Thought Bubble.

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.439
You’ve been working for two years in the
local waffle factory.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:55.139
Day in and day out, you create the golden-browny-iest,
tastiest frozen waffles ever created.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.229
The holes are perfectly spaced.

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.619
Screaming for syrup.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:59.809
And now you want a raise.

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:00.909
You deserve a raise.

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.389
No one can make a waffle as well as you can.

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.860
But how much do you ask for?

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.000
An extra thousand dollars?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.889
An extra 5-thousand dollars?

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.370
You know you’re valuable, but have no idea
what other waffle makers get paid.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.330
So you dig around online and find there’s
an entire subreddit devoted to waffle makers.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.589
And someone username “waffleleaks” has
posted a spreadsheet of waffle maker salaries.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.479
Now with a quick glance at this huge list
of numbers, you can see whether the woman

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.060
who works a similar job at the rival frozen
waffle company makes more than you.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.860
You can see how much more you are making than
the new guy, who’s just now learning to

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.860
mix batter.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.569
But you still don’t know much about the
paychecks of your waffle company as a whole.

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:41.569
Or the industry.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.569
Cause it turns out there are thousands of
waffle makers out there.

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.149
And all you see is a list with data points,
not patterns that can help you learn more

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:53.169
about how much you might be able to convince
the boss to pay you.

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:55.020
Here is where descriptive statistics come
in.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.869
You could calculate the average salary at
your company as well as how spread out everyone’s

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:01.229
salaries are around that average.

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.289
You’d be able to see whether the CEOs’
paychecks are relatively close to the entry-level

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.419
batter makers, or incredibly far away.

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:12.879
And how your salary compares to both of their
salaries.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:17.460
You could calculate the average salary of
everyone in the industry with your job title.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.339
And see the high and low end of that pay.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.539
And then, armed with those descriptive statistics,
you could confidently walk into the waffle

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.710
bosses office and demand to be paid for your
talents.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.879
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.820
While descriptive statistics can be great,
they only tell us the basics.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.840
Inferential statistics allows us to make….inferences.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.620
(Clever namers, those statisticians.)

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.240
Inferential statistics allow us to make conclusions
that extend beyond the data we have in hand.

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:47.179
Imagine you have a candy barrel full of salt
water taffy.

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:49.499
Some pink, some white, some yellow.

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:53.699
If you wanted to know how many of each color
you have, you could count them.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.689
One by one by one.

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:58.669
That’d give you a set of descriptive statistics.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:00.629
But who has time for all that?

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:05.909
Or, you could grab a giant handful of taffy,
and count just those you have pulled out,

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:08.050
which would be using descriptive statics.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.649
If your candy was, in fact, mixed pretty evenly
throughout the barrel, and you got a big enough

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:18.080
handful, you could use inferential statistics
on that “sample” to estimate the content

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.330
of the entire taffy stash.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.189
We ask inferential statistics to do all sorts
of much more complicated work for us.

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:28.649
Inferential statistics let us test an idea
or a hypothesis.

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:32.949
Like answering whether people in the US under
the age of 30 eat more fast food than people

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:33.949
over 30.

00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:36.889
We don’t survey EVERY person to answer that
question.

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:41.860
Let’s say someone tells you that their new
brain vitamin--Smartie-vite--improves your

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.860
IQ.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.860
Do you rush out and buy it?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.970
What if they told you that the average IQ
increase for Group A-- twenty people who took

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:53.920
Smartie-vite for a month--was two IQ points,
and the average IQ increase for Group B--twenty

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.430
people who took nothing--was one IQ point.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.430
How about now?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.430
Still not sure?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.080
It is a pretty small difference right]?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:06.000
Inferential statistics give you the ability
to test how likely it is that the two populations

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.060
we sampled actually have different IQ increases.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.100
However, it’s up to you, as an individual,
to decide whether that’s convincing or not.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.930
And don’t be alarmed if the bar you set
isn’t the same in every situation.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:21.110
It’s entirely okay to have different standards
for the questions “does my cat like Fancy

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.240
Feast more than Meow Mix?” vs “does this
drug cure lung cancer?”.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.220
It might take more evidence to convince you
to take a new supposedly cancer curing drug

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.290
than to switch cat food brands.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.649
It should take more evidence to convince you
to take a new supposedly cancer curing drug

00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:38.230
than to switch cat food brands.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.529
With inferential tests, there will always
be some degree of uncertainty since it can

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:46.350
only tell you how likely something is or is
not.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:51.709
Your job is is to take that information and
use it to make a decision *despite* that uncertainty.

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:56.430
If Statistics were a superhero, it’s batcall
would be uncertainty, and it’s tagline would

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.840
be “When you don’t know for sure, but
doing nothing isn’t an option.”

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.220
Statistics are tools.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.420
Statistics help us make sense of the vast
amount of information in the world.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.520
Just like our eyes and ears filter out unnecessary
stimuli to just give us the best, most useful

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.160
stuff, statistics help us filter the loads
of data that come at us everyday.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.640
Descriptive statistics make` the data we get
more digestible, even though we lose information

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.660
about individual data points.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.820
Inferential statistics can help us make decisions
about data when there’s uncertainty (like

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.839
whether Smartie-vite actually will increase
your IQ).

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.050
But statistics can’t do all of the work.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.300
They’re here to help us reason, not to reason
for us.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.459
They help us see through uncertainty, but
they don’t get rid of that uncertainty.

00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:43.060
To push our tool analogy a step further.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:49.360
Statistics, like chainsaws , are pretty useless even dangerous without understanding how they work.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.840
We need to know how to use them and how not
to use them.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.160
As we will see in later episodes, statistics
done poorly can lead us to some pretty silly

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.170
conclusions.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.700
And, chain sawing done poorly leads to about
36-thousand injuries in the US each year.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.940
81% of which are lacerations.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.560
Did you know that almost no one dies because of chainsaw injuries?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.340
Once in a while, but it's very rare.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.680
95% of the people who are hurt by chain saws
are male.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.800
This does NOT necessarily tell us that males
are significantly worse chain sawers.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.120
Statistics can help us plan a vacation to
Bali in December.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.459
They can help us optimize our chances of winning
our fantasy football league.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.360
They can help us budget our meal card at college.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.560
Statistics can help us decide whether that
additional insurance the guy at Best Buy is

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.400
trying to sell us on our new blender is worth
it.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.920
Statistics can also help us decide whether
or not to go ahead with an invasive heart surgery.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.860
Statistics can help NGOs optimize the amount
of food aid they send to refugee camps.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.819
They can help policymakers decide if they
should spend more or less money on helping

00:11:50.819 --> 00:11:53.839
students pay back their school loans.

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:57.480
And can help you decide how much money you
should be comfortable borrowing for college

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
in the first place.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.910
There is a lot statistics can help us with
but some things statistics can’t do.Thinking

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.389
statistically means knowing the difference.

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:10.189
So, when your brother says he used statistics
to prove that your mom loves him more you

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:14.470
can rest easy knowing the only question he
answered is whether she gives him slightly

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.999
more ice cream each night.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.520
And you’ve got data suggesting she gives
you extra sprinkles.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.840
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
