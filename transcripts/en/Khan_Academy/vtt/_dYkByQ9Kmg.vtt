00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.364
- [Instructor] I wanna talk
a little bit about carbon

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:06.874
and how it cycles through our biosphere.

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:08.918
And we touch on this in other videos.

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:11.589
But when we talk about
elements like carbon,

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.262
they don't just appear and disappear

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:14.814
all of a sudden in our biosphere.

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:18.265
For the most part, they have
been here since the beginning.

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:22.045
But they just get recycled
from one form to another.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:24.870
And that is also true of carbon.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.904
And to appreciate carbon's importance

00:00:26.904 --> 00:00:29.216
in our biosphere, and especially to life,

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.317
I have some, some important molecules,

00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:33.833
or examples of important
molecules that involve carbon.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:38.405
In all of these, the carbons
are these dark gray colors.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.249
So this right over here,

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:41.416
this molecule,

00:00:42.557 --> 00:00:43.890
this is glucose.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.322
Glucose, simple sugar.

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:50.374
It's where we can derive
a lot of our energy from.

00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:52.428
This is ATP, you can view it as

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:56.595
a more immediate store of
energy in biological systems.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.906
This right over here is

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.906
one of many amino acids.

00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:06.128
The amino acids make up our proteins.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:08.953
This right over here is DNA.

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:10.018
And in all of these you can see

00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:11.081
the role that carbon is playing.

00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:12.842
In fact, sometimes the
carbon's hard to see

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.359
because it's closer to the
center of these molecules

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:16.619
because the carbon, for the most part,

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.952
forms the backbone.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.768
Because carbon's this really
neat, this really neat element,

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:22.143
this really neat atom

00:01:22.143 --> 00:01:24.109
that can make four bonds.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.645
It can make these really
really really cool structures.

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:30.648
But the question is how does carbon cycle

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:32.250
through our biosphere?

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.926
And we can get as simple or as complex

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.904
as we want to when we discuss this.

00:01:35.904 --> 00:01:37.586
But on very very simple terms,

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:40.618
this is how my brain tends to
think about the carbon cycle.

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:43.392
You can imagine the
carbon in our atmosphere

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:47.378
that's mainly in the form
of molecular carbon dioxide.

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:48.773
So this right over here,

00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:50.023
this is CO two.

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:53.198
Once again, the carbon
is in the middle there,

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:55.746
bonded to the two oxygens.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:57.623
And as much as we talk about CO two,

00:01:57.623 --> 00:02:00.964
and as important as carbon
is to living systems.

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:03.286
In fact, our bodies are 18

00:02:03.286 --> 00:02:04.953
to 19 percent carbon

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:09.526
carbon by mass.

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:13.157
So it's very important
for biological systems.

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:15.215
As important as carbon
is to biological systems,

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.240
and the role carbon dioxide plays

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.489
in things like global
warming, it actually makes up

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.866
a very small percentage of our atmosphere.

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:24.199
It's only about 0.04 percent

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.507
of the gas in our atmosphere.

00:02:27.507 --> 00:02:29.116
Most of our atmosphere
is actually nitrogen,

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.364
78 percent, you don't talk a lot about it.

00:02:31.364 --> 00:02:33.574
And oxygen, 21 percent.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:35.044
And then a bunch of other,

00:02:35.044 --> 00:02:37.681
a bunch of other elements and molecules.

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.028
But the very simple
version of the carbon cycle

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:44.734
is, okay, you have this
atmospheric carbon dioxide,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.398
molecular carbon dioxide,
hanging out in the air.

00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:50.856
And you have autotrophs like plants.

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.990
So let's say this is the ground,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.417
and I have a growing plant.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:57.604
So that's a plant right over there.

00:02:57.604 --> 00:03:01.058
That's its leaf, that's another leaf.

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:03.785
And the way that plants grow

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.981
is they're able to take light energy.

00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:09.589
So that's energy coming in from the sun,

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.468
and use that energy to fix carbon.

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:14.590
Now fixing carbon sounds
like a very fancy thing,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.479
but it's literally taking
that molecular carbon dioxide

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.838
out of the air and
fixing the carbon from it

00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:24.589
to form these different
molecules in the plant,

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.768
that help the plant, that
give the plant structure,

00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:28.571
that give the plant energy.

00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.435
And so that mass of that plant,

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.332
I'm actually in this room
I'm in, there's a houseplant

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:35.256
right next to me, it's
not just growing out of,

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.875
I mean, I guess you could say
it's growing out of thin air,

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.791
but the mass isn't just
magically appearing.

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:43.311
It's taking that mass out of the air.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:44.634
And so that's where,

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:49.067
so that's what allows this
plant to keep growing.

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:51.138
And so, once again, as I said,

00:03:51.138 --> 00:03:52.667
some of that will be in
the form of proteins,

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.684
amino acids, it could form
structural components.

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:57.395
It could be fats,

00:03:57.395 --> 00:03:59.209
and also some of it is energy.

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.073
And you could imagine other animals

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:03.799
that can't do this, that
can't photosynthesize,

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.276
well, they might wanna eat these plants

00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:06.224
for that energy.

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:08.846
In other videos, we talk
about the food cycle.

00:04:08.846 --> 00:04:11.536
And so, this could be me.

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:14.145
This could be me having a salad,

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:17.870
and I might want to eat that plant.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.867
I might wanna eat the
plant for the sugar in it.

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:22.559
Maybe it's an apple of some kind,

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:27.390
and then that gives my body
the energy to live and grow.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.701
And as I, as I metabolize that glucose,

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.124
so for example glucose
is one of the molecules

00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:35.345
that that plant can form

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:38.433
by taking that carbon out of the air.

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:42.058
And then I might metabolize that glucose

00:04:42.058 --> 00:04:43.771
from that plant I just ate,

00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:47.989
and as I do that, I will
release carbon dioxide.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:50.322
So I will release the CO two

00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:52.541
back in the air.

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.908
And then you can see that
you can form a cycle here.

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:58.352
The CO two gets released by
things that are metabolizing

00:04:58.352 --> 00:05:02.151
these organic molecules, and
then it can get fixed again

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:04.724
by autotrophs, which are
able to store the energy

00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:08.072
from the sun with, in
terms of these bonds,

00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:10.186
by fixing this carbon.

00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.526
But there's other
pathways that we can have

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:14.245
to have these cycles.

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:17.286
For example, some of the CO
two, it could be absorbed

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.700
into the ocean.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.867
It could be absorbed into,

00:05:21.983 --> 00:05:23.935
into the ocean.

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.474
And in the ocean it can form carbonate,

00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:29.094
and so once again you still see
the carbon right over there,

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.169
carbon bonded to three oxygens,

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.111
and calcium carbonate is a key constituent

00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:37.194
in things like seashells.

00:05:39.917 --> 00:05:42.493
And over time, as the
sea shells break down,

00:05:42.493 --> 00:05:44.200
and they get ground up,
and they get impacted

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.617
with pressure, they can form,

00:05:47.525 --> 00:05:50.115
they can form limestone.

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:53.148
So this right over here is limestone.

00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:53.981
Limestone.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.781
But once again, it was
formed from carbon dioxide

00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:01.164
being absorbed into the ocean,

00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:04.424
living things using that calcium,

00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:06.700
using that calcium carbonate,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.587
the carbonate in conjunction with calcium,

00:06:08.587 --> 00:06:10.507
in order to form these
shells, which get ground down,

00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:14.347
and it actually forms
these rock structures.

00:06:14.347 --> 00:06:16.327
You can have situations,

00:06:16.327 --> 00:06:19.313
you can have situations
where living things,

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:21.178
whether we're talking about
the autotrophs like plants,

00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:24.337
or we're talking about things
like me that are eating

00:06:24.337 --> 00:06:26.129
the plants, well, once they
die and there's all this

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.681
organic matter that hasn't
been broken down yet.

00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:30.273
Well, it gets buried in the ground.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:31.941
I'll do the plant because it's less morbid

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.332
than showing me dead.

00:06:34.332 --> 00:06:36.060
So let's say this is the plant.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.205
Well, with enough pressure and time.

00:06:38.205 --> 00:06:40.341
Sometimes in the decomposing process,

00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.223
some of the carbon might be released.

00:06:42.223 --> 00:06:44.041
But over time this might be compressed

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.506
and be turned into fossil fuels.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:50.151
So when you see oil or when
you are burning gasoline,

00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:53.932
which is really just a
refined part of the oil,

00:06:53.932 --> 00:06:55.866
it is really this organic matter

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:57.902
that was, that's storing energy

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:00.518
that plants were able to
store from light energy,

00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:04.406
possibly millions or tens
of millions of years ago.

00:07:04.406 --> 00:07:06.936
But then if you were to take that same,

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:09.668
if you were to take that
fossil fuel out of the ground,

00:07:09.668 --> 00:07:11.164
which we now do very actively

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:14.475
in order to power all of the
things that we need to power,

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.156
and you were to burn it.

00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:18.387
So let me see, if I were to.

00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:20.412
Let me just draw an example of that.

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:22.311
So let's say you just had,

00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.728
if you had a canister of oil.

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:27.820
I'm not gonna do the oil in black

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.823
because you'd have trouble seeing it.

00:07:29.823 --> 00:07:32.317
And if you were to burn it.

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:33.899
If you were to burn it,

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:35.149
the process of,

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:38.249
the process of combustion.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.786
And this is in general, if
you're burning anything,

00:07:39.786 --> 00:07:41.864
it doesn't just have to be oil.

00:07:41.864 --> 00:07:44.528
It could be burning a piece of wood.

00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:47.749
You're taking that organic matter,

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:49.432
those carbon-carbon bonds,

00:07:49.432 --> 00:07:50.846
and in some ways you can say you're doing

00:07:50.846 --> 00:07:53.500
the reverse of the photosynthesis process.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.590
You're breaking it down,
and in that process,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.991
you're releasing that carbon,
and it's getting released

00:07:57.991 --> 00:07:59.158
in the form of

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:01.887
carbon dioxide.

00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:04.174
Carbon dioxide, which in theory

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:06.693
could then be fixed once again.

00:08:06.693 --> 00:08:09.309
So the general idea,
autotrophs like plants,

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:13.227
when they photosynthesize,
they can fix that carbon.

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.483
And then it could either be burnt,

00:08:15.483 --> 00:08:17.825
and a combustion process can release

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.793
that carbon back into the atmosphere,

00:08:19.793 --> 00:08:24.040
or you could have other
animals eating that plant.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.965
And then, as they
