the most surprising of his research when
 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.990
the most surprising of his research when
we are studying in his work oh I've been

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000
we are studying in his work oh I've been
 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.210
we are studying in his work oh I've been
startled over and over again by by his

okay and that's his theory work on a

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229
okay and that's his theory work on a
 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.020
okay and that's his theory work on a
