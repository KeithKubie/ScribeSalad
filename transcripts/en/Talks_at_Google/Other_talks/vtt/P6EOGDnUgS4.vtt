00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.600
OK.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.920
Robert de Sorbon, James Pierpont, John Harvard,
Patrick Awuah.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.150
One of these is not like the others.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.029
Three of these men founded universities destined
to change the face of education on a continent.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.369
John Harvard just gave a bunch of books and
got a school named after it.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.869
Of the remaining three, we're very lucky to
have the only one who's in a position to actually

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.280
tell us what he did, why he did, and how he
did it.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.039
In 1989, I think it was, Paul Maritz is very
fond of telling the story of how he met Patrick

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.230
back when they were both at Microsoft.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.320
And Paul Maritz is now the CEO of VMware,
Chairman of the Board for the Grameen Foundation.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.840
As Paul tells this, he says he met this kid
who confided in him that he didn't want to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.219
spend his entire career at Microsoft.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.540
He wanted to go back to his home country and
found a university.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.110
And Paul said, "Well, good luck with that."

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.350
[clears throat] And thought to himself, "Well,
you know.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.810
Everyone needs dreams."

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.380
And it was eight or nine years later.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.000
Patrick left Microsoft to go to the Haas School
in Berkeley, where he developed a business

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.200
plan for creating a self-sustaining liberal
arts university in Ghana.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.189
I think it was four years later, Ashesi admitted
its first students.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.250
It's now ten years after that and the tenth
anniversary of Ashesi, Ashesi students are

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.360
already changing the face of education in
Africa.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.950
Ashesi students are in basically impossible
demand.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.240
They're recognized for their ethics and their
critical thinking skills as the future leaders

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.890
of government and of industry.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.219
And the large schools, the private and the
public universities in Ghana, are actually

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.850
getting pressured.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.659
They're being told they need to change a little
bit, become a little bit more like Ashesi.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.380
So, the name Ashesi comes from the Akan word
for "beginnings."

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.280
And was inspired by the quotation from Goethe,
which is, "If there is anything you can do,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460
or dream you can, begin it.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.600
Boldness has genius, power, and magic.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.390
Begin it now."

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.890
So, today I'm honored to have with us and
to introduce somebody who embodies both the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.940
boldness, the genius, the power, and the magic
of beginning something.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
And I'm pleased to introduce Patrick Awuah,
who began it all.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.680
[applause]

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.600
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Thank you very much, Pablo.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.721
So, what I thought I'd do this afternoon is
just tell you the story of Ashesi--of why

00:02:55.721 --> 00:03:04.890
it's here, of what it is today, and what it
is going to become in the future as we plan

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.040
the future of this institution.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:16.060
So, Ashesi, as you can see on the slides--on
this first slide--is really about a new Africa.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.960
And so, when I left Microsoft to start on
the journey to build this university, I wasn't

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.760
actually thinking about just the fact of building
a university.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:40.290
What I was really concerned about was contributing
to what's a renaissance on a continent.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.370
And what I was thinking about was the future
happiness of an entire people.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.430
This is what I set out to do.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.200
And the question is, why start a university?

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:09.090
So, imagine that you are just a guy or a gal
at Google or Microsoft.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.420
And you wanna change the future of a continent.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:22.049
And you don't have the financial resources
personally of Bill or Larry [laughs] or people

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.800
like that.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.220
But you want to change a continent.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.220
What do you do?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.740
Where do you begin?

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.629
For me, it was trying to figure out, is there
some catalytic thing that I could do that

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:48.720
would, in the long run, very long-term, achieve
the result that I wanted, that I sought.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.169
And I did a simple exercise at some point
with friends and family in Ghana, where we

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.389
would look at different problems.

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.139
Any problem.

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.889
Health care, infrastructure, governance, education,
you name it.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.099
And ask, "Why is this the way it is?"

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.960
And we would get a set of answers for each
of those problems.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.400
But then, take each of those answers and ask,
"Why?"

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:24.419
And try to drill down to figure out is there
something that seems to be fundamental across

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.280
all these problems.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.870
And as we did this exercise, one thing stood
out.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.770
And that thing was leadership.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.789
Leadership is defined by all the people in
positions of influence--the decision-makers--and

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.430
what they were doing, whether it was making
the wrong decisions or just accepting the

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.870
status quo as it was, or even being corrupt.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.970
And so, and this is a very strong signal,
right?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.740
So, I started to ask the question about--

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.300
[phone rings]

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.270
about how leaders are created.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:15.039
And that took me to take a second look at
education, from primary school through graduate

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.069
school.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:27.900
And what I found was--and again, higher ed
made a big signal for a couple of reasons.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.249
One is, I visited university campuses where
the classes were huge.

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:39.230
You would see hundreds of students, even over
a thousand students, in a classroom, with

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.169
one professor.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.879
And the classroom was physically not big enough.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:52.610
So, students would be standing outside on
the verandas looking through windows for lectures.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.610
I spoke with some of my own colleagues who
studied computing in college.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:07.680
And whose education in computer science involved
writing code on paper, not actually running

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.349
anything through a compiler or testing code,
and getting graded on paper.

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.550
And so, this was one thing I saw.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.749
It was very troubling.

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:31.210
The second thing was data that was telling
me that only, at the time, about two percent--and

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:38.199
it's still about five percent today--but back
then, about two percent of college age kids,

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:45.990
18 to say 24- year olds, were in college in
Ghana.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:55.089
And the problem with two to five percent is
it's too small, but also, by definition, the

00:07:55.089 --> 00:08:03.850
people in college across sub-Saharan Africa
will run their countries one day.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.449
By definition.

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:11.310
If you're in college, if you're among the
two percent, or today the five percent, you

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.770
will be the ones who--.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:21.120
They would be the ones running the courts,
running the schools, setting health policy,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.449
building infrastructure, etc.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:28.749
So now, for an individual thinking of what
to do with limited resources, it seemed like,

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:29.749
OK.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:36.350
If I could address this two percent problem,
this five percent problem, I could achieve

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.940
catalytic impact long-term.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:46.970
Because if I could change the way these leaders
are educated, then there would be a sea change

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.600
in Ghana.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.380
And if we could do it across sub-Saharan Africa,
imagine a continent transformed.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:06.630
So, this is how I got to decide what to do,
to think of developing ethical leaders who

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:16.020
have the ability to innovate, to be creative,
to not accept the status quo as it is.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.430
And so, I quit Microsoft and I got scared.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:32.190
So, every, it seemed every other day or so
I would wake up and wonder, "What am I doing?"

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.500
And then, I saw these words.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.390
So, I typed them up and I put them on my mirror.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.100
And I'd read them every day.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.240
Every day.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:48.410
So, the day I decided, I realized actually,
that I was committed, I said, "Wow.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.570
This is the beginning."

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:55.460
And that's why Ashesi is called what it's
called--the beginning.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.220
So, we've come a long way in ten years.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.570
This is a picture of our campus, our permanent
campus, when it was under construction.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.700
We have 500 students.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.950
We started with 30 in 2002.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.340
We've deployed world-class technology.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:24.580
So, kids who study computer science not only
design code, but they actually run code and

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.020
have a real experience.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.250
We have 370 graduates.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:35.990
A hundred percent job placement within six
months of our graduating classes.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.120
A beautiful campus.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.180
And increasing global recognition.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.750
So, this is an amazing thing to be a part
of.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.780
But you know what amazing is, right?

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.320
Google is amazing.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.830
And at the heart of it is liberal arts core
curriculum.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.130
When I came to the United States for undergraduate
education at Swarthmore, I experienced an

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:09.260
education unlike anything I had seen up until
that time.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.200
Professors who wanted me to think.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.510
Professors wanted me to tell them what I thought,
who wanted me to be analytical, both in a

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.680
qualitative and a quantitative way.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.210
And who wanted me to have a breadth of vision.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.390
And they demanded this of all the students
who went there.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:33.950
And so, an education that was the exact opposite
of the rote learning that I'd been through

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.600
up until that point.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.900
And so, we've implemented that at Ashesi--this
mix of the liberal arts with computer science,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.860
business administration, and MIS.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.710
That's what we've done in our first ten years.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.410
And the results are staggering.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:03.240
This is data from a study that was done by
a team of MBA students from Berkeley.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:11.380
They came to Ghana and they went around corporate
Ghana asking, "How would you rank university

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.480
graduates in this country?"

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.850
And Ashesi stands out.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:23.500
And we think that it's really because of our
incredible focus on the liberal arts core,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:34.730
our focus on teaching people, young people,
to have integrity and to care about what they

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.870
do and about their impact wherever they are.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.000
Ninety-five percent of our graduates stay
in Africa.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.790
I said, as I told you, they all get jobs.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.830
Most of them are in Africa, which is great.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:13:00.850
The five percent that are not in Africa, are
typically pursuing graduate education in the

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.850
United Kingdom or the United States.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.740
So, we proved our educational model.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.940
And we built a permanent campus.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.280
The question is, where do we go from here?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.930
[pause]

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:23.510
We're going to continue to do all the things
that we're doing--classrooms that encourage

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:30.940
conversation and discussion, interaction between
students and faculty and students interacting

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.100
with each other in debating with each other.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:45.100
Spaces that inspire people, that invite people
to gather and to really ask this question,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.730
"What is the good society?

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.950
What should it look like on this continent?

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.870
And how do we achieve it?

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.920
What is our role in achieving it?"

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.030
[pause]

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:06.700
We have a requirement for community service
at Ashesi.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:15.410
So, it's this balance between saying we really
want ethics and civic engagement to be central

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.790
to what we do, but it's something we can't
force.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.300
So, we say, "Well, you've gotta do it before
you graduate."

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:30.330
But we set just a small amount of hours required
and hope that students will do more.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.040
And they all do more.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:43.240
In 2008, an amazing event occurred on campus,
where a student body in Ghana decided to adopt

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.670
a student-run honor system and to come to
the faculty and say, "We will not cheat on

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.670
exams.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.000
We will not tolerate those who do."

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.970
And the reason, ultimately, they decided to
do this is because, if you think about it,

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:07.750
cheating in exams in a classroom is what corruption
looks like when you're 20 years old.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:16.450
And if you have an institution that tolerates
that, you're building, or you're nurturing

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.130
future corrupt leaders.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:25.870
If you have an institution that does not tolerate
that, then you're developing future leaders

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:31.600
that you can trust with a central bank, who
you can trust with the lives of people and

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.910
infrastructure that those people will live
and work in.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.370
And so, this is an amazing event.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.530
We stepped out of the classrooms for exams.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.430
We don't proctor exams.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.970
And students hold themselves to this rule.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:57.100
Now, of course unfortunately, we always have
a few students who do try to cheat in exams.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.810
And fortunately, their peers hold them accountable.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.170
They're brought before a judicial committee
that includes students.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.440
And they are held accountable.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:15.900
And to see this happening and the interest
that it has generated, not only within our

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:23.780
campus, but outside our campus as the accreditation
board has initially been very skeptical about

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.100
it, as corporate leaders have spoken out in
favor of it, as high school students are so

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.910
fascinated by this thing, that when we go
talk with them about Ashesi, this is a thing

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:42.260
they most want to talk about--about this society,
this community that has decided that it will

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260
no longer tolerate corruption among its ranks.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260
[pause]

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.540
So, what next?

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.320
We call it "Vision 20-20."

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.040
And I'll run quickly through it.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.800
And again, the process for getting to what
we do, what we're going to do.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.669
As we set about thinking about the next ten
years of Ashesi, we asked ourselves, "There's

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:11.829
so many things that we could be doing.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:18.549
How do we decide which ones to do and which
ones to not do and which ones to postpone?"

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:20.079
Right?

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.299
And we decided, "Well, let's go back to our
mission statement."

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:28.189
And our mission statement is to educate a
new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial

00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:31.249
leaders in Africa.

00:17:31.249 --> 00:17:33.450
Africa.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.770
And we asked, "For what?"

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:43.850
The answer is what I started with--to drive
a renaissance on the continent, to change

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.860
a continent for the next generation.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.260
And in order to do that, we realized we needed
to be educating people for industry and for

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.159
government.

00:17:55.159 --> 00:18:01.940
And so, we set about starting from where we
are today, figuring out what are the things

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.700
that we need to do to educate leaders for
industry and government.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:12.630
And we have three broad areas that we're going
to address.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:19.020
First of all, we're going to strengthen our
base, which is the people in our community.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.210
We're going to focus on diversity in excellence.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.039
Our mission statement talks about Africa.

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.110
Not Ghana.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.110
Africa.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.529
So, this will become a more pan-African institution.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:38.519
We will grow from a current ten percent of
our student body being from outside Ghana

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:45.330
to between 30 and 50 percent being from outside
Ghana in the next ten years.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.760
We will maintain gender balance.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.970
We have achieved it.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.759
We have approximately 50 percent of our students
are women.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:19:00.129
We will provide more scholarships so that
we continue to increase economic diversity

00:19:00.129 --> 00:19:02.789
within our ranks.

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:04.840
[pause]

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.070
We will create facilities to strengthen campus
culture.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:15.179
So, more housing so that more people from
diverse backgrounds live and learn together.

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:17.740
You look at a place like Ghana.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.840
It's a country the size of the state of Oregon.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.600
There are over 50 different languages spoken
there.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.409
They're Christians and Muslims and many other
religions in this country.

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:33.809
If you look at Africa, the diversity is even
greater.

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:40.830
And it is very important that these young
people live and learn together.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:47.850
Because we have committed to that, and because
we have committed to engaging in a conversation,

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:54.740
in 2006, Ashesi students elected a woman as
Head of Student Government for the first time

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.370
in Ghana's history.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:03.559
And within two years after that, three other
universities have done the same thing.

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:13.129
This is a sea change that we talk about--setting
an example that changes an entire country

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:17.490
and what it believes to be possible.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:26.470
We're going to develop a fund specifically
to attract and hire Africans in the diaspora

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.320
to return home.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.869
We found that there are many people who want
to come back home, who have student loans

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:39.179
they have to pay off, and therefore, need
to be on a US salary scale in order to do

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:40.179
that.

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:47.289
But if we can have funding to just take care
of those loans, then they can return home

00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:54.090
and be on a local salary scale and make their
contribution to their continent.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:59.149
So, this is going to be another thing that
we focus on.

00:20:59.149 --> 00:21:02.110
The next thing is to broaden our impact.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:10.169
Now, for this, we've decided on three areas
that we're going to tackle.

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:14.040
The first is engineering and applied sciences.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.809
Computer science and MIS, we're already doing,
fit into that.

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:23.510
But we're going to get into electrical engineering,
computer engineering, mechanical engineering.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:31.190
And we took the time to go talk with companies
in telecommunications, in the oil and gas

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.460
industry, and also in light manufacturing
to guide what we do.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.600
And so, these are the majors that we're going
to do next.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.799
These will be leaders for industry.

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:49.940
But actually, the systems design mind will
be incredibly helpful in government as well.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:56.200
And the engineering program will have not
only strengths in systems and design thinking,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.399
but also in entrepreneurial thinking.

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:01.879
The second area is management and economics.

00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:10.490
So, to add economics to the business degree
and to learn from the examples of Latin America,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.659
where a few countries developed such strong
undergraduate programs in economics, that

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:21.590
their top graduates came to the United States
for their PhD's through the best PhD programs

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.710
here.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.830
They've returned to their countries.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.669
They're running central banks, ministries
of finance.

00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:32.049
They're presidents and they've changed their
continent.

00:22:32.049 --> 00:22:37.360
And we think that we can replicate this in
Africa.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.409
And finally, law and society.

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:46.770
So, economics and management is leaders for
industry and government policy.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:52.919
Law and society, leadership for government
for civic society.

00:22:52.919 --> 00:23:01.049
It turns out that a lot of kids in high school
who have an ambition to enter government,

00:23:01.049 --> 00:23:04.790
look to political science and law as the path
to get there.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.919
And so, we're going to meet that need.

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:20.539
It is also the case that those countries that
have strong rule of law are the ones that

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:30.990
do the best economically and socially in terms
of human rights, civil rights and so on.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:37.670
And of course, all of this will be based on
a liberal arts core, which is central to everything

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.629
that we do.

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:45.070
Engineering is the first thing that we're
going to engage and we're basically designing

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:51.409
the curriculum and the buildings, the labs,
and so on.

00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:55.770
I would like to invite you to join our community.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.090
Follow news from Ashesi.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.629
Invest in Africa's future.

00:24:00.629 --> 00:24:09.820
And by the way, I think Google is doing an
amazing job of investing in Africa's future.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:21.019
And I see lots of companies that look at that
map that you have of a continent that is dark

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:23.860
and say, "Oh, there's nothing there."

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.950
And I talk to Googlers and what I hear is,
"Oh, it's not lit up.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.389
Let's go light it up."

00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:34.330
I mean, that's, that's fantastic.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.860
And I invite you to continue to do that.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.860
Visit us.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.750
I think that this is one of the most compelling
projects in Africa.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:52.590
And your visit is actually super important
for our students.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:56.330
What do I mean by that?

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:05.700
In any organization, in any society, in any
country, there is an understood performance

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.549
horizon that people see.

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:13.269
People have a performance horizon.

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:21.289
And it is really important when somebody within
that community pushes the envelope, pushes

00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:28.460
that horizon a little higher and demonstrates
to others that actually, our performance horizon

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.009
can be higher than it currently is.

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:37.830
And I have found that when our students engage
with people like you all, who have an incredibly

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:44.989
high performance horizon, it helps reset what
they aim for in the future.

00:25:44.989 --> 00:25:49.289
And that's why I'm inviting you to visit.

00:25:49.289 --> 00:25:51.919
Be part of the solution.

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.759
Come guest lecture.

00:25:53.759 --> 00:25:55.980
It could be a day.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980
It could be a week.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.989
It could be a whole semester--everything in-between.

00:26:01.989 --> 00:26:07.629
Service technical advisers to help us with
our own IT systems on-campus.

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:17.750
Or, to assist a students who's working on
a project for his or her senior design project.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.980
These are all super important.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:25.970
And finally, please be an online advocate
for Ashesi.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.169
Help spread the word.

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:34.429
I think that it is very important in this
world that when something good is happening

00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:41.789
in a corner, that we shine a light on it so
others can see and follow.

00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:44.140
And so, come join us.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.159
We'd really appreciate it.

00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.159
Thank you.

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:48.159
[applause]

00:26:48.159 --> 00:26:49.159
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, we've got plenty of
time for questions and discussions, but because

00:26:49.159 --> 00:27:13.483
we're taping, I'm asked that either you go
to the microphone there or that I hand you

00:27:13.483 --> 00:27:14.483
one of these microphones.

00:27:14.483 --> 00:27:15.483
Brave individuals.

00:27:15.483 --> 00:27:17.399
&gt;&gt;Male #1: How did the other universities
react when you set up Ashesi?

00:27:17.399 --> 00:27:25.940
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Well, when we first started,
I think there was a lot of skepticism on different

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940
fronts.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:32.619
I mean, first of all, I was 35 years old and
I was gonna start a university.

00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:39.970
And just to give you some context, a 35-year
old in Ghana is considered a small boy.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.970
And so, there were people, quote unquote.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.419
So, there were people who were just skeptical
because a young person was going to do this

00:27:46.419 --> 00:27:48.809
and didn't believe it could happen.

00:27:48.809 --> 00:27:54.740
There were people who, the liberal arts approach
is so different.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:02.100
The idea that a student applies for college
and is required to take a breadth of subjects

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.309
before they specialize was new.

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:07.649
And so, there was some skepticism about that.

00:28:07.649 --> 00:28:10.980
But ultimately, we were allowed to proceed.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:19.730
And I think that there is, today, very widespread
acknowledgment that the Ashesi experiment

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.149
is delivering really good results.

00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:28.870
And so, people are starting to take a much
closer look at what we're doing and thinking

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.190
through how they might replicate it as well.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.190
[pause]

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.309
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I'm sorry.

00:28:36.309 --> 00:28:40.440
Hi, my name is Nikki.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.049
And I have a question that has to do, I guess,
with corruption.

00:28:44.049 --> 00:28:48.779
Last January or so, I was at Ashesi before
you made the new campus.

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:49.779
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: OK.

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:52.929
&gt;&gt;Female #1: And I was listening to a presentation
by the founders of DreamOval.

00:28:52.929 --> 00:28:56.999
And they're talking about all the great projects
they've done with the Grameen Foundation,

00:28:56.999 --> 00:29:01.980
with nursing in the Northern Region as well
as all the different solutions that they created.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.130
But one of the issues that they brought to
light was that even though they have great

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.989
products and they're able to execute well
on it, there's always this cultural notion

00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:14.489
of bribes, especially when you're trying to
secure certain government contracts.

00:29:14.489 --> 00:29:15.489
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:29:15.489 --> 00:29:16.620
&gt;&gt;Female #1: And different things.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.909
And I know one of my friends recently moved
back to start a company in Ghana and talked

00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:25.520
about the issues of giving bribes to get off
the ground.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.930
And it seems like that's a larger cultural
problem that even with great leadership, you

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.009
have to have that across the board.

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:33.470
And have you thought about that?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.789
Or, how are ways that you're looking at that
in the community?

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:37.789
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:38.789
OK.

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:39.789
So, that's a good question.

00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:44.600
I mean, we're in an environment where, particularly
when you're dealing with government offices,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:54.499
there's this endemic culture of people asking
for bribes in order to let you do what you're

00:29:54.499 --> 00:29:59.059
doing or for them to do their jobs.

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:06.419
My response to that has been fairly simple.

00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:08.649
We just don't do it.

00:30:08.649 --> 00:30:18.929
And the thing is, what I found is that when
it really comes down to it, you can get things

00:30:18.929 --> 00:30:21.190
done without paying bribes.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.859
You might be slowed down a little bit, but
when it becomes very clear to people that

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:30.519
this is not going to happen, then they let
you get on with it.

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.519
OK?

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:35.700
And for me, I think, you all know about bucket
lists, right?

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.499
There's a set of things that you wanna do
before you kick the bucket.

00:30:39.499 --> 00:30:43.869
Well, it's actually important to also have
an anti-bucket list, right?

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:48.720
The set of things that you're not going to
do before you kick the bucket.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.230
[laughter]

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.950
And this is one of those things that's in
my anti-bucket list.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:31:05.370
So, my view of it is first of all, if you
do it, then things get really messy because

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.659
then they've got you.

00:31:07.659 --> 00:31:10.960
And they'll never let you go.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:20.690
And if you don't do it, it pushes you to,
first of all, work with those organizations

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:27.500
and those institutions that don't do it, which
is a much healthier way to be anyway.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.429
And apart from that, I think that you eventually
will get things done and you'll get--.

00:31:32.429 --> 00:31:39.299
My experience has been the people who have
put pressure on me for this, I think after

00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:45.100
the fact, respect me more for the stand that
we've taken at Ashesi.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.080
And this is what I encourage everybody to
do.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.380
[pause]

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:57.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: As the organizer of the
talk, I get to ask some questions, too.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:00.039
Which is, so, at Google we're a technology
company.

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:03.479
And when your only tool is a hammer, everything
looks like a nail.

00:32:03.479 --> 00:32:07.690
So, looking at this, the first thing that's
spinning through my head is, "How can we throw

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.039
technology at the solution?

00:32:10.039 --> 00:32:18.009
How can technology be thrown at the question
of educating ethical, socially aware, liberal

00:32:18.009 --> 00:32:21.419
arts students?"

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:22.909
I'm sure you've thought a bit about that.

00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:28.380
Could we get you to spend a couple of minutes
hypothesizing how technology could help you

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.220
go one or two more steps along?

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.559
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: OK.

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:39.559
So, first of all, let me just say that technology
has already played a role in the work that

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:40.629
we're doing.

00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:46.109
And I'll tell you different kinds of technology
and the roles they played.

00:32:46.109 --> 00:32:53.729
So, when Ghana first set off on this path
for democracy, mobile phones and FM radio

00:32:53.729 --> 00:33:01.369
turned out to be extremely important for making
sure that our elections were fair because

00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:06.359
people had mobile phones at the polling stations
and they could call in and report if something

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:10.009
was going wrong.

00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:16.899
Technology is being deployed in Ghana today
with the voter registration to do biometric

00:33:16.899 --> 00:33:18.049
registration for voters.

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:21.070
So now, it's really difficult for people to
do multiple registrations.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.590
And when they do, they get caught.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:35.499
So, technology can play a role to the extent
that it enables things to be more transparent

00:33:35.499 --> 00:33:37.120
and hold people accountable.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.149
OK?

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:48.741
In terms of the particular role of how do
you educate people to have integrity, that's

00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:57.470
a more difficult question because I feel that,
for Ashesi anyway, it has required high touch.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:05.489
It has required many, many conversations in
classrooms, outside the classroom, about the

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:12.010
age-old question of what the good society
should be in our country.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.849
And you need to do that.

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:22.629
But I also, two years ago, the accreditation
board asked us to stop the honor system.

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:28.370
It wasn't so much, they were concerned about
the idea that students say they're gonna be

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:33.490
honest, but they didn't believe that if we
weren't proctoring exams assumes we're not

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:36.020
in fact cheating, OK?

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.450
And so they asked us to stop it.

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.899
And this resulted in a big--.

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:44.059
I got copied on hundreds of letters that our
students wrote to the accreditation board.

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:46.270
And I read every letter.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.049
It was--.

00:34:49.049 --> 00:34:51.540
And we all, this thing hit the news.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.419
I was on television.

00:34:53.419 --> 00:34:56.059
Students were on radio and television, talking
about it.

00:34:56.059 --> 00:35:03.650
So, this was technology broadcasting an event
that was happening in this small school in

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.930
Accra.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:11.000
And then, of course, there was just this huge
conversation that took off on Twitter and

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:20.329
Facebook with students from other universities
questioning our students about whether this

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:22.200
was real or not.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.339
So again, technology was a platform where
the intimate conversation that we had had

00:35:27.339 --> 00:35:33.200
on campus was now getting out into the broader
community.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.830
And I know that there's students.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:40.460
We did an ethics conference and there were
students from other universities that came.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.530
There were some students from the University
of Ghana that came to Ashesi and asked to

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.319
have lunch with me to talk about this.

00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:51.880
And they heard about it because technology
helped broadcast it.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:59.819
So, I think, I see technology as a basic infrastructure
that helps us get the word out.

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:07.530
And over time, will facilitate a conversation,
a two-way conversation as well.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.480
[pause]

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.339
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.299
Sorry.

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:18.500
I had another question.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.700
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: OK, sure.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.380
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [laughs] Another thing I noticed
when I was back in Ghana at Ashesi, was that

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.500
the founders of DreamOval as well as other
entrepreneurs had really great ideas and really

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:34.359
innovative products, but getting VC funding,
internally in Ghana, or getting the resources

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:37.470
was, seemed very difficult, either one, because
they were too young, so they thought maybe

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.540
it was some scam or two, just because it wasn't
as readily available.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:47.289
And so, how does one look at, I guess, the
issue of bringing the resources and the talent

00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:51.550
together in Ghana versus, I guess, places
like Silicon Valley, where it's just readily

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:52.550
available?

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.880
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.520
So, that's a very good question.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.090
Silicon Valley is an amazing place.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:12.460
And venture capital has been an incredible
factor in driving what is happening here.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.980
We don't have that in Ghana yet.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:23.520
But I am pretty optimistic that as we see
more clearly what's happening in the rest

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.670
of the world, there is a possibility for this
to also come to Ghana.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:39.890
I think that it's been, it's very important
that DreamOval is essentially pushing the

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.890
envelope, right?

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.849
This performance horizon that I talked about.

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:53.550
And if you came to Ghana 20 years ago, you
wouldn't see a bunch of young people, which,

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.440
as big an ambition as those guys have, right?

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.410
To have a 24-year old, a group of 24-year
olds say, "We are going to implement mobile

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:07.760
money and we're going to change the world
for all these poor people who are unbanked,"

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.660
is not something that you would have seen,
but you see that today, because of the work

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.420
that we're doing in Ashesi.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:23.210
And I think that as we see more of those kinds
of attempts that that also will attract capital

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.140
to support people like that.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:35.559
I really hope that we can have more of an
incubation culture in Ghana and on the African

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:36.559
continent.

00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:39.450
I mean, there are other institutions that
are beginning to do this.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:46.940
There's an organization called Meltwater that
is doing this is Ghana.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.609
And I hope that we'll see more of that in
the years to come.

00:38:50.609 --> 00:38:51.609
[pause]

00:38:51.609 --> 00:38:53.760
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.270
So, what do I want to say?

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.270
Yeah.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:04.970
You were talking about bringing, expanding
the offering for things like electrical engineering.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:05.990
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:10.230
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And there are now online courses
like those from MITx--

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:11.230
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.270
&gt;&gt;Male #2: which are making a follow into
this.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.310
Can you make use of this?

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.480
Would it help what you are doing?

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.480
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Yeah.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:26.040
I mean, our faculty look at MIT OpenCourseWare
quite a bit.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.510
We have a relationship with those guys where
we actually even get a local copy of it.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:31.920
So, they take snapshots.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:39.400
So, we actually have locally hosted OpenCourseWare
on campus.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.770
And I can tell you that as we're designing
the electrical engineering program, that's

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:49.359
one of the sources that we've looked at to
guide us.

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:50.789
[pause]

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:55.089
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi.

00:39:55.089 --> 00:40:00.039
With only a few percent of the people who
are of a suitable age to go to college, going

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:07.920
to college, I can see how a step in the quality
of education and the ethics of education can

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.660
make a real contribution to society.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:17.930
But in places like the US where lots of people
go to college and ethics is on the decline,

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.650
what strategy can we adopt?

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.650
[laughter]

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.080
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: OK.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.800
So, look.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:36.329
I think that the United States and other advanced
countries need to never forget the basics.

00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:37.500
OK?

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:49.599
I think that there's some classical ideas
that sometimes, as we pursue technology and

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:57.369
advancement, we start to think that Plato's
"Republic," or "The Allegory of the Cave"

00:40:57.369 --> 00:41:00.440
and things like this no longer apply.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.280
But there's some ideas that really are timeless.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:11.980
And I think that it's very important that
all institutions of learning pay attention

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:19.369
to the idea that ethics is important and that
civic engagement is important.

00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:26.930
I would also like to say that there is a dark
side in the world.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:33.520
And those guys, they have no qualms about
indoctrinating people with bad ideas.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.670
OK?

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:44.340
And the way to counter that is to make sure
that we are lighting up people's minds with

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:51.630
the basic things, those timeless ideas.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:42:02.430
Venture capital, this whole model of financing
young people and having patient capital and

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:07.809
putting money into a company without a lot
of collateral or any collateral, that wouldn't

00:42:07.809 --> 00:42:11.390
work if there was no trust.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:17.839
You need a high-trust environment for this
whole phenomenon to be successful, right?

00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:20.540
So that's my view of it.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540
[pause]

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.540
Hi, Brigitte.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.500
&gt;&gt;Female #3: How are you?

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.360
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Good.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.470
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I have a few questions.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:35.880
One, given the kind of environment in Ghana
in terms of employment, you mentioned that

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.099
100 percent of the students get employment.

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:40.550
Curious about where that is?

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:45.650
I know that a lot of the traditional companies,
the tel-cos and the banks, tend to dominate.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:46.900
And in that environment, two things.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.750
Do you think that they're able to make change?

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:53.020
Like, do you think that they are having an
impact outside of themselves?

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:58.020
Only because the hierarchical nature of the
environment basically says you're small, you

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.049
be quiet, this is how we operate.

00:43:01.049 --> 00:43:02.130
The other side is compensation.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:05.650
So, I know compensation varies incredibly
drastically in Ghana.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.650
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.010
&gt;&gt;Female #3: So, understanding, do you see
your students being rewarded more on the compensation

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.010
side?

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.960
'Cause I think that's gonna be a big factor
in keeping them local in the long term and

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.960
not going to Nigeria.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960
[laughs]

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Right.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:23.369
So, those are very good questions.

00:43:23.369 --> 00:43:31.380
So, we see our students actually climbing
up the corporate ladder wherever they go quite

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.750
quickly.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:38.550
And I assume that increased compensation goes
with that.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:43.140
So, I think that resolves itself.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:51.799
I talk with chief executives in the country
who have now decided that Ashesi is going

00:43:51.799 --> 00:44:00.010
to be a key place to hire from, particularly
because they're engaged with succession planning.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:06.520
And they're looking for people that they think
can rise up into middle management and eventually,

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.619
into executive management.

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:12.020
And they think Ashesi is a place that they
can get those kinds of people.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.430
So, that's encouraging.

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:21.289
Those are very encouraging conversations for
me to have.

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:25.650
Your other question had to do with jobs, right?

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:30.990
And again, I think it comes down to the basics.

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:40.319
If somebody is well-educated and is a problem-solver
and has an entrepreneurial mind, and you put

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:47.839
that person even in a corporate structure,
they will come up with new ideas, new ways

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.849
for the organization to grow.

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:59.690
And so, for example, when an Ashesi alum goes
and works in a bank and goes to their manager

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.240
and says, "There's this whole population of
people who are unbanked.

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.450
And we need to be thinking of a strategy to
reach those guys."

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:11.650
And managers convince management to pursue
that.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.490
Now, that bank is growing, right?

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:22.170
It's now expanding to look at a segment, a
market segment, that they hadn't before just

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:26.839
because of this one person who had the idea.

00:45:26.839 --> 00:45:32.390
And as it enters in that segment, they'll
be jobs that come with that.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:42.970
Recently, GE entered Ghana and they hired
from Ashesi to open up their Accra office.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:48.080
And now, the company is working multimillion
dollar deals in the country.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.180
And that's going to generate more jobs in
Ghana.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:46:02.589
And so, when I started this project, I said
to myself, "This is a long-term play.

00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:06.890
It's gonna take a couple of decades or maybe
three decades for me to see the full impact

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.150
of the work that we're doing."

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:14.549
In the meantime, just paying attention to
what are the steps that we're taking and what

00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:17.610
are the little glimmers that we're on the
right path?

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:23.049
And I think that it's, so far it looks promising.

00:46:23.049 --> 00:46:26.069
[pause]

00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:35.130
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Hello.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.040
I'm interested in knowing more about your
students.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.069
What are the criteria to get into Ashesi?

00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:47.369
And what barriers do they face during their
education that might prevent them from graduating

00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:49.190
and being successful in a college?

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:54.750
And what, how does the college help them achieve
that success?

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.089
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: OK.

00:46:57.089 --> 00:47:00.640
So, Ashesi student body is very diverse.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.010
So, we have students from poor, rural villages
or even urban slums.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.799
We have students from quite affluent families
and everything in-between.

00:47:09.799 --> 00:47:15.540
So, it's very dispersed.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:22.200
Now, their academic background, as you might
imagine, is different, right?

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:29.960
So, the kid who grew up in a rural village
went to an under-resourced school, maybe went

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.650
to a school and didn't even have a math teacher.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:36.540
It's at a disadvantage.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:43.859
When we make admissions decisions, what we
do is we look at a standardized national exam

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:48.369
and the accreditation board has minimum standards
for admission.

00:47:48.369 --> 00:47:53.920
We certainly will not go below those standards.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.779
But more importantly, we look at the person.

00:47:56.779 --> 00:47:59.880
So, we do interviews.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.690
Students write essays.

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.250
We try to really understand who this person
is.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:15.619
And the idea is, the kid who's self-taught
and got a "C" in math is often just as bright

00:48:15.619 --> 00:48:18.079
as a kid who went to a really good school
and got an "A" in math.

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.300
They just didn't have the resources.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:25.309
And we need to give that person an opportunity.

00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:28.119
And we need to provide the resources to help
that person.

00:48:28.119 --> 00:48:34.460
So, for example, having a learning lab where
they can go and get extra help with math and

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.700
English and things like that.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.539
Those things are very important to help people
get through.

00:48:41.539 --> 00:48:42.809
Now, once they're--.

00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:47.410
So, that's part of the answer to the second
part of your question.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:58.020
One of the things that prevent people from
being successful in college, interestingly,

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.809
some of our students who have struggled the
most are from quite affluent backgrounds.

00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:07.210
And part of the reason they struggle when
they're in college is because they just don't

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.210
have that fire in their belly.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.299
The stakes are not as high.

00:49:12.299 --> 00:49:14.650
They're not as driven.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.160
And sometimes, that's a problem.

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.069
And so, that's something that we're grappling
with.

00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:23.460
So, you'll have a few students who will flunk
out academically.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:32.930
There's some students who will be expelled
for ethics violations if they do it enough.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:39.960
There's always a second chance given to people,
depending on the severity of the offense.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.860
But so, we have a few people that fall into
that category.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.490
It's something that we have to do to just
make the point that, "Hey, this is who we

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.710
are."

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:55.400
And then, there's a third group that's very
difficult to deal with.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.710
When we give financial aid, and we give a
significant amount of financial aid every

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:07.859
year, but what we do is we commit all the
financial aid dollars we have available upon

00:50:07.859 --> 00:50:08.859
entry.

00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:12.440
In fact, it's never enough, OK?

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:19.500
And then, after the fact, it may be a couple
of years in, as students' family circumstances

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.490
change, they can no longer afford the fees.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:27.490
There are a few students who drop out because
their families are no longer able to afford

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:28.490
the fees.

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:34.780
And that's very difficult, but it is what
it is.

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.160
I mean, we need--.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:43.220
One of the things that we're trying to do
is to raise extra money, sort of emergency

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:49.720
funding, and the executive team at Ashesi
set up an executive emergency fund that we

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.990
contribute to ourselves.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.540
And certain categories of students.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:51:02.029
If there's been a death in the family, a parent
has died, or there's some other major incident

00:51:02.029 --> 00:51:05.849
like that, they can apply to that fund to
get funding.

00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:09.470
But again, even that funding is limited, right?

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.570
So, those are the things that cause problems.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:12.570
[pause]

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.020
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think we have time for
one last question.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.500
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I'm last?

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.500
OK.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.940
So, you talked about wanting to change a continent.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.119
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Mm-hmm.

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:25.530
&gt;&gt;Female #3: So, what are your ideas for making
Ashesi scale?

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:30.829
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: The big scale question.

00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:41.859
Well, let me say that, first of all, when
I started Ashesi, I had this idea that one

00:51:41.859 --> 00:51:45.910
day there would be like, ten Ashesi's in Africa.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:50.599
And franchise is not the right word because
we're not for profit.

00:51:50.599 --> 00:51:58.490
But there would be family of schools around
the continent that have the same mission,

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:05.859
they share the same ethos, that perhaps operate
differently depending in terms of particular

00:52:05.859 --> 00:52:09.980
courses they offer, depending on where they
are on the continent.

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.720
And I was gonna be the one to make it happen,
OK?

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.230
So, then I got started.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:21.230
And believe me, [laughs] it is really hard.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:27.289
So, what we, where we are now is to say, "OK.

00:52:27.289 --> 00:52:32.180
We've done the first phase of our project,
the first ten years."

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.140
Hugely successful in my view.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:42.640
And we're doing the second phase, which is
about really identifying a few very high-impact

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:51.900
areas that if we do will be transformative
in Ghana--just public, private.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:56.010
And then to say, "Well, we're going to invite
students from all over the continent to experience

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:57.010
this."

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.430
And they'll go back to their countries and
make change.

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:00.510
We have examples of this.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.960
We have someone who went back to Liberia who
is making a big difference.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.539
There's somebody who went back to Sierra Leone
who is making a huge difference.

00:53:08.539 --> 00:53:10.770
And just expand it that way.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:17.650
Now, once we've built the model, then the
question is how do we take that and scale

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:19.010
it.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:20.369
OK?

00:53:20.369 --> 00:53:27.490
And it's dawned on me that the way to take
it and scale it is I need to build up my organization.

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:35.930
We actually need focused minds on how do you
take this and replicate it?

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:44.750
And depending on funding levels and so on,
we may or may not need other Patricks to execute

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:45.750
this.

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.940
And I think that the leadership is really
important.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:55.580
Now, this one has been super difficult because
funding was very scarce when we started.

00:53:55.580 --> 00:54:03.440
It required somebody who was absolutely dedicated
and persistent and willing to go through a

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.319
bunch of stuff.

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:10.329
Those people are hard to find.

00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:15.619
But, and so, those projects need to go through
that same pain.

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:22.791
Then, we will need to find people in those
countries that have that persistence and that

00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:27.440
dedication, who are gonna go through the pain
to get it done.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.740
It's gonna be crucial.

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.599
And it's hard to find those guys.

00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:37.160
Now, if there's funding for it, then it may
be different.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.059
But I haven't figured it all out yet.

00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:44.810
But it would be really cool if we could replicate
Ashesi.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:50.150
So, that's why the second answer is replicating
the idea.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:57.410
So, there's replicating what we've done and
there is looking at other institutions that

00:54:57.410 --> 00:55:02.990
already exist, that already have infrastructure,
that already have people, and say, "Can we,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:09.790
is there a way that we can inject the Ashesi
DNA, the Ashesi ethos into those institutions?"

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:15.210
And that also is gonna require sitting down
and thinking about exactly how we do that.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:27.490
But those are the two ways that, I think,
eventually we will look at the scale question.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:40.032
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you, everyone.

00:55:40.032 --> 00:55:41.032
Thank you so much for coming, Patrick.

00:55:41.032 --> 00:55:42.032
I know there are a lot of--.

00:55:42.032 --> 00:55:43.032
Some of you have meetings throughout the afternoon.

00:55:43.032 --> 00:55:44.032
If you don't have that time scheduled and
you want to try and find some time, come see

00:55:44.032 --> 00:55:45.032
me afterwards.

00:55:45.032 --> 00:55:46.032
And I'll thank you again.

00:55:46.032 --> 00:55:47.032
&gt;&gt;Patrick Awuah: Thank you very much.

00:55:47.032 --> 00:55:47.033
[applause]
