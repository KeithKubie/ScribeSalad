00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.940
The athletes of today are not only much better
than those of the past, they also look incredibly

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.459
different. The weird thing is, scientists
know that the human body hasn't evolved that

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.250
dramatically in the past 100 years. So why
do Olympic athletes look so different now,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.310
compared to the first winter Olympics in 1924?

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.810
In the early 1900's the ideal athlete was
based on classical human proportions. If we

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.070
imagine body types distributed as a bell curve
- extreme body types being on the far ends

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.440
- it was the middle of the curve that was
considered the best physical build. Athletes

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.570
who were not too tall, but not too short,
not too bulky, but not to skinny, and, well

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.980
average, were deemed as ideal for the olympic
pursuit.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.230
But this has all changed. Now athletes succeed
based on their highly specialised body types

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.870
which allow them to excel in a world of growing
competitiveness. For example, athletes who

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.780
are required to spin in the air - such as
figure skaters or gymnasts - have been getting

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.250
smaller. These athletes with short specialised
body types have an advantage over average,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.579
or tall athletes, weeding them out at the
elite level. In fact, in 30 years the average

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.590
professional gymnast has shrunk from 5'3"
to 4'9".

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.369
Computer simulations studying the physics
of ski-jumping have proven that jump length

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.819
increases drastically with a decrease in body
weight. Throughout recent years this has caused

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.929
world class ski-jumpers to become extremely
underweight, including many examples of anorexia.

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.679
With women competing in the Olympic ski-jumping
event for the first time this years, their

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.179
bodies are stockier and broader than their
male counterparts. As female ski-jumping becomes

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.880
more popular and competitive in the future,
it's likely we'll see the extremely thin ski-jumping

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.689
body type dominate the sport.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.189
Hockey is also an example of visible body
changes. Studies looking at the past 26 years

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.450
alone found a steady increase through the
years, of nearly all variables measured. This

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.789
included height, mass, body mass index, aerobic
and anaerobic fitness and even grip strength.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.489
Since the 1920's hockey players have increased
nearly 4 inches, on average - from 5'9 to

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.229
6'1.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.999
So, clearly the "average Joe" olympian is
a thing of the past. But Science Says... the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.900
Games may now be a realistic goal for people
of many different sizes 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
and shapes.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics. Can't wait?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.900
Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.500
Just head to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to watch them before anyone else. Link in the description. 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.500
