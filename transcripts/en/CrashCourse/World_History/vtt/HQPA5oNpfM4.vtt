00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.140
Hi. I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today's video is kind of

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.580
a response to one of the most riveting history
books you'll ever read, the Columbian Exchange

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.339
by David Crosby. He had a good year in 1969--
published The Columbian Exchange, played Woodstock,

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.979
he was still on his first liver. What? It
was Albert Crosby? Gash! History, never being

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.380
as interesting as I want it to be.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.480
Right, so it was Alfred Crosby Jr., and in
that book he wrote, "The big questions are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.050
really the only ones worth considering, and
colossal nerve has always been a prerequisite

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.539
for such consideration." I love it!

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.950
Before 1492, we couldn't really talk about
a world history at all, we could only talk

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.520
about the different histories of separate
regions, but Columbus changed all of that,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.450
and everything else. The Columbian Exchange
irrevocably homogenized the world's biological

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.780
landscape. Since Columbus, the number of plant
and animal species has continually diminished,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.940
and the variation in species from place to
place has diminished dramatically. I mean,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.580
the first European visitors to the Americas
had never seen a tomato or a catfish; Native

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.170
Americans had never seen a horse, and by making
our planet biologically singular, the Columbian

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.760
Exchange completely remade the populations
of animals, particularly humans. And vitally,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.920
this cross-pollination also made possible
such wonders as contemporary pizza.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.720
[theme music]

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.780
So we're going to break the Columbian Exchange
down into four categories: Diseases, boy,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.610
you're looking good Smallpox, I'm glad you've
been eliminated; Animals, Plants, and People.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.880
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! People are animals.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.190
Yeah, that's true, me from the past, but just
for the sake of simplicity we're--

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.659
Also, when you think about it, microbes are
kinda animals and plants are, too, I mean--

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.870
Oh my god, shut up before I kill you and create
a time travel paradox.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.890
Microbes, like those hairy blokes back there,
were a definite negative in terms of the Columbian

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.090
Exchange. Terminology is hard here, but the
majority of Caribbean Islanders or Native

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.299
Americans or Amerindians had exactly one response
to the arrival of Europeans: death.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.299
We can't be sure of how many natives died
as a result of European arrival but it was

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.420
definitely more than 50% and some estimates
place it as high as 90%. Historians used to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.690
blame European brutality, which was definitely
a factor, but the main culprit was disease.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.479
Smallpox is usually seen as the villain of
the story but it is more likely that a series

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.259
of diseases in combination did the damage.
Along with smallpox, Americans were killed

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.349
by measles and mumps, typhus, chicken pox,
none of which they had been previously exposed

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.329
to. This astonishing decrease of population
was definitely the worst effect of these diseases,

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.819
both psychologically and demographically.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.609
But the secondary effects were almost as bad.
For one thing the deaths of Aztec and Incan

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.999
rulers touched off wars which made it easier
to spread disease, because you know, the number

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:33.779
one way to catch smallpox is via hand-to-hand
combat. Plus leaders kept dying. Huayna Capac,

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:38.230
the leader of the Incan empire, succumbed
to smallpox before Pizarro even arrived. His

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.599
death led to a violent succession struggle
between his sons which was won by Atahualpa,

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.639
who in turn was captured and killed by Pizarro.
And without that war, the Inca would have

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.499
had a much better chance against the Spaniards,
whose numbers were comparatively tiny. A similar

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.340
thing happened to the Aztecs. The Moctezuma
who eventually lost to Cortés was the nephew

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.010
of a much more powerful king who died of smallpox.
And the death of that great king encouraged

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.480
some of the smaller states in the Aztec empire to rebel,
and some of them even fought for the Spaniards.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.280
And another effect of disease was starvation,
because there simply weren't enough people

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.169
left to grow crops to feed the living. And
the malnutrition made survivors that much

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.359
more susceptible to disease. In short, it
sucked.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.680
The transmission of disease largely went one
way, from the Old World to the New, but the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.849
Americans did have one gift for Europe: venereal
syphilis. It showed up in Europe around 1493,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.519
and even though Europeans are very fond of
ascribing syphilis to each other: Italians

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.419
called it the French disease; the French called
it the disease of Naples; Poles called it

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.549
the German disease; Russians called it the
Polish disease. The truth is, venereal syphilis

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.909
was spread by sailors who'd returned from
the Americas.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.620
In fact, in his book, The Columbian Exchange,
Crosby tells it like this: "Sailors, by the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.559
nature of their profession, are men without
women and therefore men of many women. We

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.620
can imagine no group more perfectly suited
for guaranteeing that venereal syphilis would

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.769
have worldwide distribution." Who says history
books are boring? Syphilis would go on to

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.959
infect a veritable who's who of Europe: from
Baudelaire to Gauguin to Nietzsche, not to

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.949
mention numerous family members of the famously
infertile Tudor and Valois families, meaning

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.459
that syphilis may be responsible for many
of those miserably boring dynastic power struggles

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.219
of post-Columbus Europe. Anyway, nothing against
syphilis, but it pales in comparison to the

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.579
devastation wrought by Old World diseases
arriving in the New World.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.359
But the New World did have one gift for the
Old World that was pretty destructive: tobacco.

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.379
Oh, it's time for the open letter and there's
been a costume change? That doesn't bode well.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.680
An Open Letter to Tobacco.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.990
But first let's see what's in the secret compartment
don't be cinnamon don't be cinnamon don't

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.259
be -- dang it!

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:44.199
I guess that I'm going to do the cinnamon
challenge. Oh, I am not happy about this Stan,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.039
for the record -- alright, I'm going to do
the cinnamon challenge: one tablespoon of

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.949
cinnamon in my mouth, no water.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.040
Huh, boy, that -- that sucked. I, I uh regret
r-regret doing that to be honest with you.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.479
Dear Tobacco,
I just did something really stupid but at

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.629
least it was cheap. I'm gonna tell you two
stories about smoking, the first come from

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.340
my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer
who also writes Crash Course. When I was a

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.659
senior in high school he walked up to me and
he said, "I want you to keep smoking. I want

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.710
you to smoke until the day after your 65th
birthday, and then I want you to die so that

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.080
I collect all of your social security." That inspired me,
Mr. Meyer, to quit smoking just eight short years later.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.120
Here is an amazing statistic: cigarettes were
handed out to American servicemen during World

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.689
War II and more soldiers who started smoking during
the war died from smoking than died from the war.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.740
So if the New World was looking to extract
some measure of revenge for smallpox, and

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.220
measles, and chicken pox: Mission accomplished.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.740
Best Wishes,
John Green

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.310
Now onto animals. American animals, like llamas
and guinea pigs, never really caught on in

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.590
Eurasia. But imports to the Americas, like
pigs, cows and horses were revolutionary.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.840
Let's go to the thought bubble:

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.420
First of all, these animals, especially pigs,
completely remade the food supply. Pigs breed

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.370
really quickly, they eat anything and they
turn into bacon, which made them heroes to

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.830
the new world just as today they are heroes
to the internet. Here's how quickly pigs breed:

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.759
When Hernando de Soto arrived in Florida in
1539, he brought 13 pigs. By the time of his

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:27.340
death, there were 700 - that was 3 years later.
The abundance of meat and plentiful land for

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.210
agriculture and grazing meant that Europeans
in the Americas very rarely experienced famine,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.840
and despite what you may have learned about
religious and political freedom, the main

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.650
reason Europeans came to America was to eat.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.319
Large European animals also changed the nature
of work in the Americas. Before Europeans,

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.840
the largest beast of burden was the llama,
and at best it could carry like, 100 lbs.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.569
This meant that for the long distance travel
that the Inca engaged in, the primary transportation

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:57.770
animal was Incas. Oxen, when combined with
their plows, made it possible to bring more

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.879
land under cultivation and also made transportation
easier and more efficient, and plus European

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.639
animals remade culture.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.060
The grossly stereotypical American Indian,
like from the movies, riding the Great Plains

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.099
with an eagle feather headdress and war paint,
well he didn't exist before the Columbian

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.990
Exchange because there were no horses for
him to ride. And the introduction of horses

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.539
allowed many Native Americans to abandon agriculture
in favor of a nomadic lifestyle because riding

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:26.960
around hunting buffalo made them far richer
than farming ever had. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.340
While animals and diseases completely reshaped
the New World, it was New World plants that

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.030
had the biggest effect on Eurasia.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.060
Sure, Europeans brought over some crops that
we now grow here in the Americas like wheat

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.259
and grapes, both of which are necessary for
Catholic mass, but New World plants radically

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:46.620
changed the lives of millions, maybe hundreds
of millions of Africans, Asians and Europeans,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.199
specifically by making pizza possible.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:55.289
[Heavenly singing, "It was the greatest gift
of all."]

00:07:55.289 --> 00:08:00.259
I mean until 500 years ago Italians lived
without tomatoes, without modern pizza or

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:06.949
marinara sauce or pizza or ketchup or pizza
or even pizza. Indians lived without curry,

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:10.889
which contains chilies, a New World food.
Persians lived without corn, which is a New

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:15.569
World food, as are beans and potatoes and
avocados and peanuts and blueberries - the

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:16.759
list goes on and on.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:20.310
And these New World crops led to probably
the greatest population increase in history.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.800
To quote Crosby, "It is crudely true that
if man's caloric intake is sufficient, he

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.610
will somehow stagger to maturity, and he will
reproduce."

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.320
And New World food was far more caloric than
Old World food, which is the central reason

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.690
that the world population doubled between
1650 and 1850. Plants like corn and potatoes

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.720
could grow in soils that were useless for
Old World crops. Potatoes were actually introduced

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.190
to Europe as an aphrodisiac, but it turns
out that you have to distill those potatoes

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.100
into vodka before they have the desired effect.
Anyway, if potatoes are an aphrodisiac, the

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.380
Irish quickly became the hottest people on
Earth.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.770
An acre and a half of potato cultivation could
feed an Irish family for a year, and the average

00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:02.560
Irish worker often ate 10 lbs. of potatoes
every day. Surviving primarily on potatoes,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.940
the Irish more than doubled their population
between 1754 and 1845, when the Potato Famine

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.440
showed up and ruined everything.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.230
And it wasn't just Europe. Manioc, or cassava
is a New World plant with roots that provide

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.140
more calories than any other plant on Earth,
provided they are properly processed (otherwise

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.810
they're poisonous). Manioc is so prevalent
in Africa that many Africans swear that the

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.580
plant is native to the continent, but it isn't.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.330
Nor are sweet potatoes, and while New World
grains never replaced rice in Southeast, or

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.780
East Asia, the sweet potato was so common
that it is known as the "poor person’s staple"

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.500
in China. Even in Japan, the tomb of the farmer
who is reputed to have first brought them

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.290
to the islands is known as the Temple of the
Sweet Potato. And it's also worth noting that

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.930
corn, while it may not feature prominently
in European diets, has been the central source

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.360
of food for animals in Europe for centuries.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:50.010
And in fact, that's still the case. In 2005,
58% of the corn grown in America went to animal

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.160
feed (is the kind of thing you learn when
you live in Indiana).

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.450
Alright, so last but not least, the Columbian
exchange involved the transfer of lots of

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.260
people. Again, in the early stages this movement
was mostly one way, with Europeans and Africans

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.420
- the Africans usually against their will
- making their way to the Americas.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.390
So the Columbian Exchange led to the re-population
of the New World following the disease devastation

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.530
of the initial encounter. And better nutrition
allowed the population of the Old World to

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.480
grow which in turn placed population pressure
on Eurasia which led to more people coming

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.060
to the Americas. In the process, the world's
human inhabitants became more genetically

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.710
and ethnically interconnected. But it also
led to the horrors of Atlantic slavery, which

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.870
we'll be discussing next week.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.580
What are we to make of the Columbian Exchange?
It devastated the population of the Americas,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.580
it led to the widespread slavery of Africans,
but it also allowed for a worldwide population

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.640
increase and the lives of some Natives including
Plains tribes like the Lakota became better

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.950
and more secure, at least for a while.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.140
Fewer people have starved since the Columbian
Exchange began, but the diversity of life on

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.640
Earth has diminished dramatically and planting crops
where they don't belong has hurt the environment.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.970
So on the whole, should we be grateful for
the Columbian Exchange? And should we work

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.440
to continue and deepen its legacy of globalism
and monoculture?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.410
Crosby didn't think we were better off. "The
Columbian Exchange has included man, and he

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.970
has changed the Old and New Worlds sometimes
inadvertently, sometimes intentionally, often

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.920
brutally. It is possible that he and the plants
and animals he brings with him have caused

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.620
the extinction of more species of life forms
in the last four hundred years than the usual

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.940
processes of evolution might kill off in a
million... The Columbian Exchange has left

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.230
us with not a richer but a more impoverished
genetic pool. We, all of the life on the planet,

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.740
are the less for Columbus, and the impoverishment
will increase."

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.600
But let's give you the last word today: Do
you agree with Crosby? Are longer, healthier

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.330
lives for more humans worth the sacrifice
of an impoverished biosphere? And most importantly,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.420
how will your conclusions about those questions
shape the way that you live your life?

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.000
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.600
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.940
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself, and our

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.500
graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.630
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Mario
and Luigi,” thanks for that suggestion.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.750
If you want to suggest future phrases of the
week you can do so in comments or you can

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.940
also guess at this week’s phrase of the
week, and ask questions about today's video

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.330
that will be answered by our team of historians.
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.810
say in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
