00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:02.207
Right now, somewhere out there,

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.269
an educator is delivering
a mind-altering lesson to their class.

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:08.270
I want to engage your brains in this.

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.574
Chris Anderson: I tried to get
my head around how vast our Earth is.

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:14.753
Logan Smalley: That lesson only reaches
the students in that room.

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:16.578
What would happen if we captured it?

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.740
It's a toothed wheel.

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:20.251
LS: What if pro animators
and visualization artists

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:21.859
could bring that lesson to life?

00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:24.908
CA: It's a common object
that literally fits one million Earths.

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:27.311
It's got a bunch of notches
and a bunch of teeth.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:28.742
This was Fizeau's solution --

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.092
LS: When that lesson lands,
curiosity is ignited.

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:32.482
CA: It seems impossibly big.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:34.136
AS: Something interesting happens.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.591
CA: In the great scheme
of things, it's a pinprick.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.626
AS: A door closes on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.209
LS: Then that group of students
is one thought closer

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.544
to being what every teacher
hopes their students will become:

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:47.569
a lifelong learner.

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.273
AS: Based on the distance
between the two stations --

00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:53.217
CA: The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.226
AS: He calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.645
CA: The more you know,
the more amazing the world seems.

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:02.679
That's the central mission of TED-Ed:

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.798
to capture and to amplify

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.840
the voice of the world's
greatest teachers.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.659
He does this in 1849.

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:12.721
CA: It's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.146
that pull us forward.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.781
So stay curious.

00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.804
TED-Ed is really an invitation
to teachers all around the world

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:25.336
to submit their best lessons.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.594
Jordan Reeves: We review each submission
and work with the educators

00:01:28.618 --> 00:01:32.260
to refine the lesson and make sure
that they're less than ten minutes long.

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:34.918
From there, we mail out
these portable recording booths.

00:01:34.942 --> 00:01:36.808
A teacher pulls up their final lesson,

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:40.371
presses record and can instantly share it
with our animation team.

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:42.820
It's also an invitation to animators.

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:45.311
We are looking for talented animators

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:47.269
to get involved, submit their reels

00:01:47.293 --> 00:01:49.939
and help us animate
these incredible lessons.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.662
LS: Right now, there's a gifted educator
somewhere out there

00:01:53.686 --> 00:01:55.380
delivering a life-changing lesson.

00:01:55.404 --> 00:01:58.575
The TED-Ed team hopes that anyone
who is passionate about education

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.312
will help us find that teacher,

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.659
capture that moment and amplify it

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:05.013
the way that it deserves to be amplified.
