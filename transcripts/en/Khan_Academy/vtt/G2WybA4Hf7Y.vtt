00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:02.340
- [Voiceover] So let's
think about a function.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.117
I'll just give an example.

00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:04.530
Let's say, h of n

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.643
is equal to

00:00:06.643 --> 00:00:08.161
one-fourth

00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:09.740
times

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.555
two

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:12.060
to the n.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.015
So, first of all,

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.059
you might notice something
interesting here.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.704
We have the variable, the
input into our function.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.402
It's in the exponent.

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:24.474
And a function like this is
called an exponential function.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:27.221
So this is an exponential.

00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:30.641
Ex-po-nen-tial.

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.751
Exponential function, and that's because

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.376
the variable, the input into our function,

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:38.447
is sitting in its definition of

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.396
what is the output of
that function going to be.

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:41.942
The input is in the exponent.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:44.682
I could write another
exponential function.

00:00:44.682 --> 00:00:45.428
I could write,

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:46.154
f of,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.581
let's say the input is a variable, t,

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.659
is equal to

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.213
is equal to five

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:54.943
times

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:56.521
times three

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.792
to the t.

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:58.755
Once again,

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.110
this is an exponential function.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.293
Now there's a couple of
interesting things to think about

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:05.168
in exponential function.

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:07.710
In fact, we'll explore many of them,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.271
but I'll get a little
used to the terminology,

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.604
so one thing that you might see

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.687
is a notion of

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:14.040
an initial value.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.373
In-i-tial

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:18.196
Intitial value.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:20.344
And this is essentially
the value of the function

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:22.758
when the input is zero.

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:24.348
So, for in these cases,

00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:26.647
the initial value for the function, h,

00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:29.026
is going to be, h of zero.

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:30.245
And when we evaluate that,

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:31.846
that's going to be one-fourth

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.245
times two to the zero.

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:36.288
Well, two to the zero power, is just one.

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:37.437
So it's equal to

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:38.505
one-fourth.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:40.305
So the initial value,
at least in this case,

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:41.883
it seems to just be that number

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:42.987
that sits out here.

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:44.867
We have the initial value times

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:46.724
some number

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:48.164
to this exponent.

00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:49.988
And we'll come up with
the name for this number.

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:52.900
Well let's see if this was
true over here for, f of t.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.083
So, if we look at its intial value,

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:56.280
f of zero

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.070
is going to be

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.673
five times

00:01:58.673 --> 00:02:00.703
three to the zero power

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.074
and, the same thing again.

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:03.376
Three to the zero is just one.

00:02:03.376 --> 00:02:05.419
Five times one is just five.

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.799
So the initial value is once again, that.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.375
So if you have

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.555
exponential functions of
this form, it makes sense.

00:02:10.555 --> 00:02:11.996
Your initial value,

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:14.712
well if you put a zero
in for the exponent,

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:16.405
then the number raised

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.029
to the exponent is just going to be one,

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.277
and you're just going to be left with

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:20.777
that thing that you're
multiplying by that.

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:21.857
Hopefully that makes sense,

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:22.937
but since you're looking at it,

00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.061
hopefully it does make a little bit.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.118
Now, you might be saying,

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.033
well what do we call this number?

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:29.832
What do we call that number there?

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:31.261
Or that number there?

00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.868
And that's called the common ratio.

00:02:33.868 --> 00:02:35.029
The

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.909
common

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.718
common ratio.

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:39.703
And in my brain,

00:02:39.703 --> 00:02:42.257
we say well why is it
called a common ratio?

00:02:42.257 --> 00:02:45.044
Well, if you thought about
integer inputs into this,

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:48.282
especially sequential
integer inputs into it,

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.001
you would see a pattern.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.401
For example,

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.433
h of,

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.169
let me do this in that green color,

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.305
h of zero

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.155
is equal to, we already
established one-fourth.

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:00.081
Now, what is h of one

00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:01.682
going to be equal to?

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:03.408
It's going to be one-fourth times

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:04.707
two to the first power.

00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.564
So it's going to be one-fourth

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:06.894
times

00:03:06.894 --> 00:03:07.826
two.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:09.420
What is h of two

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.220
going to be equal to?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.461
Well, it's going to be

00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.331
one-fourth

00:03:14.331 --> 00:03:15.294
times

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.018
two squared,

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:18.924
so it's going to be times two times two.

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:21.745
Or, we could just view this as

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:23.988
this is going to be two times

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:25.430
h of one.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.634
And actually I should have done this

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:27.640
when I wrote this one out,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.801
but this we can write as

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:29.835
two times

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.899
h of zero.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.665
So notice, if we were to
take the ratio between

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:35.698
h of two

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:36.549
and h of one,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.690
it would be two.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.645
If we were to take the ratio between

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:39.312
h of one

00:03:39.312 --> 00:03:39.887
and h of zero,

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:41.023
it would be two.

00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:42.544
That is the common ratio between

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:46.185
successive whole number
inputs into our function.

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.563
So, h of

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:49.037
I could say

00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:49.731
h of n

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:50.792
plus one

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:51.952
over

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:53.442
h of n

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:55.682
is going to be equal to

00:03:55.682 --> 00:03:57.354
is going to be equal to

00:03:57.354 --> 00:03:58.782
actually I can work it out mathematically.

00:03:58.782 --> 00:03:59.528
One-fourth

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:00.689
times two

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.568
to the n plus one

00:04:02.568 --> 00:04:03.088
over

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:04.040
one-fourth

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.725
times

00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:06.129
two to the n.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.898
That cancels.

00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:08.566
Two to the n plus one,
divided by two to the n

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.609
is just going to be equal to two.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.988
That is your common ratio.

00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:14.997
So for the function h.

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:15.995
For the function f,

00:04:15.995 --> 00:04:17.438
our common ratio is

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:18.576
three.

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:20.178
If we were to go the other way around,

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:22.674
if someone said, hey, I have some function

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:24.252
whose initial value,

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:25.228
so let's say,

00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:27.046
I have some function, I'll
do this in a new color,

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:29.426
I have some function, g,

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:31.627
and we know that its initial

00:04:31.627 --> 00:04:32.927
initial

00:04:32.927 --> 00:04:34.529
value

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:35.388
is

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:36.851
five.

00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:37.826
And someone were to say

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.789
its common ratio

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.621
its common

00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:44.327
ratio

00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:45.627
is six,

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.566
what would this exponential
function look like?

00:04:47.566 --> 00:04:50.201
And they're telling you this
is an exponential function.

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:51.850
Well, g of

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.824
let's say x is the input,

00:04:53.824 --> 00:04:55.205
is going to be equal to our

00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:57.909
initial value, which is five.

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.126
That's not a negative sign there,

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:01.591
Our initial value is five.

00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.557
I'll write equals to make that clear.

00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:04.623
And then times

00:05:04.623 --> 00:05:06.177
our common ratio

00:05:06.177 --> 00:05:08.441
to the x power.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.335
So once again,

00:05:09.335 --> 00:05:12.484
initial value, right over
there, that's the five.

00:05:12.484 --> 00:05:14.514
And then our common ratio

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.385
is

00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:16.474
the six,

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:17.773
right over there.

00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:19.382
So hopefully that gets
you a little bit familiar

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:20.984
with some of the parts

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:22.099
of an exponential function,

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.492
why they are called what they are called.
