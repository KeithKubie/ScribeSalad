that explains why the animation was this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
that explains why the animation was this
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.589
that explains why the animation was this
way and why all the stories don't really

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599
way and why all the stories don't really
 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.290
way and why all the stories don't really

be a pilot to a TV show this tried
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500
be a pilot to a TV show this tried
harder it fooled me into thinking it was

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510
harder it fooled me into thinking it was
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.820
harder it fooled me into thinking it was
going to be something that tried hard

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830
going to be something that tried hard
 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.530
going to be something that tried hard
rock the whole thing I guess it does

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540
rock the whole thing I guess it does
 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.470
rock the whole thing I guess it does
technically have an ending and yeah the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480
technically have an ending and yeah the
 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.000
technically have an ending and yeah the
endings not that bad it even kind of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
endings not that bad it even kind of
 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.890
endings not that bad it even kind of
reckons the ending of the first film but

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
reckons the ending of the first film but
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.930
reckons the ending of the first film but
it's weird when you see the choice she

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
it's weird when you see the choice she
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.759
it's weird when you see the choice she
makes you understand her reasoning but

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769
makes you understand her reasoning but
 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.190
makes you understand her reasoning but
there's also like a ton of dangers that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
there's also like a ton of dangers that
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.630
there's also like a ton of dangers that
happen throughout this film to go

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
happen throughout this film to go
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.000
happen throughout this film to go
against her reasoning to nothing what

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010
against her reasoning to nothing what
 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.530
against her reasoning to nothing what
happens is the wrong choice I'm saying

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540
happens is the wrong choice I'm saying
 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.449
happens is the wrong choice I'm saying
they never explained the actual dangers

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459

that could come along with it and that's

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959
that could come along with it and that's
 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.979
that could come along with it and that's
very important to address so yeah I

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989
very important to address so yeah I
 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.080
very important to address so yeah I
guess in terms of other technicals the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090
guess in terms of other technicals the
 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.360
guess in terms of other technicals the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370
voice actors are all replacements and
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.580
voice actors are all replacements and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.979
they do a good job the animation like I
said is a huge budget cut but for kind

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989
