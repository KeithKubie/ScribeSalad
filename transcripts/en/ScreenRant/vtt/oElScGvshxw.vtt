00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.790
With studios lining up to adapt every bankable
superhero or comic book icon to the big screen,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.059
you might think that fans would be happy with
what they have coming. But every comic fan

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.760
has their favorites, and sometimes, it's the
most unlikely superheroes that could end up

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.070
being the biggest box office surprises. Here
are Screen Rant's 10 Superhero Movies We Would

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.130
Love To See.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.279
X-Force
Anyone who's read an X-Force story knows why

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.930
the strike team is perfect for Fox's shared
universe. Pairing deadly heroes like Deadpool

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.320
with Psylocke and Archangel - both joining
the movie universe in X-Men Apocalypse - would

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.980
guarantee action, as the covert, unsanctioned
side of the X-Men seek out mutant threats,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.390
and end them before they make trouble. With
the team leader, Cable getting a role in the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.629
Deadpool sequel - and a spot for Wolverine,
should Hugh Jackman want to try an R-Rated

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.670
ensemble - Fox would be crazy not to make
this sooner than later.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.609
Secret Six
They may seem like another Suicide Squad,

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.910
but the Secret Six - a team of villains working
together on a massive score - are the ones

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.270
being chased, not the other way around. When
Deadshot, Catman, Bane, and more team up to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.580
transport a prisoner across the country, a
bounty is put on their heads, drawing every

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.830
gangster, goon and killer out after them.
If DC's Suicide Squad ends up a hit, then

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.190
a spinoff like Secret Six could give fans
an even stranger, more supernatural dose - on

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.330
a much smaller budget, and with characters
less tied to other franchises. That's assuming

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.800
the studio will have room alongside their
big screen Justice League.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.821
Ms. Marvel
Since kids everywhere are getting more and

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.660
more obsessed with Marvel's Avengers, it seems
crazy to NOT make a movie based on the new

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.610
Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan - a teenage girl who
gets incredible superpowers, and decides to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.310
follow in the footsteps of her favorite hero:
Captain Marvel. The comic was a critical hit,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.220
starring a Pakistani-American heroine, and
dealing with a coming-of-age tale while also

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.030
telling a superhero origin. Since Captain
Marvel is coming to the big screen, with the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.940
Inhumans like Kamala not far behind, focusing
a movie on her personal story could be a nice

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.110
counterpoint to the massive Avengers event
movies.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.390
The Metal Men
Doctor Will Magnus didn't know what he was

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.690
creating when he added microcomputers to liquid
metal, but what he ended up with was The Metal

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.319
Men: metallic robots with strengths and personalities
all based on the metal they're made of. Before

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.170
long, Gold, Platinum, Mercury, Iron, Tin and
Lead were using their shapeshifting powers

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.940
to take down enemies born right out of science
fiction. The humor of a movie based on the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.140
comic is hard to miss, but the action could
be just as good. Especially once they stop

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.850
shapeshifting in battle and combine to form
Alloy, a massive robot warrior with ALL of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.030
their powers. Just picture the toy sales!

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.170
Spawn
The demonic hero created by Todd McFarlane

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.990
got his big screen debut in 1997, before comic
book movies were mainstream hits, but still

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.910
managed to keep fans happy. The cartoon series
kept the love going, and the creator hasn't

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.860
given up on a sequel - or remake - just yet.
In recent years, McFarlane has claimed to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.720
have a script all but finished, with Oscar
winner Jamie Foxx on board to play the marine-turned-Hellspawn

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.440
terrorizing the criminals of his city. It's
still one of the darkest comic book movies

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.190
to ever get made, and got enough right to
earn a second look. So if studios are looking

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.230
for an R-Rated anti-hero, having a movie star
already on board is half the battle.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.330
Moon Knight
He might seem like a Batman rip-off, but Marvelâ€™s

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.040
Moon Knight is even weirder. When a former
Marine and mercenary winds up surrounded by

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
ancient Egyptian artifacts, dying at the feet
of a statue of Khonshu, the Egyptian Moon

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.530
God, Marc Spector agrees to be resurrected
as the god's new host. It's a gift and a curse,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.960
since the revival fractures Marc's mind, changing
his personality with the phases of the moon.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.750
The only thing scarier than a super-strong,
gadget-wielding mystical vigilante? One who

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.780
doesn't try to avoid painful punches and kicks,
seeing them as punishment for the life he

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.040
used to live. Talk about issues.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.860
Lobo
DC may not have a match for Deadpool, but

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.500
Lobo comes pretty close. The immortal, self-healing,
murder-loving intergalactic bounty hunter

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.300
was created as a parody of the ultra-violent
Marvel heroes Wolverine and Punisher, but

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.960
ended up becoming a fan-favorite anyway. In
the year since he was introduced, Lobo has

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.330
weaved his way through every cosmic DC story,
meaning a Lobo movie could take place virtually&nbsp;anywhere.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.430
Still need another reason? His immortality
isn't just genetics: when Lobo died and went

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.560
to Hell, they threw him out, up to Heaven.
The angels couldn't handle him either, permanently

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.150
banning him from the afterlife. Tell us that
isn't a comic book movie waiting to be told.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.000
Captain Comet
If there's one genre of film that's enjoying

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.449
as much of a boost as comic books, it's science
fiction - and the more attitude and personality,

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.380
the better. Casual fans might think that the
deep space side of DC's movie universe is

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.190
just for the Green Lanterns and New Gods,
but there are some seedier locations, too.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.540
Take Hardcore Station, the stomping grounds
of the galaxy's surliest citizens. The setting

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.490
was the real star of DC's "Mystery in Space"
mini-series, following the exploits of the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.960
telekinetic, telephathic, teleporting superhero
known as Captain Comet. A mutant even older

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.280
than Marvel's X-Men, and a mix of the heroes
of Guardians of the Galaxy, Firefly, and Star

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.220
Wars, he's the perfect hero to show DC's cosmic
world has a sense of humor, too.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.280
Beta Ray Bill
Just because a movie seems like a long shot,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.870
that doesn't mean we want it any less. The
version of Thor in the MCU truly has the strength

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.530
of a god, but the comic books had him meet
his match in an alien calling itself 'Beta

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.630
Ray Bill,' one of the last survivors of the
Korbinite race. The fact that he could actually

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.440
beat the thunder god and take his hammer shows
he has star potential, but is just as noble

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.500
as any Asgardian - the reason Odin had a hammer
made for him from the same dying star. The

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.210
horse-faced warrior was an instant favorite
of Marvel readers, and with the stakes being

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.810
raised higher than ever in Thor 3, having
a beloved replacement ready to take over for

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.790
Thor wouldn't hurt.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.430
The Runaways
It's one thing to find out you're the child

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.190
of a superhero, but what if you discovered
your parents were as super-villainous as they

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.300
come? That's what happened to Marvel's Runaways,
who reacted by doing what any hero would:

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.980
stealing their parents' gadgets and weapons,
and training to right their wrongs, becoming

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.031
the super-protectors of the city they tried
to destroy. It's a story no movie has come

00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:49.139
close to touching, which is why the teen team-up
was originally in the works at Marvel. But

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.500
it was shelved to make room for The Avengers'
shared universe. That doesn't mean the movie's

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.591
been canceled, but Marvel shouldn't miss out
on this idea which, in the right hands, could

00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:58.700
really be something special for the MCU.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.139
Those are just a handful of comic book heroes
and heroines we would love to see on the big

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.850
screen, but what are your own picks? Do you
think the big studios are missing out on some

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.150
of their best properties? Let us know what
you think in the comments, and remember to
