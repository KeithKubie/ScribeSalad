00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:15.345
In this dystopian world, your resistance
group is humanity's last hope.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.359
Unfortunately, you've all been captured
by the tyrannical rulers

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.527
and brought to the ancient colosseum
for their deadly entertainment.

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:25.382
Before you're thrown into the dungeon,

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:28.964
you see many numbered hallways
leading outside.

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:31.942
But each exit is blocked by 
an electric barrier

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:34.506
with a combination keypad.

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:39.541
You learn that one of you will be allowed
to try to escape by passing a challenge

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:44.852
while everyone else will be fed to
the mutant salamanders the next morning.

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:48.631
With her perfect logical reasoning,
Zara is the obvious choice.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:54.466
You hand her a concealed audio transmitter
so that the rest of you can listen along.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.058
As Zara is led away,

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:58.942
you hear her footsteps echo 
through one of the hallways,

00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.694
then stop.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.659
A voice announces 
that she must enter a code

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.166
consisting of three positive whole numbers
in ascending order,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.466
so the second number is greater than
or equal to the first,

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.254
and the third is greater than
or equal to the second.

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.432
She may ask for up to three clues,

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.026
but if she makes a wrong guess,

00:01:19.026 --> 00:01:20.966
or says anything else,

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.754
she'll be thrown back into the dungeon.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:30.848
For the first clue, the voice says
the product of the three numbers is 36.

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:33.092
When Zara asks for the second clue,

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.092
it tells her the sum of the numbers

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:39.876
is the same as the number 
of the hallway she entered.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:41.682
There's a long silence.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:44.317
You're sure Zara remembers 
the hallway number,

00:01:44.317 --> 00:01:46.809
but there's no way for you to know it,

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:50.002
and she can't say it outloud.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.422
If Zara could enter the passcode 
at this point, she would,

00:01:53.422 --> 00:01:57.215
but instead, she asks for the third clue,

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.811
and the voice announces that the largest
number appears only once

00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:04.117
in the combination.

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:08.931
Moments later, the buzz of the electric
barrier stops for a few seconds,

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.766
and you realize that Zara has escaped.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:15.002
Unfortunately, her transmitter 
is no longer in range,

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.507
so that's all the information you get.

00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:19.849
Can you find the solution?

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.280
Pause on the next screen
to work out the solution.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.451
3

00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.394
2

00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:30.401
1

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:33.829
You're worried about the fact that you
don't know Zara's hallway number,

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.140
but you decide to start 
from the beginning anyways.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.170
From the first clue, you work out all of
the eight possible combinations

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.911
that come out to a product of 36.

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.972
One of these must be right,
but which one?

00:02:45.972 --> 00:02:48.371
Now comes the hard part.

00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.313
Even though you don't know which number
you're looking for,

00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:55.782
you decide to work out the sum
of each combination's three numbers.

00:02:55.782 --> 00:02:57.564
That's when it hits you.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.562
All but two of the sums are unique,

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:03.532
and if the hallway number had matched
any of these,

00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:07.259
Zara would have known the correct
combination right then and there

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.687
without asking for the third clue.

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:11.501
Since she did ask for the clue,

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.356
the hallway number must have 
matched the only sum

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:17.104
that appears more than once in the list:

00:03:17.104 --> 00:03:18.478
thirteen.

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:22.391
But which of the two combinations
that add up to thirteen is correct:

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.539
1,6,6,

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.433
or 2,2,9?

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.594
That's where the third clue comes in.

00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:30.465
Since it tells us that the largest
number must be unique,

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:33.152
2,2,9 must be the code.

00:03:33.152 --> 00:03:37.449
When night falls, you and the others
escape through hallway thirteen

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.785
and rejoin Zara outside.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.293
You've freed yourselves through 
math and logic.

00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.700
Now it's time to free 
the rest of the world.
