00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Let's do a couple more angle
game problems, and hopefully

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.746
this will make you an
angle game expert.

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:11.710
So let's start, I have the star
drawn again, and let's say we

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.120
know the following angles.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.316
We know this angle right
here is 41 degrees.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.710
We know this angle
here is 113 degrees.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.920
We know this angle
here is 101 degrees.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.070
And what we have to figure out
-- this is the goal of this

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.360
angle game -- we want to figure
out what this angle is.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.300
And like always, I encourage
you to try it on your own.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
Pause the video and then just
try to work it through.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.520
If you get stuck, then play
the video again and hopefully

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.450
I'll have a solution for you.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.300
So pause right now, but
otherwise let me explain

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.300
how to do this.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.895
So let's see, we know this,
this and this, and we're going

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.740
to figure out this angle.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.060
So how can we figure
out this angle?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.490
What are the possible
strategies?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850
Well, if we knew this
angle here, we could say

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.140
they're supplementary.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.060
But that angle seems like a
hard angle to figure out

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.610
too, because it's not a
part of any triangles.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.260
But this angle is a
part of this triangle

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.550
right here, right?

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.940
So if we were able to figure
out this angle and this angle,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540
these green angles, if we're
able to figure out these green

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.840
angles, then we could figure
out this brown angle, which is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.290
the goal of this angle game.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.920
So, this could also be a good
time to pause because I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.390
just gave you a hint.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.930
This green angle, well it's
supplementary to this angle

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.300
right here, so that means it
adds up to 180 degrees, and

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.732
that's clear because it's
on kind of the same line.

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:52.180
So this is 101 degrees
and this is going to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.900
be 79 degrees, right?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.510
So it adds up to 180 degrees.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.890
That's 79.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.480
Now how can we figure
out this angle?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.730
Well, it's kind of left by
itself out in the corner of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.215
some place, so we could see if
it's part of any triangles.

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:13.030
But we already said it's
part of this triangle.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.370
But that doesn't help us
because we don't know

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.330
this angle and that's
actually our goal.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.560
What other triangles
is it a part of?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.540
Well, it's a part of this
triangle right here.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.120
That's why I like the star
problem because it has all

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.190
these triangles in it that
might not be obvious to you the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.880
first time you look at it.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.300
But the more you look at you
see all these triangles.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.760
So it's part of this
triangle, and it's also

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.890
part of this triangle.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.060
I'm going to draw this triangle
another color because I think

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.260
it'll be clear to you that this
is a useful triangle to see

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.020
that's it's a part of.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.180
So we have that triangle.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.790
So do we know two of the
angles of that triangle?

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.230
Well sure.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.790
We know this angle and
we know this angle.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.740
So we know that this angle plus
113 plus 41 is going to equal

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.050
180 degrees because of the
three angles of a triangle.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.870
So let me call this, I
don't know, g for green.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.850
Let's call this g for green.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.970
So we know g plus 113 degrees,
that's this one right here,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.800
plus 41 -- remember, we're
looking at this triangle;

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.810
that's the hardest part just
keeping track of which triangle

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.970
we're looking at -- is
going to equal 180 degrees.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.300
g plus, what is this, 154?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.580
Right?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.140
40, 50, 154 equals 180 degrees.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.170
That's always where I
mess up on the addition.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.200
And so g is equal to, what is
this, 26 degrees, right,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.510
because I just subtract
154 from both sides.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.890
So we're almost there.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.940
So we figured out g, we
know this green angle.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430
We just have to figure out
this, and they're all part

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.490
of this triangle, this
small one right here.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.570
This small triangle.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.460
So our goal, which is
let's call this x.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.910
x plus g, which is 26 degrees
-- we just figured that out.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.820
26 plus this angle, 79 -- and
we figured that out because it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.010
was supplementary to this
angle -- is going to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.320
equal 180 degrees.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.536
So x plus, what is this,
105 equal to 180.

00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:43.000
So x is equal to 75 degrees,
if I did my addition and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.530
subtraction correctly.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.660
So x is equal to 75 degrees.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.520
And then we are done.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.940
Let's do another one
of these problems.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.300
These problems are all
generated on the [? Card ?]

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.220
Academy website dynamically
by the computer.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.400
Whoever wrote this software
must be a genius.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.530
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.550
Let me draw some more.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.790
So this is going to be a pretty
straightforward drawing.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.270
It's pretty much just two
triangles next to each other.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.860
Like that and then let me draw
another line that goes like

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.160
that, and then we draw a line
that goes like that, and I

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.940
think I have done my drawing.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.060
There you go.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.590
I'm have done my drawing.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.000
So let's see.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.610
What do we know about this
triangle and what do

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.960
we need to figure out?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960
I'm going to tell you that this
angle here, this big angle

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.495
here, is 86 degrees.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.355
We also know that this
angle here is 28 degrees.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.590
And we also know that this
angle here is 122 degrees.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.810
And our goal, our mission
in this round is to figure

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.390
out what this angle is.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.670
And maybe we can do it, we
can do it in a good color.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.560
Maybe we can do it in a
couple of different ways.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.720
So one thing we could do is we
could figure out what this

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.470
angle is, so we could just
subtract this green angle from

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.270
86 and we would get our answer.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.940
Well, this angle's easy, right,
because we know two angles

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.390
of this triangle, so we
could figure that out.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.730
Let's just call this, I don't
know, let's call this y.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:41.900
So y plus 122 plus 28 degrees
is going to equal 180.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:48.420
So y plus 150 is equal to 180.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.170
So y is equal to 30
degrees, right?

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.780
So this is equal to 30 degrees.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.980
So this is 30 degrees, and
this big angle here is 86.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.130
So our goal, let's call that x,
so x is going to just be equal

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.230
to the big angle, 86 minus this
angle we just figured

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.200
out, minus 30.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.430
So x is going to be
equal to 50 degrees.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.830
Done.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.860
That was a pretty
straightforward problem.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.260
Let's see if we could figure
that out any other way.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.963
Well, we could say instead
of doing it that way --

00:07:25.963 --> 00:07:28.490
let's forget we just
solved it that way.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.660
We could say this angle here
is supplementary to this

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.230
122 degree angle, right, so
it has to add up to 180.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.180
So this plus 122 is 180, so
what does that make this?

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.390
It makes this 58
degrees, right?

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.830
This plus this is
going to be 180.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.040
So we figured out this.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.740
If we could figure out
this, then we could

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.190
use this triangle.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.800
How do we figure
out this angle?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:02.340
Well, we could look at this big
triangle here, and we know

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.540
this side, right, and we
could figure out this.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.410
Let's call this z.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:14.130
So we know that z plus this
angle, plus 28, plus this big

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.620
angle, plus 86 is equal to 180.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:26.070
So z plus, what is this,
106, 114 is equal to 180.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.450
So z is equal to, what
is this, 66 degrees.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.250
I don't know if I'm doing
any of my math correctly,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.770
but let's just hope.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.580
z equals 66.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.000
So z is 66, this angle is 58,
and now we can use this

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.960
triangle here to figure out
what this angle is, our x.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:09:00.842
So x plus 66 plus 58
is equal to 180.

00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:03.440
I already think I might
have made a mistake some

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.150
place in the addition.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.080
So this time around I get x
is equal to -- let's see,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.600
66 plus 58 is 110 plus 14.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.110
So 180 minus 124.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.600
So now I got it, x is
equal to 56 degrees.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.350
Oh great, I actually
got the right answer.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.500
I was looking at this, I
thought it was 50, but this

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.790
was 56, right -- 86 minus 30.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.150
So x is equal to
56 degrees again.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.420
So we did it two
different ways.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.110
That's what I wanted
to show you.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.790
There's actually not a right
answer, as long as you kind

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.970
of get there eventually.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.900
We solved it two different ways
and I did all my addition and

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.940
subtraction correctly, and you
get the exact same answer.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.730
So hopefully you find the angle
game fun and you'll be playing

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.000
this with your friends.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.640
I'll see you later.
