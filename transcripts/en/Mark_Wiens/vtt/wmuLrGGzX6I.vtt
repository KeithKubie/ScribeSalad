00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.810
- Hi everyone, I hope you're
having an amazing day,

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.643
it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:04.370
We just arrived in Kandy, Sri Lanka

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.890
which is in central
Sri Lanka on a plateau,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.590
it's a lush beautiful city.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.630
And today's for lunch,

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.828
Ruzaina has invited us to--

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:14.064
Her aunt owns a lodge

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.138
and so we're staying at the lodge.

00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:18.684
But her grandma has come from her home

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.562
to cook for us a very special

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:24.540
home-cooked all beef meal.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.130
The dishes that we're
gonna have are unique,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.739
they're not typically
available at restaurants.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.120
We're hopefully gonna see a little bit

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.953
of the cooking.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:31.280
We're gonna eat some
incredibly delicious food

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.299
and just have a chance
to hang out with granny

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.830
and I'm gonna share all the food

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.705
with you in this video.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.288
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:46.638
- The tongue.
- [Mark] The tongue?

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:47.471
- Yeah.
- That will remain.

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:49.930
- This is cooking the intestines.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.720
We are heavy meat eaters.
- Awesome.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.568
Heavy meat eaters.
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:55.088
- [Mark] I like the sound
of that, millet roti.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.546
- Millet roti, yes.
- Millet roti.

00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:00.790
- [Grandma] Yeah, of course. (laughs)

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.530
- We made it to Kandy,
we are in the kitchen now

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.935
with grandma and some
of Ruzaina's relatives.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:09.620
And they are preparing
very special meal for us

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.970
that's gonna be all parts of the cow.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.610
There's tongue, there's hoof,
there's intestines, there's--

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.443
- Beef!
- Beef, the meet.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.939
- Yeah, meat.
- Beef meat.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.811
All made into a variety
of different curries.

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.929
The entire tongue is curled
up in a single clay pot curry

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.420
which looks incredible.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.960
Right now she's making some millet roti,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.165
which is there's flour, there's
coconut, shredded coconut

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.200
in the recipe there's--

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.240
- [Grandma] roti Olive oil.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.410
There's olive oil and then
what's unique about that roti

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.390
is that she rolls it out
and then folds it over

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.600
like four times so that it has layers

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.010
and then that goes on the hot plate

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.673
to really slow cook.

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:51.678
Break a piece.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.680
- [Ruzaina] Look Mark, just break a piece

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.513
see how soft it is.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.900
- [Mark] Oh yeah, it's
so soft, like crispy.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.615
Fresh off the grill and
I can't wait to try it.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:01.532
(Mark Wiens music)

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.617
Yeah, that's delicious.

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:07.290
It's a flat bread and yet at the same time

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.622
it's kind of fluffy, delicious.

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:10.738
(happy music)

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:12.568
- [Grandma] I need cardamon too.

00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:14.568
I can't finish all that.

00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:16.731
- [Mark] Okay.

00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.147
(happy music)

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:22.100
The pot roast tongue was already
prepared when we arrived,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.050
but she's getting ready
to make another tongue.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.590
I saw the tongue that
was sitting in the sink.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.280
There's another tongue uncooked,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.563
she's getting ready to
prepare that right now.

00:02:31.812 --> 00:02:33.940
(tap water dripping)

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.406
She is washing the tongue now
with some powdered tumeric

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:41.300
to really clean it off, really prepare it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.610
before it's gonna get
cooked, the entire tongue.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.474
That's like a foot long.

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:46.638
(tap water dripping)

00:02:46.638 --> 00:02:49.822
(happy music)

00:02:49.822 --> 00:02:52.405
- [Grandma] Cardamon, cinnamon,

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:56.349
and then curry leaves

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.349
and put some ginger, crushed ginger,

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:05.727
garlic.
(oil simmering)

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:09.980
- She added in the ingredients
to some simmering coconut oil

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.630
and immediately you could smell the aroma

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.442
coming out of the cloves,
the onions, the garlic.

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:18.369
Oh, it smells delicious immediately.

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.160
(grandma laughs lightly)

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
Okay.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.457
(happy music)

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.254
(oil simmering)

00:03:27.254 --> 00:03:29.550
- This is very special.
- *** yes, you know.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.967
- This is very special.
- Not yet until you add water.

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:41.352
Water and then chili powder.
- And then chili powder.

00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:45.177
- And some pepper.

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.512
(happy music)

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:52.255
Until now we have to add salt.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.160
- [Mark] Okay, that will cook for a while.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.775
- Yes, for about--
- Then we can--

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.192
(chattering)

00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:07.031
- Would that be coconut vinegar.

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.099
To the tongue dish, she just added a spoon

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.080
of coconut vinegar and you can immediately

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.507
smell the fumes coming out of that,

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.773
the steam, those sour vinegary fumes.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.659
They're gonna be also making a rice dish.

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.483
So that's rice with some shredded coconut

00:04:29.483 --> 00:04:31.650
and then some salt and some flour

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.901
and then it's gonna--
- Will I add more?

00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:36.071
- The rice is already cooked?
- Yeah, rice is cooked.

00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:37.707
- You're gonna form it into little--

00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:39.390
- And we're gonna steam it.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.372
- Steam it in a--
- In concoction lid.

00:04:41.372 --> 00:04:45.844
- Concoction, that what it's
called, a concoction, yes.

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:47.481
(Mark and Ruzaina laughing)

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:48.462
I don't know what to call it.

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:49.670
Concoction is good.
- Yeah.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.593
- Contraption.
- Contraption is better.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.440
- You really like mash it up, blend it,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.247
mesh it with your fingers to get the rice

00:04:57.247 --> 00:04:59.520
completely blended with the coconut.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.530
A little bit of flour to hold it together

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.530
and then make it into funnel
cylinder cakes of rice.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.500
In their community, this
community this is a common dish.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.874
This is a common meal spread
with the different beef curries

00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:16.455
with this type of rice.

00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:18.955
(happy music)

00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:23.630
Oh, okay, awesome.
- Yeah, certainly, yeah.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.740
- Added in some flour
and still just kind of

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.730
working it into little pallets almost.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.793
It really is gonna be like a rice bread.

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:34.171
Obviously, you just like drop it in there?

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:35.061
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.561
(happy music)

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.080
- Then how long will
that need to steam for?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.140
- Five to 10 minutes.
- Okay.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.210
- So when the steam comes
on you have to close it.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.250
- Oh, then you put the lid on, aha!

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.723
- And then it'll steam some more.

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:52.530
- And let it steam for about five minutes

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.530
and then you'll have a
reinvention of a rice cake bread.

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:03.934
(happy music)

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:20.900
(chattering)

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.756
- So the dishes are almost all ready.

00:06:23.756 --> 00:06:27.547
The rice cakes are ready.
- 15 minutes.

00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.467
- Yes, soon, 15 minutes.

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:32.528
Granny says 15 minutes, time for lunch.

00:06:32.528 --> 00:06:36.195
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:49.332
(Happy music)

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.140
Setting all the food on the
table, the dishes are ready.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.560
There's like four or five
different all beef meat dishes.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.255
There's an onion sambal.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.586
We're going meat heavy for this meal.

00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:08.086
(happy music)

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.536
Thank you, it's a
beautiful spread of food.

00:07:12.536 --> 00:07:15.355
Everything hand prepared.
- Yeah, hand prepared.

00:07:15.355 --> 00:07:16.188
- No recipes.
- No!

00:07:16.188 --> 00:07:18.909
- Just she knows it all.
- All natural ingredients.

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:21.347
- Experience!
- Very natural ingredients.

00:07:21.347 --> 00:07:23.756
- Thank you.
- No artificial flavor.

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:25.472
- No artificial flavor.
- Nothing.

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:26.305
- No artificial anything.
- Yeah.

00:07:26.305 --> 00:07:27.514
- Everything natural from here.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.369
- Everything, natural
ingredients on the whole bunch.

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:30.990
- It's a privilege to be here.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.352
Thank you so much for this meal.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.396
- Thank you for being here,

00:07:34.396 --> 00:07:36.062
we're happy to have you here.
- Thank you.

00:07:36.062 --> 00:07:36.940
and I can't wait to taste the food now.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.540
- [Ruzaina] So this is
our version of the piptu.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.480
Okay, I'm gonna serve the hoof now.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.180
- Hoof?
- Yeah.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.286
Look at all that fat and jelly

00:07:46.286 --> 00:07:48.500
and oh my God.
- Oh, that's so good.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.350
- I'm salivating.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.871
(happy music)

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.886
This is intestines dried and fat.

00:07:58.886 --> 00:08:00.510
(Mark laughing excitedly)

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.964
Full on fat.
- You see it jiggling.

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:06.964
- Yeah, look, this.
- Who wants that?

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.083
Okay, nice!

00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:11.083
- Full on meat feast.
- Full on meat,

00:08:12.308 --> 00:08:13.141
love it.

00:08:13.985 --> 00:08:16.485
(happy music)

00:08:17.526 --> 00:08:18.490
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.720
- Ruzaina just dished me an entire plate

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.590
filled with all the meat.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.410
Actually there's not even
tongue on the plate yet

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.020
and my plate is full.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.090
Juices,

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.580
the sauces.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.060
Some of them are actually more juicy,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.271
others are more like a dry curry sauce.

00:08:33.271 --> 00:08:35.180
We've got the version of pitu

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.452
with the rice and the
flour and then the roti,

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:41.985
and then the sambal,
the trotters, the feet,

00:08:41.985 --> 00:08:43.550
the intestines are just...

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.426
Although you can see the little shoots.

00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:48.430
You can see the meat,
it smells incredible.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.623
You can smell the cardamon, the clove,

00:08:49.623 --> 00:08:51.070
the cinnamon in there.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.436
First what you do is you sprinkle,

00:08:53.436 --> 00:08:57.460
you douce the pitu in fresh coconut cream.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.090
Oh, yes!

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.210
Oh yes!

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.384
As much as you need.

00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:04.270
And then you can reach in,
you can kinda squish in,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.881
you can mingle it with the meat.

00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:07.960
I'm gonna try some of that.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.350
That's just the straight meat cubes.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.490
That beef right there, I
believe it's cooked down with,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.390
you can see the dried chilis in there.

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:18.117
Mm!

00:09:18.117 --> 00:09:18.950
- Mm-hmm!

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.913
- Oh wow!

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.780
Oh, it's so good.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.540
It's so tender, it's so soft.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.921
You taste the dried chilis,
you taste the cardamon

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:29.510
like clove flavor of it.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.197
As you keep on chewing
you taste a little bit

00:09:31.197 --> 00:09:33.030
of the sourness in that beef,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.385
which also comes from tamarind.

00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:36.586
- Lime and lime juice.
- Mm-hmm!

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:37.419
- Aha!
- Yes!

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:38.650
- One of the meat is
cooked with lime juice.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.993
- Yeah, lime and lime juice.
- Ah!

00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:42.810
Oh, and the lime leaves?
- Yes!

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.383
- Right, as you showed that one is cooked

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:45.270
with the lime leaves.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.670
Okay, I'll try that one next.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.620
Oh, yeah there's three,
there's three meats.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.453
Right?
- Yes.

00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:50.286
- Okay, I'll try this meat next.

00:09:50.286 --> 00:09:52.844
This one I think is the
one with the lime leaf.

00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:53.677
- [Grandma] The lime leaf.

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:54.510
- You can almost feel how tender it is

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.337
just in your finger tips.

00:09:56.337 --> 00:09:59.327
(happy music)

00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:00.160
Oh yeah!

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.135
Mm-hmm!
- Mm-hmm!

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:03.978
(laughing excitedly)

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:04.960
- That one you do taste the lime.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.793
- Yeah.

00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:08.630
- Oh, it's like super
balanced of like richness

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.463
and citrusiness.

00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:11.563
These are some of the food
like you grew up eating?

00:10:11.563 --> 00:10:14.070
- Yeah, this is our childhood food.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.762
- Special occasions.
- Special occasions.

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:18.990
- Family get togethers.
- Family get togethers.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.180
We have this for everything, for anything.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.570
Like anything, for
birthdays, whatever we want.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.243
Like this is--
- It's always this mix.

00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:28.555
- When we're together.
- Yeah.

00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:31.470
- You know.
- Yeah.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.821
- We eat a lot of meat.
- And meat.

00:10:33.821 --> 00:10:34.794
- Awesome!
- And also, it's a respect

00:10:34.794 --> 00:10:38.290
for the whole cow because
it's an entire animal

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.826
being sacrificed.
- Exactly.

00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:40.659
- Right?
- Exactly.

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:42.156
- So we have to eat everything.

00:10:42.156 --> 00:10:43.510
- Every part.
- Not just one part

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.220
and throw it out.
- Mm-hmm.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.855
- For us, it's a form of respect

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.440
for this animal being
sacrificed, you know.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.110
So we eat all, everything.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.020
- [Mark] Okay, this one is the intestines.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.788
- [Grandma] Try the fat piece.

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:56.621
- Oh, try the fat, okay.

00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:57.481
Granny says to try--
- Before it gets cold.

00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:58.890
- The chunk of that,
oh, before it gets cold.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.480
Okay, this is the respect right here

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.089
just the straight lump of fat.

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:03.392
(happy music)

00:11:03.392 --> 00:11:04.225
Oh!

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:06.422
Oh yeah!

00:11:06.422 --> 00:11:08.777
That is just like ultra-tender.

00:11:08.777 --> 00:11:10.164
- It's nice, yeah?
- It is.

00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:13.003
Ultra-tender, just like
jiggly on your tongue.

00:11:13.003 --> 00:11:15.560
I'm gonna mix in with some of the sambal

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.564
going with intestine, a little shoot.

00:11:18.564 --> 00:11:21.064
(happy music)

00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:26.464
That's stunning!

00:11:26.464 --> 00:11:30.953
And yeah, it's like a totally
different style of rice.

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:32.760
It's very crumbly.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.378
It really worked well to
soak up some of that sauce.

00:11:36.378 --> 00:11:37.923
- [Grandma] When you're tired of rice

00:11:37.923 --> 00:11:40.011
but you exchange it for a taste.

00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:40.844
- Make something like this.
- Yes.

00:11:40.844 --> 00:11:42.290
- Okay, I'm moving in for the troder

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.060
and I think I'll try that.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.479
Oh yeah!
- That's the hoof.

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:46.312
- The hoof.
- Yeah.

00:11:46.312 --> 00:11:50.014
- I'll hop a chunk while
the collagen is just oozing.

00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:52.514
(happy music)

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.720
Be careful of the little toe bones.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.720
It's not fat but it's jiggly,
it's creamy, it's collageny,

00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:08.850
it's so rich and succulent.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.990
I'll have some more once I'm gonna grab

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.490
one of those pieces of troder.

00:12:15.808 --> 00:12:16.641
Oh!

00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:19.590
And that roti is also awesome.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.147
There's coconut stuffed into it.

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:25.320
It's like fluffy, yet hard
and dense at the same time,

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.260
all at the same time, and just
wrapped up with that sauce.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.314
What really stands out
is the Sri Lankan version

00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:31.502
of all these dishes.

00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:35.300
It has like a tropical taste to it,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.733
like the rich and heavy with the meat.

00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:39.739
But at the same you taste the lightness

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:41.710
of the lime leaves, the lemongrass.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.910
It's like a combination
of meaty tropicalness.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.670
I'm gonna re-coconut

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.100
and kinda work in a bite.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.693
Grab a piece of meat, grab some sambal.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.153
Mm!

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.248
Oh!

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:04.501
And then when you a add
a little bit of sambal

00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:07.286
it just like compliments everything.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.151
- Because it's like meat, meat, meat, meat

00:13:09.151 --> 00:13:11.080
and then little bit of tang.
- Like real fresh.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.346
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:13:12.346 --> 00:13:13.617
(Ruzaina laughs lightly)

00:13:13.617 --> 00:13:16.417
- But you still haven't started
the tongue yet. (laughs)

00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:17.449
- [Grandma] Oh yeah.

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:19.213
- You forget.
- We gotta try the tongue.

00:13:19.213 --> 00:13:20.711
Almost!
- Now the tongue has arrived,

00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:22.590
it's waiting now.
- The tongue has arrived.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.207
Okay.
- The tongue is waiting.

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:26.831
- Should we take a time out and tongue it?

00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:28.592
(Ruzaina laughing)

00:13:28.592 --> 00:13:31.110
About to get up to taste the tongue,

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.942
but granny said I gotta finish
all the fat on my plate.

00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:35.420
The fat lumps, 'cause it will get cold.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.143
She's like, "Quick, eat all the fats."

00:13:37.143 --> 00:13:41.323
I have like six lumps of
fat in my mouth right now.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.978
Okay, granny it's amazing.

00:13:44.978 --> 00:13:47.120
Now, let's try the tongue.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.533
- [Ruzaina] It's like a pot roast.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:49.870
- [Mark] It's like a pot roast but

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.610
with extra seasoning and sauce.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.727
- Now, cut it.
- And Ruzaina game me the--

00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:57.986
- Pot roast version.
- Oh, it's so tender.

00:13:57.986 --> 00:13:59.796
- [Ruzaina] Yeah, this one is more tender

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:01.400
because it cooked longer.
- Look at that.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.093
Oh wow, that is beautiful.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:05.510
Ruzaina has given me the okay to just take

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.946
a bite out of the tongue. (laughs)

00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:10.446
(happy music)

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.233
Oh wow!

00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:19.836
Whoa, that's amazing.

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:22.400
Oh, that's one of the most
satisfying bites I've ever had,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.751
right out of the tongue.

00:14:23.751 --> 00:14:27.858
(everyone laughing)
Thank you granny.

00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:29.107
- Thank you for Ruzaina grandmother.

00:14:29.107 --> 00:14:30.834
- Thank you granny.

00:14:30.834 --> 00:14:31.790
- Thank you Ruzaina's grandmother.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.823
- So tender.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.366
This also has like a sourness to it.

00:14:35.366 --> 00:14:36.357
Tamarind?
- Yes.

00:14:36.357 --> 00:14:38.820
- Like a tamerind sourness.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.580
That is incredible.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.320
It's so tender, like you can
actually cut this with a fork.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.895
- Yeah.
- But dense at the same time.

00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:47.312
(chattering)

00:14:48.219 --> 00:14:49.469
Yes, thank you.

00:14:50.827 --> 00:14:52.273
Okay, and this is the other tongue.

00:14:52.273 --> 00:14:54.003
The sambal is incredible.

00:14:55.004 --> 00:14:56.304
(cats meowing)

00:14:56.304 --> 00:14:57.554
Whoa, a symphony of cats.

00:14:59.427 --> 00:15:02.730
(cats meowing loudly)

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.480
The hoof is just like melting
into the sauce right now.

00:15:07.393 --> 00:15:08.277
(Ruzaina laughs)

00:15:08.277 --> 00:15:10.310
- You're doing good now.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.954
I'm very happy that you enjoyed the food.

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:14.759
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Yeah.

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:16.350
- [Mark] Okay, there's
no marrow in this bone

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.050
but there's juice and there's fat.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.883
- [Ruzaina] Yeah, juice and fat.

00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:20.380
- So you kinda just suck it up.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.960
Oh yeah!
- Very good?

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.373
- Kinda like greeny almost.

00:15:26.373 --> 00:15:27.661
Greeny, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

00:15:27.661 --> 00:15:30.290
(grandma speaking foreign language)

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.150
(Mark sucking bone)

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.220
- And it's like cinnamon, even that spice

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.973
has seeped in there and just
kinda soaked in the bone.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.970
You can also lick the
jelly off the joints.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.103
Mm! Oh yeah!

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.520
As soon as you lick that
your lips get coated

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.470
in like a jelly--
(grandma talking)

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.954
Like a jelly fat.
- Yeah.

00:15:51.954 --> 00:15:53.890
- Oh, it's wonderful!
(everyone laughing)

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.723
It's wonderful!

00:15:54.723 --> 00:15:56.620
- It's nice, right?
- Really good!

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.794
To end the meal that's like
a dessert, meat dessert.

00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:00.479
- [Grandma] (laughs) Meat dessert.

00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:03.830
(everyone laughing)

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.135
- Oh yeah!

00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:07.185
- Custard.
- Milk and custard and sugar.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.020
- [Ruzaina] Usually we don't
eat it like that anymore but.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.407
(foreign language)

00:16:14.407 --> 00:16:16.907
(happy music)

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:23.660
- [Mark] This is a special custard,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.010
there's nuts in it, eggs.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.210
The traditional way to
eat it is, with a banana,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.620
and what you do is you can
chop it up, or you can eat it

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.960
the traditional way, which is
where where you take a bit of

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.960
the custard or take an
alternate bite. Or you can..

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:48.750
All together in one bite
with banana and custard.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.733
- A piece of banana

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.853
- Look at that.

00:16:54.853 --> 00:16:56.780
After the meat feast its
tradition to eat this desert

00:16:58.203 --> 00:16:59.606
with the banana to digest the meat.

00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:01.510
- [Ruzaina] Its to cool you down.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.636
- [Mark] Yeah its a cool day
in Kandy but I am feeling the

00:17:05.636 --> 00:17:08.523
digestions sweats that's
for sure, the meat sweats.

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:11.842
The body is at full digestion
potential right now.

00:17:11.842 --> 00:17:12.755
- (laughs)

00:17:12.755 --> 00:17:13.605
- Okay, custard..

00:17:14.446 --> 00:17:17.560
(eating noises)

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.343
- Oh its pretty awesome actually.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.383
Its like a..

00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:27.793
oh no I lost a piece of custard in my lap.

00:17:27.793 --> 00:17:29.550
That would be my next bite.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.350
Yeah on its own the custard is like,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.197
like simple, its slightly
sweet, its creamy

00:17:35.197 --> 00:17:37.257
and you taste the nuts in there.

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:39.203
But when you take the banana with it,

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.497
it totally elevates the entire experience

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:45.190
because you've got the creamy tartness of

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.361
the banana mingling with the sweetness.

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.097
The banana specifically
not overripe so its sour

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:51.453
a little bit.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.760
I think the combination is what makes it.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.376
I'm gonna lean back though.

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:58.876
(happy music)

00:18:02.609 --> 00:18:04.442
- Oh wow, what a meal.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.264
- Granny is an amazing cook,
and she cooks everything just

00:18:08.264 --> 00:18:11.014
from knowledge from experience and with

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:11.960
ultimate love.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.369
The meat is incredibly
delicious, but the love

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:16.010
you can just taste in every

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.017
single bite you take.

00:18:17.017 --> 00:18:19.350
Its the late afternoon already
but we're just gonna walk

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.398
around Kandy a little bit.

00:18:20.398 --> 00:18:22.678
We're gonna do a little bit
of sightseeing, walk around

00:18:22.678 --> 00:18:24.738
and maybe eat a little bit more.

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:27.238
(happy music)

00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.921
(noisy crowd)

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.640
We decided to take a walk over
to the Temple of the Sacred

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.473
Tooth Relic.

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:46.630
And it dates back too the
late 1500's and its one

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:50.584
of the most sacred Budhist
sites in Kandy and it's

00:18:50.584 --> 00:18:54.940
really like the cultural sites

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.560
which surrounds the kingdom of Kandy.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.420
And so we're just
gonna.. actually you know

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.530
the weather is perfect,
it's cool, it's breezy,

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.910
we're just gonna take a little walk around

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.713
and mostly see it from the outside.

00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:08.120
(happy music)

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.070
Something I always love
about Sri Lanka are the trees

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.290
and just massive trees
with spanning branches,

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.240
the birds the crows,
the trees, they really

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.660
stand out, you're gonna
love the trees when

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.810
you visit Sri Lanka.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.710
And the palm trees as well are
amazing, the coconut trees.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.520
- Micah is definitely
enjoying himself running

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.440
through the crowd.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.033
Micah are you enjoying yourself?

00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:41.867
(happy music)

00:19:43.164 --> 00:19:45.670
Okay we're off now to walk
around the central downtown

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.300
area of Kandy, maybe eat
a little bit and just walk

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.050
around and explore it a little bit.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.950
(happy music)

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.470
- Uh huh, roti and samba..

00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:10.550
(egg cracks)

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.360
- [Mark] We've been walking
round Kandy for a little while

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.480
just exploring it, it started
drizzling so we stopped

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.100
inside. This is kind of like a tea shop,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.047
snack shop, a place to get
quick eats, a place to get

00:20:20.047 --> 00:20:25.020
roti, hoppers. We ordered
some roti, we ordered, some

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.131
sambal, and we're also gonna
have tea here as well and

00:20:29.131 --> 00:20:30.443
hoppers as well.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.950
Try some of the roti, oh
it feels pretty thick.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.576
And then dip it into the sambal.

00:20:40.576 --> 00:20:43.993
(busy restaurant noises)

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.350
I got a little sambal on my lap.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.084
Its just a tiny bit spicy, quiet salty,

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.810
more of like a dried chili flavor though,

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.480
but it kind of like,
maybe the lime as well.

00:20:58.005 --> 00:21:00.252
Kind of like a sharp saltiness though.

00:21:00.252 --> 00:21:04.533
Made from a combination of
rice flower, coconut milk.

00:21:06.654 --> 00:21:08.610
The best thing about hoppers
is the method in which

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.690
they make the net around
it, skill it, so that

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.190
the edges are crispy and the bottom

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.938
remains kind of fluffy and gummy.

00:21:13.938 --> 00:21:17.333
And its that texture that makes a hopper.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.095
Scoop up some of that sambal.

00:21:20.095 --> 00:21:23.512
(busy restaurant noises)

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.133
Its good because its so fresh,
the hopper, right out of the

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:31.030
skilla, its warm, its
like gooey on the inside,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.070
crispy on the outside.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.858
But I gotta admit, I'm still
like pretty full from that

00:21:35.858 --> 00:21:38.352
lunch feast, the meat feast from granny.

00:21:38.352 --> 00:21:41.633
Like that was a significant lunch,

00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:43.676
and its still

00:21:43.676 --> 00:21:45.840
sitting heavy in my stomach right now.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.340
So its a good thing we're
just snacking right now.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.190
(happy music)

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.700
Today has been fantastic, we
drove from Columbo to Kandy,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.110
we arrived to meet with
granny and Ruzaina's aunt,

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.900
and Ruzaina.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.200
That was an impressive and
unbelievably delicious meal

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.570
and the food was excellent,
the meat was incredible,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.450
the tongue!

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.990
But without a doubt, that food
was cooked with so much love

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.080
and that's what made it so
spectacular, so incredibly

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.470
delicious with every single bite and

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.130
that is a meal I will never forget.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.948
I wanna say a massive thank
you to granny, to Anky, to

00:22:25.948 --> 00:22:28.820
