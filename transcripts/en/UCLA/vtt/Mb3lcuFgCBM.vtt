00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.760
I would describe the reservation... I'd say
it's really beautiful.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.280
Quiet. Peaceful.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.940
There's no casinos nothing like that. W e pretty much know everybody who lives there

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.700
My brothers and I were always close growing up.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.160
As my brother and sister chose UCLA I wanted to be a part of that community

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.980
Nobody in my family ever really went to college that I knew, it wasn't like a THING.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.540
My grandmother first went to school because she was forced to go to school

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
Historical trauma I see that within my
own family.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.880
You know they wanted to please their dad, they wanted to please me. They saw the fruits of their labor.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.820
So always from a young age I knew that I was gonna go to college.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.460
I didn't really know what it was. I just knew it was more school.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.980
We all came at different times so I was here for two years by myself

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.600
and then my sister came in

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.020
and then Daniel came in you know

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.000
My brothers and I were always close growing up.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.060
I think I might had to do with the fact
that we shared a room for like ten years

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.120
We did everything together.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.040
You know yeah
they're my best friends.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
I don't know what they're doing
I'm not handy like that.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.680
I like to bake or bead. David built me a
loom like... it's like this big and it's adjustable.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.580
So it can go all the way

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.140
So I'm just beading sash.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.540
Class of 2018.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.760
Oh that's Daniel's high school graduation
cap.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.660
I beaded this for him.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.420
I think I was a sophomore.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.780
This is David's. Daniel's from high school and David from college

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.940
And it's always during finals week they give me this stuff.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.080
My first year here at UCLA was it was really fun just like getting to know the campus and like

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.620
taking college classes and meeting new
people. Yeah at times I felt really

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.580
overwhelmed I get really homesick David
would take me home a lot.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.220
He had already experienced years of college so he could
you know tell me a little bit like

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.120
how to navigate it.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.680
We're gonna imagine that
were like our own like tribe here okay?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.800
and we're determining whether or not
we're gonna have a casino okay

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.520
So you are proponents for casino...

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.680
I struggled a lot for like two years

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.540
It was really hard for me to just pass my
classes you know and learn how to write

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.680
learn all these different things that
like I had to relearn all this stuff so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.860
a lot of my professors a lot of the
faculty have really helped me because I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.160
could have just been left behind and I
would've just you know can drop to the wayside

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.420
When you have a sibling here or
have your family here it's it's a lot

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.240
more comforting like you have
individuals that are always there and

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.680
you can always talk to. It's fun to
hang out with them

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.700
they were essentially the only role
model I had that were geared towards

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.140
higher education. I saw them how they
treated their teachers.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.900
How they respected their teachers, how they respected their schoolwork.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.800
Certain things like that like the way you treat others really plays into your success

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.620
Working with kids they all have their
own view of the world and

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.120
college isn't necessarily in that view.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.940
I think that's just part of being kids having that innocence.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.620
Whenever I sit down with
a student I try to make sure they

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.640
understand why they're doing it with why
it's important.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.640
Mission, huh?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100
These are actually tough projects.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.800
Having that explanation really helps a child grow

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.160
just being around them... they would lift
people's spirits

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.790
they'd make them strive harder and it
wasn't because they were you know trying

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.140
to put on the show or anything like that
they just had it in them to live like that.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.580
All my shirts are from UCLA. Free t-shirts.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.580
From the powwows the youth conferences
whatever they got going on there

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.600
Okay I'm just gonna call the guys up

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.380
Jim!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.300
Yo

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.660
It's ready.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.680
Okay.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.580
That's something we've always done too.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.460
I just wanted them to have the things that
they needed to have to be able to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.240
survive here. That's my greatest
heartbreak is not finishing my education.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.160
I had a family altercation and I was
sent off of the reservation.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.760
I had to leave the reservation when I was 14 years old and had to leave my school and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.300
nobody really came and got me and said
oh you need to come back you know you

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.560
need to finish your school they just
kind of said okay well see you later.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.640
Traditionally we're cremators so
people would pass we would burn.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.960
Burn the bodies burn the possession but we just burn to burn you know because it's

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.320
it's it's convenient we don't have like
a dump to take it to or anything like that so.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.880
In a sense too were a developing
community. We've, you know... in the year 2000,

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.580
we barely got electricity and
telephones and then running water.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.880
When I was born we didn't have electricity we had a little generator up here.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.260
The house is pretty old now though. Huge
parties here all the time with everybody

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.300
from around the rez all of our family
from my dad's side it was always a really good time.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.360
Built this bed frame right here. It's
like in high school...

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.320
That's like we didn't have a lot of hard sciences and things like that but I was able to take

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.760
small engines, welding like wood shop so that's things that we did do.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.120
Honestly our youth really isn't college bound. I didn't even think that you could  apply to UCLA.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.960
You know that's not a college you can apply to.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.500
I've always believed that you gotta
be a multi-millionaires kid or an actor

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.080
from Hollywood to get in there. When
David got in there I was like,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.520
"What?! Holy crap dude."

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.940
We come from a background where
we're stereotyped sometimes and and oh

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.560
you know what they're Native Americans
so you know they're probably... can't

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.280
be educated properly or whatever
the case may be. When you have a family

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.200
like the Streamers they've come out and
proven that

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.100
hey you know what if we can do it anybody else can do it.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.020
You have the world at the end of your fingers you know you just gotta pull it in.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.900
Basically I always tell people we're survivors if you

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:46.140
can live here on this reservation and be
happy, have a vehicle, have a job...

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.460
you're surviving. Cause if not, you're stuck if
you can change things for the better

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.200
it's really like a little piece of
heaven

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.460
The mountains, the fresh air,
you hear the bees in the rosemary.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.800
This is my people's land so why would I want to leave it.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.040
I want to do a community garden

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.260
Every since I was born there's been a garden at our house.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.340
I want to make a better space in this is community right here.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.900
We got tons of
little cousins coming up, growing up.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.760
They're gonna need all the help that they
can get so...

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.140
The days get longer and the days get

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.620
warmer then they just really start
pumping the eggs out

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.480
They're nice.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.480
So my dad,  he's he

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.640
made us do our chores, made sure we
weren't fighting with each other

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.080
he's always strict with us but he was
never mean to us.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.280
The most important thing, I feel,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.400
they grow up to be honest and
hard-working and to love their neighbors

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.240
and that was my greatest desire.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.220
the good
thing about my parents is they never

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.840
forced us to do anything you know like
Even though my mom she did she took a lot

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.690
of steps to ensure that we were going in
the direction of college you know she

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.980
never sat there and said "oh you have to go to college"

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.980
 

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.120
Aunt Davida and Uncle Jim they had
presence. They were always there for them.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.600
Always. You know if like when we would
come home sometimes our mom wasn't home

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.560
you know we'd come home and then P.J.
would cook us dinner or Toby would make

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.060
us whatever we find. Knowing there was
gonna be a meal on the table.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.340
If I leave my mom's still gonna be there when I
come home at the end of the day.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.440
That's a lot for them, you know that
security

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.280
I wasn't gonna let my kids be

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.480
treated the way I was treated. It just
seemed like nobody cared

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.980
There's me. There's Daniel brand-new born. Right at home.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.120
You know, we had we had the best life growing up.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.820
You know, she made sure
that we had a stable household and yeah

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.540
so she was just really supportive and just there for us. She was there for

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.800
every sports game that we had every
event she was just always there for us

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.820
and you know we felt that we knew it and
it made a big impact on our lives.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.440
This is my first notepad.
We just like listed all these colleges that

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.080
we thought we you know we should
apply to. Well then I started to figure

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.260
out what they needed to get into these
colleges. You know did they have the

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.240
right requirements were they getting
that at school. And then at the time I

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.880
didn't have internet so I would go to
the library and I would look up things

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.320
I didn't know about SAT prep. None of those
things are available at the high school. Nothing.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.860
and then I'm like started
figuring out how to pay for this stuff

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.400
My grandmother first went to school
because she was forced to go to school.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.620
Cut your hair don't speak your language
get beat if you act like a savage.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:54.280
In the late 19th century the United States
instituted a federal boarding school

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:00.480
program for American Indian people. They
had high mortality rates, high levels of disease...

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.280
And people were forbidden to
speak their own traditional language or

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.340
to enact any of their cultural
traditions. According to the man who

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:15.920
founded the reservation system his plan
was to quote "Kill the Indian and save the man."

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.520
There are still people alive
today who remember being taken.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.880
Remember running away from schools.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.520
School really
was a taboo like

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.460
"Okay you're going to school because you want to be a white man."

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.120
It's not a necessarily an anti-education culture

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.500
it's an
anti-government culture

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.220
We weren't taught normal history like what happened to the Indians.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.059
so between 1846 and 1873 California's
indigenous population plummeted from

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:57.520
perhaps 150,000 people to just 30,000
survivors. The state government began to

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.840
build a state-sponsored killing machine
and the United States Army added to the

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:08.400
death toll. Between 9,400 and 16,000 California Indian people, at an absolute minimum,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.080
were killed.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.260
There's this thing...

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.380
it's called historical trauma or
intergenerational trauma. It talks about

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.020
how the experiences that happened to
Native people could pass down to

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.120
generations generation that's why you
see these reoccurrences of things like

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.860
Alcoholism, abuse... all these
different types of things in our communities. 
is affiliated with the reservation the

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.040
Anybody will attest that is affiliated with the reservation that either

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.480
uncle's or aunts, cousins a lot of
them suffer alcoholism problems and

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.440
we've lost quite a few relatives because
of that.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.280
And it takes individuals like my mother to break these cycles.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.380
How can you not love them you know? How can you not

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.819
love your kids. That's really what all
this is about is about how much I love my kids.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:57.240
And I went through a lot just to
make a stable home for them you know so they

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.700
come home from school because I
would come home from school on the bus

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.080
and you know I wouldn't know if my mom
and dad would be there or if they would be drunk or

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.560
or, if she would be okay because she
was ill a lot

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.900
I just love them so much

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:20.000
and I just want the best for them I want
the best

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.520
it seems like there's always a lot of
pushback when I say that I'm gonna try

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.600
and go in to law. You can really make
positive change within not only like

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.520
large legal structures but also
in your own communities...

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.980
Having a good understanding of law makes you become
a stronger leader in American Indian

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.760
communities. I still want to be a lawyer to have this knowledge but currently I kind of

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.360
want to after these four years I
want to go back home. Wherever I'm needed

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.760
I want to serve you know. If I see that
students need an extra tutor I would

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.720
step in as that tutor. And like when my
siblings get established in what they

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.160
have I would feel more comfortable
going back to school. I think it's very

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.860
important that if one of us are there, it'll
better all of us.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.640
One thing I'm really passionate about is the native youth. Sometimes they're just in a bad situation

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.520
then I just want to help them get out of that.
I just hope that we can uplift the

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.540
spirits of our people. Get things
going. Utilize our resources, we could

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.350
really do something but we just have to
physically be there. Definitely this whole

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.720
valley, this whole region. I'll
definitely die here.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.880
All native people have their creation stories you know, and their creation stories are where

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.500
they come from and for us this is where we come from. A lot of people don't realize that

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.000
they're occupying spaces of
that aren't where they're from and

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.780
they're trying to make it their own you
know, but this place is really ours.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:58.960
This is where we're from.
