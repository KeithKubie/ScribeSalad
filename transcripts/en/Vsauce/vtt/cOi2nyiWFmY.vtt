00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.150
A telephoto lens with the tripod for
your iPhone and soap

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.240
shaped like a piece of poop.
It's episode 23

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.340
of LÜT.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.949
Wake up in your warm Nintendo knee-high
socks and put on your fancy superhero

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.760
bow-tie, along with these sunglasses from
Spencer's with a neat

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.040
hanging mustache.
Then, climb a rock wall

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.400
installed so that when you fall you just
take a dive. And this fire pit...

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.920
it's shaped like the world.
Squirrel mask.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.200
Now, what's this?
Oh, nice

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.460
a Spock bath robe.
They've also got Captain Kirk,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.980
but minimal superheroes now come on t-shirts.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.210
Of course, this t-shirt makes you look rich.
Except by rich,

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.540
I mean geeky. I was kidding. Here's a
nice mug to get for your friend.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.460
Again,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.630
I was kidding. Keep the table safe with
giant Scrabble coasters

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.180
and keep your lips moist with unicorn
farts lip balm flavored like cotton

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.730
candy

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.320
and spearmint. These aren't for sale,
but check out normal stuffed animals

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.830
bought second-hand, inverted and then
made into cute inside-out cuddly animals.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.250
You also can't buy this pancake quilt
with bacon accessory, because it's sold

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.690
out,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.729
so keep the bacon sweet with VAT19's

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.220
bacon pops.
Hard candy infused with bacon bits

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.590
or be sweeter with a candy necklace
flavored like bacon.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.320
Back to pancakes.
Williams-Sonoma offers molds to make Star Wars

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.430
shaped pancakes and if you have $50

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.799
and an out of this world taste, pick up some
exquisite gourmet chocolates

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.909
shaped like the planets.
Or

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.240
go darker with these anatomically
accurate skulls

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.610
made of chocolate. Here's a fluffy nuclear
mushroom cloud that's actually a lamp.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.080
Shapeways.com

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.150
also offers a necklace sporting a loop
made of a single curl piece of metal

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.860
that locks in a ball or your very own strandbeest,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.820
a sculpture, that when pushed or pulled

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.110
automatically appears to walk.
Oh, and this battle mug

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.850
has scope rail so you can soup it up
with all your equipment.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.840
ThisIsWhyImBroke[.com]
pointed me toward a Zelda Sword USB Drive

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.030
and rage base masks.
Pop Chart Lab does it again with this amazing

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.959
graph poster of rap names organized by
common themes.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.010
No, I've seen negatively engraved rings before,
but this one

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.450
from The Cheeky is great.
All day it pushes against your skin,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.470
so when you try and be sneaky and remove it, your finger carries the mark

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.530
"I'm married."
TotusMel creates jewelry

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.580
with lace.
One of my favorites is the mask,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.180
but don't forget the ankle corsets. 
Drink some liquid from a can

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.940
that's actually a porcelain mug
and then solve puzzles

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.360
from V-CUBE.
Not six-sided six-colored ones,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.980
but two-colored cubes that let you have
a checkerboard shape or my favorite

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.739
flag. With two colors, they've got
Poland, Denmark, Finland and Sweden,

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.940
but with three colors they've got Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.209
and Russia.
Here's an eraser shaped like the evolution of man.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.450
And Japan Trend Shop brings us Ten-Ten Dama.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.580
Like a switch hit, an awesomely designed toy
that when thrown in the air seemingly

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.580
magically

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.550
inverts itself.
ThinkGeek has Captain Jules'

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.620
rings, which unfold into a telescope.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.349
But now for your free thing.
Two things, actually. Cubeecraft[.com]

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.470
offers free printouts you cut, fold and
glue or tape in the fun characters and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.209
shapes.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.280
Once you've done that make them dance to Mario Paint

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.909
using the composer for PC or Mac just
like the one

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.500
in the original SNES game.
RezonerDJ recommended cyber dogs

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.380
cybernetic jewelry, like this headset.
And Tokyoflash

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.200
offers bizarrely awesome high-tech
watches that look like

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.080
things aliens have left behind.
Their newest is like a stencil. See, this one

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.140
says that it's 12:04.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.160
As you may remember, 6 LÜTs ago

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.599
I mentioned them. Well, they found out,
thought it was awesome

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.120
and now they've set it up, so that until
the end of April if you buy a watch

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.359
using code VSTF you get ten dollars off.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.079
So how about that?
Keep being Vsaucy.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.089
And as always,

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.929
thanks for watching.
