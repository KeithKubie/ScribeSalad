00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.220
We've all deeply, deeply internalized the
logic of the marketplace, which is that our

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.600
value is reflected in our economic value.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.170
This is one reason why we have otherwise very,
very smart well-intended people talking about

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.670
how to turn coal miners into software coders.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.060
Why is it that we think that they must become
software coders?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.939
It's because their earlier purpose in the
market no longer exists, and so we have to

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.800
find them a new one and being a software coder
seems like something that the market wants.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.649
Now unfortunately the way that the market
is evolving is that more and more of us are

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:42.420
going to struggle to outcompete software,
artificial intelligence, and robots more and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.450
more where robots are going to be to drive
a car and a truck better than us very, very

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.559
soon.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.620
AI can already outperform the smartest doctors
at identifying tumors on a radiology film.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.770
AI can already surpass experienced corporate
attorneys at editing documents and contracts.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.990
And so right now we're trapped in this mindset
where we all have to find value based upon

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.909
the market's estimation of what we can do.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.060
But the market's going to turn on more and
more of us very, very quickly and has nothing

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.380
to do with our merit.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.260
That radiologist went to school for a long
time, but they just can't see shades of gray

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.149
that the AI can.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.649
And the AI can reference millions of films
whereas the radiologists can only reference

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.649
thousands.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:37.049
And so we have to start evolving the way we
think of ourselves and our value in this society.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.299
If we rely upon the market, we're going to
follow the market off a cliff because the

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.479
market's going to turn on more and more of
us over time, and we can already see that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.850
the market does not value many of the things
that are core to human existence like caring,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.549
nurturing, and parenting and caregiving.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.829
And I use my wife as an example.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.960
My wife is at home with our two boys, one
of whom is autistic.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.970
And the market values her contribution at
zero whereas we all know that's nonsense and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.979
that her work is incredibly valuable and difficult.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.230
It's not just the caring and nurturing roles.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.190
It's also arts, creativity, journalism, increasingly,
volunteering in the community.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.240
All of these things are getting valued at
zero or near zero and declining.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.720
And so what we have to do, we have to say
look, the market is not omniscient.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.550
The market's valuation of us and our activities
and their value is something that we essentially

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.960
invented.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.490
And we need to invent new ways to measure
what we think is important.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.840
And I think that this is the most important
challenge of our time because if we do not

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.290
evolve in this direction, we're going to follow
the market to a point that's going to destroy

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.159
us where eventually AI is going to be able
to outprogram our smartest software engineers.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.569
And then what will we ask people to do that
has value?

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.700
So we have to start getting ahead of this
curve as fast as possible, and this is why

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.629
I'm running for president.
