Thanks to CuriosityStream for supporting PBS
Digital Studios.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.840
Engineering is a dangerous field.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.940
You need to worry about the dangers at work
and the things you’re creating.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.560
And there’s a lot that can go wrong.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.380
You can’t expect to make things that will help
change the world without addressing these issues.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.520
You need to care about safety.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.640
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.970
Safety – in engineering as with everything else –
is all about trying to minimize or eliminate the hazards
involved with what you’re doing.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.520
Go back a few centuries, and mishaps were
usually seen as inevitable and uncontrollable.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.860
But by the turn of the 20th century, as tens of thousands of people began dying every year in the US alone because of industrial accidents, something had to be done.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.400
The public saw countless workers, including children,
being killed in things like coal mine explosions,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.420
or the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire
of 1911, where 145 workers died after being
trapped inside a burning factory.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.540
Reaction to events like these led to the modern
safety protocols in place today – what engineers
call safety culture.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.600
And the root of this culture is simply the idea
that safety must be prioritized and embraced as
a whole, not just thrown in here or there.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.680
Which is an important mindset to have, because
today engineers work on projects that can have serious,
permanent consequences – like nuclear power.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.930
The Chernobyl accident of 1986 is a cautionary
tale.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:35.220
Due to a flawed design and inadequately trained staff, one of the reactors in the Soviet nuclear power plant exploded, releasing massive amounts of radioactive material.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.980
Two workers were killed within hours, 28 more died of radiation exposure in the following weeks, and another hundred or so ended up in the hospital with acute radiation sickness.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.960
Today, decades later, the area around Chernobyl
is still uninhabitable.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.310
The catastrophe revealed a severe lack of
safety culture.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.600
Workers didn’t follow proper protocols and
prioritized quick results over safety.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.000
Whether or not you're working with something
as dangerous as nuclear power,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.480
any safety precautions you take will fall
under one of two main categories:
occupational safety and public safety.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.300
Occupational safety is all about the risks
you’ll encounter where you work.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.980
Think of heavy machinery on construction sites,
dangerous chemicals in a lab, or radioactive
waste from a nuclear power plant.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.080
Public safety is pretty much a catch-all for
everything else.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.220
It can be about dangers you come across at
home – like a gas leak from your stove–

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.820
or the ones you’ll encounter while driving to
work – like flying debris from a demolition site.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.670
We’ve talked before about the ethics behind
engineering, but this episode is all about the practical
steps you can take to fulfill your ethical obligation.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.500
Because proper safety conditions don’t just
happen.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.640
You need to have a plan: a set of precautions
that will ensure safety as best you can.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.460
One step might be wearing the right equipment.
Hard hats and steel-toe-capped boots in a factory.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Lab coats and safety goggles in the lab.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.920
Maybe a face mask if you’re dealing
with toxic fumes.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.760
That might be a good start to address an occupational
hazard on your own personal level, but you can’t expect
the public to walk around in hard hats and lab coats.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.500
As an engineer, you need to think more
broadly and consider the people around you,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.080
not only while you’re working, but also anyone that
will ever be involved with what you create.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.740
If you’re building a car, for instance, you should
have good safety practices from the second you
start designing it to the day it rolls off the lot.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.430
And the first step in any project is to conduct
an initial safety analysis.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.560
This happens during the design stage of your
experiment, the process before you actually
start to make anything.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.660
You want to know what the hazards are. Like,
Electrical? Chemical? Mechanical?

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.000
Once you know that, you need to find your
safety limits.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.400
How hot can your equipment get before it
breaks down?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.040
How much pressure can you apply to
something before it bursts?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.940
The idea here is to identify potential problems,
and mitigate their chances of happening, or
their effects if they do.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.820
Fortunately, there are lots of resources to
help you do this!

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.520
Are you working with chemicals?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.120
Check out the supplier’s MSDS, or Material
Safety Data Sheet, to learn about any potential
reactions they could have.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.680
Working with any equipment?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.340
You should do what you never do at home:
actually read the manual – especially if you haven’t
worked with that type of machine before.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.500
One of your biggest resources is the people
around you!

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.340
Engineers work together in teams, so talk
to others to get advice, especially people
from different disciplines.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.650
After you do an extensive safety analysis,
you need to have a very thorough safety review
during the final part of your design process.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.960
You might conduct a hazard and operability
study, or HAZOP, to check everything out.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.699
A HAZOP breaks down a big, complex design
into smaller, simpler sections called nodes.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.030
That helps catch any issues you may have missed
while looking at the design as a whole.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.020
For instance, something as complicated as a
nuclear power plant is built in many smaller stages.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.320
You have to find a suitable site, design the power plant
to fit that site, fabricate all of your components,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.520
build the plant, and then finally get it all
powered up and ready to operate.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.400
At every step of that process, you need to
check out the safety of your operations.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.580
Like when you’re finding a suitable site,
you need to make sure you have enough space
not just for the reactors,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.080
but also for things like ventilation and a
safe place to store fuel.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.280
But that’s not all.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.840
Once you’re out of the design stage and
have something up and running, you should
conduct safety reviews on a regular basis.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.640
Conditions always change, and things break
down in unexpected ways.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.440
You want a scheduled process in place to try
and catch those changes in a timely manner.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:19.540
And you especially need to have a safety review if you
ever change anything, like if you move your operations to
a new factory or use different materials to cut cost.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.500
At that point, you should have a formal
inspection done by an official representative of either
your company or the government,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.400
not just for safety, but also for any environmental
impacts – which we’ll cover more next time!

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.820
Now, if something goes wrong and
someone gets hurt,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.500
you obviously need a thorough review to
determine not only the cause, but also to assess
if it was anyone’s responsibility.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.640
Because the fact is, even after many levels
of safety review, things can still go wrong.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.360
You need to know why it happened so that others
can avoid making the same mistake.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.540
So, you have your resources, like an MSDS,
and a safety review, and maybe a HAZOP,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:01.120
but when it comes to your process for ensuring
the safety of your project, you can compress all of
these safety concerns down to four steps.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.840
The first part is “designing out” any
hazards.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.960
You want to minimize the inherent dangers
of a process as much as possible from the get-go.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.760
If you don’t want to start a fire, you’ll want to use
fire-resistant materials rather than flammable ones and
keep temperatures within an acceptable range.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.860
Next, you want to come up with a design that
allows for a reasonable margin of error.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.980
Now you rate your lift for a dozen people,
it better be able to hold 20, just in case.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.320
So you may also need what’s called a
“safe fail.”

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:35.349
This basically means that if your design ends up failing
or shutting down, then it does so as safely as possible,
rather than ending in some kind of catastrophe.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.400
You’ve seen this first hand if your phone
has ever overheated and shut down before any
real damage happened.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.680
Finally, you should put in place procedural
safeguards.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.660
These can range from general safety standards, like
training workers and staff, to watching over a process
in order to identify any new potential issues.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.920
The best systems will have multiple layers
of safety involved.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.770
It's a good idea to conduct something like
a Layers of Protection Analysis, or LOPA.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.460
After making your system as safe as possible,
a LOPA helps you add in safety controls like
automated responses or warnings.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.080
Some of these may be cautionary, like your
car’s check engine light, while others will need your
immediate attention, like a fire alarm.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.360
Keep building outward and make sure every
alarm is properly prioritized.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.320
But only if they’re really needed – because
too many alarms can actually do more harm
than good.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.460
Take the Texaco Pembroke Refinery explosion,
for example.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.420
In 1994, a large explosion ripped through the
Pembroke Refinery in Wales, injuring 26 people.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.460
The blast was heard from up to 40 miles
away and its shockwave damaged properties
within a 10-mile radius.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.889
There were many reasons why this explosion occurred,
but one was the excessive number of alarms that the
operators had to respond to during the emergency.

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:50.000
2,040 total alarms were in the system, with
87% being designated as “high priority”.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.920
But many of them were just given that
designation without really addressing how
dangerous they actually were.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:02.660
The whole event happened over several
hours, but in the last 11 minutes alone,
operators had to respond to 275 alarms!

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.040
They were unable to tell which were critical
to safety and which were not, effectively
rendering the alarms useless.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.780
So your LOPA needs to help establish an
adequate number of alarms and fail-safes
set in place, but not too many.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:20.960
And it doesn’t stop there. At some point, you
should also put in automated systems that will
shut down the process when any issues arise.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.280
One of the problems with the Chernobyl
accident was that the operators actually disabled
the automatic shutdown mechanisms,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.900
and the reactor was too unstable by the time
they tried to shut it down themselves.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.300
You might also need physical protection systems, like
ditches around your plant or some high, sturdy walls.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.280
And you definitely need not only a plant-wide
response system, but also an emergency community
response plan.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:50.040
For nuclear power plants in the US, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission makes sure that each one has
a thorough emergency response system set in place.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.620
They require every plant to have a full-scale
exercise at least once every 2 years

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.740
to ensure everyone involved, from the operators to the
local government, are fully prepared for the worst.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.420
If any of this seems like too much, just remember
that people’s lives are often in your hands.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.440
While you can’t eliminate problems entirely,
you can do a lot to prevent them.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:15.760
Something like a nuclear power plant can actually
be pretty safe if you follow the proper protocols,
and put an emphasis on safety culture.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.560
But fail to do so, and it can have catastrophic effects.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:27.560
So just make sure you treat safety with the same level of importance as all the other engineering concepts you’ll learn and you’ll be on the best path to success!

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.020
Today we learned all about safety and its
impact on engineering.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:39.940
We saw the difference between occupational safety and public safety and found out how to analyze and review a process for any potential dangers with things like HAZOP.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:47.840
Then we learned about LOPA and the dangers of having too many alarms, and ended on how important it is to adopt a good mindset of safety culture.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.040
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll talk
about environmental engineering.
