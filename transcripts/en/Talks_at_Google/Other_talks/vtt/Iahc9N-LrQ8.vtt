00:00:01.386 --> 00:00:04.560
MALE SPEAKER: He's authored
three books on gamification,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.930
including the newest one which
is just coming out, "The

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.590
Gamification Revolution, How
Leaders Leverage Game

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.090
Mechanics to Crush the
Competition." So you should

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.150
pick that up.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.530
He blogs for sites like
Huffington Post and Mashable.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.790
He's given numerous talks,
including a really great Ted

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.260
talk for TedxBrussels titled,
"How Games Make Kids Smarter."

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I'm excited to have Gabe here
because gamification is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.150
becoming more and more
recognized as an important

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.760
aspect of learning, especially
here at Google.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.820
But as we know, with great
power comes great

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.170
responsibility.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
So we're very lucky to have
Gabe here and to share his

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.760
experiences with us.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.190
So please welcome
Gabe Zichermann.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.440
GABE ZICHERMANN: Thank you.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.740
Thanks very much everybody.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.870
I'm super excited to be here
for the second Google Talk.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.180
It's always nice to have the
Google food and drink the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.230
Google water and so on,
just not the Kool-Aid.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.630
I noticed there's no Kool-Aid.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.920
So talking about gamification,
put this in context first.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.370
I was born in 1974.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.840
And 1974, in addition to being
the year that I was born,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.910
which is an auspicious enough
occasion for us to care, is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.920
also more or less the time that
the modern video game

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.180
industry gets up and running.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.390
And it wasn't more than a few
short years later that my

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.860
immigrant parents thought, I
think this computer thing is

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.520
going to be big someday.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.150
And so maybe we should
get Gabe a computer.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.170
And they bought my
first Vic-20.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.050
It was my first computer,
Vic-20, 1982.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.120
And very shortly thereafter, I
learned my first lesson in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.230
computing when the Commodore 64
came out four weeks later,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.440
after I bought my Vic-20,
making it obsolete.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.640
But like so many people with
their first computers, I'm

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.560
sure many of you can relate to
this, I almost immediately

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.120
went off in search of the games
that I could play with

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.510
my Vic-20, which came mostly in
cartridge or cassette tape

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.650
form, which was actually a form
in which software was

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.700
once delivered.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.080
And it wasn't long after that
that I started wanting to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.760
learn how to make those games
that were part of that

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.960
experience with the computer.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.890
And I started with typing
game books like these--

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.120
Usborne books, which some of
you might be familiar with.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.680
And I eventually graduated
to writing some from game

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.730
programming books.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.340
And games became an ever larger
part of my life, as

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.020
with so many of us who grew up
in that first generation of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.330
contemporary gamers.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.870
All the way through to college,
where I became

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.000
obsessed with this game called
Civilization, which I'm sure

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.350
has ensnared some of you
and your loved ones.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.650
I played about 8,000 hours of
Civilization, give or take,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.520
during my undergraduate years.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.240
I also managed to graduate
with a degree.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400
But I spent a lot of time
playing this game.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.250
And so I took that as part of
my passion with games when I

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.550
found myself working the
networking industry for a few

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.630
years and joined the
games industry.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.630
And I started off working
on the game developers

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.890
conference, "Gamasutra" game
developer magazine, which are

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.280
the three main trade outlets
in the game space.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.790
And I did cool things like help
launch the Independent

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.070
Games Festival, which some of
you might be familiar with.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.230
And after that, I started a
company called Trymedia, which

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.510
was the first successful
digital

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.190
distribution company in games.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.640
So before Steam, this was a
company that made that happen.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.540
And when we sold the company in
2005, we powered about 4/5

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.620
of the world's legitimate
game downloads.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.200
So if you downloaded a game
between 1999 and 2005, thank

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.690
you so very much.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.310
After we sold the company,
I had what could best be

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.430
described as a crisis
of conscience.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.900
I started to think to myself,
look at all the amazing things

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.570
that games have done.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.100
Look at how many people they've
entertained and all

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.210
the success that we've had.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.510
Is that all that we'll
ever do with them?

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.110
Is entertainment the sum total
of what this powerful medium

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.540
is capable of accomplishing?

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.380
And don't get me wrong, I
think entertainment is

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.770
important and meaningful
in and of itself.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.910
It does not need another
purpose to be

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.590
important to society.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.760
But I thought to myself,
we could do more.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.690
And so I started to research.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.870
I started to play around.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.030
I started to build apps.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.750
And out of that came my first
book, "game-based marketing,"

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.090
which came out in 2010 and
was followed up by the

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.900
"Gamification by Design," which
I wrote for O'Reilly.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.520
And then now, my new book, "The
Gamification Revolution."

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.710
And so for the last, however
many years, about seven years,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.640
I spent my life devoted to this
topic of how to use games

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.260
to change people's behavior,
change the world.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.529
I now also edit the site,
gamification.co, which is the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.780
main site that covers
that topic.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.570
I run a strategic consultancy
called dopamine, which is the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.610
leading group that helps design
experiences, meaningful

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.710
experiences using gamification
engagement science.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.730
And as you heard, I'm the chair
of gamification summit,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.120
or gsummit, which is a
super awesome event.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.830
Some of you will be there.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.680
Hopefully, others of you will
join us either live or online

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.190
looking at the top experts who
use this subject area, the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040
power of games, to change
behavior in

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.870
all kinds of spheres.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.390
It's happening in
San Francisco.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.280
And it's at GSummit.com.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.980
But going back to
my childhood.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.510
So games let me do
a few things.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.130
One of the things that I figured
out that very quickly

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.110
they allowed me to do is they
allowed me to be somebody else

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.860
and experience things that
weren't normal or natural to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.480
my default state of being.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.660
So one of those things was,
obviously, I could be the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.650
athlete in games like
"Decathalon," that I couldn't

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.910
be in my regular life.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.760
Or the global sleuth in, "Where
in the World is Carmen

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.980
San Diego," which is still one
of my favorite games and

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.210
endlessly replayable
even as an adult.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.930
And of course to the tween boy
in me, "Leisure Suit Larry"

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.850
gave me some insight into what
it would be like to be an

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.286
adult at some point and--

00:05:34.286 --> 00:05:36.830
and as you know, it's
very true to life--

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.600
have those experiences.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.770
But what I didn't realize at the
time, and science only now

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.390
has caught up to some extent,
how significantly those game

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.720
experiences were rewiring my
brain and how significantly

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.790
they were doing the same
to all of you.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.670
It turns out that in a couple
of key ways, games have a

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.100
profound effect on the brain
and on the mind.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.180
And one of those is through the
process of what's called

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.720
intrinsic reinforcement.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.300
And basically, the way intrinsic
reinforcement works

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.380
is anytime you challenge
yourself to something,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.580
anything at all, doesn't matter
what it is, good or

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.030
bad, big or small, and you
achieve that thing, your brain

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.460
secretes a little bit of a
magical neurotransmitter

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.000
called dopamine.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.310
And dopamine is a pleasure
chemical.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.080
So challenge, achievement,
pleasure.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.300
And the interesting thing about
that loop is, of course,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.030
it explains a great deal of
what's amazing and also kind

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.460
of messed up about the world
all in one shot.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.760
Because you can derive pleasure
from things which are

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.910
not objectively good.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.220
They don't have to be good in an
ethical, moral, or concrete

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.540
sense for you to derive pleasure
of challenging and

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.960
achieving that thing.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.200
Now, in the real world, the one
that we're inhabiting in

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.570
theory today, we get this
dopamine release very

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.650
infrequently.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.840
It doesn't happen
all the time.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.850
It doesn't happen regularly.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.720
We can't beat our personal best
or run our best marathon

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.280
time over and over
and over again.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.800
But in the game world, we can
deliver that jolt of dopamine

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.150
by design, sometimes hundreds
of times per hour.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.530
A game is an endless series of
little challenges that you

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.400
then achieve.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.670
And then you produce dopamine.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.460
And in this loop, in this
constant loop, we train

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.250
ourselves to want that
more and more.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.470
That's intrinsic
reinforcement.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.440
We want that release.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.300
The second piece of the science
that's caught up a

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.940
little bit is that games can
actually make you smarter.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.680
And this has been the subject
of some debate.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.140
In fact, this research is so
contentious that it's taken 10

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.180
years of repeatedly demonstrable
studies by the

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.320
same research team to prove that
a game can raise people's

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.960
intelligence.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.840
And this game type, this mode
is called n-back, the letter

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.960
"n" and then back,
or dual n-back.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.180
It's kind of game rather
than a brand name.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.440
And it's been shown to raise
your intelligence, your IQ

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.850
score by as much as four to five
points by playing this

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.230
game for as little
as four weeks.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.750
And the halo affect of that
rise can last for

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.270
six months or longer.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.160
Kind of astounding when
you think about it.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.970
Pretty amazing that a
game can do that.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.050
Now, I would preface this, I
will say that n-back or dual

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.690
n-back is really hard.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.930
So it's not an easy game.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.310
It's not like "Lemonade Stand."
You have to actually

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.390
lean in and do it.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.790
And it forms one of the
important lessons about the

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.890
power of games and the
power of gamification

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.230
to change the world.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.020
But since that time, since my
childhood with games and many

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.220
of your childhood with games,
the industry's evolved a

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.590
tremendous amount.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.950
The games today are almost
indistinguished--

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.350
We can't even see them as the
same thing as they were 30

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.660
some odd years ago.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.850
They look amazing.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.110
They're capable of astonishing
things with incredible power,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.929
with incredible clarity, with
incredible sophistication.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.640
And at the same time, our
behavior, our world has

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.049
changed substantially from that
time 30 years ago, 30

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:40.789
some odd years ago.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:44.400
It doesn't look the same at
all as it was before.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.050
And I think that those two
things are connected.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.310
Now, some of us have spent
this time imagining and

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.620
dreaming about ways that these
games, this gamer generation,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.390
will help save the world.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.640
They travel even today.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.310
Many of my contemporaries
travel around the world

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.620
telling us how great games will
be at solving the world's

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.060
problems, how they will help
us to change everything and

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.520
fix everything that's
wrong in the world.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.920
But many others seem stuck in a
pattern that hasn't changed

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.950
some 30 odd years.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.090
We're still arguing about
whether or not

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.280
games are good or bad.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.470
We're still arguing about
whether or not they can teach

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.020
children something, whether
they're positive or negative,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.130
whether the addiction that
results from games is better

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.600
or worse than other things.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.250
Still arguing about that.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.120
It's the same conversation.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.890
And of course, the omnipresent
question of whether or not

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.440
games cause violence, which
continues to be a major theme

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.500
in the discussion about games
and their role in the world.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.520
But I'm struck by something on a
repeated basis every time we

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.900
have this discussion.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.880
First of all, I am effin bored
as hell of this discussion.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.180
I am sick and tired of having
this argument with people.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.480
It's over, this discussion.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.250
I don't want to have
it anymore.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.930
I don't want to put games or
gamers on trial anymore.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.210
Why is it that games and gamers
are the ones on trial

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.130
constantly being asked, what
their purpose is, what purpose

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.930
they serve in the world when
our stupid, boring, gray,

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.200
dull, irritating, pointless
existences in so many ways are

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.470
not the things on trial.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.450
Why isn't every dull
interaction

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.350
that we have on trial?

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.950
Why are the things that bring
us so much joy, the things

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.570
that bring us so much engagement
the things that we

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.260
have so many qualms about?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And I'd argue that at the same
time, we're on the cusp of

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.520
something very unusual and
interesting, which is, I

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.820
believe, an actual evolutionary
step in humanity.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:41.910
I think we're witnessing the
birth of the next human.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.410
And these things are connected,
in my mind.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.530
And I'm struck by looking at the
rates of, in particular,

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.260
autism and ADHD.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.680
I'm sure many of you have
been touched by it.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.920
Of course, the stats tell us
that many of you have been

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.890
touched by it, by the
immense growth of it

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.990
over the last 30 years.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.960
But in particular now, the stats
say that about one in

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.570
every 54 male children
has some form of

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.950
autism spectrum disorder.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.710
And over 10% of the American
population has

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.560
some kind of ADHD.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.340
And it strikes me that this
is very significant.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.490
At some point in the near term,
this will shift from

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.730
being something that we
pathologize, shift from being

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.460
something that we medicalize,
to being something that will

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.930
be quite normal.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.870
When a sufficient percentage
of the population--

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.470
You can project this
graph out.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.380
Most of you are math nerds.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.450
You can project this graph
out yourself, just

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.660
the same way I can.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.520
It's not long before these
numbers produce a substantial

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.050
minority of the population is no
longer a pathology, that's

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.480
no longer an illness, something
that needs to

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.550
medicated or something that
needs to be dealt with, but a

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.730
substantially different group of
people with a substantially

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.450
different way of viewing
the world.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.190
And what makes people in the
autism spectrum and people

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.700
with ADHD particularly
interesting is that

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.440
it's not all bad.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.430
We think of them as not fitting
and not being able to

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.960
relate to the world in
particular ways.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.380
But it turns out that folks with
high functioning autism,

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.820
things like Asperger's actually
have a higher level

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.280
of fluid intelligence than
the average population.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.660
And fluid intelligence, by the
way, is different from

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.540
crystallized intelligence, which
is what we typically

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.540
measure on a standard IQ test.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.980
Fluid intelligence is our
ability to problem solve in

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.510
novel situations.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.330
It's our ability to, in
circumstances where we don't

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.710
really know anything or we don't
have the knowledge, find

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.600
solutions to problems,
figure our way out of

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.110
boxes, solve things.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:39.270
And so it's not without
observation that there are

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.350
some interesting upsides.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.930
And I want to connect
those dots.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.800
So I started to research the
question of this sort of

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.940
adaptation.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.630
And I came across the work of
Nobel Prize winning economist,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.100
Robert Fogel.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.290
And Mr. Fogel has spent his
life researching a concept

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.960
called technophysio evolution.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.020
And the concept of technophysio
evolution is, how

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.810
is it that technology changes
our evolution, both our

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.790
genotype and phenotype
evolution?

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.740
So both our genes and how they
are expressed, how that

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.930
expresses itself in outcomes
in the world.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.450
This is his area of study.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.440
And after doing a life's work,
crunching an unbelievable

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.150
amount of data in his recent
research, they've identified

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.370
that technology has been
directly responsible for a

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.950
very, very significant change
in human outcomes.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:32.020
In 1850, the average American
man was 5' 7" and could expect

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.310
to live 45 years.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.200
In 1980, the average American
man was 5' 10"

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.610
and lived to be 75.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.880
That time interval, that
timespan is so short by

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.960
evolutionary standards.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.690
And after crunching all the
data, it became very clear

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.440
there was no other answer but
technology to explain how that

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.360
occurred, various technologies,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.710
but how that occurred.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.670
And so why would technology's
influence on our evolution,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.440
both genotype and phenotype,
be restricted?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.460
If you can think, our longevity,
our vibrancy, our

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.910
health is such a big thing.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.570
It's a very complicated thing.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.950
If it can influence that, what
else is in influencing?

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.390
What other things are
technologies, and particularly

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.460
really engaging technologies,
doing to our

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.540
sense of well being?

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.980
And so it strikes me--

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.070
"Revenge of the Nerds," it
strikes me that we've come

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.220
upon a time in which certain
kinds of characteristics,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.430
certain kinds of human
characteristics are no longer

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.450
things that we need
to select against.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.350
So now, it no longer hurts your
ability to reproduce, if

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.400
that's the objective, certainly
from an evolutionary

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.550
biology standpoint.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.770
It no longer hurts your ability
to reproduce if you're

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.880
not so good socially.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.500
If you're not as good at reading
social cues in this

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.010
generation, you probably are
not going to have a huge

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.880
problem finding a mate
and having kids.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.670
And that's been the
case for a while.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.290
And in fact, our society has
increasingly shifted to

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.840
valuing our ability to process
and interact with machines

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.790
versus our ability to process
and interact with each other,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.990
which is one of the
characteristics of people with

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.010
autism spectrum disorder.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.190
It's a response to that.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.790
So those people who are able to
do better with machines and

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.880
process with their brains
technology, math, and that

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.510
kind of interaction have
some sort of advantage

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.820
in our world today.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.710
And so it seems to me like these
things put together,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.230
these technology pressures,
particularly the power of

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.260
games, are producing this
interesting evolutionary step.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.620
And those people who have this
new capability, who have this

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.120
new and different characteristic
are not to be

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.480
medicalized.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.350
It's not a pathology.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.590
It's the future of people.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.370
And they're already
walking among us.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.410
There's no ignoring the
evidence, for those of you

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.030
with a young child.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.270
There's no ignoring the evidence
of their intuitive

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.030
connection with technology and
that increasing funnel and

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.215
pressure that we put them on to
engage with that technology

00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:10.440
in early days.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.680
This is only intensifying.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.330
It's only becoming
more serious.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.840
This evolutionary step is
something that the optimist,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.430
the writers, the visionaries
have talked

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.310
about for a long time.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.740
And I think for many of you
who loved comic books, who

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.810
loved video games as kids, you
had sort of hoped that if we

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.790
had a human evolutionary step
in our lifetime, that those

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.960
people would have superpowers.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.190
I think we can all agree it
would be really cool.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.760
And they'd be really easy to
spot, because they'd be flying

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.100
above us and turning
water into ice.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.270
But I posit that this is
actually happening and it is a

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.710
kind of super power.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.470
And that superpower's
manifesting itself every day.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.220
What's interesting to me about
this particular evolution from

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.260
the millennial generation
forward is that for many

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.930
folks, particularly older folks,
the millennials in this

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.870
tight gamer influence generation
is something that

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.870
they just don't understand.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.160
It's something that's producing
a lot of friction.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.859
And yet, it's suggested that
this particular generation

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.329
doesn't have problems as much
as these particular

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.150
generations have strengths.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.579
And they're demonstrating those
strengths by running

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.170
rings around the established
order all the time.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.079
And those rings are showing
up in ever more increasing

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.750
frequency the more and
more that we look.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.650
And it poses a real challenge
for those of us not on that

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.540
side of the fence, those of us
perhaps a little bit older

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.680
already established in
our jobs in industry.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.140
Google the phrase "managing
millennials," for example.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.220
I know many of you
are quite young.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.380
Many of you are in the
millennial generation.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.720
But you have to know that many
older folks, people more my

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.750
age and even older, are having
a lot of, shall we say, ennui

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.390
about managing millennials.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.730
Just for your own edification,
Google it and see all the

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.730
frustration people--

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.080
Millenials are so
hard to manage.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.360
They need constant positive
reinforcement.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.130
They're never happy
with anything.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.766
They think they're entitled
to everything.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:07.390
I look at that and I'm like, so
you're taking the smartest,

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.810
fastest thinking, most
technologically literate, most

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.680
socially connected, most
ethically grounded generation

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.570
in history, dismissing them
because you can't figure out

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.430
how to manage them the way
they need to be managed.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.500
Let me tell you what
will happen.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.570
If you can't figure out how to
make an environment that's

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.680
engaging to them, they'll leave
and start competitors.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.870
Because there's nothing holding
that generation and

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:38.000
their younger cohort to working
in major corporations.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.230
Similarly, from the marketing
standpoint, if you don't make

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.580
your products and services
engaging enough, if you don't

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.180
think about them the way this
intensively changed, new human

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.090
thinks about marketing a product
experiences, you too

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.450
will lose them.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.610
Take this case study.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.860
A few months ago, a major car
maker came to me, one of the

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.810
world's largest makers, and
said, Gabe, we have a problem.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.240
I was like, OK, what's
your problem?

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.540
And they're like, kids don't
want to drive anymore.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.740
For the first time since
the introduction of the

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.590
automobile, the interest of
teenagers in driving in the

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.440
United States is
on the decline.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.580
It's never been seen before.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.980
And there's lots of different
research.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.880
And I said, why?

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.900
Let's look at the research.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.470
And the reasons that are cited
are the environment, which the

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.210
millennial and younger
generations, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.190
generation are really
concerned with.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.180
The cost of driving a car, also

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.630
prominent in people's minds.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.370
But the main reason, according
to this automaker's research

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.225
was that kids can't Instagram
and tweet while

00:19:38.225 --> 00:19:39.926
they're behind the wheel.

00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:41.600
Not kidding you.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.890
So instead of not

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.300
Instagramming, they're not driving.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.400
Let's put that into
perspective.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.120
If you told me five years ago
that some photo sharing app

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.130
was going to undo five
generations of intrinsically

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.290
built-in American personality
and behavior, that connection

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.930
between Americans and their
cars, between teenage

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.080
Americans and their
cars, right?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.610
Think about this indoctrination
that you get as

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.330
a teenager.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.830
If you had told me that
Instagram was going to kill

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.750
the car, I'd have
laughed at you.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.370
But the writing's on the wall.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.040
People will give up things that
are so dear to them in

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.610
pursuit of pleasure and positive
reinforcement.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.710
They go where the pleasure is.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.240
It's a sort of hedonistic
principle.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.500
And to the old canard of
violence in video games--

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.090
every time some terrible tragedy
happens that often in

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.640
between, a debate erupts
about the effect of

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.330
video games on violence.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.280
And even if you choose to ignore
all the studies that

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.480
say the games do not generate
violence in people who are

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.570
naturally not predisposed to
violence, we can also all

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.640
agree that games are excellent
training tools.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.060
And so if you are predisposed
to violence and you like to

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.290
use video games, you probably
have gotten a fair amount of

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.790
education on how to do that.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.650
Now, let me ask you this.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.530
If we're going to have this
argument about games and

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.900
violence in society, what
are you going to do?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.470
Ban games?

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.040
You need to get rid of them?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.390
You going to shove that
back in the box?

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.970
Maybe the more pertinent
question should be, how are

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.440
you going to defend yourself
against somebody who spent

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.670
10,000 or 20,000 hours training
on how to commit

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.670
violence when they decide
that they want to?

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.440
Your police officers, your Army
lieutenants do not have

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.300
the same amount of training that
a 16-year-old boy playing

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.230
video games has, in terms of
total numbers of hours.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.200
And they never will.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.500
They'll retire from the police
force without ever seeing that

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.610
much action as you will in four
or five years of violent

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.750
video game play.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.560
The only way to do that, the
only way to do it, whether

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.860
it's that--

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.970
I know that was a little
heavy, OK.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.030
But I understand.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.870
But we have to have
this conversation.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.120
We have to have it.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.090
People are too polarized
about this.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.230
We have to have the
real conversation.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.710
And no matter what it is, you're
not putting this game

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.510
genie back in the box.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.260
You're not going to do it.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.160
So what you have to do no matter
where you sit in the

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.160
ecosystem is level the
playing field.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.790
Changing this next generation
consumer, this next generation

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.630
human is less powerful of a
strategy and less effective of

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.810
a strategy, as I'll argue and
I'll show you, as making the

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.220
thing that you do, the position
that you're trying to

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.450
advocate for, whether that's
your business, society, the

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.860
government, your non-profit,
or even

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.520
your safety more gamelike.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.230
And so we arrive at this topic
called gamification.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.490
And the way that we think
about gamification is

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.840
gamification is the process of
engaging users and changing

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.230
behavior using the best ideas
from games, loyalty programs,

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.390
and behavioral economics.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.860
It's a way of leveling
the playing field.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.090
It's a way of bringing the best
ideas from games to this

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.170
thing that you're doing, which
maybe isn't games, and

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.550
leveraging that to create the
kind of engagement that you

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.580
need to change that
sort of behavior.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.790
In looking at the research, we
found that there were three

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.120
characteristics that a system
had to have in order to be

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.580
engaging, particularly to this
next generation of consumer.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.710
It had to have feedback,
friends, and fun.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.890
And the more feedback, friends,
and fun that a system

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.680
has, the more effective it is at
changing people's behavior.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.690
Feedback, friends, and fun,
these are the characteristics.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.050
And although much of this
evolutionary shift that I've

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.080
been talking about is something
that rests below our

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.910
observable level, so it's not
something that most of us are

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.430
keenly aware of, I think.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.230
We don't feel like there's a
next human walking among us.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:53.060
It turns out that intuitively,
many businesses have actually

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.290
been talking to this new
consumer and designing for

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.510
this new consumer.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.970
And it's an interesting case
study in the free market and

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.370
that profit motive, and how in
response to pressure, some

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.160
organizations have stepped it
up and figured out a way to

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.820
leverage gamification and take
leadership even before there

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.170
was clear evidence
to support this.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.640
So one of those examples,
certainly on

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.830
the marketing side--

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.090
And it's no surprise that
marketers are first, because

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.630
they're the first people to
say, hey, our ads are not

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.740
working the way they
should anymore.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.680
People are not paying
attention to

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.540
our messages anymore.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.030
Everyone knows that our social
media marketing is fake.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.910
So one of the most interesting
case studies for this comes

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.420
from a company called Autodesk,
which many of you

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.110
are familiar with as a creator
high end 3D modeling software.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.420
And they have, like many
software makers, a free to

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.970
play, free trial version.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.390
Afterwards, you can buy
a paid version.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.610
Autodesk realized that people
were getting all excited.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.760
I'm going to do 3D modeling.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.470
It's really cool.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.650
I want to make 3D stuff.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.580
And they would download the
trial version of the product,

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.860
fully featured, industry
standard product.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:00.200
And then people would get
confused and stop using it and

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.130
therefore, never buy
the product.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.530
So they said we have to
have a better way.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.470
We've got to connect with this
new consumer in a new way and

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.350
come up with a way to get them
to buy this product.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.740
And so what they did was they
gamified the free trial of

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.990
their 3D modeling software.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.300
They created quests, which are
inspired by Carmen San Diego--

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.080
even though I don't know that
they would say that publicly--

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.120
where basically, you have to
solve puzzles for each feature

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.570
of the product.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.740
So you're traveling through
the world and solving a

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.120
puzzle as you go.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.120
And to solve each puzzle, you've
got to learn the basic

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.410
element of the product, like how
to model something, how to

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.840
rotate a model, how to light
something, so all these

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.960
different features.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.510
And through this process,
Autodesk has raised total time

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:44.860
in its trial versions by 40% and
increased revenue by 15%.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.140
It increased sales.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.140
The seat of their software
goes for $3,500.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.160
So 15% increase is not an
insignificant number.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.100
Would be significant at any
company, but it's particularly

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.240
jarring in that context.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.990
And that's by creating these
opportunities to connect with

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.150
consumers in a way that's
more meaningful.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.440
Or another fun example,
this time from

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.240
the pizza chain Domino's.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.820
Domino's built this game called
"Pizza Hero." And in

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.120
this game, which is available
for your iOS devices and also

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.040
Android devices, you play a
pizzaolo or pizzaola, someone

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.260
who makes pizzas.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.430
You have to learn how to knead
the dough, spin the dough up,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.400
get the ingredients,
put them on.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.820
Once you've mastered how to do
that, you could actually

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.290
submit your pizza to be baked
at your local Domino's.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.110
So as an output of the game,
you can say, hey

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.820
make this for me.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.070
And then they bake it and
deliver you the pizza that you

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.180
made through this game.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.510
And if you're especially good
at it, Domino's will invite

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:40.550
you to apply for a job at the
company making pizzas, which

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.020
of course is amusing.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.970
But this is a real
business problem.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.840
This is a company that's got to
hire a lot of people every

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.280
year, big turnover.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.800
In the first seven weeks of the
product roll out, hundreds

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.090
of thousands of people played
Domino's "Pizza Hero." And it

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.010
resulted in millions of dollars
worth of incremental

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.700
revenue to the company.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.890
They've been a little bit more
mum on the number of employees

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.170
they've hired as
a result of it.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.740
But nonetheless, a really,
really interesting case study.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.200
But the use of gamification
isn't isolated to marketing.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.180
Other companies taking a
leadership position thinking

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.750
about this next generation of
consumers have started to

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.800
apply these principles to human
resources and to the

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.930
enterprise and to business
process.

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.970
And one of those is IBM, which
built a business process

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.510
management platform called
innov8, off of which they

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.950
developed a couple of
games that make

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.420
use of this BPM concept.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.860
And one of those games, by
example, is called "City

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.620
Manager." it's kind of a "Sim
City" for people who actually

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.340
run cities.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.200
So if you're really a city
manager, it's the kind of

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.400
thing you might play.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.320
Today, IBM's little game
experiment, this little game

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.470
that IBM has put out on the web,
is the number one lead

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:49.380
generator for the IBM
corporation worldwide, is this

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.150
game that they put on their
website, the inov8 platform.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:53.890
Pretty cool stuff.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.130
It's actually a lot of fun.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.620
Or take as an example,
"Plantville," from the German

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.776
engineering company Siemens,
which most of you, I'm sure,

00:28:00.776 --> 00:28:01.940
are familiar with.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.020
So Siemens built this game
called "Plantville," in which

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.030
you run a plant or factory
or some kind of

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.380
facility like that.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.370
The crazy part about
"Plantville" is right now as

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.300
we're talking, something like
20,000 or 25,000 people are

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.090
playing "Plantville," of which
the majority are people who

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.540
run plants for a living.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.960
So just to put this in a
perspective, you go to your

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.540
job running a factory all
day until 6 o'clock.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.860
Then you come home, take your
pants off, grab a sandwich,

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.050
and sit down and play plant
manager all night long until

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.352
you go to bed.

00:28:36.352 --> 00:28:38.240
It sounds a little
crazy, right?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.780
It's a little crazy,
until you start

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.220
putting this into context.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.750
And you start remembering, as
some of you may have seen

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.690
during the Iraq and Afghanistan
conflicts, news

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.200
reports ran these stories about
soldiers would go out,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.430
do a sortie, come back to base,
take a shower, sit down,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.570
and play war games.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.510
Some of you may have seen
that in the news.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.570
This is a kind of similar
phenomenon.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.120
The basic idea is that whatever
it is that you do for

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.520
a job, you go into that job with
really big expectations

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.000
about what your career's
going to hold.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.640
You have a fantasy about
what that job is.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.310
And then once you get into a
day to day, your reality's

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.550
more narrow.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.390
But you were in it because
you had a real

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.920
passion for that thing.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.590
And you still maybe want
to play with it.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.790
Take this example.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.850
So let's say you're the nuclear
plant manager playing

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.750
"Plantville." Every day you
come to your job at this

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.930
nuclear plant.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.050
This nuclear plant, you come in
every day hoping that today

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.950
is not the day that the
plant melts down.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.920
But you kind of hope it is,
just a little bit, right?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.470
But it would be terrible
if it was.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.040
But it would be kind awesome.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.200
But it would also be horrifying
and really good.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.480
It's complicated.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.510
You train your whole life
as a nuclear plant

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.756
manager for that meltdown.

00:29:45.756 --> 00:29:48.580
You've trained and trained
and trained.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.200
You've done all the training,
mostly on paper.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.600
It would be bad if
that happened.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.030
But also, it would be kind of
cool to test your limits, to

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.920
know what you're capable of
doing, to actually see

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.760
yourself in that context.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.880
But again, the use of
gamification by leading edge

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.990
businesses isn't limited
to marketing or HR.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.190
To address this next generation
of challenges and

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.860
this next consumer, companies
are also using it in a

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.160
strategic way.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.570
Take, for example, the United
Kingdom's Department of Work

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.870
and Pensions.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.410
It alone is the single biggest
part of the UK government in

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:21.920
terms of budget spent.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.870
They cover 28% of the total
budget of the UK, just this

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:25.960
one department.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.000
And they were looking for ways
of optimizing their business

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.270
and ways of improving the
way that they work.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.360
So they launched this concept
called Idea Street, which is a

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.270
stock market for ideas.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.380
Anyone in the company can
propose a concept.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.840
And then people buy and sell
shares in that idea just like

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.970
in the stock market
to rank them.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.790
In the first 90 days, Idea
Street generated over 1,400

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.180
different concepts, different
ideas that were vetted by the

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.750
market and saved them 30
million pounds in cost

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:01.010
savings, just from the launch
of that idea, demonstrating

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.560
how you can do it.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.760
And when we talk about the
civil service, it's not

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.810
usually like idea
rich environment

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.720
in which we're operating.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.310
So it's particularly
challenging.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.320
Or another example that I really
like comes from the

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.750
University of Washington,
a project called Foldit.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.260
And some of you might be
familiar with this.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.060
But basically the premise is
in order to do advanced

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.920
disease intervention or drug
discovery, we have to be able

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.370
to understand the small protein
structures of the

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.100
world around us, like
DNA and RNA.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.740
But we can't actually do that
under a microscope, because we

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.600
don't have microscopes that can
see the structure clearly.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.020
So we do it through a process
of folding, where we model

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.900
them out and then use math
models to figure out whether

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.280
it's accurate or not.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.800
Now, the process of folding
is very time consuming.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.180
And it turns out that machines
are not very good at protein

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.150
folding, because they're not
very good at defining symmetry

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.460
without making mistakes.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.340
They're not terrible, but
they're not great.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.820
Humans, on the other hand,
are intuitively quite

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.620
good at this function.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.820
They're very good at finding
symmetry in things.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.960
So researchers at the University
of Washington took

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.350
their machine learning protein
folding product, called

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.350
Rosetta, and built a human based
protein folding game

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.490
called Foldit on top of it.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.400
And Foldit had a colossal
breakthrough just a little

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.030
over a year ago.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.920
Scientists had been working
for 15 years to solve this

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.820
elemental protein structure
in the fight against HIV.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.570
15 years, they've
been stumped.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.170
And Foldit players, 49,000
people playing Foldit, solved

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.340
that protein structure in 10
days that had stopped people

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.020
for 15 years.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.690
Now, what's super cool about it
is not that you can get a

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.850
community of people to engage
in a challenge.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:39.970
Because you can certainly
do that.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:40.370
You've seen that.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.140
You have SpaceShipOne hanging
in your foyer.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.110
You know that you can get
communities of people engaged

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.210
in a challenge.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.210
What's particularly exciting
about the Foldit example is

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.800
that 50% of the people who
played Foldit had no math or

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.560
science background whatsoever.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.020
They did this tough math and
science problem without

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.220
actually knowing how to do it,
without ever having receive

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.360
training for it.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.330
And it's a very, very
interesting case study.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.880
When you give people a sense
of purpose and you build a

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.490
game that's engaging or fun, you
can activate that smarter,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.790
better, faster element of
this evolving consumer.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.740
Or take the example of Nike.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.470
So many of you are familiar with
Nike+, a combination of

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.630
hardware and software device
that enables us

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.280
to track our movement.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.720
When Nike+ was first conceived
in 2004, Nike was not the top

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.990
choice for hard core runners.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.670
They were the second or
third shoe of choice

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:36.870
for a hard core runner.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.060
New Balance and Asics were much
more popular with the

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.170
hard core runner.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.690
And Nike, seeing the trend of
mobile technology, built

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.000
Nike+, which allows us to
keep track of how we do.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.690
Today, 5 million people will
use Nike+ to track their

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:53.820
performance.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.090
And what it's done is it's
changed the meaning of being a

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.140
sportswear and apparel
company.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.220
It's changed what Nike is
fundamentally, in a strategic

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.300
way, from the bottom up.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.429
It used to be a company that
sold footwear and shirts and

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.400
shorts and pants.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.049
And today, for those 5 million
people and the people who

00:34:14.049 --> 00:34:17.170
joined Nike+ and buy the fuel
band every single day, Nike's

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.510
a wish fulfillment company.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.610
Nike is a business.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.860
Nike is a brand that helps you
get where you want to go in

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.920
life, for real.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.440
Not just in advertising, not
just in Mad Men language, but

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.469
for real, every day.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.190
Every step you take along your
way, while you're sweating,

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.469
while you're aching, Nike is
there pushing you on, urging

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.449
you forward, telling
you to do better.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.000
They fulfill your dreams of
being who you want to be.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.710
And oh by the way, they sell
some shoes and apparel.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460
But the writing's on the wall.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.980
The future for that business is
as a software company, not

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.230
as a hardware company.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.910
At the heart, these examples and
the dozens of others that

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.720
we talk about in the
gamification revolution was

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.310
why I wrote this book.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.860
While so many people are sitting
around arguing about

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.310
whether or not the millennials
can be managed and trying to

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.590
figure out whether or not we can
adapt to the challenges of

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.530
the future, some businesses
already are.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.590
And they're using gamification
and those principles to gain a

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.910
strategic competitive advantage
over others.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.210
They're dominating markets.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.590
They're transforming the
definition of their businesses

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.480
and some non-profits and
governments, as well, as

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.275
you've seen, by using these
concepts of gamification.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.620
So that's the contents
of my book.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.560
And we also built for the book
the world's first gamified

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.960
social reading application
called ReadSocial, which you

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.440
can download for free if you get
a copy of the book and see

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.670
a new way of engaging
with this content.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:53.960
So for many people, the concept
of gamification was a

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.770
sort of tactical idea.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.830
It's like, oh, we've got this
little engagement problem we

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.950
need to solve.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.860
Let's put some game
processing on it.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.840
Let's sprinkle game
sugar on it.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.580
Let's get it more gamey and
then the problems will

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.190
magically solve themselves.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:10.120
And the point of this
gamification revolution, the

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.170
point of the book, and the
point of this work is to

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.480
highlight that this has ceased
to be a tactical environment.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.340
This is starting to be a
strategic environment, one in

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.640
which companies that acknowledge
this new consumer

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.350
gain a significant advantage.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.800
And so one of the most frequent
questions, of course,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.880
in all that I've been
talking about--

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.050
I've been only talking about
these younger generation, this

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.730
next evolution of humanity.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.610
But it turns out, and this is
the bonus for all of us, the

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:41.880
techniques in gamification work
just as well on older

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.090
people, they're just
not begging for it.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.480
They're not sitting
around arguing

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.380
that it needs to happen.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.360
It's this new gamer generation
that's on the forefront,

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.990
that's pushing it forward, the
ones that are disconnecting

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.470
from the existing experiences.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.810
But everything that we do for
them, we can also do for the

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.390
older generations.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.390
And that's just a big bonus.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:06.960
So as we look forward, as I look
forward over the next few

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.820
years and look at this shift in
society, it strikes me that

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.060
what we all need to do is we all
need to start connecting

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.100
with this idea that the next
human is here, they

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.810
walk among us now.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.470
Many of you are them.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.840
And some of you have
them as children.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.850
They're a new kind of person
with a new and special skill.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:33.920
They're intimately connected to
the technologies that many

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.340
of you have built and our
parents built and the world is

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.210
delivering.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.740
They've adopted, based on those
technologies, from the

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.190
kind of people that we were
to the kind of people

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.490
that we will be.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:50.000
And we stand in between two
kinds of humans, one based on

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.550
the old model where technology
was a nice to have and one

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.880
based on the new model where
technology is the context

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.300
through which we interact with
ourselves and with each other.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.360
And in the context of this
inescapable conclusion for me,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.440
we find that it's necessary
for us to start, I think,

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.720
embracing this idea,
internalizing the notion of

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.790
how we connect with that
particular consumer, that next

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.740
person, that next member of
society, whatever they may be.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:27.080
And to remember that while we
may think of some of them as

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.590
needing our help, needing our
assistance, needing medicine,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:36.220
needing remediation, needing
their support, maybe it's us

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.610
that needs the help.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:43.980
Maybe it's the slow, gray world
that we come from into

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.510
the bright, shiny feedback
friends and fun filled world

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:52.580
that we're entering that's the
one that needs to be fixed,

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.020
the one that needs
to be helped.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.160
And so I hope that this will
be something that all of us

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.470
can feel as a potential
opportunity for you in your

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.950
business, for you in your
career, for the world that we

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.400
live in and that you'll join
me in this amazing, amazing

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.660
journey as we gamify
the world.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.020
Thank you.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:24.486
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:24.486 --> 00:39:27.830
AUDIENCE: So one of the things
that always interests me is

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:31.350
keeping users motivated,
particularly in algorithms

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.370
wrapping a human into it.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.610
What are some of the ways that
you've seen that people are

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.060
using motivational systems to
keep users engaged for long

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.080
terms without any kind of cliff
at the end, where they

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.530
just lose interest and stop
playing the game?

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.010
GABE ZICHERMANN: So it's not
possible to design an

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:55.080
experience that is a perpetual
motion machine for engagement.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.140
We don't have the ability to
write one set of code that

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:04.380
will forever be interesting to
people, because one of the

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.670
characteristics of people--

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.920
not even this new generation
of consumer that I've been

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.510
talking, but all people--

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.490
is that we quickly habituate
to stimuli.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.610
So just so that we could put the
science into context, it

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.430
just came out.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.400
The research was published
recently, I think, in

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.910
"Science." And they wrote it up
in the "New York Times." So

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.800
they said that the average
romantic relationship between

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.650
people spend two years in a
state of romantic affection.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.300
And then after about two years,
switches to become

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.280
companionship affection.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.900
So we stop waking up every day
going, oh my god, my partner's

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.190
so amazing and start waking up
every day and going, OK, we

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:47.830
got to take the kids
to school.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.780
I'm glad this person is here.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.430
So romance shifts to
companionship.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.310
Now, many couples when they
encounter that transition,

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.080
they feel badly about
themselves.

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.570
Because they're like, I somehow
failed in this.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.560
My relationship is no longer as
hot and fresh and exciting

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.090
as it was before.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.070
The science behind that
is called habituation.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.520
And all of your human senses,
your brain is wired to

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.430
eventually habituate to stimuli,
that is to say, to

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.630
normalize stimuli.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.160
Think about why that's important
evolutionarily.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.500
Like a really bad smell, if you
didn't habituate to it,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.380
but it was perpetual,
you'd go crazy.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.640
Background noise, if you don't
learn habituate to that kind

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.240
of background noise,
you'd go crazy.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.780
Right now, if a caveman was
unfrozen and became a lawyer

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.630
and showed up here,
they would note--

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.120
It's an SNL joke.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:43.030
They would note that there was a
loud hum in the room, like a

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.290
very loud machine hum,
because they've

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:46.440
never heard that before.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.360
We don't hear it anymore,
because we've

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.160
habituated to it.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.900
But it's all around
you all the time.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.550
So habituation is the enemy of
long term engagement design.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.930
Every time a stimulus is
presented and is presented

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.120
over and over again, eventually
people become

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.900
immune to it.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.320
One technique is to do what's
called operant conditioning,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.410
which is slot machine effect.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.580
If you can never predict the
reward, ever, in any way, and

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:16.010
you can't predict its timing or
its size or its frequency,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:18.830
then in theory, you'll be
forever pressing a pedal

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.790
trying to get that
thing to happen.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:25.500
But people even find
that disturbing.

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.880
So the key is whatever you're
going to do to design long

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.380
term engagement for users
requires you to design it in

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.490
the long term.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.980
Design it early, middle,
and late game.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.360
Continue to invest in it.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.800
Continue to evolve
it over time.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.810
They're clearly some games like
Nike+ which continue to

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.360
be played over the long term.
"World of Warcraft" is played

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.370
over the long term.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.290
But make no mistake
that those are

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.990
continuously being expanded.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.030
Those are continuously
being evolved.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.046
They're always being changed
and updated.

00:42:54.575 --> 00:42:56.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
your talk today.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.645
GABE ZICHERMANN: Thank
you for being here.

00:42:57.645 --> 00:42:59.370
AUDIENCE: I have basically
two questions.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.760
So the first line is, are there
any types of problems

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.250
where you would not
encourage to use

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.270
gamification to solve them?

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.760
And the second one is around the
mechanics of gamification.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.250
What are the good sources--
maybe, I'm not sure.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.200
I just bought your book.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.490
I'm not sure if you talk
about it in the book.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:21.110
What are the components of
a gamification strategy?

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.600
What are the attributes and
how do you combine them to

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.795
gamify a problem?

00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:29.330
GABE ZICHERMANN: So your second
question, I'll do the

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.280
mechanics first.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.440
So there is a kind of
methodology that I've laid out

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.610
in "Gamification by Design,"
which steps through how we

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.880
gamify something.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.430
And I don't think that there's
one cookie cutter actual set

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.830
of mechanics that you can use.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.080
I don't think we could say,
do a, then b, then c.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.980
We can't build a repeating
algorithm to make gamification

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.990
work every time.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:55.080
Because in practice, whenever
we do that, it ends up

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.140
becoming kind of boring.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:58.420
So everyone has the
same thing.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.270
And then nobody cares
about it anymore.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.710
So you have to be original.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:07.030
But you can use a methodology
to go about process of

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.540
designing gamification.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.450
And it probably won't surprise
you to know that we use

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.020
gamification to design
gamification.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.750
So it's a little meta,
but a lot of fun.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.500
And if you get a chance, I
do them live workshops.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.830
I do them in the books.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:26.500
Also, we have some online
resources that you can follow

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:26.810
to help you.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.230
So visit gamification.co.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.800
It's got some great resources
for the mechanics.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.160
The second question, like
situations where we don't use

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.120
or shouldn't use gamification,
or where it doesn't work.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.430
So I get asked this
question a lot.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.670
And I usually give one answer,
but I want to give you a

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:43.470
different answer.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.220
GABE ZICHERMANN: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.940
Why not?

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.190
So here's the thing.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.750
I've tried to of express this
probably a couple different

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:57.220
ways today.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.390
So I just want to go back
to it for a second.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.800
I don't really think that
there's any situation in which

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.360
we shouldn't be thinking
about how to gamify it.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.430
Because every single idea,
concept, product, business in

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:14.750
the world lives or dies by
its consumer engagement.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.150
Everything.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.900
I tend to describe it as
a last mile problem.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.557
It is the last mile problem of
every idea, especially in

00:45:22.557 --> 00:45:23.400
technology.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.510
You've got a great concept, an
amazing product, just like the

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.100
other 5 million people here in
the valley coming up with

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.700
their great ideas, launching
their problem products.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.940
And where do they all
end up failing?

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.920
They all end up feeling because
they're not able to

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.500
get user adoption.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.250
That's where we have
the last mile part.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.250
It's not we don't have great
ideas, because we have lots of

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.260
great ideas.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.400
It's that we don't have methods
for actually getting

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.940
people to do that thing.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.620
And no matter how good our ideas
are, if people don't do

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.580
that thing, then our idea
isn't worth squat.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.060
It turns out that engagement
behavior change, itself, is

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.140
actually, I think, the currency
on which companies

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.910
are priced.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.480
So the more businesses are able
to change behavior and

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.020
the more you in your own career
are able to touch your

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.360
examples of behavior change,
the more people

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.220
will pay for you.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.980
That's what they're
paying for.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.360
You can call it traffic.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.130
But the discussion is shifting
from traffic to engagement.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.930
And that's the currency of our--
the coin of the realm,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.530
if you will.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.860
So gamify everything.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.430
And probably, you won't
have a choice, p.s.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:32.680
That's the other piece of it.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:39.330
This next consumer isn't going
to care unless the experience

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.990
has feedback, friends,
and fun.

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.020
They're just not
going to care.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.700
Just ignore it.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.670
Oh, this doesn't have enough
fun in it, so I'm

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.380
not going to do it.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.500
And I don't care how good it
is for me or how good it is

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:50.940
for the world.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.100
It's got to of have feedback,
friends, and fun.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.800
AUDIENCE: My question is,
I do a lot of coaching.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:01.060
And they've trained us to do
games in the practicing.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.260
So we play baseball.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.180
And instead of just playing
catch with them,

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.130
you have this game.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:05.822
So they designed this game.

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:06.810
They're running this game.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.990
So my question is, the game,
I didn't realize, was so

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:12.170
exciting by the players.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.990
But have you seen things we
need to watch for on the--

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.850
So the goal is to make sure they
play well in the game,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:24.050
the actual game, not
the practice game.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.540
Do I need to watch out for--

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.310
So there's a lot of feedback in
that practice game you do

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.190
for ground balls.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:34.510
But will it to translate into
when they have their game?

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:35.530
Because baseball's
kind of slow.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:35.990
GABE ZICHERMANN: It
is kind of slow.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.000
AUDIENCE: It's a one person
kind of thing.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.710
And when we play this game, it's
like they're so active.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.940
And they're cheering
on each other.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.090
But in the game, you're
kind of, you know--

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.740
GABE ZICHERMANN: So there's a
lot of interesting research on

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.700
how to design feedback loops
for optimal outcomes.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.140
And there's no clear answer
for how to do that.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:59.450
There's not one ring to rule
them all when it comes to how

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.983
to design a feedback loop.

00:48:02.983 --> 00:48:04.050
AUDIENCE: One of the
question is--

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.265
So we're getting the feedback
in the game practicing.

00:48:07.265 --> 00:48:11.020
But in the actual, when we
want them to perform--

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.410
GABE ZICHERMANN: What's the
purpose of a practice game?

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.965
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's not
a practice game.

00:48:14.965 --> 00:48:17.510
It's just this, for
the ground balls.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:18.640
They line up.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.660
And we throw ground
balls to them.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.560
They get points.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.000
GABE ZICHERMANN: Why?

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.513
AUDIENCE: They find it fun.

00:48:23.513 --> 00:48:25.430
GABE ZICHERMANN: Are you doing
it because they find it fun or

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:27.190
are you doing it because
that will improve their

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.475
performance?

00:48:27.475 --> 00:48:28.940
AUDIENCE: We want them to
improve their performance in

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.570
the actual game.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:30.200
GABE ZICHERMANN: OK.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.500
AUDIENCE: So I wonder, like
in the game, it's so slow.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.510
In the actual game, it's so
slow, they might not even get

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.280
the chance to actually
catch a ground ball.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.490
GABE ZICHERMANN: Right?

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:42.610
AUDIENCE: They perform lower
in the real situation.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.640
GABE ZICHERMANN: So a
couple quick things.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.950
One is, if you're going to
design a proxy experience for

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.900
people, so you let's say you
were designing a simulator to

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.020
simulate being a pilot.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.340
Many of you have seen
those aircraft

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.820
simulators on TV or movies.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.060
Some of you have probably
been in one.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.080
It's kind of awesome.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.530
I really want to go in one.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.620
So that simulator has to
be super realistic.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:07.745
That simulator cannot be
partially realistic.

00:49:07.745 --> 00:49:10.700
It can't suffer from, what's
called the uncanny valley,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.060
which some of you might know
from game design, where you

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.770
get something that looks and
feels a lot like reality, but

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:18.890
then isn't reality.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.510
So you sit there spending a lot
of your energy figuring

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.840
out, is it real or isn't it,
instead of just being in the

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.210
experience, or constantly
being pulled in and out.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.200
If you build a simulator to
simulate the experiences that

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.560
somebody's supposed to have in
real life and that simulator

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.815
is better than real life, why do
you think that people would

00:49:34.815 --> 00:49:37.380
want to do the thing in real
life, as much as they would

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.760
want to do the simulator?

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.630
So that's a genuine issue.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.880
It's similar to the nuclear
plant manager thought example

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.760
that I gave you earlier, which
is you do this exciting

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.660
training thing.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.110
And the actual thing
a sort of boring.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.730
So one piece of advice
I would give is, make

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.640
baseball more exciting.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.230
We could all benefit from that,
if that's within your

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.770
power to do.

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.600
If it's not within your power
to do, I would look for ways

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:11.460
to make that simulation more
like actual baseball and maybe

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.200
put people on different tracks
depending on their actual

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.110
skill level.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:19.030
So if they are more highly
skilled and more highly

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:24.620
motivated, maybe they will be
fine doing the high speed

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.710
practice, because they're being
driven to play that

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:31.900
other game a different way
versus your average player or

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.920
below average player, for whom
as soon as the attention

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.900
shifts out of the--

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.770
They drop out of attention,
they're not going to be

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:41.310
engaged anymore.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:44.190
I'd like to see your new
baseball, Baseball 2.0.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.566
I might even play it.

00:50:46.566 --> 00:50:47.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.716
GABE ZICHERMANN: Thank you.

00:50:48.716 --> 00:50:51.360
AUDIENCE: In terms of enterprise
gamification, what

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.850
are the most common stumbling
blocks you've seen, maybe in

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.295
your consulting work, where
do things go wrong or

00:50:57.295 --> 00:51:00.450
where do they fail?

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.270
GABE ZICHERMANN: So the biggest
mistake that companies

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.220
make all the time, this
happens all the time.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.440
So it's like a company will be
like, alright well, we, want

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.540
to gamify an employee
interaction, because we're

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:13.790
trying to improve throughput,
improve outcomes, whatever.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.750
So my first question to them is
always, how are you going

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.750
to get them to use it?

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.660
Because 4/5 of enterprise
software implementations fail,

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.100
more or less.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.100
So how are you going to get
people to use this thing?

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.530
And typically, especially if
it's HR driven, the company

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.480
will say, well, they're
going to have to do.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.500
So by Fiat, that's the method
for delivering new software.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.120
And the truth is, people don't
like being told what to do.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.850
It doesn't matter how
fun the game is.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.120
If I preface my gamify solution
by saying, you must

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.200
play this game, you're probably
going to be like, no,

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.450
not so much.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.450
So that's a really
big mistake.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:52:00.520
We have to make enterprise
engagement design to the same

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.210
standards as consumer
engagement.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.020
You'd never try to get
your customers to do

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.170
something like that.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.330
Why get your employees to
do something like that?

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.030
And the more we start to
realize, and I talk about this

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.830
in the evolution of this
consumer point, that same

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:17.510
person who's just as distracted
by their smartphone

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.690
at home, who can't watch--

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:21.560
Crazy stat.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:26.020
The last month, 80% of the
American population has

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.990
watched television with a second
or third screen open

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.850
while watching.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:37.530
Now, it wasn't that long ago
that TV was the distraction.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:40.930
And now, we need a distraction
from the distraction just to

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.230
feel like our brains
are functioning.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:45.000
Are you frustrated at the movies
when you go that you

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.160
can't open your phone?

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:46.520
I am.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.390
I think about it all the time.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.750
It's like, I want to do
something, but I have to just

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:50.900
watch this movie.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:59.150
And so set against that
backdrop, why would employees

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.880
suddenly not become normal
humans when they walk through

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.880
the door at work?

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.170
What is it about the walking
through the doorway at the

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.050
office that suddenly makes
them not distracted, that

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.030
suddenly makes the not
hedonistic, that suddenly

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:14.950
makes them not want to follow
feedback, friends, and fun?

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:18.130
Nothing, p.s.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.950
Historically, we've
depended on this.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:26.280
We've all been part of this
shared delusion that the

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.410
office is somehow not
like the free market

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:29.890
for people's attention.

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.490
And in practice, it's
no different.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:34.890
So to build successful
enterprise gamification, you

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.110
have to start thinking about
your employees as consumers,

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.470
think about them in the same
context as consumers, and

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.620
design that experience with
that same idea in mind.

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.910
My question is, can you use
gamification to actually

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:50.950
reduce engagement, like to
addictions or products like

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.386
that, which you actually
would like to--

00:53:52.386 --> 00:53:52.790
GABE ZICHERMANN: Yes.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.210
In fact, two of the most
successful examples of

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:00.510
gamification are Alcoholics
Anonymous and Weight Watchers,

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.610
both of which are behavior
cessation games.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.960
And in fact, Weight Watchers
employs a fair number of game

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.880
designers to tweak
the design of it.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.770
And they're two of the most
successful behavior cessation

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:11.410
systems in the world.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:16.490
They have many of the same core
design principles of the

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.160
other gamified examples that
we've talked about.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.350
So they've got points.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.330
And they've got badges.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.190
And they have levels.

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:22.440
And they've got achievements
and some

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.730
degree of leader boards.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:26.250
So they've got all
the mechanics.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:30.260
But what makes them especially
powerful is that they're all

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.730
about helping people
achieve mastery.

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.960
And any time you design your
experience, something

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.220
gamified, we spend a lot of
time talking about helping

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.430
people achieve mastery, how
gamification drives mastery.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.120
And the more you're able to
drive mastery in people, the

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.790
more loyalty they give you,
the more control they give

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.510
you, the more confidence they
impart in your system.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:57.830
So basically, if you give
somebody the mastery over

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.610
something that they want
to control, they're

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.820
loyal to you forever.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.100
So consider this.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:04.740
You run into somebody
on the street.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.900
You haven't seen them
in five years.

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.490
You're like, oh my god,
you look amazing.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.450
You've lost so much weight.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.300
You look amazing.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.280
They turn to you and they're
like, oh yeah, I did it at

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.520
Weight Watchers.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:17.060
How'd you do it?

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.050
Weight Watchers.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.810
But it's not Weight Watchers.

00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.500
You actually had to do
diet and exercise.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.550
The person did the work.

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.250
They did the work, the same work
that everybody else does.

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:30.310
They just used Weight Watchers
as the system to do it.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:33.620
When the system delivers
mastery, people will replace

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.430
their sense of self
accomplishment with the system

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.860
as the identity.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.770
They do that all the time.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.260
That's its kind of
loyalty side.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.460
So you can change behavior when
people want to change

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:48.610
their behavior by using
those systems.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:52.190
If your question was whether,
can you force people to change

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:53.910
their behavior?

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:55.200
It depends on whether
or not you believe

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.010
people have free will.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.410
If you believe they have free
will, then you cannot force

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:02.500
them to do anything.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:06.720
If you don't believe they have
free will, then you can

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.600
certainly force them to
do certain things.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.910
AUDIENCE: So seguing from
addiction, all of these seem

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:15.460
to be about moving people who
aren't already addicted to

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.650
gamification process
into this process.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.640
What do you do when people's
limited engagement is maxed

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.810
out on all these things
we've built, these

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:24.730
feedback cycles for--

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.650
Like, how do you make them do
Foldit instead of more cow

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:31.005
tipping on Facebook?

00:56:31.005 --> 00:56:34.450
GABE ZICHERMANN: Well, I think
it's just an arms race.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:38.520
So just like everything else
that you have to do, any other

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.420
kind of behavior change or user
engagement system, over

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.800
time they lose their efficacy.

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.360
And you have to overcome
their habituation.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.160
Thankfully today, the market
is more wide open than you

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:49.590
would think.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:53.990
Even in writing "Gamification
Revolution," where we were

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:55.490
researching and looking at
these companies that were

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:57.420
really doing this strategically,
that were

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.920
really crushing the competition
with gamification,

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.680
there's not that
many examples.

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.910
It's like we had 500 examples
to choose from.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.350
We didn't have that many
where they're really

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.360
doing it that well.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.670
So one of the things about
gamification is it's a

00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:14.390
relatively new trend with
pretty deep roots.

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:16.280
And because we're in the tech
business, we've heard the term

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.050
for three years.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.140
And we're like, oh everyone's
doing it.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.760
But look around Google.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.790
How much of it is actually
being done?

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.560
Some of it is like conceptual
people want to do it.

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.900
Sometimes we dipped our toe
in the water somewhere.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.810
But not that many companies are
actually doing it doing

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:33.700
it, deliberately doing
it, purposefully.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.890
So the market is still fairly
open in most categories.

00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:39.530
And I would say even in
categories where gamification

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:41.240
has been particularly
successful, like

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.780
the wellness category--

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.070
I challenge you to find a
wellness startup in the last

00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.450
two years that isn't a

00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:50.520
gamification-based wellness startup.

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.980
It's hard to find one.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.440
Even in the wellness category
like the best performer, Nike+

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.640
arguably, or RunKeeper or
Fitbit, one of those, none of

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.802
them are A plusses.

00:58:01.802 --> 00:58:04.020
Not to be critical, but none of
them have knocked it out of

00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.000
the ballpark.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.360
Nike+ is great, but it's
5 million people.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.870
But it's 5 million people.

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:11.430
It's not 500 million people.

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:13.110
So we still have work to do.

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.510
We've still got a
long way to go.

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:17.700
I won't stand up here
and tell you that I

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.790
have all the answers.

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.460
What I have is clarity that
there's a real challenge.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.480
And it's going to require the
effort of all people doing

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.090
whatever it is that they're
doing to lean into actually

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.340
make that a reality.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.160
Thanks to you.

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.100
Awesome.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:37.950
Thank you so much.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.030
And if you're a Twitter person,
you can chat with me

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:42.560
on Twitter.

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.910
I'm @gzicherm.

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:44.560
Thank you everybody.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.020
I really appreciate it.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.270
Thank you.
