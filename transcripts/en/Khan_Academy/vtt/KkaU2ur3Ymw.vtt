00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
 

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.940
What I want to do in
this video is review much

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.510
of what we've already talked
about and then hopefully build

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.730
some of the intuition on
why we divide by n minus 1

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.180
if we want to have an unbiased
estimate of the population

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.290
variance when we're calculating
the sample variance.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.490
So let's think
about a population.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.890
So let's say this is the
population right over here.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
And it is of size
capital N. And we also

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.900
have a sample of
that population,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.710
so a sample of that population.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.470
And in its size, we have
lowercase n data points.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.280
So let's think about all of
the parameters and statistics

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.820
that we know about so far.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.320
So the first is the idea
of the mean, of the mean.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.270
So if we're trying to calculate
the mean for the population,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.574
is that going to be a
parameter or a statistic?

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.990
Well, when we're trying to
calculate it on the population,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.120
we are calculating a parameter.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.350
We are calculating a parameter.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.240
So let me write this down.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.370
So this is going to be--
so for the population we

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.430
are calculating a parameter.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.260
It is a parameter.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.130
And when we calculate, when we
attempt to calculate something

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.520
for a sample we would call
that a statistic-- statistic.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200
So how do we think about
the mean for a population?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.510
Well, first of all, we denote
it with the Greek letter mu.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.630
And we essentially take every
data point in our population.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.722
So we take the sum
of every data point.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.180
So we start at the
first data point

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.430
and we go all the way to
the capital Nth data point.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.290
So every data point we add up.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.340
So this is the i-th
data point, so x

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.610
sub 1 plus x sub 2 all the
way to x sub capital N.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.020
And then we divide by the total
number of data points we have.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.500
Well, how do we calculate
the sample mean?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.240
Well, the sample mean--
we do a very similar thing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
with the sample.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.040
And we denote it with
a x with a bar over it.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.160
And that's going to be taking
every data point in the sample,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.824
so going up to a lower
case n, adding them up

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:15.365
--so these are the sum of all
the data points in our sample--

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.600
and then dividing by
the number of data

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.890
points that we actually had.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.650
Now, the other thing
that we're trying

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.020
to calculate for the population,
which was a parameter,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.130
and then we'll also try to
calculate it for the sample

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.010
and estimate it
for the population,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.620
was the variance, which was
a measure of how dispersed

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.180
or how much of the data
points vary from the mean.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.810
So let's write variance
right over here.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.630
And how do we denote
any calculate variance

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.150
for a population?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.490
Well, for population, we'd
say that the variance --we

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.190
use a Greek letter sigma
squared-- is equal to--

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.530
and you can view it as the
mean of the squared distances

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.050
from the population mean.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.310
But what we do is we
take, for each data point,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.790
so i equal 1 all
the way to n, we

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.406
take that data point, subtract
from it the population mean.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.780
So if you want to
calculate this,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.220
you'd want to figure this out.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.150
Well, that's one way to do it.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.733
We'll see there's
other ways to do it,

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:18.750
where you can calculate
them at the same time.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.150
But the easiest or
the most intuitive

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.000
is to calculate this first,
then for each of the data points

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.160
take the data point and
subtract it from that,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.850
subtract the mean
from that, square it,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.300
and then divide by the total
number of data points you have.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.520
Now, we get to the interesting
part-- sample variance.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.040
There's are several ways-- where
when people talk about sample

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.020
variance, there's several
tools in their toolkits

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.290
or there's several
ways to calculate it.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.492
One way is the biased
sample variance,

00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:55.360
the non unbiased estimator
of the population variance.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.250
And that's denoted,
usually denoted, by s

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.510
with a subscript n.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.109
And what is the biased
estimator, how we calculate it?

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.650
Well, we would calculate it very
similar to how we calculated

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.858
the variance right over here.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:12.620
But what we would do it for
our sample, not our population.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.040
So for every data point in our
sample --so we have n of them--

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.470
we take that data point.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.570
And from it, we subtract
our sample mean.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.860
We subtract our sample
mean, square it,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.889
and then divide by the number
of data points that we have.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.930
But we already talked
about it in the last video.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.390
How would we find-- what is
our best unbiased estimate

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.850
of the population variance?

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.910
This is usually what
we're trying to get at.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.440
We're trying to find an unbiased
estimate of the population

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.810
variance.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.326
Well, in the last video,
we talked about that,

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.950
if we want to have
an unbiased estimate

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.620
--and here, in
this video, I want

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.370
to give you a sense
of the intuition why.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.530
We would take the sum.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.471
So we're going to go through
every data point in our sample.

00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:56.970
We're going to take
that data point,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.430
subtract from it the
sample mean, square that.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.940
But instead of dividing by
n, we divide by n minus 1.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.140
We're dividing by
a smaller number.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.230
We're dividing by
a smaller number.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.180
And when you divide
by a smaller number,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.870
you're going to
get a larger value.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.620
So this is going to be larger.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.470
This is going to be smaller.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.955
And this one, we refer
to the unbiased estimate.

00:05:25.955 --> 00:05:28.940
 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.480
And this one, we refer
to the biased estimate.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.750
If people just
write this, they're

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.255
talking about the
sample variance.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.130
It's a good idea to
clarify which one they're

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.759
talking about.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.550
But if you had to guess
and people give you

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.970
no further information,
they're probably

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.530
talking about the unbiased
estimate of the variance.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.050
So you'd probably
divide by n minus 1.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.390
But let's think about why
this estimate would be biased

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.017
and why we might want to have
an estimate like that is larger.

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:01.600
And then maybe in the future,
we could have a computer program

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.960
or something that really
makes us feel better,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.710
that dividing by
n minus 1 gives us

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.640
a better estimate of the
true population variance.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.320
So let's imagine all the
data in a population.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.530
And I'm just going to plot
them on number a line.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.020
So this is my number line.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.700
This is my number line.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.960
And let me plot all the data
points in my population.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.780
So this is some data.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.620
This is some data.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.710
Here's some data.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.260
And here is some data here.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.400
And I can just do as
many points as I want.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.750
So these are just points
on the number line.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.160
Now, let's say I take
a sample of this.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.924
So this is my entire population.

00:06:40.924 --> 00:06:41.840
So let's see how many.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.640
I have 1 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.940
So in this case, what
would be my big N?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.090
My big N would be 14.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.480
Big N would be 14.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.750
Now, let's say I take a sample,
a lowercase n of-- let's say

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.400
my sample size is 3.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.450
I could take-- well, before
I even think about that,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.900
let's think about roughly where
the mean of this population

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.430
would sit.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.846
So the way I drew
it --and I'm not

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:12.490
going to calculate
exactly-- it looks

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.030
like the mean might sit some
place roughly right over here.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.180
So the mean, the
true population mean,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.200
the parameter's going
to sit right over here.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.440
Now, let's think about what
happens when we sample.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.900
And I'm going to do just a
very small sample size just

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.316
to give us the
intuition, but this

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:29.800
is true of any sample size.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.310
So let's say we have
sample size of 3.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.170
So there is some
possibility, when

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.410
we take our sample size of 3,
that we happen to sample it

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.630
in a way that our sample mean is
pretty close to our population

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.130
mean.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.090
So for example, if we sampled
to that point, that point,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.290
and that point, I could imagine
in our sample mean might

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.130
actually said pretty
close, pretty close

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.440
to our population mean.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.810
But there's a
distinct possibility,

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.490
there's a distinct
possibility, that maybe when

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.660
I take a sample, I
sample that and that.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.960
And the key idea here is
when you take a sample,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.170
your sample mean is always
going to sit within your sample.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.670
And so there is a possibility
that when you take your sample,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.282
your mean could even be
outside of the sample.

00:08:18.282 --> 00:08:19.740
And so in this
situation-- and this

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.860
is just to give
you an intuition.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.276
So here, your
sample mean is going

00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:26.980
to be sitting
someplace in there.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.120
And so if you were to just
calculate the distance

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.110
from each of this points to the
sample mean --so this distance,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.510
that distance,
and you square it,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.801
and you were to divide by
the number of data points you

00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.330
have-- this is
going to be a much

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.600
lower estimate than the true
variance the true variance,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.520
from the actual population mean,
where these things are much,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.979
much, much further.

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:49.520
Now, you're always not going to
have the true population mean

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.570
outside of your sample.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.490
But it's possible that you do.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.710
So in general, when you
just take your points,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.490
find the squared distance
to your sample mean, which

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.730
is always going to sit
inside of your data

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.230
even though the true population
mean could be outside of it,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.081
or it could be at
one end of your data,

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.830
however, you might
want to think about it,

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.820
you are likely to
be underestimating,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.400
you're likely to
be underestimating

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.510
the true population variance.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.665
So this right over here is an
underestimate-- underestimate.

00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:21.530
And it does turn out that
if you just-- instead

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.940
of dividing by n, you
divide by n minus 1,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.510
you'll get a slightly
larger sample variance.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.937
And this is an
unbiased estimate.

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.520
In the next video --and I might
not to get to it immediately--

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.040
I would like to generate some
type of a computer program

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.730
that is more convincing that
this is a better estimate,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.080
this is a better estimate
of the population variance

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.230
than this is.
