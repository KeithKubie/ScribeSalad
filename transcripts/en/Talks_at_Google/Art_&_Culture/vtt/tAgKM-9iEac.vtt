00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:08.930
MISTRAL MYERS: Nathan's the
founder and executive director

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.090
of the nonprofit
I'm From Driftwood,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.440
which you'll be
hearing about today,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.180
which is an online archive of
first person LGBTQ stories.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.260
In 2011, Manske completed a four
month 50 state story collection

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.320
tour, ensuring that I'm
From Driftwood stories

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.230
represented people from
all across the country.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.360
The stories on
I'm From Driftwood

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.690
are used by family counselors
as well as educators

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.990
to aid them in their work, and
I'm From Driftwood's newest

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.080
program, which is
called What Was It Like,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.920
documents stories from LGBTQ
elders, which, as you know,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.590
is something that we have also
been looking at in the Gayglers

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.700
is understanding how to better
serve older LGBTQ folks.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.320
Matthew grew up in Driftwood,
Texas, hence the name

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.350
I'm From Driftwood, where
one of his weekly chores

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.870
was burning trash in a
burn barrel, which I really

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.190
want to hear about.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.770
He now lives in Brooklyn
where he sorts and recycles.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.810
Thank you for saving the planet.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.330
So, Nathan, tell
us a little bit now

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.820
that we know a little bit about
you about I'm From Driftwood.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.750
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah,
next month in March

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.620
is actually going to be our
nine year anniversary, which

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.870
we're very excited about.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.720
The idea came to me from
after watching the film

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.636
"Milk" in 2008 with Sean
Penn, and I saw the film

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:33.260
on a Wednesday, and
Thursday morning, I

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.900
was thinking about a
photograph of Harvey Milk.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.810
And in the photograph,
he's sitting

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.390
on the hood of the car in the
San Francisco pride march,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.900
and he's holding a big
sign, and the sign,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.870
all it said was "I'm
from Woodmere, New York."

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.230
And I was just thinking about
that photo over and over again

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.600
and asking myself like,
why is Harvey Milk--

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.330
everyone associates him with
San Francisco, this big queer

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.040
mecca.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040
But he's not from there.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.860
He's sitting here proclaiming
that he's from this town that--

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.390
we're in New York, so some
people might know where it is,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.520
but most people don't
know where Woodmere is.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.050
And that really
resonated with me

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.600
because I'm not from
Brooklyn or New York.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.550
I'm from Driftwood, Texas.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.590
And I feel like that
message of you're

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.070
not alone no matter where
you are would have meant

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.680
a lot to me growing
up in Driftwood where

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.420
my main issue was isolation.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.980
I didn't feel like--

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.050
or I did feel like I was the
only gay person in the world.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.962
So that message of
you're not alone

00:02:26.962 --> 00:02:28.170
would have meant a lot to me.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.660
So I wanted to take that message
out there through storytelling.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.590
And at the time, I was working
in advertising as a copywriter,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.660
and I was worried that I
wouldn't have time to do this.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.890
And so to recap, I saw
"Milk" on Wednesday.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.490
I thought of the
idea on Thursday.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.420
Friday, I went into my
job, and I was laid off.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.350
So I suddenly had all the time
in the world to, you know.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.379
It was late 2008,
height of the recession.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.670
So there was little chance
to get a new job right away.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.820
So I put everything I had
into it, told all my friends.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.410
Everyone rallied around
me and helped launch

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.540
three months after thinking
of the idea in March 2009.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.489
So, yeah, that's
how it came to be.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.530
MISTRAL MYERS: Very cool.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.590
All from a photograph.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.410
So tell us a little bit
about what I'm From Driftwood

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.050
seeks to do.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.354
What is the project about?

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:20.270
NATHAN MANSKE: It at its
core is about sending

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.030
that message of you're not
alone through storytelling,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.360
and something really
interesting happened early on.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.830
We started as just
written stories.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.050
So anyone could write a
story-- and still can--

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.340
and submit their written story.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.260
But it started really to help
queer youth in smaller towns.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.090
That was my singular focus.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.770
And after launching
the site, we started

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.660
getting all this feedback
from people letting

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.314
us know what the
stories meant to them,

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:45.230
and it wasn't just queer
youth in small towns.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.240
It was people here in Manhattan.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.760
It was people all over
the country and the world

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.180
letting us know that
just by hearing stories

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.330
from other people, whether
they connected with it or not,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.240
made them more empathetic
to other issues.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.502
And then, of course,
people did read stories

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:02.960
that they related
to, and it helped

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.520
them realize I'm not alone.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.080
And there were two
pieces of feedback

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.780
that we got very early on
which made us realize that we

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.130
were on the right track.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.770
One was from a gay
teenager who said

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.400
seeing these stories made him
realize that he's not alone

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.140
and that they literally
saved his life just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.810
by realizing that
wherever he was

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.660
from that there are other
people like him out there.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.200
The other one was from somebody
who was almost 60, and he said,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.520
I thought I was the only one.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.160
I'm not, and I just came
out this past Christmas

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.090
at the age of 60.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.360
So once we realized that
we were making an impact

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320
across the entire spectrum,
we broadened our reach,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.950
but still with that message of
you're not alone, but no matter

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.310
who you are, where you
are, what age you are.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.990
So, yeah, that's really what we
are still, but with a broader

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.110
message.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.818
MISTRAL MYERS: That's
really interesting.

00:04:53.818 --> 00:04:55.670
So you spoke a little
bit about the impact

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.378
that it's had on a
couple of individuals.

00:04:57.378 --> 00:04:59.810
But can you speak more
broadly about the impact

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.670
that you feel the evolution
of this LGBTQ story archive

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.450
has had on your members'
readership, viewership?

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.630
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah, I had
an intern a few years ago,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.709
and I was still in
this mindset of--

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.250
especially since
we're a nonprofit so

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.570
we have to apply for funding
and all that fun stuff.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.030
And constantly, we're
having to tell people

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.400
what we're doing is
so important and why.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.450
And it was frustrating
and a little scary.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.490
I was like, I can't
answer this succinctly.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.190
Watch the story.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.773
You'll get it.

00:05:34.773 --> 00:05:38.360
But that's not an acceptable
answer on a grant application.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.570
So I gave this intern
this task of researching

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.540
why stories are so powerful
and why they increase empathy.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.472
We knew they did.

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:50.930
We have the feedback
to support it.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.240
But I didn't
understand why, and it

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.860
felt like I was just
grasping for air,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860
and I couldn't sink my
teeth into an answer.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.680
And what he came back with
was science, of course.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.459
There's something called mirror
neurons in everyone's brain,

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:08.000
and whenever you
tell a story, you're

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.450
activating mirror neurons
in that person's brain.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.550
So on a very
microscopic level, they

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.220
are experiencing the same
thing that you experienced.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.927
So if I tell you
a story, and let's

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:19.760
just say our lives are
completely different,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.340
and I tell you the story about
what it's like to grow up

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.970
gay in Driftwood, and
I tell a story well,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.600
then I'm activating those
mirror neurons in your brain,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.990
so that whenever you hear a
story like, ugh, I get it.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.140
I feel you.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.400
I'm in your shoes.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.030
The reason for that is
those mirror neurons.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.590
Since then, we have focused
more on telling stories well.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.256
So every single story
that we collect and share,

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:49.880
we make sure that
there is a story arc.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.470
There's a beginning,
middle, and end.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.240
There's a conflict
and a resolution

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.330
and all these traditional
storytelling components

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.930
that make a story so that we can
activate those mirror neurons.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.480
So we're basically
trying to control minds.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.630
[LAUGH]

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.380
MISTRAL MYERS: Just a
simple, simple task.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.860
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah,
nothing difficult.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.735
MISTRAL MYERS: Building
empathy in the world,

00:07:08.735 --> 00:07:11.540
changing people's minds
about things, no big deal.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.500
So how did the development
of I'm From Driftwood go?

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.180
Did it grow very, very quickly?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.550
Were you surprised
by the growth,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.410
or has it developed as a slow
burn over the time you've

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.400
been going?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.100
NATHAN MANSKE: It was a little
bit of a roller coaster.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.372
We launched just as a
website, and I didn't really

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:33.830
have this grand vision of what
it could become at the time.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.440
I just wanted to start
collecting and sharing stories.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.780
About a week after
launching, I was just

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.310
spending all my time emailing.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.400
This was 2008 or 2009.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.140
Everyone had a
blog at that time.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.140
It was a blog heavy
time on the internet.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.450
And there were a
lot of LGBT blogs,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.230
and I was just emailing every
LGBTQ blog that I could find.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.840
And a lot of them started
picking it up and sharing it,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.240
and we just got a
wave of stories.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.620
And soon after that, I had
a friend in Philadelphia--

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.330
his name is Marquise-- and I had
this idea of a little PR video

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.470
I wanted to do in New York.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.720
I was going to walk around
the city with a white board

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.428
and have people write
where they're from,

00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:15.560
just to get the
idea out there again

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.650
and another nod to that
photograph of Harvey Milk.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.450
And he would visit
New York frequently,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.440
and I told him this idea, and
he was like, oh, I'm into it.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.460
But how about we have
people tell you a story?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.220
And I'll film it and edit it.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.580
And I was resistant to it.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.530
I was like, that's not my idea.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.289
My idea was this PR video
that I want to send out

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.220
to help me in this outreach.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.960
But he was like, I'm
not interested in that.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.460
So there was a little--

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.280
and I was, OK, let's do some--

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.610
I don't know-- video stories.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.200
And he came to New York.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.520
We filmed two of them.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.330
And they not only
were a hit, they

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.520
are now the focus of
what I'm From Driftwood

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.600
what is today, which are these
weekly video stories that we

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.050
publish every Wednesday.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.240
So it was all
because of Marquise,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.540
who's now a board member.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.340
I was like, oh, you
have really good ideas.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.757
And so actually, do you
want to watch a video story?

00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:11.590
MISTRAL MYERS: Yeah.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.520
Yeah, let's do it.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.021
So we've got a couple of
videos here for you to see.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.770
So let me make sure
my clicker is working.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.153
There we go.

00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:21.162
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.620
- Hi, my name is
Matt Beierschmitt.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.660
I'm from Collinswood,
New Jersey.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:30.960
And when I was 15 years old,
I was on my family computer

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.270
talking on AOL
chat rooms and just

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.520
to meet people and
meet other guys

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.632
and unbeknownst to
the rest of my family.

00:09:37.632 --> 00:09:39.090
I'm in the
male-for-male chat room,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.400
and I'm talking to this guy.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.844
Back in the day, you maybe
got one picture from somebody.

00:09:45.844 --> 00:09:48.010
It took like five minutes
for one picture to upload.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.990
So you had to just
take what you can get.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm 15.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.270
He's probably like in his
30s, and no one knows my age.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.265
I'm telling him I'm older.

00:09:57.265 --> 00:10:01.170
This guy's very eager to
meet me and just giving me

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.050
negative vibes, but I'm
desperate to meet somebody.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.450
I wanted to just have a
connection with somebody.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.330
So I just have a really
weird feeling about him.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.260
So before I go to
meet him, I literally

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.690
have to sneak out of
my parents' house,

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.467
and I take a kitchen knife
with me just to be safe.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:20.550
And I thought that would--

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.994
it was one of those old
'80s wood-handled kitchen

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:25.410
knives that wouldn't
cut a carrot,

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.550
but I thought it
would kill somebody.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.650
So I take the kitchen
knife, go back to my room,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.460
and I sneak out my first story
window, hop to the ground,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.950
and I walk about a half mile
to this river near my parents'

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.450
house.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.570
Told the guy what I was wearing,
and we agreed on the time

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.070
to meet.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.880
And no cell phones, so
you have to tell them,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.129
I'll meet you at this time,
and you just go down there

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:43.670
and wait.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.985
So he picks me up, and we drive
to I think one of the parking

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:48.860
lots along the river.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.000
And it's dark, and I'm
not really into him.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.570
He's not hideous, but
just not really into him,

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.900
and he's in me.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.830
And I've already
come all this way,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.360
and so I feel obligated
to do something.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.030
So I end up fooling
around with the guy,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.455
and I was a little nervous.

00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:16.830
But we end up fooling
around maybe 10 minutes.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.640
And afterwards, I get out
of the car immediately,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.624
and I just start heading home.

00:11:22.624 --> 00:11:24.790
I don't know if it was that
night or the next night,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.800
but I'm online again, and I
get an email from him saying,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.630
it was nice to meet you.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.980
You seem like a nice guy.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.530
And you forgot your
knife in my car.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.310
And I just was like
mortified, but also

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.190
didn't really care because
I was petrified at the time

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.270
and glad I brought it.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.570
So fast forward to a
few months later, I'm

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.490
back in South Jersey
male-for-male chatting

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.250
with people, and I've been
chatting with this one guy

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.500
for a while, one
kid for a while.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.020
I remember his screen
name was KegKiller,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.640
and I was BlueSwoosh81.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.582
That's my birthday,
and Nike was swoosh.

00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:03.540
And we chatted for a
while, and I had a feeling

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.632
he was legit and real.

00:12:04.632 --> 00:12:06.090
And the way we
chatted about stuff,

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.517
I knew he was my
age, lived nearby,

00:12:08.517 --> 00:12:09.850
and I really wanted to meet him.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.710
But he did not want to meet me.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.930
He was very skeptical about
it, very scared about it.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.570
But he actually dropped
where he worked randomly

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.680
in conversation one time.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.100
It was a movie theater.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.840
So I asked my friend Liz to
go to the movies with me,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.240
and it was to go see
"Good Will Hunting,"

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.960
and I think it was like
in '96, '97 at this point,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.250
and I knew it was at
his movie theater.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.680
So I just randomly went
there one night to go see it.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.420
And when I got there, the guy
taking my ticket resembled him.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.270
He resembled his stats, and
I was like, OK, that's him.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:42.990
That's him.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.240
So we went to the movie,
got inside the movie,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.670
and halfway through the
movie, I come back out,

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.720
and I make sure I buy--

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.270
I have some candy, and I
made sure I contact with him,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.530
and I made sure that we had
some sort of interaction.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.446
Not really talking, but
I made sure he saw me.

00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:58.304
The next night or the night
after, I'm online again,

00:12:58.304 --> 00:13:00.720
hoping he'll sign on so I can
tell him I went to his work.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.372
And he ends up signing on, and
I end up chatting with him.

00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:04.830
I'm like, hey, I
went to your work.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.880
I think I saw you.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.870
I was wearing this.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.640
I said hi to you.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.870
And he remembered me and
was willing to meet me now.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.405
So we ended up meeting like
that night or night after.

00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:16.530
I can't exactly I remember.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.370
But from then on, we were
like instant friends,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.890
and it was my first gay friend
ever I made, and we had so much

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.500
in common.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.360
He lived near me.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.980
He was in high school, too.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.964
And I had like my
first gay friend

00:13:30.964 --> 00:13:32.880
that I could do anything
with, and we ended up

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.529
just like going to the city
experiencing everything

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:38.820
together for the next 10 years.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.800
And it was something
that I didn't

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.350
know I needed until I had it.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.430
When I found Jeff, I was able
to be myself, be honest, just

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:48.120
be me.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.000
When I was 15, I had
to find people online

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.080
because in 1996, there
wasn't anything else.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.700
But today, I think it's
important to have safe spaces

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.636
where young queer youth can
go meet other people like them

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:02.010
so they're not
putting themselves

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.426
in these weird
predicaments like I

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:07.620
was meeting a complete stranger
down by the river with a knife.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.170
It's funny now to think about
it, but it's also really scary.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.230
And I don't want anybody
to be in that position.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.790
So I think anybody who's young
in the closet or not even

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.740
in the closet but
still needs allies,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.690
they need to find
safe spaces near them.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.273
You need that.

00:14:22.273 --> 00:14:25.110
You need people like you, going
through the same thing as you,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.990
so you can make
mistakes with them,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.510
learn from their mistakes,
and you help each other out.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.280
It's important.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.142
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.229
MISTRAL MYERS:
[INAUDIBLE] Oh, OK.

00:14:43.229 --> 00:14:44.770
I'm not as good at
this clicker thing

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.610
as I thought I was going to be.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.860
So can you tell us a
little bit about this video

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.500
and why you decided to
include it in today's talk?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.840
We have a couple others as
well, so got more to come.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.330
NATHAN MANSKE:
Yeah, so early on,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.982
I knew that I didn't want to--

00:14:56.982 --> 00:14:58.190
or I knew a couple of things.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.106
One is I wanted to make
sure that this was not

00:15:00.106 --> 00:15:02.770
a coming out story site, and
it was very important to me

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.070
to share stories that capture
the queer experience as opposed

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.200
to this one moment
in everyone's life.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.350
And so the only
prompt that I give

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.350
the storytellers is to share
a story from your life that's

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.560
meaningful to you
involving you being LGBTQ.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.130
And some storytellers are like,
that's not very good direction.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.050
[LAUGH] I'm like,
I intentionally

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:23.916
leave it very open.

00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:25.540
I don't want to guide
you down any sort

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.910
of story or any
direction that might not

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.560
be your most meaningful story.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.930
So we have a long list of
thought starter questions

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.040
to help people think of a
story they want to share.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.840
So this story was--

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.690
we asked not to
think of a story.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.890
And the process is we
email back and forth.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.467
We send the storyteller
a link with the thought

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:52.300
starter questions and
a little form for them

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.910
to just get in
storytelling mode,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.460
to set the stage of what
it's like, so they understand

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.470
that it's not a question
and answer interview.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.120
It's not like a back and forth.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.000
It's just sharing
their story with me.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.990
And so this was just a story
that stuck out a lot to Matt.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.420
So he shared it,
and we loved it.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.790
And actually that reminds me
of another really valuable

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.340
learning experience that
I had very early on.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.620
It was about
probably three weeks

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.790
after launching the website.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.090
So it was very new, and
I was very inexperienced

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.190
and very protective
of I'm From Driftwood.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.360
It's like it has to be
perfect and all this stuff.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.310
But the only guidelines I had
were it has to be a story,

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.160
and it has to be
grammatically correct.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.930
It was very, very loose.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.500
So I would scan the stories
and make little grammar

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.200
and spelling fixes.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.750
But if it was a story,
I would publish it.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.750
So I received one story, and
this was a written story,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.420
and the truth is, I just
didn't connect with it.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.060
Whatever it was, I
wasn't feeling it.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.160
And this was, again,
at a time where

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.740
I wanted to put I'm From
Driftwood's best face forward.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.790
And so I started a
draft of an email

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.599
to the storyteller explaining
thank you for submitting.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.390
Maybe rework it or
send another one.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.449
And I couldn't articulate why
I didn't want to publish it,

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:19.740
and then I started feeling bad.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.760
I'm like, what am
I going to say?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.760
I don't like your story?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.010
Like, sorry?

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.359
Who am I to say that?

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.592
So I was like, oh, whatever.

00:17:27.592 --> 00:17:28.800
I'm just going to publish it.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.230
So I published it, and one
of the very first comments

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.990
said this is the best story
I've read on the site.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.810
And I'm so glad that
I learned that early

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.300
on because the reason it
didn't connect with me

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.680
is because I didn't need it to.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.690
I have my life
and my experiences

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.650
and my history, and that story,
I didn't need that story,

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.880
but other people did.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.640
So it allowed me to
really remove myself

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.590
and my personal experiences
from I'm From Driftwood.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:57.720
And so whenever people come
up with a story like Matt,

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.205
that was a meaningful
story to him.

00:17:59.205 --> 00:18:01.080
And it just so happens
that I connect with it

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.465
because I was definitely
on those AOL m-for-m chat

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:05.890
rooms also.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.670
But that's why I
try to be hands off

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.760
in terms of helping people
think of their stories.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.657
And some people
have many stories

00:18:13.657 --> 00:18:15.990
that they're thinking about,
and then we'll talk to them

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.975
and help them develop them more.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.350
MISTRAL MYERS:
Yeah, I think it's

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.590
really fascinating in an
archive like this the diversity

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.410
of experience that you find.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.510
So I would encourage
everybody to go and take

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.810
a look at the site, which
has this video archive,

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.670
and you can really
find an enormous number

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.378
of different kinds of
stories from people

00:18:37.378 --> 00:18:41.880
with very, very wide ranging
experiences of identifying

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:50.370
as LGBTQ in various stages of
their journey throughout life.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.790
But I'm curious also if you
saw some recurring themes.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.660
Did you have certain things that
kept circling up for you, even

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.570
as you were stepping away
from being personally invested

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.290
or connecting with every story?

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.090
Did you find that
interesting things were

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.434
popping up over and over again?

00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:12.820
NATHAN MANSKE: Not
generally at first.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.530
And it actually leads me to
talking about the story tour,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.260
because at first, we were
collecting video stories

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.244
from people.

00:19:20.244 --> 00:19:20.910
We had no money.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.868
We had no organization.

00:19:21.868 --> 00:19:23.460
It was just like
doing what we could.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.140
So we had to do what
was easiest, which

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:28.300
was collect stories in
New York and Philadelphia

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.400
where Marquise lives.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.640
And the good thing about
New York and Philly

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.790
is that they're such
international cities.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.171
So people are from
everywhere here in New York.

00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:41.670
So it was good because we were
getting some diverse stories,

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.670
but I felt like we were
cheating a little bit

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.839
because all the people
here decided to move here,

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:49.380
and that is a different kind of
person than people who decide

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.060
to stay in their hometowns.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.540
So that was where the idea
of the 50 state story tour

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.170
came from.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:59.340
I was like, we're doing a good
job of getting diverse stories,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.290
but we need to
really get out there.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.470
And so I pitched the
idea to Marquise,

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:10.250
and he had a nice, cushy job
in Philly, and, of course,

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.180
I'm scrambling to do
what I can to turn this

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.120
into an organization.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.630
And so I'm like, let's
go to all 50 states.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:16.950
And he's like, [LAUGH].

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.440
He's like, how is that possible?

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.430
Let's do like a five day, three
city tour in the Northeast.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.577
Let's start there.

00:20:24.577 --> 00:20:25.410
Build some interest.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.320
And I was like, no, no, no.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.800
No one's going to care about
a three city tour in over five

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.040
days.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.940
We have to do it big.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.410
It has to be I'm From
Driftwood's 50 state story

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:32.910
tour.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.330
It has to be stories from
all over the country.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.250
And about six months
later and a lot

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.320
of convincing and conversations,
we decided to do it

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.869
and bought a van,
mapped it all out, and--

00:20:50.869 --> 00:20:52.410
MISTRAL MYERS: You
did it by vehicle?

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:52.950
NATHAN MANSKE: We drove.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.420
MISTRAL MYERS: You were not
flying between the places.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:54.920
OK.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.572
NATHAN MANSKE: We flew
to Alaska and Hawaii.

00:20:57.572 --> 00:20:59.280
We thought about
getting a duck van so we

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.770
could drive to Hawaii, but no.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.230
So, yeah, we drove
to all 48 states

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:10.140
and then flew to Hawaii, from
Hawaii to Alaska, then back

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.460
to the 48 states.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.360
And it took over four months.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.550
And so to answer
your question, that

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.100
was when we noticed a trend.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.100
I guess there's a trend I guess
of me setting rules for myself,

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.120
but I was like, I don't want
to seek out specific stories.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.150
If we are in Laramie,
Wyoming, I don't

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.990
want to seek out a
Matt Shepard story.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.900
If we're in the
South, I don't want

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.510
to seek out religious stories.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.480
If we're in Utah, I don't
want to see Mormon stories.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.270
I just wanted the stories to
happen and stick to our guns

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.160
and say whatever story
you want to share.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.790
And I'm glad we did
that because that

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.320
is the best way to notice
a trend without swaying

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.220
it any certain way.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.500
And the trend was something
that I didn't predict.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.630
We did presentations,
like story sharing events

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.270
at colleges and universities,
and whenever I did,

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.520
I would ask people
there, what is

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.130
it like being LGBTQ
here in Kansas?

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.520
And the answers consistently
were the smaller

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.330
the town, the more
the youth or community

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.550
wanted to challenge
the perception

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.680
of the rest of the country
about their small town.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.846
And they're like, just
because we're in a small town

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:32.390
doesn't mean we're backwoods
idiots, knuckle draggers.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.420
My family's supportive of me.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.350
I'm out at school.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.766
Like, they were
really challenging

00:22:37.766 --> 00:22:40.730
this perception of Kansas
or wherever we were

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.687
being this terrible small town.

00:22:43.687 --> 00:22:45.020
They're like, it's not that way.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.110
We don't have protections.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.776
They were very honest
and real about it,

00:22:47.776 --> 00:22:50.690
but they were like, they
hear I'm from Kansas,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.850
and they think, oh, it
must be so terrible.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.830
And there are rooms
for improvement,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.690
but it's not this
terrible place to be.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:01.610
And then the opposite was
true in the big cities--

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.540
the same but opposite.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:08.090
So it was we were in West
Hollywood at the LA Center,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.580
and it's West Hollywood,
like the gayest of the gay.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.860
And there was probably 18
or maybe even 16 to 24.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.740
A youth group had a meeting,
and we shared stories,

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.300
and I almost didn't ask.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.870
Because it's this
beautiful-- like,

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.870
there's so much money
behind it in their center,

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.290
and it was new and renovated.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.770
But I was like, I should ask.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.990
I was like, what's it like being
LGBTQ here in West Hollywood?

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.657
And all their hands
shot up, and they're

00:23:34.657 --> 00:23:36.740
like, just because we're
in West Hollywood doesn't

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.520
mean it's easy.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.380
And I don't live
in West Hollywood.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.240
I live with my parents.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.650
I had to sneak out to be here.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.850
They don't know I'm gay.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.200
My friend was kicked out.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.070
So it was the same
idea of challenging

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.470
a perception of what
the world sees them as

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.040
and turning that on its head.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.850
And basically, everyone
was saying, we're unique.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.550
There's not a broad
stroke that you

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.140
can paint for our town or city.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.130
It was like pay
attention to us--

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.660
to us, not our town or city.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.120
So that was the biggest trend
I saw on the story tour.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.870
MISTRAL MYERS: That's
really good to hear.

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.460
I'm glad that that was the
trend and not something

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.600
worse or more difficult.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:17.980
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.354
MISTRAL MYERS:
Yeah, good to hear

00:24:19.354 --> 00:24:21.680
that people were able to
challenge their perceptions

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.880
of their small towns.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.730
As somebody who grew up
in a relatively small town

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.520
in the middle of New
Mexico, which at the time

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.740
was probably also a place in
which people would imagine it

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.882
being not particularly
LGBTQ friendly,

00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:40.090
I actually didn't want to
challenge those perceptions

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.690
so much because I
think at the time,

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.731
it was still a pretty
difficult place to grow up.

00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:45.710
But I can understand
the impetus--

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:51.117
[INAUDIBLE] give a
real understanding

00:24:51.117 --> 00:24:52.700
for folks who don't
live there of what

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.487
it's actually like to be from
that place as an LGBTQ person.

00:24:56.487 --> 00:24:57.320
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.819
Yeah, I feel like
there's a balance.

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:00.719
People are like,
yeah, there's pride.

00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:01.760
It's like, I'm from here.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.300
I like it.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.460
I love it.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.450
There are some issues, but, hey.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.740
It's not all the way
one or the other.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.760
There is a balance, and yeah.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.070
MISTRAL MYERS: That's great.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.530
At what point did
you start to have

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.510
an understanding of where
you needed to broaden out

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.300
your demographics?

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.674
So you were talking
in particular

00:25:21.674 --> 00:25:26.720
about looking at the stories
of older LGBTQ folks is often

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.370
a part of our community that
can be either not properly cared

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.060
for, not properly highlighted,
or sometimes even silenced

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.530
in a variety of ways.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.634
So using that as
an example, where

00:25:40.634 --> 00:25:42.050
was the fork in
the road where you

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.870
realized that broadening
demographics would

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.574
be really helpful?

00:25:46.574 --> 00:25:47.990
NATHAN MANSKE:
Pretty early on, we

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.890
knew that we wanted to make sure
that the stories represented

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.460
the diversity of the community,
which there's no community more

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.190
diverse than the LGBT
community because we're

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.250
part of every community.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:08.490
So it was always a focus, but
it wasn't until we would--

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.710
so the process is we
help storytellers come up

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.560
with a single story to
share from their life.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.780
And what would
happen whenever we

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.760
would get a story from
somebody who's older

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.100
is that we would work
with them on the phone

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.790
and figure out a single story,
and we would show up to film.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:28.200
And let's say, for example, the
story's about they found love

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.809
at age 50.

00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:30.350
But then we show up
with the cameras,

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.820
and they're like, when I was
14, and I was like, what?

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.320
Wait.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.120
We're looking at
my notes like, uh.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.820
And they try to cram in their
entire life into this story,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.660
and we try to keep the videos
about five minutes, five

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.900
to six minutes, because we want
to make sure people watch them.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.397
And if we upload
a 25 minute video,

00:26:49.397 --> 00:26:51.730
it's unlikely people are going
to watch the whole thing.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.940
So there's this
balance of needing

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:00.037
to have shareable and viewable
content while making sure

00:27:00.037 --> 00:27:02.120
that we respect the
storyteller and the story they

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:02.703
want to share.

00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:07.157
So with elders, then we
felt bad because we'd

00:27:07.157 --> 00:27:09.740
publish their story and they're
like, what about this and this

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.060
and this that I talked about?

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.139
And we're like, it was too long.

00:27:14.139 --> 00:27:15.680
We don't think people
would watch it.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.170
So they would be a
little sad by that,

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.970
and we feel like
we let them down.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.460
So we wanted to
come up with a way

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.210
to have this compromise of
like, what can we do to--

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.750
and also elders have no
one in the community ever

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.800
will see as much history
and change in the community

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.570
as our elders right now.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.030
They have been arrested
for dancing with people

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.530
of the same gender,
and now they can

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.570
marry people of the
same gender, and that

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.030
won't exist in 20 years, and
it didn't exist 20 years ago.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.420
And so we also knew the
importance and value

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.720
of documenting and
preserving their history.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.390
So we came up with
this new program called

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.160
What Was It Like,
and it's specifically

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.840
stories of LGBTQ elders.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.060
And the way that
program works is

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.490
that instead of having
them share one story,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.757
we helped them figure out six
to eight individual stories

00:28:04.757 --> 00:28:05.340
in their life.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.280
So it's still every
story has an arc.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.680
Every story has an individual
conflict and resolution

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.957
so then we can share
them individually.

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:14.540
But it also gives
them the opportunity

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.680
to share their
whole life but still

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.940
through individual stories.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.130
So we launched that about
a year and a half ago,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.905
and it's been incredible.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.410
I mean, we talk a lot
behind the scenes.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.320
But even Damien, my colleague
and the videographer

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.690
and editor, he says the
stories from elders,

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.450
they're just
better, because they

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.684
have such different
history, and younger people

00:28:44.684 --> 00:28:46.100
have fewer stories
to choose from.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.380
So it's really been just
an incredible new program

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.460
that we're happy with.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.610
And we have a story from an
elder if we're ready to watch.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.520
MISTRAL MYERS: Yes.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.380
NATHAN MANSKE: We're
going to skip Alexa's.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.000
MISTRAL MYERS: We're
going to have to skip?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.240
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.989
MISTRAL MYERS: OK.

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:02.030
So give me just one
second to do my clicker.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:02.630
There we go.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.470
NATHAN MANSKE: There it was.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.250
MISTRAL MYERS: Here it is.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.291
NATHAN MANSKE: All right.

00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:07.490
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:17.840
- In 1997, give or
take a year or two,

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.390
I was working out
on Fire Island,

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:26.900
a barrier island
off of Long Island,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:33.320
and I worked at this little
restaurant called El Hot Spot.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.550
It was a Mexican restaurant with
a generic name, a Mexican name.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.210
And I was told that I could
wear anything I wanted,

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:51.350
and, in fact, they encouraged
me to dress up, be myself.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:56.660
I was wearing a church
dresses with hats sometimes,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.090
all different kinds of wigs.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:04.170
And I didn't know
much about makeup,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.560
but I had some girlfriends
that started to help me

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.240
with the makeup and stuff.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.790
I was given this
creative freedom.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.170
I had basically
lived as a gay man,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:20.090
and Pearl hadn't emerged yet.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.580
And so I was wearing--

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.180
I just tried to put together
things that I could find.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.040
They had a lot of--

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.560
I was wearing--
they would have--

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.150
a lot of the old drag queens
out on the island would retire

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:41.360
and their drag, and they
would put it up at yard sales,

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.490
and I would go shopping.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.630
That's where I did my
shopping in the beginning

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:51.080
because I dare not go to any
store to buy women's clothing.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:56.180
And so I was getting ready
to come into the city,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.810
and I was going to go
through my whole routine,

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:03.710
put on back into
my male clothing,

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.410
and get ready to come back.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.140
Simple, I've done
it a thousand times.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.370
And at that time, I
couldn't get it together.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.990
I couldn't change my clothes,
and I couldn't get out

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.370
of my drag to go
back into the city,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.890
and I felt so schizophrenic.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.460
And I started talking to myself.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.370
I said, OK now, Pearl.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.630
Come on off it.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.930
Or I might have
even talk to Ken.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.670
I said, OK.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.584
Chop, chop.

00:31:32.584 --> 00:31:33.500
Let's get it together.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.040
Let's get on that boat,
take off these clothes.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.480
And it was like Pearl
came out of me and said,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.010
I'm not taking them off.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:48.790
It was like, I said, what?

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:54.500
And she said, I'm not
taking this dress off.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.890
And I'm holding a
conversation with myself.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.846
I sad, of course you are.

00:31:58.846 --> 00:32:00.770
I said, we can't go.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.740
And so I went up
to the Ice Palace,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.120
and I remember talking to one
of the entertainers there.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.920
I said, I'm going back into
the city just like this.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.980
And he said, no, Pearl.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.200
You got to take it off
because you could be beat up.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.370
Or you could--

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:24.180
I said, Pearl won't let
me take the drag off.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.160
I know he probably
said, this child's

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.870
been doing a little
too many drugs.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:33.370
So I ran home, got
my bag, got my stuff,

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.830
and I got on the boat.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:41.500
It was the most surreal trip
across the bay from Cherry

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.110
Grove back to Sayville.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.785
And I'm on the way in,
and people are looking.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.400
And I look just like what I am.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.480
And I go in, and I remember
walking through Penn Station,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.440
and I'm in a flowing something.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.770
And people-- and when
I looked in my wake,

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.720
you know how you
walk past somebody

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.850
and if you look back
real quick in your wake,

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:14.130
there's all these people
staring like, what?

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:18.920
And I get on the subway,
and I catch the train

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.075
on back down this way.

00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:28.310
Now it's getting ready to
just throw everything out

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.730
that I thought I was--

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:35.640
a gay black man living with HIV.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.340
And now this new,
new something has

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.430
emerged that was peeking
out all the time.

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.400
Pearl was there.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.720
She didn't have a name,
but she was there.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:34:04.690
Everything up to this point had
led to me being true to myself

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.440
as a transgender woman,
and at that point,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.170
I had no idea what that meant.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:18.568
Because for the next 16 years,
and it still continue today,

00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:20.139
it's been a journey.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.897
And I wouldn't trade
it for the world.

00:34:22.897 --> 00:34:25.282
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.929
MISTRAL MYERS: So clearly,
a lot of these stories,

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.120
again, it's just
really wonderful

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.230
being able to see each of
these stories on the archive.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.659
It's such an
incredible experience

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.360
to jump into other
people's lives,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.194
all those mirror neurons
getting fired up.

00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:47.860
But I'm curious.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.360
This actually leaves us
really nicely into part

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.889
of what you came
here to talk about,

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:58.800
which was having all of
this be a digital platform

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.875
and have it be an internet
base, particularly

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:05.400
when we're talking about
LGBTQ elders who may have told

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.810
stories prior to this becoming
an easy platform to access

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.050
in very different ways.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.140
So I'm curious how you
see that playing in

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:17.767
and influencing this
project at its core.

00:35:17.767 --> 00:35:19.350
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah,
I mean, it simply

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.190
wouldn't exist if we weren't
in the internet age right now

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.300
and without YouTube and ways
to share all these stories,

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.370
because our focus
has always been

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:37.680
on getting these stories out
to a home in Idaho somewhere.

00:35:40.237 --> 00:35:42.070
That's what makes I'm
From Driftwood special

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.400
I think is its accessibility--

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.895
freely accessible to anyone
with an internet connection.

00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:52.570
And that's what's
special about it.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:55.770
We look at our analytics,
and most of our views

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.020
do come from the
bigger states, but just

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.120
knowing that they've been
seen from every country

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.661
in the world.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.230
I mean, I can't understate it.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.780
It wouldn't exist without where
we are today with the internet.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.010
And the name itself, it's town
focused, geography focused.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:19.200
It's really all about getting
our stories out there.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.565
That said, there
is an element of--

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.200
I don't know.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.894
It becomes a little bit
impersonal especially for me

00:36:30.894 --> 00:36:33.060
because I spend so much
time on just like a computer

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.460
sharing these stories,
and it becomes so digital

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.730
that it loses a little
bit of heart sometimes.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.960
And I can't tell if that's just
me because it's my job or what.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.740
But because of that, we started
having more community events

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.680
where we screen stories
in public places,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.690
and we have
storyteller spotlights.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.860
So Pearl, for example, was
one of our first featured

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.200
storyteller spotlights, where
we screen a few of her stories

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.850
and she's there
with a moderator,

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.620
and there's questions
from the audience.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.990
So you see these stories,
and then you can actually

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.430
ask the storyteller questions.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.040
So it kind of takes it offline.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.100
So as much as we're focusing
on online, we're now--

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.260
I think maybe as
humans in general,

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:18.490
we've been so focused on
online and digital and phones.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:19.720
Now we're like, wait.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.610
I missed this
personal connection.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.820
And we're correcting
that a little bit.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.570
So I'm glad that we now have
these ways of experiencing

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.940
I'm From Driftwood offline.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.930
So, yeah.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.930
MISTRAL MYERS: Having to
complement is really cool.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.020
So online storytelling
clearly doesn't

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.560
have a very long history,
certainly not in comparison

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.750
to storytelling more broadly.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.700
So we don't have a ton
of precedent to go off.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.440
But I'm curious as somebody who
is involved on a daily basis

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:56.170
in curating LGBTQ stories
in the online space,

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.440
do you have a sense for
how online storytelling

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.350
particularly around LGBT
stories is going to develop

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.410
over the next five, 10 years?

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:10.240
What do you see coming up
for online storytelling?

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.280
NATHAN MANSKE: I think
just generally it's

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.880
going to become decentralized,
and we're actually

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.120
trying to put together
a youth committee

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.890
to help us figure out--

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.400
because nine years is a
long time for the internet.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.680
So much has changed.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.320
Instagram didn't
exist when we started.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.010
So what I want to
figure out is what

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.750
I'm From Driftwood would look
like today if it started today.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:38.590
And it would probably not
be a centralized website.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.580
It would be more of a
hashtag or something,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.680
and it's not all
living on one place.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.020
It's everywhere.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.360
And you can look at
the #MeToo movement.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.420
That is not a
centralized storytelling,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.410
and it's a singular theme,
and it's everywhere.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.190
There's not a single
place to go there.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:05.630
I think storytelling is
going to become decentralized

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.960
I guess is maybe a dry
answer, but I think

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.120
that's like where it's going.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.520
Just the internet in
general, it's less--

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.920
you look at blogs now.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.700
There are not as many blogs.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.970
People don't go to places
like bookmarks and stuff.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.950
It's now just what
you read on Instagram

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.814
or Facebook or Twitter.

00:39:23.814 --> 00:39:26.230
I feel like everything's been
taken and shaken up and just

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.760
like thrown out there.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.145
So I think it's going to be
similar for storytelling.

00:39:30.145 --> 00:39:31.270
MISTRAL MYERS: Interesting.

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.320
How do you find navigating
that space knowing it's

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.850
becoming decentralized?

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.840
And clearly there are lots
of options for where folks

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.660
can go to find LGBTQ stories.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.580
So do you find it a
challenge to try and get

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:49.450
I'm From Driftwood into
a unique enough space

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.200
that it's still
holding its own in what

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.200
can be just a competitive,
as you say, decentralized

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.460
space on the internet?

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.500
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah,
the challenge for us

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.220
is we're trying to plan
five years in advance

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.220
and 10 years in advance.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.530
And looking back,
it's like, oh my god,

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.680
five years ago,
things change so fast.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.220
And we're applying for
funding for something

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.100
that we're planning for
in a couple of years.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.250
But then if you get the funding,
it's like, wait, actually,

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.875
we need to change
this because of this.

00:40:16.875 --> 00:40:20.670
And it is just very fast
paced environment obviously,

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.740
but that's a good thing.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.140
So that's not a complaint.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.510
It's just that it is
a challenge though.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:32.060
And just trying to always keep
up with it and stay relevant.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.170
Is a website the way to go?

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.280
Do we need 20 second
video stories?

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.340
And actually, we've
been tracking--

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.990
YouTube has
analytics that allows

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.140
you to monitor the percentage
of the video watched,

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.440
and early on, we
were very focused

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.596
on less than three minutes.

00:40:54.596 --> 00:40:56.970
We kind of made it up but also
looked, did some research.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.020
We're like, less than three
minutes for a video story.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.160
And then we got a
really great story

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.743
that had to be closer
to four minutes.

00:41:01.743 --> 00:41:03.240
We're like, OK, just this once.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.990
But we compared those
analytics, and we're

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.240
like, look, the same percentage
of people watched it.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.970
And now some of our videos
are over seven minutes,

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.390
and the percentage
stays the same.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:17.450
So that just taught us
that the story arc takes

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.350
the primary focus, and
as long as it's a story,

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.270
people watch it
for the same amount

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.240
of time or percentage of time
as they would for a two minute

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:25.900
story.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.291
So yeah.

00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:29.915
I forget how I got
there, but I think--

00:41:29.915 --> 00:41:33.310
MISTRAL MYERS: No, no,
that's really interesting.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.850
I know that that's not the case
for all YouTube videos, right?

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.190
Plenty of them, you
drop off in the middle.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.770
So it's really interesting
to hear that LGBT stories are

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.200
really connecting, particularly
that arc is keeping

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.110
people engaged over the course.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.390
I'm sure on the keeping up
with the technology piece,

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.952
I know that as I get
older and more crotchety,

00:41:56.952 --> 00:41:58.660
it's actually really
difficult to keep up

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.076
with the new
technologies that are

00:42:00.076 --> 00:42:03.310
coming out and
understanding how they work.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.430
Like, Snapchat is just
a thing that I just

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:11.350
do not understand nor use.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:13.840
Yes, it came along
with my gray hairs.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.760
So I can imagine that
that is difficult,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.409
but it's a really
interesting space to be in.

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:20.075
NATHAN MANSKE: It's
the youth committee.

00:42:20.075 --> 00:42:21.700
I'm like, we'll just
get the youth to do it.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.824
MISTRAL MYERS: That's good.

00:42:22.824 --> 00:42:25.510
So I know that we had one
more video we wan to show,

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.530
which we certainly can.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:29.247
But before we jump into
getting some questions from

00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:31.330
the audience and certainly
showing this last video

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:35.290
if we'd like to, I just want to
make sure that we touch on how

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.500
groups like ours-- so the
Gayglers is Google's LGBTQ

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.570
employee resource group--

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.270
and how groups
like the Gayglers,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:48.610
as well as other LGBTQ community
groups or organizations,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:52.120
can become involved with
a project like this,

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.240
either with the option
to contribute or help

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.407
spread the word, et cetera.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.240
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.460
There are so many ways.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.415
We're a very small organization,
and we have very big goals

00:43:02.415 --> 00:43:03.540
of what we're trying to do.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.020
And it's just me and Damien.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.730
So one is share your story.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.480
From what I've heard,
it's a good process.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.479
It's a learning process.

00:43:12.479 --> 00:43:14.320
You learn about storytelling.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.600
We come to you to
film your story.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.400
So just reach out to us--

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.170
nathan@imfromdriftwood.com--
and we will get your story.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.900
If you don't live here, we can
sometimes find videographers

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.506
in your area.

00:43:27.506 --> 00:43:29.380
But sharing your story,
there's no better way

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.440
to get to know more
about the organization

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.520
than sharing your story.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.160
We have community events.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.570
We are volunteer opportunities.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.778
We have this youth committee.

00:43:38.778 --> 00:43:43.090
So if you're knowledgeable
on all of these new--

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.440
we need help with Instagram.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.210
And also, it's just like time.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.450
I'm trying to keep Instagram
up to date with our stories

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:55.180
and photos, and we need help
and guidance, so social media.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:59.970
AdWords, we have a Google grant,
and AdWords is so in-depth,

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:04.750
and, yeah, it's way beyond
what I am able to do.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.280
So we need help with that.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.900
We need help with anything.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.040
So basically, if you
are interested in taking

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.990
part and volunteering
at events or anything

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.420
at all with a
storytelling organization,

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.400
just reach out to me,
and we will make sure

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.950
that you're doing
something that you enjoy.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.350
MISTRAL MYERS: That's great.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.500
I think that in the
interest of time

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.400
we might open it up now for Q&amp;A
unless there is anything else

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.350
that you wanted to
touch on before we jump

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.920
into some audience questions.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.900
NATHAN MANSKE: No,
that sounds great.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.810
MISTRAL MYERS: OK, great.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:36.740
Does anybody have any questions?

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.720
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.120
I took a brief look
at your website,

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.220
and from that and from
what you've shown here,

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:53.970
you highlight, for example,
transgender stories, gender

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.040
non-binary stories.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:02.620
You showed a story
of a community elder,

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.080
though I didn't see a way
to particularly access

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.580
that on your website.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:10.210
And it got me wondering
whether there are tools there

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:13.690
that I just didn't see that
allow people to explore

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:16.810
the site from the point
of view of various kinds

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.610
of intersectionality.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.450
NATHAN MANSKE: Yes.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:24.010
So basically, we tag
all of our stories.

00:45:28.234 --> 00:45:30.740
I have like a traffic jam in
my mind of what I want to say.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.940
So we are working on
a new tool right now,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:40.110
which we need help with from
smart developers and encoders

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.360
and all that stuff that
we don't know how to do,

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.370
where we want to create what's
currently called a story map,

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:49.720
and it's a visual representation
of I'm From Driftwood.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:54.170
So it's literally this
globe, and there's

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.210
a visual representation
of every single story

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.590
that we've collected,
and it's interactive.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.380
So you can click on
it, and it pulls up

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.379
a preview of the story, and
you can filter those by our

00:46:04.379 --> 00:46:05.420
What Was It Like stories.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.850
You can filter it by
transgender stories, sexuality,

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.710
gender orientation,
or gender identity.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.840
So that is stepping
in that direction

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.970
of making it easier
to search and find

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.520
the stories that you want.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.330
The website itself right
now is not ideal for that.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:27.797
You can go to the search
bar and type in New Mexico,

00:46:27.797 --> 00:46:29.630
and all the New Mexico
stories will come up.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.380
But it's not
perfectly there yet.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.200
But the story map
is my answer for all

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.170
that because then you
can search for anything,

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.430
and it's right there.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:43.760
You see this globe, and it
pulls up all those stories,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.420
and you can zoom in and see.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.540
It's really cool, but we
have to get it to a place

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.670
where we can publish it, and
it's not quite there yet.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.060
And additionally, the
What Was It Like stories,

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:58.760
we want to create a companion
site that lives on I'm

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.799
From Driftwood but feels
like its own thing also,

00:47:02.799 --> 00:47:05.340
so that if you want to only look
at What Was It Like stories,

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.964
you can go there,
and all their stories

00:47:06.964 --> 00:47:08.450
are presented in this way.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.790
Like, Pearl has
six other stories.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.980
So a way to watch
that one story we

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.890
just watched but know that there
are other stories from Pearl

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.620
right there that you
can just click on next.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.460
So, yes, we need help
with website development

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.540
and that story map.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.151
So reach out.

00:47:25.151 --> 00:47:25.650
Yeah.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:26.690
Did I answer your question?

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:27.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.305
NATHAN MANSKE: OK great.

00:47:28.305 --> 00:47:30.780
MISTRAL MYERS: Great.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:35.570
I also want to note that
Googlers who are either

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.550
watching this video or
here in the room can

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.230
in their own personal capacity
outside of work certainly

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.480
offer their stories
to I'm With Driftwood,

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:51.382
and we're happy to help connect
you as volunteers with Nathan

00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:53.840
in order to get those stories
up if that would be something

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.610
that would be of interest.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.025
Does anyone else have
any questions for Nathan

00:47:58.025 --> 00:48:00.890
while we're here?

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:01.390
Yeah.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.556
Raheem, if you don't mind
just popping up to the mic

00:48:03.556 --> 00:48:04.885
so we can capture you.

00:48:04.885 --> 00:48:05.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, Nathan.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.400
My name's Raheem.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.600
Quick question, so you said
so you host sometimes on site

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.000
events to help with the cause.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.403
I wanted to know, so how do
you decide what type of events

00:48:17.403 --> 00:48:19.719
to help build community?

00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:21.260
Where did you go
for those resources?

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.514
Or do you just
develop that yourself?

00:48:24.514 --> 00:48:26.180
NATHAN MANSKE: Yeah,
we basically just--

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.800
we knew that we wanted
to take it offline,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.960
and we've been operating
for nine years.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.850
I mean, we know that we have
a lot of supporters and fans

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:41.090
because whenever we have
fundraisers, people show up.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:45.140
But that eliminates a lot of
the rest of the community who

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.140
likes I'm From Driftwood
if you have to pay

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.140
$100 to go to a fundraiser.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.850
So we wanted an
option for anyone

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:55.712
to participate and come
and be part of the I'm

00:48:55.712 --> 00:48:56.940
From Driftwood community.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.330
So all of our community
events are free,

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.630
and typically, they're
like happy hour

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:07.235
times at bars and more
generally community spaces.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.970
And later in March, we
have our anniversary party

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.720
at Stonewall upstairs.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.760
In April, we have a storyteller
spotlight club coming.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.760
So we're trying to
target different age

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.220
groups and different
people in the community

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.395
just by having fun events.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.760
And also, just last week, I
spoke at CUNY here in New York.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.750
They have an LGBT student group.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:39.050
So some are college campuses.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.180
Some are like at bars
and community centers.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.050
We had an event at the
Center several years ago.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.360
Yeah, so really the objective
was to take it offline

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.735
and get all these
people who know

00:49:48.735 --> 00:49:50.630
about I'm From Driftwood
together in a room,

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.549
as opposed to just commenting
on Facebook or whatever.

00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:54.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.131
I see what you're saying.

00:49:55.131 --> 00:49:57.830
And last question, so how do
you keep them coming back?

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.976
NATHAN MANSKE: It
depends on what it--

00:50:04.976 --> 00:50:06.350
like, people to
go to the events?

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.515
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:08.765
NATHAN MANSKE: Our newsletter.

00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:13.100
[LAUGH] And good drink
specials at the bars.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.430
But really, we had an event.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.880
The last one that we
had featured-- his name

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:21.200
is Robert Richards, and it was
a What Was It Like storyteller.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.920
It was one of the most
incredible experiences,

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.750
like seeing him
watch his stories.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.390
He had not seen them, and we
published it over a year ago.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.090
So we got to see him
watch his own stories.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.600
And at one point, he
was like, wait, stop.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.630
It was about a former lover,
and he was like, stop.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:39.170
I can't.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.890
I can't.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:41.390
And then the moderator
asked some questions,

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:42.348
and he talked about it.

00:50:42.348 --> 00:50:43.850
He was like, OK, OK, I'm good.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:45.681
Let's finish the video.

00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:47.930
Finished it, and he was like,
that was just-- you just

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.110
have this emotion and
raw emotion in the room.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.700
And I think that's what gets
people really coming back.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.430
They see the emotions that
come out from these stories

00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.960
and also seeing a
storyteller there.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.710
So for the storyteller
spotlights,

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:05.780
it's just this powerful
experience to witness

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:10.830
and to hear stories and an
interview from our elders.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:15.760
So my hope is that people who
go to these experience that,

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.240
these feelings, and
come back for more.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.367
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:21.616
MISTRAL MYERS: Thanks, Raheem.

00:51:24.023 --> 00:51:27.410
Have any other questions?

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.070
Anyone brave that I
can see out there?

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.110
If not, then, Nathan, thank
you so much for being here.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:38.090
We're so delighted to have I'm
From Driftwood here at Google

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:42.080
and to be able to hear about the
process and the journey for you

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.490
and also how we
can get involved.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.970
So we will definitely look
forward to seeing you again.

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.060
But really appreciate it.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.935
Let's give him a round
of applause, shall we?

00:51:48.935 --> 00:51:52.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:53.922
NATHAN MANSKE: Thank you.

00:51:53.922 --> 00:51:54.260
Thanks.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.551
AUDIENCE: Play the third video.

00:51:55.551 --> 00:51:57.580
MISTRAL MYERS: You want
to play the third video?

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.124
OK.

00:51:58.124 --> 00:51:59.290
NATHAN MANSKE: We've got it.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:51:59.860
Might as well.

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.026
MISTRAL MYERS: We've got it.

00:52:01.026 --> 00:52:02.224
It's right here.

00:52:02.224 --> 00:52:05.008
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.150
- My name is Alexa Espinal,
and I'm from New York City.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:15.040
I recently came to Mississippi
four months ago to teach.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.041
I'm teaching middle school art.

00:52:18.041 --> 00:52:19.290
So I teach six through seven--

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:21.710
I mean, sixth, seventh,
and eighth grade.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:25.810
It's been eight weeks now,
and it was interesting being

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.450
a young person-- right, because
I'm obviously very young--

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:32.230
and coming from New York
City and then asserting

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:35.440
this kind of power and
being in this place

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.680
where you are not really
connected to the culture.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.800
Plus, I don't necessarily--

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.550
I am a colored person but
don't racially identify with--

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.950
they still don't know what I am.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:54.410
And in the state, it's kind
of very black and white.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.790
And the in-between is strange.

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.940
And for students, it's hard
for them to gauge that.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.980
So it's my second
week of school.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.379
I'm still figuring out how
to navigate this new realm

00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:08.170
that I'm in, right?

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:12.130
This new place, new position.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.460
And I have to walk all
the students in a line

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.540
to the bathroom.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.070
So there's some waiting time.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.090
And as other students
are using the bathroom,

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.020
these two students break out
in a fight kind of, not a fight

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.620
but just like a tiff
between the two.

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.900
And they're like, you're
gay, you're gay, you're gay.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.470
And I was just like,
how do I address

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:36.370
this knowing that
I can get fired

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.066
for being gay in Mississippi?

00:53:38.066 --> 00:53:39.190
Which is like a huge thing.

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.830
And then on top of that,
knowing that there's

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.000
this religious thing.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.440
How do I then say
anything about it?

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.260
But I knew I had
to say something.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.546
Something needed to be said.

00:53:51.546 --> 00:53:53.170
So I was like, we're
not going to speak

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.955
about being gay in a negative
way because it's not negative,

00:53:55.955 --> 00:53:58.330
and we're not going to use
that word in that kind of way.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.160
We're not going to
use that language.

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.300
And this one kid straightened
up, looks forward,

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.110
and he's like, OK, I'm
not going to do it.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:11.350
Then this other student blurts
out, well, no, it's a sin.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:12.220
Being gay's a sin.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.780
It's wrong.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:17.500
And I didn't know what
to say at that point.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.890
And I just knew that I couldn't
push too much, especially

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:23.120
since it's my second week.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.990
Like, I'm not trying to
cause huge waves either.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.070
And I was just like,
well, we're not

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.470
using that word in a
negative way and just

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.539
shut it down there.

00:54:35.539 --> 00:54:37.330
So he just straightened
up, and we ended up

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:39.640
going back to the classroom.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:43.660
Time passes on, and I still hear
it every again in the hallway.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.960
And the first time I saw
maybe like a small light

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:51.640
was this one kid decided
to say it in my classroom.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.440
The word comes up again,
and these two boys

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.540
start saying, you're
gay, you're gay.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.610
And all I did was give a look.

00:54:57.610 --> 00:54:59.530
And this one student
says, we're not

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.120
using that type of language.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.280
And I was like,
yeah, that's amazing.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.840
And I'm planting a seed, and
something's happening, right?

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.510
There's going to be
change, and it's just

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.560
going to take some time.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.530
I think it's important
to always respect

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.320
where people come
from and understand

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.420
that everybody has a
different background,

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.940
has different beliefs.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.060
And so the only way to really
create any type of change

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:30.400
is to meet them where they
are, meet them with they know,

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.617
and try to not change
the way that they think,

00:55:32.617 --> 00:55:34.450
but maybe change the
framing of what they've

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.210
seen, especially when you're
dealing with young students,

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.760
right?

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.730
So by not reprimanding
him in a kind of way

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:46.150
or saying like you're
wrong, just saying

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:48.100
that's not the word to use.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.170
We're not using that
word in a negative way,

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.025
and that word isn't negative.

00:55:52.025 --> 00:55:54.150
And hopefully, students
will feel a lot more calm--

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.733
any students that
are maybe struggling

00:55:55.733 --> 00:55:57.640
with sexual identity,
that they can

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.080
see that they can come to me.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.400
I'm an ally.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.194
I'm someone that
they can speak to.

00:56:02.194 --> 00:56:05.182
[END PLAYBACK]

00:56:10.011 --> 00:56:12.260
MISTRAL MYERS: [INAUDIBLE]
That was a nice way to end.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:12.930
NATHAN MANSKE: Thanks, everyone.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:13.971
MISTRAL MYERS: All right.

00:56:13.971 --> 00:56:17.180
