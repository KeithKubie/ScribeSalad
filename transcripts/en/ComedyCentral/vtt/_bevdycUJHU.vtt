00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:03.136
Dude, I-- I thought
he was in a band.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.005
I didn't know this was
gonna be, like an improv show.

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.474
Yeah, me too,
I don't know.

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:11.445
What's hotter than a pink
dick with a sense of humor?

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.915
I mean, a black
dick, but...

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.284
You know that you're so
anti-racist sometimes

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.152
that you're actually
really racist?

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.288
Huh.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.027
(man)
All right, thank
you all for coming.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029
We are Statutory Crepe.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.732
Everything you're about to
see will be fully improvised.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.834
All we need to get
started is one word.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.171
(man)
Eggroll!
I heard "eggroll."

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:40.207
Dude.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.442
Mom.
Yes, son?

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:46.647
I need to talk to
you about my penis.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.115
Yes, son?

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.450
I love answering questions
about penises,

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.753
even though
I have a vagina!

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.255
Ha ha ha!

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.193
How much for
this shirt?
I can--

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:03.497
One million dollars.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.898
I'm embarrassed
that I'm here.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.767
I'm embarrassed that
he was inside of me.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.670
(animal noises)

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.638
I'm not watching
this by myself, get--

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:12.840
(Ilana)
You should come
down here.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.142
Sit in your seat,
you brought me here.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.145
Oh, my God.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.446
Scene!

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.781
We're gonna take
a quick break and be back

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.483
with another hour of
Statutory Crepe!

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:27.221
Woohoo!

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.656
(Ilana)
Oh, my God, that was the
worst thing I've ever seen.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.491
I feel like I've
been hate-crimed.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.393
Oh, my God!
The dot's back!

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:35.128
(Abbi)
Ew, it's still
in Times Square!

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:36.330
I bet the freak
was seeing a play

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:37.931
and turned it
off to be polite.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:38.932
Oh, my God, dude.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.100
Times Square,
Central Park?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.102
Upper East Side,
means it's a tourist.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.270
Ew!

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.938
The dot's moving
down Eighth Ave.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.306
What tourist spot
is down there?

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.407
I don't know, but
let's get out of here

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.244
before Jerry Lewis
sees you again.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.679
(Ilana)
Oh, my God, oh!

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.181
I've been
pulled back in.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.983
It's too-- I can't--
I can't not.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.184
I can't say no.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:58.452
Okay, you go with
Dr. Evil, because

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.554
I just figured out where
the thief took my phone,

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.390
the last place
every tourist goes.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.392
The airport?
No, not--

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.461
Not literally
the last place.

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.896
Magnolia Bakery.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.097
Right, right,
right, right.
Right?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.498
Yeah, do it.
Okay, I'm going.

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:12.666
Get your hot piece.
All right, I'm going.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.901
Get it.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.636
Hey!

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.971
Oh! Oh.
