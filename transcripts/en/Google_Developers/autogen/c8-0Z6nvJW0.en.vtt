welcome back to the box we're here to
 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.700
welcome back to the box we're here to
talk about more Android with Nicola

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710
talk about more Android with Nicola
 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.999
talk about more Android with Nicola
welcome Nicola thanks Nicola here you're

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009
welcome Nicola thanks Nicola here you're
 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.050
welcome Nicola thanks Nicola here you're
talking about effective image

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060
talking about effective image
 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.990
talking about effective image
manipulation and on androids obviously

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000
manipulation and on androids obviously
 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.880
manipulation and on androids obviously
Android is a constrained environment

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890
Android is a constrained environment
 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.210
Android is a constrained environment
because it's mobile you know environment

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
because it's mobile you know environment
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.529
because it's mobile you know environment
what are the options for developers that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539
what are the options for developers that
 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.290
what are the options for developers that
they can use when it comes to images and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300
they can use when it comes to images and
 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.350
they can use when it comes to images and
so the options that that you can use in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360
so the options that that you can use in
 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.479
so the options that that you can use in
your program the common ones are

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489
your program the common ones are
 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.990
your program the common ones are
probably OpenGL and native and those two

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000
probably OpenGL and native and those two
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.850
probably OpenGL and native and those two
actually have a lot of issues and a lot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860
actually have a lot of issues and a lot
 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.010
actually have a lot of issues and a lot
of constraints that you have you have to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020
of constraints that you have you have to
 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.270
of constraints that you have you have to
deal with one of the recent possibility

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280
deal with one of the recent possibility
 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.700
deal with one of the recent possibility
that for android is run the script which

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710
that for android is run the script which
 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.709
that for android is run the script which
is a new framework a new language for

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719
is a new framework a new language for
 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.810
is a new framework a new language for
processing images that has a lot of

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820
processing images that has a lot of
 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.880
processing images that has a lot of
advantages compared to those of

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
advantages compared to those of
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.490
advantages compared to those of
solutions ok so we'll get to that and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500
solutions ok so we'll get to that and
 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.910
solutions ok so we'll get to that and
enter your experience anything against

OpenGL specifically or native I mean

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350
OpenGL specifically or native I mean
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.050
OpenGL specifically or native I mean
what are the shortcomings before we get

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060
what are the shortcomings before we get
 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.179
what are the shortcomings before we get
to render script and no nothing nothing

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189
to render script and no nothing nothing
 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.859
to render script and no nothing nothing
but gratitude only the only thing is

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869
but gratitude only the only thing is
 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.539
but gratitude only the only thing is
that I guess native I mean my native

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549
that I guess native I mean my native
 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.920
that I guess native I mean my native
what I mean is that you simply pass a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930
what I mean is that you simply pass a
 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.899
what I mean is that you simply pass a
bitmap to the native side you process it

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909
bitmap to the native side you process it
 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.789
bitmap to the native side you process it
it's pretty easy to process the problem

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799
it's pretty easy to process the problem
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.240
it's pretty easy to process the problem
is that if you want to optimize you are

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250
is that if you want to optimize you are
 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.370
is that if you want to optimize you are
going to have

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
going to have
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.789
going to have
to optimize for particle devices it's

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799
to optimize for particle devices it's
 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.779
to optimize for particle devices it's
going to be difficult optimized for

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789
going to be difficult optimized for
 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.020
going to be difficult optimized for
everything and compared to OpenGL it's a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
everything and compared to OpenGL it's a
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.569
everything and compared to OpenGL it's a
bit slower you also have to give we

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579
bit slower you also have to give we
 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.719
bit slower you also have to give we
memory etc etc back later yeah rice with

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729
memory etc etc back later yeah rice with
 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.330

some advantages some inconvenience

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
some advantages some inconvenience
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.399
some advantages some inconvenience
opengl good thing is that it's it should

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409
opengl good thing is that it's it should
 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.910
opengl good thing is that it's it should
be fast the bad thing is well support

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920
be fast the bad thing is well support
 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.950
be fast the bad thing is well support
for opengl depends on drivers and some

GPU SBS better than others okay and you

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189
GPU SBS better than others okay and you
 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.289
GPU SBS better than others okay and you
know some cheap use of constraint that

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299
know some cheap use of constraint that
 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.120
know some cheap use of constraint that
was onto not tab you have like maximum

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130
was onto not tab you have like maximum
 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.919
was onto not tab you have like maximum
size of textures and stuff like that all

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929
size of textures and stuff like that all
 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.059
size of textures and stuff like that all
right okay so uh so you're talking about

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069
right okay so uh so you're talking about
 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.260
right okay so uh so you're talking about
this because you have experience with

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270
this because you have experience with
 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.350
this because you have experience with
this and you've been building I've been

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360
this and you've been building I've been
 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.860
this and you've been building I've been
walking this past year basically on a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
walking this past year basically on a
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.160
walking this past year basically on a
new photo editor in gallery yes where we

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
new photo editor in gallery yes where we
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.289
new photo editor in gallery yes where we
actually started the first question that

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299
actually started the first question that
 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.479
actually started the first question that
we really is the back last November last

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489
we really is the back last November last
 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.220
we really is the back last November last
year was mostly using native processing

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230
year was mostly using native processing
 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.839
year was mostly using native processing
we're just passing the bitmaps with a

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849
we're just passing the bitmaps with a
 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.550
we're just passing the bitmaps with a
native side doing something in c and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560
native side doing something in c and
 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.530
native side doing something in c and
that's it but since then we moved a lot

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540
that's it but since then we moved a lot
 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.930
that's it but since then we moved a lot
more to water on the script and for

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
more to water on the script and for
 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.630
more to water on the script and for
quite a few reasons the big the big

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
quite a few reasons the big the big
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.990
quite a few reasons the big the big
difference for us is that we want we

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
difference for us is that we want we
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.789
difference for us is that we want we
want the software to run on as many

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799
want the software to run on as many
 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.509
want the software to run on as many
devices as possible and it gets

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
devices as possible and it gets
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.460
devices as possible and it gets
difficult if you have to test and be a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470
difficult if you have to test and be a
 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.890

opengl for instance is going to walk

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
opengl for instance is going to walk
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.979
opengl for instance is going to walk
everywhere so that's why we really went

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989
everywhere so that's why we really went
 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.960
everywhere so that's why we really went
with native even if it's not as fast as

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
with native even if it's not as fast as
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.879
with native even if it's not as fast as
open yet it's a lot it's a more

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889
open yet it's a lot it's a more
 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.530

tractable problem to be sure that

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
tractable problem to be sure that
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.340
tractable problem to be sure that
everything will work well but if we want

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350
everything will work well but if we want
 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.470
everything will work well but if we want
to make it faster to review really good

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480
to make it faster to review really good
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.920
to make it faster to review really good
interactive speed then opengl start to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
interactive speed then opengl start to
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.420
interactive speed then opengl start to
look more appealing but then you end up

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
look more appealing but then you end up
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.949
look more appealing but then you end up
with all those issues with compatibility

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959
with all those issues with compatibility
 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.000
with all those issues with compatibility
and etc render script on the other hand

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
and etc render script on the other hand
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.550

as with quite a few nice advantages one

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
as with quite a few nice advantages one
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.589
as with quite a few nice advantages one
of the advantage is that it's a specific

of the advantage is that it's a specific
 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.240
of the advantage is that it's a specific
language that actually

processing because all those victoire

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
processing because all those victoire
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.590
processing because all those victoire
extensions you can actually write

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600
extensions you can actually write
 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.290
extensions you can actually write

they basically use LLVM compiler us to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820
they basically use LLVM compiler us to
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.050
they basically use LLVM compiler us to
generate that and then with the tech d

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060
generate that and then with the tech d

bunch of optimization and more
 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.160
bunch of optimization and more
importantly they couldn't in all of that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
importantly they couldn't in all of that
 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.810
importantly they couldn't in all of that
in parallel so in terms of performance

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820
in parallel so in terms of performance
 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.490
in parallel so in terms of performance
is what you get is something that is

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500
is what you get is something that is
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.410
is what you get is something that is
completely paralyzed that we take

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420
completely paralyzed that we take
 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.150
completely paralyzed that we take
advantage of all the codes on your

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
advantage of all the codes on your
 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.430
advantage of all the codes on your
device which is pretty important about

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440
device which is pretty important about
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.110
device which is pretty important about
the GPU can we use the GPU as well and

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
the GPU can we use the GPU as well and
 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.580
the GPU can we use the GPU as well and
that's one of the big thing this year is

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
that's one of the big thing this year is
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.930
that's one of the big thing this year is
that we know supports GPU drivers for on

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940
that we know supports GPU drivers for on
 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.030
that we know supports GPU drivers for on
the script okay so on all the Nexus

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040
the script okay so on all the Nexus
 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.280
the script okay so on all the Nexus
devices we do have GPU driver but what

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290
devices we do have GPU driver but what
 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.510
devices we do have GPU driver but what
does it mean do you get to choose as a

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520
does it mean do you get to choose as a
 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.980
does it mean do you get to choose as a
developer if it runs on one or the other

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
developer if it runs on one or the other
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.980

what's available you can either choose

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990
what's available you can either choose
 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.240
what's available you can either choose
on the truth I mean you have the option

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250
on the truth I mean you have the option
 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.400
on the truth I mean you have the option
right so if you don't do anything around

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410
right so if you don't do anything around
 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.230
right so if you don't do anything around
the script will just say m I'm going to

the CPU which sometimes is is a really

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
the CPU which sometimes is is a really
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.830
the CPU which sometimes is is a really
good thing to do because the CPU is a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840
good thing to do because the CPU is a
 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.130
good thing to do because the CPU is a
lot more predictable than 30 p you so

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140
lot more predictable than 30 p you so
 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.600
lot more predictable than 30 p you so
depending on what you do right that

about the the previews do you actually

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970
about the the previews do you actually
 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.939
about the the previews do you actually
compute this for the entire image or the

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949
compute this for the entire image or the
 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.830

how do you how do you make that so

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
how do you how do you make that so
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.010
how do you how do you make that so
snappy I mean in general the way you do

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020
snappy I mean in general the way you do
 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.610

it too you can't you can't actually run

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620
it too you can't you can't actually run
 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.950
it too you can't you can't actually run
everything on the full image all the

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960
everything on the full image all the
 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.200
everything on the full image all the

once you really care about is to have
something that is fast that is very

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990
something that is fast that is very
 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.529
something that is fast that is very
interactive for the user so you just

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539
interactive for the user so you just
 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.710
interactive for the user so you just
cheat in earth what we doing the editors

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720
cheat in earth what we doing the editors
 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.120
cheat in earth what we doing the editors
that we compute everything on a very

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130
that we compute everything on a very
 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.370
that we compute everything on a very
small preview image and because it's

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
small preview image and because it's
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.300
small preview image and because it's
smaller you know it we can run your

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310
smaller you know it we can run your
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.950
smaller you know it we can run your
stuff at an interactive interactive

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960

then we have a progressive preview so as

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340
then we have a progressive preview so as
 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.670
then we have a progressive preview so as
soon as you stop moving stuff we compute

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680
soon as you stop moving stuff we compute
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.020
soon as you stop moving stuff we compute
the higher resolution images and the

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030
the higher resolution images and the
 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.939
the higher resolution images and the
higher and I are until you get the final

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949
higher and I are until you get the final
 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.610
higher and I are until you get the final
one to an image and you have this nice

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620
one to an image and you have this nice
 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.189
one to an image and you have this nice
way of comparing before and after yeah

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199
way of comparing before and after yeah
 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:04.200
