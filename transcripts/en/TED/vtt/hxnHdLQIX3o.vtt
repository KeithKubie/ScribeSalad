00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:17.000
This is an elementary school
in Columbus, Ohio.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.292
And inside of this school
there was a student named D.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.809
When D started school here
he was six years old:

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.101
cute as a button,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.332
with a smile that brightened
the entire room.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.893
But after a few months in school,

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:33.768
D became angry,

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:35.167
and that smile faded.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.226
D began to do things like flip tables,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.059
throw desks and chairs,

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.601
yell at teachers,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.351
stand in windowsills,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.393
run in and out of the classroom

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.583
and even running out of the school.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:57.434
Sometimes these fits of anger would put
the entire school into lockdown mode

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:00.351
until D could get himself back together,

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.667
which could sometimes take over an hour.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:08.083
No one in the school knew how to help D.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.917
I know this because
I was the principal at this school.

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:17.976
And what I quickly and collectively
learned with my staff

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.059
was that this situation was more extreme

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.792
than anything we had ever
been trained for.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:27.768
Every time that D lashed out,

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:29.976
I kept thinking to myself:

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.083
what did I miss during
my principal prep coursework?

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.000
What am I supposed to do
with a kid like D?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.518
And how am I going to stop him
from impeding the learning

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:43.125
of all the other students?

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:48.851
And yet after we did everything
that we thought we knew,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.476
such as talking to D

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.684
and taking away privileges

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.250
and parent phone calls home,

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:59.226
the only real option we had left to do
was to kick him out,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.375
and I knew that would not help him.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:05.333
This scenario is not unique to D.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:09.917
Students all over the world
are struggling with their education.

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:14.893
And though we didn't come up
with a fail-safe solution,

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:16.792
we did come up with a simple idea:

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:21.518
that in order for kids like D
to not only survive in school

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.268
but to thrive,

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.643
we somehow had to figure out a way

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:27.976
to not only teach them
how to read and write

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.125
but also how to help them deal with
and manage their own emotions.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.059
And in doing that,
we were able to move our school

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:39.059
from one of the lowest-performing schools
in the state of Ohio,

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.393
with an F rating,

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:43.250
all the way up to a C
in just a matter of a few years.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.476
So it might sound obvious, right?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.726
Of course teachers should be focused
on the emotional well-being of their kids.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.393
But in reality,

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.851
when you're in a classroom
full of 30 students

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.184
and one of them's throwing tables at you,

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:00.434
it's far easier to exclude that child

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:02.982
than to figure out what's going on
inside of his head.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:05.809
But what we learned about D,

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.434
and for kids like D,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:11.726
was that small changes
can make huge differences,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.542
and it's possible to start right now.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.476
You don't need bigger budgets
or grand strategic plans,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.226
you simply need smarter ways
of thinking about what you have

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.934
and where you have it.

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.476
In education, we tend to always
look outside the box for answers,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.559
and we rarely spend
enough time, money and effort

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.559
developing what we already have
inside the box.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:37.667
And this is how meaningful change
can happen fast.

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:40.875
So here's what I learned about D.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:47.351
I was wanting to dig a little bit deeper
to figure out how he had become so angry.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:50.934
And what I learned was
his father had left the home

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.851
and his mother was working long shifts
in order to support the family,

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.976
which left no adult
for D to connect with --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.726
and he was in charge of taking care
of his younger brother

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.809
when he got home from school.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:07.417
Might I remind you
that D was six years old?

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:10.809
Can't say that I blame him
for having some trouble

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.893
transitioning into the school environment.

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:17.643
But yet we had to figure out a way
to help him with these big emotions

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:21.184
all while teaching him core skills
of reading and math.

00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:22.917
And three things helped us most.

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.768
First, we had to figure out
where he was struggling the most.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:29.392
And like most young kids,

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:32.351
arrival at school
can be a tough transition time

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:35.684
as they're moving from
a less structured home environment

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.101
to a more structured school environment.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.559
So what we did for D was
we created a calming area for him

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:42.976
in our time-out room,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.184
which we had equipped with rocking chairs
and soft cushions and books,

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:50.226
and we allowed D to go
to this place in the morning,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.934
away from the other kids,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:56.434
allowing him time to transition
back into the school environment

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.476
on his own terms.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.143
And as we began to learn more about D,

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:04.226
we learned other strategies
that helped him calm down.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.184
For example, D loved to help
younger students,

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:10.559
so we made him a kindergarten helper,

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:12.809
and he went into
the kindergarten classroom

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:15.143
and taught students
how to write their letters.

00:05:15.167 --> 00:05:17.851
And he was actually
successful with a few of them

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:19.667
that the teacher was unable to reach.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.309
And believe it or not,

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:27.143
D actually helped calm some of those
kindergarten students down,

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:31.643
signalling to us that the influence
of peers on behavior was far greater

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.667
than anything we adults could ever do.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.351
We used humor and song with him.

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:39.351
Yes, I know it sounds really silly

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:42.643
that the principal and the teachers
would actually laugh with kids,

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:46.101
but you can imagine the shock on D's face

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:50.226
when the principal's cracking a joke
or singing a song from the radio station,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.101
which almost always ended in a laugh,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:55.601
shortening the length of his outburst

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:58.292
and helping us to connect
with him in his world.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.726
So I know some you are like,

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.018
"It's really not practical
to lay on this kind of special treatment

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.809
for every student,"

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.101
but we actually made it happen.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:13.351
Because once we figured out
the tools and tactics that worked for D,

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:16.976
our teachers were able to roll that out
and use them with other students.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.351
We began to proactively address
student behavior

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:22.333
instead of simply react to it.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.934
Our teachers actually took time
during the lesson plan

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.726
to teach kids how to identify
their feelings

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.559
and appropriate, healthy
coping strategies for dealing with them,

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.476
such as counting to 10,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.809
grabbing a fidget spinner

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.250
or taking a quick walk.

00:06:38.167 --> 00:06:40.434
We incorporated brain breaks
throughout the day,

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:42.351
allowing kids to sing songs,

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.643
do yoga poses

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.851
and participate in structured
physical activities.

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:51.226
And for those kids that struggle
with sitting for long periods of time,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.059
we invested in flexible seating,

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:56.393
such as rocking chairs and exercise bikes,

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.309
and even floor elliptical machines,

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:01.250
allowing kids to pedal
underneath their desks.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.226
These changes encouraged kids
to stay in the classroom,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.500
helping them to focus and learn.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.559
And when less kids are disrupting,

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:12.958
all kids do better.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.476
And here's the magical thing:

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.083
it didn't cost us
a whole lot of extra money.

00:07:19.792 --> 00:07:22.792
We simply thought differently
about what we had.

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:28.500
For example, every public school
has an instructional supply line.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.684
An instructional supply could be a book,

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.059
it could be a whiteboard,

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:34.851
it could be flexible seating,

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:36.393
it could be a fidget spinner,

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:40.726
it could even be painting the walls
of a school a more calming color,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.333
allowing students to thrive.

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.851
It's not that we didn't invest
in the academic tools --

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:48.476
obviously --

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.518
but we took the social tools
seriously, too.

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.934
And the results speak for themselves.

00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.226
By taking the emotional development
of our kids seriously

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.268
and helping them manage their emotions,

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.434
we saw huge growth
in our reading and math scores,

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:05.643
far exceeding the one year
of expected growth

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.292
and outscoring many schools
with our same demographic.

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.768
The second thing we did
to help our kids manage their emotions

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:15.476
was we used leverage.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.434
As a not-so-funded public school,

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:20.018
we didn't have the support staff

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:23.226
to address the chaos that our kids
might be facing at home,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.143
and we certainly weren't trained
or funded to address it directly.

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:29.643
So we started to reach out
to local groups,

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:30.976
community agencies,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.292
and even the Ohio State University.

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:36.518
Our partnership
with the Ohio State University

00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:38.184
afforded us college students

00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:40.101
not only studying education

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:43.518
but also school psychology
and school social work.

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:46.143
These students were paired
with our teachers

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.393
to help our most struggling students.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.143
And everyone benefitted

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:54.268
because our teachers got access
to the latest college-level thinking,

00:08:54.292 --> 00:08:57.934
and those college students
got real-world, life experiences

00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.208
in the classroom.

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:03.601
Our partnership with our local
Nationwide Children's Hospital

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:07.226
afforded us -- they're building us
a health clinic within our school,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.333
providing health and mental health
resources for our students.

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:14.351
And our kids benefitted from this, too.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:16.542
Our absences continued to go down,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.518
and our kids had access to counseling

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:22.667
that they could access
during the school day.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:28.726
And perhaps the biggest change
was not in D or in the kids at all.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.518
It was in the adults in the room.

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:32.851
Teachers are typically good

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:35.934
at planning for and delivering
academic instruction,

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.268
but when you throw in disruptive behavior,

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:41.208
it can feel completely outside
the scope of the job.

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:45.559
But by us taking the emotional development
of our kids seriously,

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:48.018
we moved from a philosophy of exclusion --

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:49.684
you disrupt, get out --

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.143
to one of trust and respect.

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:53.559
It wasn't easy,

00:09:53.583 --> 00:09:54.934
but we felt at heart,

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.768
it was a positive way to make change,

00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:00.583
and I'm in awe at the teachers
that took that leap with me.

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:04.476
As part of our personal
professional development plan,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.476
we studied the research of Dr. Bruce Perry

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.351
and his research on the effects
of different childhood experiences

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.042
on the developing child's brain.

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:18.559
And what we learned was that
some of our students' experiences,

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:20.684
such as an absent parent,

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:22.018
chaotic home life,

00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:23.851
poverty and illness,

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:27.059
create real trauma on developing brains.

00:10:27.083 --> 00:10:28.458
Yes, trauma.

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:30.934
I know it's a very strong word,

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.726
but it helped us to reframe and understand
the behaviors that we were seeing.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.518
And those difficult home experiences

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:42.184
created real barbed-wire
barriers to learning,

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.250
and we had to figure out a way over it.

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:48.601
So our teachers continued
to practice with lesson plans,

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:51.351
doing shorter lesson plans
with a single focus,

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:53.226
allowing kids to engage,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.351
and continued to incorporate
these movement breaks,

00:10:56.375 --> 00:11:01.393
allowing kids to jump up and down in class
and dance for two minutes straight,

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:06.559
because we learned that taking breaks
helps the learner retain new information.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.768
And might I add that the "Cha-Cha Slide"
provides a perfect short dance party.

00:11:10.792 --> 00:11:12.559
(Laughter)

00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.226
I saw teachers say,
"What happened to you?"

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.976
instead of "What's wrong with you?"

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.958
or "How can I help you?"
instead of "Get out."

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:25.893
And this investment in our kids
made huge differences,

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:29.542
and we continue to see rises
in our academic scores.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.351
I'm happy to say that when D
got to fourth grade,

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.934
he rarely got into trouble.

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.226
He became a leader in the school,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.059
and this behavior became contagious
with other students.

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:45.059
We saw and felt our school climate
continue to improve,

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:49.184
making it a happy and safe place
not only for children

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.518
but for adults,

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:52.792
despite any outside influence.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.226
Fast-forward to today,

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.351
I now work with an alternative
education program

00:11:58.375 --> 00:11:59.726
with high school students

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.583
who struggle to function
in traditional high school setting.

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:06.351
I recently reviewed
some of their histories.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:09.476
Many of them are 17 to 18 years old,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.184
experimenting with drugs,

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:13.601
in and out of the juvenile
detention system

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:14.917
and expelled from school.

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:21.184
And what I discovered was that many
of them exhibit the same behaviors

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:22.958
that I saw in six-year-old D.

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:26.184
So I can't help but wonder:

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:30.893
if these kids would've learned
healthy coping strategies early on

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.268
when times get tough,

00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:35.333
would they now be able to survive
in a regular high school?

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:38.018
I can't say for sure,

00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:41.184
but I have to tell you
I believe that it would've helped.

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:44.643
And it's time for all of us to take
the social and emotional development

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.208
of our kids seriously.

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:53.309
The time is now for us to step up
and say what we need to do for our kids.

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:57.143
If we teach kids how to read
and write, and they graduate

00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:59.643
but yet they don't know
how to manage emotions,

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.018
what will our communities look like?

00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.309
I tell people:

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:07.101
you can invest now or you will pay later.

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:10.559
The time is now
for us to invest in our kids.

00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.684
They're our future citizens,

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:15.875
not just numbers
that can or cannot pass a test.

00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:18.018
Thank you.

00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:20.583
(Applause and cheers)
