00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
In the UK and many other countries

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.720
houses are expensive

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.460
very expensive

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.960
prices have been rising consistently for many decades

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.880
In England, prices rose by 4255% between 1971 and 2011

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.680
If the price of a supermarket chicken had inflated by the same rate,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.780
It would cost 51 pounds and 18 pence by now

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.840
Around 1950, you could get a 3 bedroom house in northwest London

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.560
on the northern line, between West Finchley and Woodside Park

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.180
for just £1050

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.940
This was 2.5 times the average wage of £400 a year

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.060
The head teacher of the local school could very comfortably have bought this kind of house

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.780
with a total mortgage somewhere around twice their annual salary

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.760
Today, a similar house, in the same area, would cost close to one million pounds,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.860
forty times the average income.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.520
It's nearly ten times the salary of the local head teacher

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.200
house prices in the UK haven't just increased, they have skyrocketed

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.340
But why is housing so expensive?

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.620
The cost of houses has very little to do with the building materials

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.540
The value is almost all in the land on which the house sits

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.780
So why does land cost so much?

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.180
One reason is that demand for housing keeps growing.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.000
The UK population increases by between 300 and 400 thousand people a year

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200
And also, the number of people in each household is getting smaller

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.220
More people live alone or just as couples without children

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.120
So the demand for accommodation is growing all the time

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.980
In order to keep up with the demand the UK would need about 240 thousand new flats and houses a year

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.860
It's building less than half of this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.320
That's not just a UK problem. France is building only 330 of the 500 thousand new homes needed per annum

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
Major cities fair worse

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.140
London will face a shortfall of over 700 thousand homes by 2031

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800
In response to the cost of housing crisis

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.900
governments have tried to intervene to help people to buy their own home

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.840
In the US there are schemes like the federal home loan banks

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.780
and the community reinvestment act

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.640
In the UK, there is "Help to Buy" and there are interest-free loans in France

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.980
The underlying idea is that the people would buy houses if only they had the money

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.720
But really, most governments are just crying crocodile tears about high property prices.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.240
They know that the bulk of their voters actually like expensive houses a lot

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.340
The number of people who want new houses at any time is very small, only 10% or so.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.480
In relation to the huge numbers who already have a home.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.840
And therefore, the property-owning side of society has a vested interest in seeing the value of homes go up

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.300
Creating easy credit doesn't actually make housing more affordable,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.100
the real issue is one of supply

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.980
if we simply ease credit without increasing supply,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.200
you'll just stoke house inflation, which is precisely what's happened

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.900
It's the same with the big expansion of mortgage lending

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.660
You may be able to borrow more, but so can other people

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.440
You're all chasing the same limited number of homes

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.460
so this just pushes prices up and up

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.360
So why is building houses so difficult?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.800
Well, because there is enormous opposition to the building of new homes

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.280
and great restrictions on the use of land

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.320
There are lots of immediate answers to do with planning regulations and zoning, but dig deeper

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.040
and what we have really are society-wide fears of new housing

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.760
For one large reason above all others, because almost all new housing development are very, very ugly

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.580
And no one in their right mind wants a new development anywhere near them

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.640
Most of the large housing developments built in the southeast of england in the last 25 years

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.200
share one common, generally undiscussed feature

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.920
they're very ugly.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.800
Or, to be more precise, they're far uglier than the countryside that they've replaced

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.360
In the mid 18th century,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.100
people looked on without dismay,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.900
as the hills around the little town of Bath were given up to Queens Square, the Royal Crescent

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.200
and Somerset Place

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.420
Likewise, a little further back,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.760
when the wetlands, scrubby weed beds and sandy islands at the mouth of the river Po

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.960
were sacrificed to urban expansion,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.460
few people were likely to have raised protests,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.020
given what would come to replace them, the city of Venice

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.880
History shows us that people don't object to new housing per se,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.080
They object when the houses are less beautiful

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.700
than the natural landscape they have devoured.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.980
This starts to isolate the cause of expensive houses,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.500
as well as point the way to a solution to the issue

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.420
It is, literally, ugliness, that is largely to blame for the  current social catastrophe of high house prices

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.300
What seems like negative and entrenched nimbyism (not in my back yard)

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.580
is at heart an inarticulated, disguised

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.780
but understandable plea for grace, elegance and a touch of grandeur in architecture

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.720
We love towns and cities,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.320
when they're attractive.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.740
But we've no confidence we can make today the kinds of places we actually really like.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740
And the reason for that has nothing to do with prices

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.620
The argument isn't that we should build replicas of Georgian crescents

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.400
let alone rows of canal-sided gothic palaces

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.420
anymore than it would be an idea for someone who loves the english language

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.580
to begin addressing strangers in shakespearean dialect

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.880
The answer is to create housing developments in the best architectural idiom of our times

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.740
Places like, for example, the exceptional Accordia housing scheme in the suburbs of Cambridge

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.560
to which, unsurprisingly, no one objected

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.820
Solving the housing crisis requires that we get better at grasping the nature of the problem we're facing

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.840
The issue isn't stopping selfishness

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.440
it's a longing that we shouldn't build unless we can build beautifully

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.020
Crack that and no one will mind a fell trees to much, and  mortgages will come down too

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.600
So, what's the solution?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.300
It's to stop thinking that creating credit for house purchases does anything: it just stokes house inflation

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.540
What we should be doing is creating not-for-profit housing corporations that are incentivised by volumes,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.940
rather than prices reached

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.300
And most importantly,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.440
we should build so beautifully that no one minds a patch of land near them being developed

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.700
Tantalizingly,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.440
all this,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.440
could be done.
