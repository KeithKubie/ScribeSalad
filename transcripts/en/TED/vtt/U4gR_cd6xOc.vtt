00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.240
Words matter.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.656
They can heal

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.960
and they can kill ...

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.960
yet, they have a limit.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
When I was in eighth grade,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.616
my teacher gave me a vocabulary sheet

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.200
with the word "genocide."

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.760
I hated it.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.320
The word genocide is clinical ...

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.000
overgeneral ...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.776
bloodless ...

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.640
dehumanizing.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.800
No word

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.416
can describe

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.560
what this does to a nation.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.896
You need to know,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.600
in this kind of war,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.600
husbands kills wives,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.080
wives kill husbands,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.960
neighbors and friends kill each other.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.960
Someone

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.336
in power

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.560
says,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.160
"Those over there ...

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.800
they don't belong.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.040
They're not human."

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360
And people believe it.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.096
I don't want words

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.640
to describe this kind of behavior.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.320
I want words to stop it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.480
But where are the words to stop this?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.400
And how do we find the words?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.760
But I believe, truly,
we have to keep trying.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.600
I was born in Kigali, Rwanda.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.240
I felt loved by my entire family

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.600
and my neighbors.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.296
I was constantly
being teased by everybody,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.920
especially my two older siblings.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.200
When I lost my front tooth,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.536
my brother looked at me and said,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.160
"Oh, it has happened to you, too?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.416
It will never grow back."

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.456
(Laughter)

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.696
I enjoyed playing everywhere,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.720
especially my mother's garden
and my neighbor's.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.560
I loved my kindergarten.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.856
We sang songs,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.136
we played everywhere

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.640
and ate lunch.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.936
I had a childhood

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.680
that I would wish for anyone.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.400
But when I was six,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.016
the adults in my family
began to speak in whispers

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.880
and shushed me any time
that I asked a question.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.256
One night,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.960
my mom and dad came.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.920
They had this strange look
when they woke us.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.936
They sent my older sister Claire and I
to our grandparent's,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.880
hoping whatever was happening
would blow away.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.680
Soon we had to escape from there, too.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.816
We hid,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.056
we crawled,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.360
we sometimes ran.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840
Sometimes I heard laughter

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.400
and then screaming and crying

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.120
and then noise that I had never heard.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.216
You see,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.120
I did not know

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.680
what those noises were.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.856
They were neither human --

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.360
and also at the same time,
they were human.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.480
I saw people who were not breathing.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.760
I thought they were asleep.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.376
I still didn't understand what death was,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.920
or killing in itself.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.256
When we would stop
to rest for a little bit

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.216
or search for food,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.176
I would close my eyes,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.736
hoping when I opened them,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.160
I would be awake.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.840
I had no idea which direction was home.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.760
Days were for hiding

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.040
and night for walking.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.296
You go from a person who's away from home

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.560
to a person with no home.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.856
The place that is supposed to want you

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.560
has pushed you out,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.920
and no one takes you in.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.120
You are unwanted

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.600
by anyone.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.080
You are a refugee.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.456
From age six to 12,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.760
I lived in seven different countries,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.760
moving from one refugee camp to another,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.160
hoping we would be wanted.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.576
My older sister Claire,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.480
she became a young mother ...

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.440
and a master at getting things done.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.816
When I was 12,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.560
I came to America with Claire
and her family on refugee status.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.616
And that's only the beginning,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.656
because even though I was 12 years old,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.896
sometimes I felt like three years old

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920
and sometimes 50 years old.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.776
My past receded,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.016
grew jumbled,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.240
distorted.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.056
Everything was too much

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.440
and nothing.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.016
Time seemed like pages torn out of a book

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.920
and scattered everywhere.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.400
This still happens to me
standing right here.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.880
After I got to America,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.880
Claire and I did not talk about our past.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.616
In 2006,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.320
after 12 years

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.336
being separated away from my family,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.136
and then seven years
knowing that they were dead

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.000
and them thinking that we were dead,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.680
we reunited ...

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.960
in the most dramatic,
American way possible.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.776
Live,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.416
on television --

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.576
(Laughter)

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.016
on "The Oprah Show."

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.856
(Laughter)

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.280
(Applause)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.936
I told you, I told you.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.280
(Laughter)

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.680
But after the show,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.816
as I spent time with my mom and dad

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.496
and my little sister

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.400
and my two new siblings that I never met,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.360
I felt anger.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.160
I felt every deep pain in me.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.416
And I know that
there is absolutely nothing,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.640
nothing,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.496
that could restore the time
we lost with each other

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.240
and the relationship we could've had.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.656
Soon, my parents
moved to the United States,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.880
but like Claire,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.720
they don't talk about our past.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.216
They live in never-ending present.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.256
Not asking too many questions,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.720
not allowing themselves to feel --

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.880
moving in small steps.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.760
None of us, of course,
can make sense of what happened to us.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.400
Though my family is alive --

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.416
yes, we were broken,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.176
and yes, we are numb

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.000
and we were silenced
by our own experience.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.320
It's not just my family.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.096
Rwanda is not the only country

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.056
where people have turned on each other

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.520
and murdered each other.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.800
The entire human race,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.896
in many ways,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.440
is like my family.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.496
Not dead;

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.576
yes, broken, numb and silenced
by the violence of the world

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.280
that has taken over.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.896
You see,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.856
the chaos of the violence continues inside

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.016
in the words we use

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.120
and the stories
we create every single day.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.096
But also on the labels
that we impose on ourselves

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.480
and each other.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.416
Once we call someone "other,"

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.776
"less than,"

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.056
"one of them"

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.440
or "better than,"

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.840
believe me ...

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
under the right condition,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.560
it's a short path to more destruction.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.696
More chaos

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.056
and more noise

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.280
that we will not understand.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.120
Words will never be enough

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.816
to quantify and qualify
the many magnitudes

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.840
of human-caused destruction.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.840
In order for us

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.240
to stop the violence
that goes on in the world,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.336
I hope --

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.896
at least I beg you --

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.200
to pause.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.000
Let's ask ourselves:

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.400
Who are we without words?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.760
Who are we without labels?

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.720
Who are we in our breath?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.440
Who are we in our heartbeat?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.760
(Applause)
