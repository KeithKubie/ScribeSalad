00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:02.236
- YO, AMERICA.
WHAT IT IS.

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:06.974
IT'S JAH-BOY
ADAM "SO FINE" DEVINE,

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:10.444
AND I'M HERE TO WEL-CON-UM YOU
TO <i>HOUSE PAR--</i>

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.245
AAH!

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:12.446
I HATE IT.
I HATE IT.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.081
IT'S STUPID.
CUT.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.883
- CUT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.050
- OKAY, WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.118
YOU'RE SITTING OVER THERE

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.520
THROWING OUT BAD VIBES TO ME

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.488
WHEN I'M GIVING MY ALL
TO THIS SHOW.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.590
I NEED A DIRECTOR
WHO'S MORE DYNAMIC,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.093
WHO THROWS MORE "SNAPABILITY"
INTO THE SITUATION.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.628
- "SNAPABILITY" IS NOT A WORD,
ADAM.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.730
- HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
A DIRECTOR

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.465
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
DIRECTING WORDS...

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.267
- OH, JESUS CHRIST.
- LIKE "SNAPABILITY"?

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.835
OKAY, IF I WERE TO DIRECT
THESE EPISODES,

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:37.037
THEY'D PROBABLY MOST LIKELY
BE THE BEST ONES EVER,

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.539
BECAUSE I HAVE
A CREATIVE SPARK

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.807
BURNING IN MY HEAD
AND MY HEART AREA,

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.943
UNLIKE SOMEONE I KNOW,
WHICH IS WHO YOU ARE.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.711
- ALL RIGHT, ADAM.
THEN YOU DIRECT THE SHOW.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.480
YOU DIRECT THE SHOW, MAN.
- FINE, I WILL.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.482
- HERE'S YOUR DUMBASS
LITTLE SCRIPT ON THE GROUND.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.717
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT A--I ACTUALLY
WORKED KIND OF HARD ON THAT.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.286
- SHUT UP, DUDE. I'M OUT.
- YOU SHUT UP.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:53.554
I'M GOING TO THE BAYOU.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.189
I'M GONNA WRESTLE GATORS
AND SHIT.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.723
HAVE FUN.
- I WILL HAVE FUN.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.592
- BYE, MIKEY.
SEE YOU, GOONERS.

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.427
- AH, COOL.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.429
'SUP, DUDE?
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.898
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.400
OH!

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.067
