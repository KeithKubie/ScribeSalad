MALE SPEAKER: A few weeks
ago, I went to a comedy show

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:04.759
in the city, and I got
talking to this Irish guy who

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.300
had this very
interesting background.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.350
He had this debilitating
fear of public speaking.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.370
So the obvious way to
approach conquering that fear

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.390
is, of course, becoming
a stand-up comedian.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.560
So as a non-comedian,
he pretended

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.040
to be a stand-up comedian
for a year to get over

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.020
his fear of public speaking.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.400
An interesting
way to attack it--

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.370
but in the process of
doing that, he learned

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.050
a lot about comedy techniques,
about stand-up techniques,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.090
and about public
speaking in general.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.189
And he took all
these ideas, and he

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.730
thought about how to make more
effective presentations, which

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.350
we had a long discussion
about because I care deeply

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.950
about public
presentations and humor

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.520
and how to make them
all more engaging.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.730
And he took that information.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.424
He wrapped it up
to it into a book.

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:49.840
And I thought, well, that
sounds like an interesting book.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.226
I'd like to read it someday.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.320
So three days later, there was
an internal email at Google

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.560
that said, hey, there's
this author named

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.150
David Nihill who has a new book
coming out on public speaking.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.020
Would anybody like to host this?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.459
Well, that's a perfect
opportunity for me

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.530
to have an excuse to
actually read his book now.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.500
So here we are, a
few weeks later.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.420
And he's going to
tell us about how

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.720
to make more effective
presentations using techniques

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.240
of stand-up comedians.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.470
I think we all know and suffer
from public presentations that

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.900
could be a heck of a lot more
entertaining than they are.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.050
And there's no reason why
they shouldn't be, except

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.440
that maybe people don't
common techniques that

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.092
could be used to make them so.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.800
So that's sort of what
the book is about,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.910
and it's about what the
presentation is about.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.490
And please welcome David Nihill.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.780
DAVID NIHILL: Thank you.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780
Fine introduction.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.920
So I know that sounds
like the worst plan ever.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.310
You're scared of
public speaking,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.160
and you're going to pretend
to be a comedian for a year?

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.760
That does not sound
like a good idea.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.830
It 100% was not a good idea.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.170
But at least we've written
it down at this stage.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.920
Thanks for coming.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.970
I always like to ask
who thinks they're not

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.610
funny by a show of hands.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.729
So is there anyone who's
like, I'm not funny at all?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.590
So four of you are not
funny, and the rest of you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.800
are really, really funny?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.060
So this will be fine
no matter what I say.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.010
Because we can just call upon
you guys to rock it, right?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.630
Anyone else hate
public speaking?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.730
I totally hate public
speaking, which is ironic

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.600
that I'm merely
laying an egg on video

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.500
right now here
recording this one.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.000
How many?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.380
Keep the hands up.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.830
I mean like shaking the page
kind of fear public speaking?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.310
That was me, always.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.070
Nobody over here
in the States knew.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.760
Obviously I'm from Ireland
originally with a dodgy accent,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.580
and I went to
university in Ireland.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.299
And all my friends had me
nicknamed shakin' Stevens,

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.840
because whenever I
had a bit of paper

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.820
in my hand for a
presentation, public speaking,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.570
it would just start moving
around like this all the time,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.630
and I'd start sweating.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.780
And do you know this
feeling at all, anybody?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.120
And it's just getting worse.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.911
And I'm holding the
microphone, and I can't

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.370
hold it steady anymore either.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.650
It was always, always,
always that bad for me.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.140
And honestly, I would
have described it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.360
as a crippling fear.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.960
If you ask me, in any way
public speaking for you,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.570
it is a crippling fear.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.530
And that was until a rather
serious phone call that I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.287
got about a friend of mine.

00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:16.870
And it was to inform
me that he'd just

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.880
suffered a severe
spinal cord injury,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.640
and he might never walk again.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.130
And his insurance
provider cut him off,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.480
and we were trying to come
up with ways, because he

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.500
was in no way accepting
this that he was never

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.333
going to walk again.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.480
He's like, I'm going
to get back on my feet.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.830
I just need to be able to do
the rehab process to do it.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.038
So we're like, well, as his
friends, we got together.

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:37.920
We're like, let's
start doing fundraisers

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.270
to get him back on his feet.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.580
And I just happened to
live next to this guy who

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.460
was a touring comedian
and a headlining comedian.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.710
And I was like, hey,
Tim, would you by chance

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.910
do this comedy show
fundraiser we're going to do?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.570
I don't know anything about
organizing it or anything,

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.660
but let's do it.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.832
And he said yes.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.290
And all my friends
were like, well,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.940
you're naturally
pretty talkative, you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.231
are going to be the host
because you are organizing it.

00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:01.794
And I was like, I am not hosting
that never, absolutely no way.

00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:03.210
And they were all
just kept at me.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.630
No, no, you have to.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.430
And up to that moment, I
was like there's no way.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.420
I can describe this as
a fear that's crippling.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.510
I mean, faced with a
more serious impact--

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.269
the real impact of that
word, I was like, all right,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.579
time to get over this.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.634
So I went, and I did this.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.050
And I was looking
right-- if I had

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.850
to get good at public
speaking quickly

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.558
and had to get over
this fear, like who's

00:04:24.558 --> 00:04:25.820
the best person to study?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.570
Like, where do I get
the information from?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.470
There's books out there.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.720
I don't want to read them all.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.950
I don't really have time.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.910
Where do I get it from?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.080
Who are the true masters?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.570
So I was thinking,
well, comedians

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.620
are probably the true
masters of public speaking.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.514
I just read a lot of
Malcolm Gladwell, which

00:04:38.514 --> 00:04:39.930
I'm sure you're
very familiar with

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.330
and his 10,000 hour rule
that makes a master.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.850
Well, comedians are on stage
more than anybody else.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.720
They take people to
a range of emotions

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.309
more so than anybody else.

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.600
Let me see what I can get from.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.547
It's a comedy show anyway.

00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:53.130
So it'll be pretty
useful, and I don't

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.570
want to be that one funny
nervous guy with the shakin'

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.542
Stevens moves and
see what happens.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:04:59.500
So it went really well.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.750
We raised a good chunk
of money, totally packed.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.264
And it went so well that the
main comedian asked me, like,

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:06.680
literally, like,
hey, Dave, do you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.890
want to open for me at
the Punchline Comedy

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.010
Club in a couple of weeks?

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.680
And I was like, do I tell him
that I haven't got a clue?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.160
I was like, nah.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.270
Yeah, sure, I'll do that.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.970
So I did it.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.962
And I'd just been
reading-- he's an author.

00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:21.670
I'm sure he's been
here at Google before.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.720
You might be familiar
with his work, AJ Jacobs.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.240
He's very much referenced
by in Tim Ferriss's books.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.810
He was known for going deep
into a topic for a year

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.060
and writing about it.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.125
And I read his books.

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:33.250
And he'd just done "The
Year of Living Biblically,"

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.830
where even though he was Jewish,
followed the rules of the Bible

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.010
to the letter of the law,
like so much so he was out

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.400
throwing stones at adulterers.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.660
It was pretty cool.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.967
I was like, right.

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:46.550
Maybe I'll keep this
going for a year.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.940
Maybe I'll get
Tim Ferriss on it.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.240
I was very influenced by
him breaking things down,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.010
80/20 principle,
trying to figure out

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.010
what are the techniques
that are most effective.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.350
And I'll do it for a full year.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.380
And I was like, well, I've
just left a corporate job.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.880
And if I tell my
friends I'm going

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.230
to put all my effort into
being a comedian for a year

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.480
with actually no objective of
being a full time comedian,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.300
and very little potential income
from this choice for a year,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.076
they're going to
think I am bonkers.

00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:10.950
So I was like, I better
make up a stage name,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.110
because I don't want people
tagging me on Facebook doing

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.151
all this comedy stuff,
and I hate public speaking

00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:16.390
in the first place.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.060
So I got a bit carried away.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.500
And we came up with Irish Dave.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.450
That was the comedian.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.080
And this kind of
became the book,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.580
was my learning along the way.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.610
But here I got very much
carried away with this.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.420
Irish Dave doesn't sound like
the most novel stage name

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.240
to an Irish person,
but Americans seem

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.620
to like it for some reason.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.330
And I went as an
accomplished comedian.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.455
So I was trying to make it
known that I was already

00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:39.880
well-versed in
comedy because it's

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.190
much easier to get booked in
clubs and festivals that way.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.740
So this was one
of the first shows

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.690
I managed to get booked
on, a real highlight.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.850
You can see "Estrogen Entree
with a Side of Balls."

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.590
I got to be that side of balls.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.030
As you can see
with all the ladies

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.320
names, a real proud
moment for my parents.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.980
I can imagine--
David, glad to see

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.390
you've left your corporate job.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.580
When are you going back
to it again, please?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.610
[INAUDIBLE] side of balls.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.020
Loads and loads of festivals,
loads of comedy clubs

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.070
all over the US.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.010
And it wasn't all totally nutty.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.899
I learned a lot along the way.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.690
And some of the cooler
ones, are any of you

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.160
familiar with NPR's The Moth,
the storytelling series--

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.690
true stories told live?

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.090
So I was trying to get on
any stage that would have me.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.070
So I went along, told
a story, and I won.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.570
And then they're
like, well, now you

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.278
have to go on our
biggest event that they

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:28.550
produce worldwide
is in San Francisco,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.820
in the Castro Theatre.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.320
So that little ant
on stage is me.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.100
And it's 1,400
people there, and I

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.860
am about to lay an
egg I am so nervous.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.520
And if you shook
my hand beforehand,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.020
you'd feel like
you'd been assaulted

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.760
by a semi-defrosted
mackerel-- like, bad.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.590
I was so nervous.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.450
But you wouldn't know it if
you were in the audience.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.960
So over a year of
experiments, I'd

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.585
learned enough to
make it at least look

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:52.230
like I was quite comfortable
where I very much was not

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.100
on stage.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.870
And telling that
story that night,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.340
I could never have predicted
what would have happened.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.626
It set off a lot of
really cool stuff

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:02.000
that I'm going to tell you
about by the end of this talk.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.370
So I just want to
give you an overview

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.828
some of the things in the book
that I learned along the way

00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:07.800
that I think you can
replicate, and in the end

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.540
we'll get some questions
going because I

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.520
know there's loads around it.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.890
But I just wanted to focus on
what were the techniques that I

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.380
was using to do
this along the way

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.210
and what I saw from comedians.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.710
Because everyone I saw
along the way in comedy,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.800
they didn't all get
famous as comedians.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.750
In fact, very few of them did.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.310
But every single one of them
got funnier along the way.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.780
They were very much showing that
there was a process behind it.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.450
All of their writing got better.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.240
So there was certain
techniques behind it.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.480
So if I said to you
you can become funnier,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.880
you'd be like, well, no.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.395
You're nuts.

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.270
Or most of you today
would be like, yeah, I'm

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.960
funny enough as
it, which is what

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.799
I got from the raise of hands.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.517
You're like, no, no no we're
all fine in this department.

00:08:45.517 --> 00:08:47.850
But comedians over time, they
all become better writers.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.800
So if I said to you you
can become a better writer,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.924
you'd say, well, of course.

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:52.740
I just need to do a
little bit every day.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.535
And that's effectively
what they did.

00:08:54.535 --> 00:08:55.910
So over the course
of the year, I

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.260
guess there was really three
key findings [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.150
So I studied all the
leading TED Talks.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.170
I studied all the most
popular business talks.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.730
And we were trying to find
trends for humor in there

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.167
because no one had done it.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:08.750
And I was like, well,
surely everybody

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.020
says humor is a key part
of talks, but is it?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.550
So sure enough, it was.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.050
All these top speakers
were using humor.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.700
They were using the exact
same techniques as comedians,

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.620
even though a lot of
them did not know it.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.400
And the nice thing for only
the four people in here

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.070
that weren't funny, you don't
need to be a natural comedian

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.880
to get laughs.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.986
I remember being at a comedy
club out in Pleasanton.

00:09:30.986 --> 00:09:32.610
And we were sitting
there, and this guy

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.340
was literally the
most boring dude

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.970
I've ever met in my
existence, like barely

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.057
conversed with anybody, just
sat there super awkward.

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:42.140
And I was like, well, is
it your first time coming

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.350
to this comedy club?

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.380
Are you enjoying it?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.673
He's like, no, I'm
here all the time.

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:46.506
It's like, oh, what?

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:47.840
He's like, yeah, I'm up next.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.270
I'm one of the comedians.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.390
It's like, whoa, this is not
going to end well for you.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:52.890
No.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.931
Did your friends tell you
to do this as a career?

00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.580
And this is a really bad choice.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.700
No, no, no, no, no.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.480
He went on stage and
absolutely crushed it.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.080
I mean, people were
belly laughing.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.090
I would have bet my house
on this guy not being funny,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.090
and he was amazing.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.510
And he was far from
the only guy I saw this

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.780
over a period of time.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.860
So people who weren't
naturally funny, chatty,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.900
witty, or outgoing off stage
were very funny on stage.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.750
And I was like, how
are they doing this?

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.250
What are they learning behind
the scenes along the way?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.029
And why would you need to do
this in a business setting?

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:24.570
We're obviously here
at Google today.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.630
A lot of you guys are
giving business talks.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.840
Why do you care about this?

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.674
Well, John Medina's work on this
is all around brain science,

00:10:31.674 --> 00:10:33.840
but it's essentially the
brain doesn't pay attention

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.280
to boring things
or dodgy accents.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.970
If you can't understand me or
you don't like what I'm saying,

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.680
you have your phone for
company at any moment.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.110
And you will whip it
out and let me know.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.715
Comedians, they say, are
judged about every 12 seconds.

00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:49.090
And we're pretty much doing
the same to business speakers

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.280
these days because
you're like, I've

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.500
got a computer in my pocket.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.700
I do not have to be listening
to this fellow who's

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.290
boring me to pieces.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.420
All right, and they're
never intentionally boring

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.690
their audience to pieces.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.530
Nobody goes on
stage to be boring.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.940
They just don't really
know the techniques

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.040
behind that that
can change it a bit.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.920
So infotainment,
basically, all of a sudden,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.970
has become our means
for getting information.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.350
So if you're competing
with where people

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.116
go for entertainment
to advertise or get

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:17.740
your content out there, whether
it's public speaking or written

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.670
content, then you
these days have

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.337
to become that entertainment.

00:11:21.337 --> 00:11:23.420
Because I'm just scrolling
through it on Facebook.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.378
And if you're trying to
get my attention there,

00:11:25.378 --> 00:11:28.230
I expect it to be some way
engaging or entertaining.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.790
So do any of you guys watch
the old school news anymore

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.660
for news?

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.282
Not so much.

00:11:33.282 --> 00:11:35.573
Does anyone get their news
from somebody like this guy?

00:11:35.573 --> 00:11:36.400
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.540
Historically, right?

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.890
I mean, that's the way
we're getting information

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.210
with a punch line.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.160
Did anybody see on late night
TV recently any political stuff,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.670
annihilation of Donald Trump
in one way by a comedian?

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.910
They released some of
President Obama's footage

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.580
today, talking
about his objections

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.060
to the Republican candidates.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.640
It was basically
stand-up comedy.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.455
It was amazing.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:58.330
The timing was there.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
The principles were
there, everything.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.300
And most of the time
he has comedy writers

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.110
writing his talk.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.150
That's why they're really good.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
Obviously he has to get
good at delivering them,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.960
and he has some huge
natural skill there.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.590
But a lot of people
will say, well,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.700
humor isn't
appropriate at my job.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.930
If the president's using humor,
you're probably going to be OK.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:16.430
All right?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.370
So you can replicate
these techniques.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.240
Anyone familiar with
Seth Godin's work?

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.030
Very, very leading marketer,
author, and blogger,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.520
you name it.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.160
His talks are so good
that even TED themselves

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.565
described him as funny.

00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:30.440
They're not my words.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.570
They're from TED's
description of his talk.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.070
And they're really,
really funny.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.420
When you actually
analyze his TED Talks,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.070
you get 3.4 laughs per minute.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.400
And that won't mean a
lot to you as a metric

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.880
until we compared
them to the three

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.420
funniest movies of all time.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.020
So if I wanted to get
laughs per minute,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.250
I would be better off
listening to a business talk

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.740
and watching it than I would be
the funniest movies ever made,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.390
which is totally insane
when you think about it.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.400
Now, we're in Google.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.700
I know there's some good
statistics heads in the room

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.230
here.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.240
You'll be like, well, it's a
longer period in the movie.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.190
It's harder to sustain a
consistent level of laughs

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.360
with a story arc.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.390
Absolutely.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.030
I belly laughed
during "The Hangover."

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.100
I didn't belly laugh during
the TED Talk, absolutely.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.330
But if you wanted just to laugh
on a laughs per minute basis

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.090
and get some good
laughs in, you're

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.830
better off watching a lot
of TED Talks these days.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.384
And his talk was
by no means alone.

00:13:24.384 --> 00:13:25.800
The good news for
us as people who

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.970
are trying to pull something
out of these techniques

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.720
is that 58% of his
laughs in that talk

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.910
came from using funny images.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.874
So if you're like, I
can't be a comedian--

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:38.290
and I'm not telling anybody
in this room to be a comedian.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.680
I'm just saying there's a
lot we can use and learn

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.400
from the techniques
that they use.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.760
Using funny images,
stuff that you

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.930
know is socially proven and
funny already and just sticking

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.830
it into your presentation,
is one of the easiest ways

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.720
ever to get laughs.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.430
And these guys are using it
at the very highest level

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.520
in TED Talks.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.570
But it gets treated
very much like a joke.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.445
So a joke is always a set-up
to something and the funny bit.

00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:03.820
So a lot of business speakers
will put the image up there

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.080
and just go, look at that.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.370
It's funny, isn't it?

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.930
And it gets a little
bit of a laugh.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.200
But if you build up that
image, like everything,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.410
the frustration I felt
that moment can all

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.450
be described by this one image,
and it's just something crazy,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.620
always a big laugh.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.130
And you literally just treat
the funny image or the content

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.165
you have as the joke.

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:22.790
You're not the one
delivering the joke.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.480
You just build up
anticipation to it.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.770
So the cool thing,
when we go into this,

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.380
and we link the
techniques he's using

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.588
and the techniques that a
lot of TED Talks are using,

00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:34.580
every single one of the top
10 TED Talks at the moment

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.870
has humor in them.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.490
Every one of them moves
the needle on humor,

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.890
and some of them at levels
that rival a stand-up comedian

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.620
and many of them
at levels that are

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.220
higher than the funniest
talks of all time.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.130
So there's a bunch
of them interchanged.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.250
These are researchers.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.920
These are not
stand-up comedians,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.780
from Sir Ken Robinson, the most
viewed TED Talk of all time,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.220
literally to Shawn Achor,
Harvard researcher, one

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.396
of the funniest TED
Talks you'll ever watch.

00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:00.770
I think it's the
11th most viewed

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.390
at all time at the moment.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.880
Does anybody know Mary
Roach's talk, particularly

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.540
about female orgasm?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.180
Any guys in the
room know that one?

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.210
[CHUCKLING]

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.260
Not one of you?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.300
Just one you-- smartest
man in the room.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.600
This is a very good time
to say I know that talk.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.900
I love that talk.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.080
Actually, I start every
day with that talk.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.870
That's how I prepare for life.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.590
You'll be a very popular
man in the dating cycle.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.550
List that as your
most common interest.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.130
I like soccer and Mary
Roach's talk about orgasm.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.500
You will see the undying dating
spike come pretty quickly.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.780
But the proof is there when
you go through all these,

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.330
and we did.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.496
And we were correlated them.

00:15:36.496 --> 00:15:37.270
They're all funny.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.380
They're all entertainment.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.230
And TED themselves are called
technology, entertainment,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.840
and design.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.670
The entertainment
level is there.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.550
My argument was that it's just
getting higher and higher.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.250
And if you're a
speaker in any way,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.440
and you go on after one of
these really funny folks,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.890
you're going to
know all about it

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.415
if you're not able to reproduce
some of those contexts.

00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:58.040
Anybody had that
happen in a conference

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.260
where you go on after
the really funny speaker?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.830
You're like, oh, no.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.910
You see them crushing it.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.080
You're like, oh no!

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.110
I don't want to go next.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.330
How do I do that?

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.900
The thing is you
can if you know some

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.582
of the techniques behind it.

00:16:10.582 --> 00:16:12.540
So what I'm going to give
you a little overview

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.710
is very much 80/20.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.964
So what was I doing fast?

00:16:14.964 --> 00:16:16.380
How was I trying
to break it down?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.580
Again, very influenced
by trying to find

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.980
the 20% of the things I
could do that would give me

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.580
80% results in the
fastest time possible.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.090
So starting with a story
was pretty much the basis

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.659
for me doing this.

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:31.200
And that was for a
number of reasons.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.741
But if you're public speaking
in any way and you're not using

00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:36.310
stories, well, then you're not
memorable in any way because I

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.490
cannot recall the information
you've just given me as a bunch

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.160
of numbers, facts, and figures.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.230
If I tell you a story about the
customer problem, the solution

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.100
I've solved, whatever
acquisition it was,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.990
whatever challenge
that you're working on,

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.970
now my mind can actually
process and remember that.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.636
And if you're public
speaking and no one

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.360
can remember what you
said, then were you

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.610
even there in the first place?

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.390
I am today because I'm
on video somewhere.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.147
But most of the time, you
don't leave as much of a trail.

00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:01.230
So it's very important to
deliver your information

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.080
in a memorable way.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.280
We know our mind
works like that.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.250
I don't know how we have
for Spanish speakers

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.700
in the room-- any
Spanish speakers?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.480
The word for "to put"
in Spanish is caber.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.869
And if I'm trying to teach
someone that word-- there's

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.030
a lot of non-speakers?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.990
Most of you guys?

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.750
Si, senor.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.250
All right.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.869
Nicely done.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.660
I don't want to have
an Irish person trying

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.967
to speak Spanish in here--
never going to end well.

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:27.300
But if I'm trying to teach
you that word just as a word,

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.970
nearly impossible to
remember literally by itself

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.960
and to recall.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.150
But if I give you some
context around that,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.000
and we break it up in
a way that your mind's

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.660
able to remember
it-- so this example

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.020
I've taken from Benny Lewis
who is an Irishman who

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.250
speaks 12 languages.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.900
And he's the first one since
James Joyce to do that.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.760
So he's probably
worth listening to.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.040
And his stuff is really
good around the topic.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.360
But literally we take
the word caber to fit,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.290
and we make up a
crazy story around it.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.466
So we literally picture a
yellow New York taxi car,

00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:56.090
pulling over on the
side of the street.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.010
And then we picture
a big hairy bear

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.880
trying to get in the
window of the taxi cab,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.671
because he doesn't know
how to work a door.

00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:03.670
And his bottom is
taken out the window,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.820
hairy bottom in the wind, and
the taxi driver is going crazy.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.430
And maybe he's from somewhere
in Russia or somewhere Eastern

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.960
European.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.834
He's like, hey, bear!

00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:11.960
Get out of taxicab.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.460
You cannot fit in taxi!

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.420
It's a very bad
accent, to be honest,

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.310
but it's the best I'm going to
be able to do for the moment.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.250
And right, you're like, the
bear does not fit in the cab.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.330
Caber, caber is the
word for it to fit.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.944
And if I ask you
that ever again,

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:27.610
what's the word for
"to fit" in Spanish?

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.560
You will know it.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.780
You won't know it instantly,
but it will take you one

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.710
to two seconds to put the
story together in your head.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.690
So what we want to do in
trying to be funny in any way

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.270
or trying to be
memorable-- remember,

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.820
this and the book and the
objective is not to be funny.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.070
It's to be engaging.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.690
And the easiest
way to be engaging

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.520
is to go for fun
before funny and use

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.127
your own personal stories
because they're unique to you.

00:18:50.127 --> 00:18:51.710
So anyone will say,
oh, I tell a joke.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.376
You know the moment
your boss calls you,

00:18:53.376 --> 00:18:56.060
and he's like, hey, I
got a good joke for you.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.660
You're just like-- I know
it's not going to be funny.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.610
I know based on historically
you just make a decision.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.160
You see the joke
coming, and you've

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.360
assumed it's either going
to be funny or un-funny.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.800
But there was a moment where you
had a chance to get off the bus

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.383
or get out of the office and go,
I need to get away from this.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.400
This is going to be bad.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.150
The nice thing when
you're telling a story

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.419
is everybody loves a story.

00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.710
We've never had those moments
in life where we're like,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.760
shut up telling me that story!

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.072
I hate stories.

00:19:21.072 --> 00:19:22.030
All right, nobody does.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.360
Your mind is just naturally
wired to appreciate them.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.860
So if I'm not trying to be funny
in any way, shape, or form,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.950
and I do it in the
form of a story that

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.310
just happens to be
funny, there is no risk

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.320
anymore to not being funny.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.710
What happens if you
don't laugh at my story?

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.090
I just told you a
story, no downside,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.690
more exciting than
your pie chart,

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.160
or your graph, or your
list of facts and figures,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.260
and more engaging.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.720
And now if we can find
out a sneaky structure

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.200
to make that story
funny, now is where

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.070
we use some comedic techniques.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.330
The nice thing about your
stories are extremely unique,

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.880
personable to your own
style, and literally

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.350
can't be copied by anyone else.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.190
They're yours.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.110
And the really nice thing
with public speaking

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.859
for the nervous public
speakers out there,

00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:07.610
when you're telling your
story, your own stuff,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.650
and you screw it up, and
you say something wrong

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.940
or you leave out
something, what happens?

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.910
Nothing.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.990
Nobody knows whatsoever that you
just messed up your own story.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.994
You're the only person
that knows that content.

00:20:18.994 --> 00:20:20.910
And you don't have to
stock with your stories.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.034
You can draw on things that
you really like around.

00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:25.130
But if it's your stories,
ultimately your audience

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.770
wants to know a
little bit about you.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.150
And your stories make it cool.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.614
They get to know you a bit.

00:20:29.614 --> 00:20:31.030
They get to feel
for you, and they

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.250
get to relate to you
in a little bit way.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.730
The most powerful thing you
can ever do with story telling

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.770
is to allow the listener to see
themselves within your story.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.930
So if you do that in
any way, shape, or form,

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.080
you're already creating a memory
that they're like, oh, yeah.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.600
I remember.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.559
I felt something
during that talk.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.600
So literally, when we're
trying to be funny fast,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.120
80/20 principle style, we
take a list of our stories,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.520
and we put them through
comedy writing techniques.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.490
So if I say to you now,
tell me a funny story,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.080
you'd be like, no.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.850
And that's what everyone,
even a comedian,

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.170
someone who's performing a
story, tell me a funny story

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:03.530
right now.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.946
Automatically the
mind goes blank.

00:21:04.946 --> 00:21:05.750
I've got nothing.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.840
And honestly, if I ask
you, tell me a funny story,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.230
do you have anything in life?

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.290
Most of you will be
like, oh, I don't know.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.390
What comedians and performers
are amazing at doing

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.130
is literally keeping a list
on a smartphone or device

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.560
that's like a funny story file.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.850
And every time they see
anything remotely funny,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.430
they're like shut up.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.930
Stop.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.140
I need to make a note
of this, and they do.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.940
And every time they
listen to a podcast,

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.330
or NPR, Snap Judgment, a
storytelling series, every time

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.170
they see a stand-up comedian and
it jogs a memory in their mind,

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.230
they write it down.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.700
And all of a sudden, you
have a mountain of material

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.320
from your own life that's
highly personable to you

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.620
that's more engaging than
the average little factoid.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.430
And you can link
those and literally

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.702
build your own
presentations around them.

00:21:44.702 --> 00:21:47.160
And that's what we were seeing
in the most successful talks

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.590
when we were studying, that
these guys were a shoe horning

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.170
stories they like to
tell, just in linking it

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.419
to business topics.

00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:55.960
And you'll always say, I'm not
sure there's a way to do that.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.220
And in the book, I listed
all sorts of ways to do that.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.011
But any story about
anything that you think

00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:02.230
is not appropriate you
can link that to work,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.434
absolutely, no problem.

00:22:03.434 --> 00:22:05.100
So we were taking
these lists of stories

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.684
that everybody thinks
they don't have.

00:22:06.684 --> 00:22:08.850
At the moment, are you still
like, oh, I don't know.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.910
I got nothing funny.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.300
Most embarrassing thing
that ever happened to you?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.160
First date you ever went on?

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.880
First blind date
you ever went on?

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.680
Strange Skype call
with your parents

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.300
where that drove
you crazy trying

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.240
to teach them how to work Skype
or trying to turn on the video?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.180
Inappropriate text messages
you received by accident

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.560
from your friends or when
somebody just had to retype,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.000
the respell, the autocorrect
on there do it for them?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.860
That time you tried to
learn a new language

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.151
and you said the wrong word,
and it didn't end so well.

00:22:35.151 --> 00:22:36.350
First day at work.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.730
Strangest customer
you ever came across.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.379
All of a sudden you're
kind of like, OK.

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:41.920
Yeah, I know.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.003
I definitely have stories.

00:22:43.003 --> 00:22:45.440
And they're the coolest stories
because they're relatable.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.827
So if I tell you a great
story about me being in China,

00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:48.910
you're like, that's great.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.670
I don't care.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.620
Unless you've been to
China or you're Chinese

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.036
or you're interested
in it, I need

00:22:53.036 --> 00:22:56.400
to give you a reason to get
on board, that you relate to

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.900
in a way.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.240
So an opening set up becomes
very important to allow

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.650
you to tell a story.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:03.060
So if I tell the story
about China, don't care.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.310
But if I can make that
relatable to you in a way

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.460
that you all go, OK, so if
I'm like, being in a new place

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.740
can be challenging, being in a
new place can be uncomfortable,

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.820
this time I was in China--
now your opening statement

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.320
was appealing to the whole room.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.940
You didn't shut everybody off.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.440
And you're very
much not just trying

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.010
to be Jerry Seinfeld
or something

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.380
by making a comment that's kind
of controversial or Louie CK

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.359
and be like, Oakland
is a crazy place!

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.900
And then people are
like, oh, no, no,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.941
from Oakland in the room.

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:31.110
You just lost half the room.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.110
And while comedians will
do what their skill is,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.030
they'll bring that back.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.363
And everybody laughs in the end.

00:23:35.363 --> 00:23:36.009
It's all happy.

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:37.550
We as business
speakers are not going

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.380
to be doing that whatsoever.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.220
Stay away from it.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.610
We just tell stories.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.170
There's no strong
opinions in them.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.800
You have no chance
of running the risk.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.090
And that way there's
no nervousness

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.049
when you're using it in
a business environment.

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:50.548
And to do that, we literally
just put it through a structure

00:23:50.548 --> 00:23:51.930
that comedians use all the time.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.550
So the reason to tell
the story, what's

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:58.260
the key funny part in the story,
and then any other little lines

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.020
afterwards that are kind of
engaging or funny that you can

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:01.610
say.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.490
So a comedic delivery
can always be

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.880
refined to a set up,
the punchline which

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.450
is the funny part of your
joke, and then the tagline.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.650
And comedians will
literally force themselves

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.990
to be really concise.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.620
Business speakers, not so much.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.620
Comedians are losing
people every 12 seconds,

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.828
so they get very good at
delivering that content very

00:24:19.828 --> 00:24:20.340
fast.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.840
And obviously for a business
audience with these techniques,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.480
in any way or
anyone speaking, you

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.980
don't have an unscheduled
amount of time.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.897
You've got to be pretty
tight in your content.

00:24:28.897 --> 00:24:30.396
But again, we're
going to take that,

00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:31.990
and we're going to
rewrite your story

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.999
to delay the funny
component in your story.

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:37.540
You ever seen somebody getting
a laugh on the business stage,

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.310
and then the whole audience
laughs, and they keep talking?

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.690
And then the whole audience
stops all of a sudden

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.800
to listen to them.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.300
Why?

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.180
There's a really cool
expression that's

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.180
called the end of
laughter is followed

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.090
by the height of listening.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.900
So the most attentive
your mind will ever be

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.330
is that moment after you've
laughed because you're like,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.657
give me more of that!

00:24:56.657 --> 00:24:58.490
Compared to your average
business conference

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.670
you've been to, you're
like, oh my god.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.640
Wait, was that funny?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.350
That was good.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.120
I want more.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.060
I need more of that.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.860
And you get really, really
attentive to the next words.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.850
So comedic performers,
and comedic copywriters,

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.350
and anyone who's good, did you
ever see somebody on stage,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.820
and you're like his,
delivery was amazing?

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.146
He has really good timing.

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.020
Comedians, you're like,
that was really good.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.900
President Obama, the video
today that I watched,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.090
all the comments--
timing was amazing.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.950
But you can impact that timing
by taking out the funny bit

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.456
and sticking it at the
end of the sentence.

00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:28.830
Literally, what's
the funny word?

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.710
And how do I hide
that till the end?

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.730
And if you say the funny word
last, second to last, last two

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.890
or three words,
then you just stop

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.470
and you allow people to react.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.732
If it's your story,
you know more or less

00:25:39.732 --> 00:25:40.940
where they're going to react.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.660
You've told it to
your family before.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.480
If you had to force it to one
key element, what would it be?

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.590
You kind of know that people
might laugh or respond on this.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.340
And now you literally
go out of your way

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.510
to structure the sentence so
the key word is at the end.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.994
When the key word is at the
end, you just kind of sit back,

00:25:55.994 --> 00:25:56.910
and you're like, yeah.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.170
And you let people allow
that time to react.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.919
And when that happens,
everyone goes away.

00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:02.990
And they're like, his
timing was really good.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.990
I wanted to show you a
great example of this,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.250
and it was from
President Obama himself

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.270
in Congress, delivering it.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.520
But it's very hard to get
the copyright permission

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.730
to show you that video,
so what I've done

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.750
is I've basically
convinced a friend of mine

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.870
to recreate it
for you, and we're

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.450
going to watch a very
low quality, low budget

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.940
production that
took approximately

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.670
six seconds to put together.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.770
And you're going to notice
that in this, President Obama,

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:32.390
well, to be honest and frankly
truthful, he's Indian in this.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.110
And we figured, well,
with the growth of tech

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.090
and the demand for
programmers in Fremont,

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.850
it's only a matter
of time before you

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.860
have an Indian
president anyway, so you

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.881
should be comfortable
with that, that's fine.

00:26:43.881 --> 00:26:44.380
Good!

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.300
So just have a look at this.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.000
But this is the
actual words that he

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.130
said in Congress that day,
and just pay attention

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.200
for how good the timing
is going to look.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.660
Very high budget.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.590
And then there's my
favorite example.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.080
The Interior Department
is in charge of salmon,

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.200
while they're in freshwater.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.980
But the Commerce
Department handles them

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.550
when they're in saltwater.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.510
I hear it gets even
more complicated

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.510
once they're smoked.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.786
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.350
All right, completely terrible
with awkward look at the end

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.850
there.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:19.930
That's my friend Richard.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.110
He is a programmer at Yahoo.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.646
He's a also very, very,
very, very funny comedian.

00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:26.020
But unfortunately,
we had to work

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.480
with the actual words in that
because we wanted to recreate

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.650
it accurately for you guys.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.025
But you notice
the word "smoked,"

00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:34.346
he's really gone out of his
way to put it as the last word.

00:27:34.346 --> 00:27:36.220
And when you look up
that video for yourself,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.780
the actual real
video of it, you'll

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.844
see President Obama just
kind of kicking back.

00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:41.510
Because he knows
what's going to happen.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.750
They're going to laugh.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.230
And if I said, and when they're
smoked, it's even more crazy,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.180
or when they're smoked
it's even more insane,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.554
or when they're
smoked something,

00:27:49.554 --> 00:27:51.960
once I say the word "smoked,"
you know it's a joke.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.970
You start to laugh.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:53.800
I keep talking.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.530
You stop laughing.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.870
And you start listening again.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.750
So I've actually
stopped the laughter,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.540
so my timing looks really bad.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.000
So it's just one
little sneaky hack

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.730
you guys can use
yourself to recreate it.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.390
Find a key part in the story
and place it at the end.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.930
Leave it as a surprise.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.407
And a really key thing in
comedy, which is tough for me

00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:12.490
to talk about as an Irish
person because we're not

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.700
very good at saying
the number three,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.540
every time in fact
we say three, it

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.360
doesn't really come
out like it should

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.434
and sounds a bit strange.

00:28:19.434 --> 00:28:21.850
But the rule of three, if any
of you know it or any of you

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.800
have copywriting positions
here in any way or watching,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.780
the rule of three is at
the heart of everything

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.680
memorable you've ever been
subjected to in any marketing

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.760
or copywriting
material, because three

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.550
is the smallest
amount of numbers

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:37.490
your brain can recognize
as a sequence or pattern.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.749
So if I give you one, two,
you're always expecting three.

00:28:41.749 --> 00:28:43.540
And I remember when I
looked at this first,

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.330
I was remembering when
I used to box when

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.640
I was in college or
back before college.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.030
It was always one, two, right.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.522
And you would always hit them
with that left, left, right,

00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:54.230
because they weren't
expecting the right.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.146
And that was the sequence
that you were always

00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:57.340
trying to punch in.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.340
It was one, two, and
you automatically

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.960
expect the third one to come
from the same direction.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.280
Comedy is extremely similar.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.680
It's always that
one, two, three.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.070
And in comedy, three is funny,
because three is actually four.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.280
So a joke is always one, two--
you think three is coming,

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.910
but it's not.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:14.900
It's four.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.550
It's a flip of expectations.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.500
So to describe it is
very much like a train

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.260
coming down the tracks
with the first two

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:21.670
elements in the sequence.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.010
I'm trying to create a
picture and let you think

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.300
you know where it's going.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.750
And your laughter will
come when I derail or flip

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.910
that expectation.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.120
So literally just changing
the last word in that sequence

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.870
will make it kind of funny.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.480
It might not be viral
hilarity by any means,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.820
but it will be more engaging,
whether it's copyright,

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.472
whether it's your
own Facebook updates,

00:29:40.472 --> 00:29:42.180
whether it's for
Twitter, or whether it's

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.400
for public speaking.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.770
Any information in sequence
of three is more memorable,

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.130
and it's also more
shocking to your mind

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.120
when that third element
in that is a flip

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.740
and it changes the expectation.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.430
I mean, this is a
really good graphic

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.680
that shows how central
the rule of three

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.180
is to everything that we're
doing, from all the campaigns

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.790
and slogans you've been
subjected to, to marketing

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.700
copy that you're
like, oh, I recognize

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.920
that, to the strikes and the
sporting systems we go through

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.430
and all the sports you watch.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.880
You remember Snap, Crackle,
and Pop in the world of cereal

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.840
when you're a kid or
the Three Little Bears.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.180
Like, why was it always three?

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.890
There was always three of
these items, whether it's

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:22.980
their primary colors, to
literature, and to company

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.210
names, to TED themselves.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.210
These names are not
three words by mistake.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.270
They're three words
very intentionally.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.200
Obviously here Google
just went, nah.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.490
Google, fine.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.150
But a lot of these
companies were not

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.858
as creative in that
endeavor, and they're

00:30:39.858 --> 00:30:42.540
playing on the same mind
pattern of recognition for you

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.465
to remember that.

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:45.130
Now here's a good
example I didn't

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.760
have to go too far to find.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.496
It's down from the
Tenderloin in San Francisco.

00:30:49.496 --> 00:30:51.870
Some of you will be worried
about what I'm about to show.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.720
Don't worry.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.390
So just a sign outside a
bar-- not amazingly funny,

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.060
but you're like, oh,
that's kind of funny.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.430
And you can replicate
this sequence in any way.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.890
We used to do it to sell tickets
for events we were doing.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.910
We're like, buy your tickets now
and get a free drone, a Tesla,

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.110
and false advertising.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.276
And they're all like, ha-ha.

00:31:12.276 --> 00:31:13.150
Buy a ticket.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:13.650
It works.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.250
And a little spike of dopamine
gets you a bit happier.

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.770
And it's a little bit of a
laugh that wasn't hard to get.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.560
What happens if I
change that sequence?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.074
So that's very much
one, two, four.

00:31:23.074 --> 00:31:24.740
And that's the best
example of it there.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.700
One and two, logical sequence.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.050
I think I know what's coming.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.830
Four, flip of expectation.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.390
And so the third element,
essentially, becomes a four,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.900
just to throw you
off a little bit

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.790
and not be able to
recognize the pattern.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.570
What happens if I move false
advertising there and change

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.150
the sequence?

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.150
Not funny anymore, not
even mildly entertaining.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.590
I mean, you can
use this anywhere

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.923
once you're start familiar
and start mining to use this.

00:31:47.923 --> 00:31:49.820
So this is the back of my book.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.350
And not much entertainment
value, traditionally,

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.540
to the back of a book.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.270
Normally you have
a couple of blurbs

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.790
from famous people going, oh
my god, book's so amazing.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.930
Read it, whatever.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.350
You don't pay attention to it.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.040
We use it as an
opportunity for humor.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.580
So one and two there,
pretty much normal.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.010
Three, "This book is great.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.100
I haven't read it yet,
but David drew a picture

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.630
when he was 6 years old
of a penguin drinking

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.750
beer in a Chinese
restaurant, and it

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.050
was clear the potential
for slight wisdom

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.650
and misguided
creativity were there,"

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.070
Marita Nihill, David's mother.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.761
Is that unusual all of a sudden?

00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:25.510
Now you're thinking
my mom's kind of cool.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.610
And to be honest, she is.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.972
And she's pretty funny, if
I inherited any of that.

00:32:28.972 --> 00:32:30.430
You guys are already
funny already.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.570
So you got lucky as well.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.670
But one, two, four.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.170
So your mind's just logically
processing information,

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.800
and it comes as a
little bit of a shock

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.210
that you broke the pattern.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.780
That opportunity's
in everything,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.220
at the end of the emails
you send, in subject lines

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:49.020
for emails, and autosign--
anything we have squeezed humor

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.040
into places where
you don't expect it.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.790
And if you're worrying
how to sequence it,

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.950
it's always that
structure of three.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.690
So I want to show
you a quick example.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.000
This is from a comedy club.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.160
I wrote this joke.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.100
It is terrible.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.320
It is the worst joke ever.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.945
I'm embarrassed to
even show it to you.

00:33:03.945 --> 00:33:05.680
Even my own friends
are like, oh no, no.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.390
Don't be telling
that joke again.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.730
But I wrote it with
this sequence in mind.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.400
So I'm like, if I sit down
to take a story from my life

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.810
and write it in a joke
format and I go and tell it

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.892
in a comedy club
or on any stage,

00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:19.100
and then I go to another
one and I tell the same one,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.300
I tell the same one, can
it become predictable?

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.720
Can it be repeatable?

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.660
And what effect will
it have on people?

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.332
And what I'd like
you to note is just

00:33:26.332 --> 00:33:27.540
the structure of how I do it.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.310
Has he hid the last word
until the end or not?

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.080
And you might not
think it's funny.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.890
You probably won't.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.490
And I'll have to explain why I
think it's mildly funny after,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.470
but just note the
audience's reaction.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.990
And apologies,
again, for this joke.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.450
Because it's really terrible.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.440
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.674
-I don't know a lot about
California, I must admit.

00:33:43.674 --> 00:33:45.340
But does anybody else
have this problem?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.923
Guys, you're going to have with
your girlfriend-- she's always

00:33:47.923 --> 00:33:51.636
on you to go to Napa. (FEMALE
VOICE) I want to go to Napa.

00:33:51.636 --> 00:33:52.900
I want to go to Napa.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.619
So I gave in.

00:33:53.619 --> 00:33:54.910
I was sick of listening to her.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.900
I said, all right.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.400
And I finally brought her, and
it turns out she doesn't even

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.490
like auto parts.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.771

00:34:02.989 --> 00:34:03.530

00:34:06.122 --> 00:34:07.080
--even like auto parts.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.400
That was totally terrible.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.780
I did apologize.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.360
For those of you
who don't get it,

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.020
and of course, if you're
not familiar with here

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.311
in the Bay Area, you might not.

00:34:24.311 --> 00:34:25.989
Napa, famous wine region.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.659
When I mentioned the word Napa,
girls are automatically like,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.159
oh, that warm day.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.449
I had my nice dress on.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:32.750
I can nearly taste the wine.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.210
Oh, I really like Napa.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.360
And maybe they've even
grabbed a memory already

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.580
of when they were last there.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.371
A lot of guys will be
like, oh, that time I

00:34:39.371 --> 00:34:40.219
got dragged to Napa.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.679
I'm sick of going with my
girlfriend there all the time.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.719
But all of a sudden
you're painting a picture

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.800
of a place that is
very much not what

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.480
I'm talking about in that joke.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.550
So it was a rubbish joke,
but NAPA, of course,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.980
is also a chain of
automative service stores

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.310
where you go to get the
oil in your car changed,

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.880
not a good place to
bring somebody on a date,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.090
even if you are watching
that talk all the time

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.190
about the female orgasm.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.760
You still won't get away from
bringing the lady to the oil

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.790
parts place.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.720
So that's the flip
in expectations.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.710
So you're like, why is
this thing humorous?

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.000
If I wrote it out, it
doesn't seem that funny.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.360
But very much the last word
is at the end of the sequence.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.620
And that's what brings
it to life a little bit.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.630
It sounds totally crazy.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.490
But in it's simplistic
form, that can be recreated,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.200
and it can be used
for all content

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.650
that you're crafting, whether
it's on the back of a book.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.170
I just like that cat, and
that's why I put him up there,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.320
for no apparent reason.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.350
But a lot of stuff
around public speaking

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.850
that I have in the
book, a lot of it

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.560
is tips on the actual
delivery yourself.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.990
But I wanted to talk to you
about the content side of it

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.960
at the start, how to
craft it, just so you

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.020
have a bunch of cool
material that you feel, OK, I

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.360
have an embarrassing story,
or have a crazy client story,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.620
or have a customer story.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.620
Because we wouldn't be
in business if we weren't

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.967
solving some sort of problem.

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:53.300
So you're like, who was the
person I was solving it for?

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.890
Now tell me about
them a little bit.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.480
That's your story to start with.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.170
So a lot of pitches,
and you'll have

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.378
heard before where they go
in-- they're just numbers.

00:36:01.378 --> 00:36:03.600
80% year on year growth
rate, whatever attraction.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.797
Brian, my partner,
pivoted refinance series

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:07.630
B. You're like, what
are they talking about?

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.470
Totally lost.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.310
Start with a story,
and then the numbers

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.570
become the icing on the cake.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.945
So once you give
people something

00:36:12.945 --> 00:36:14.950
to latch onto and
remember, you're good,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.920
a little bit of a shared
experience if you can,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.180
so they can see themselves
within your story,

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.199
and understand the pain point
you're solving in any way,

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:23.740
or what you're trying
to communicate,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.366
and then all the numbers come.

00:36:25.366 --> 00:36:25.990
And guess what?

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.040
If you're pitching with
numbers the same thing

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.420
as comedic effect and timing,
if your company is getting

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.080
an 80% year on year growth
rate, it's much more impactful

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.240
if I say, we have a year
on year growth rate of 80%.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.780
The impactful word gets moved
to the end of the sentence,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.040
and it doesn't sound
as natural to say,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.010
but with a tiny bit of
practice, it feels all right,

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.152
and it sounds totally
natural to your audience.

00:36:49.152 --> 00:36:50.610
But I'd love to
take some questions

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.340
from you guys as
to-- there's all

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.632
this stuff around the delivery.

00:36:53.632 --> 00:36:55.715
Obviously I pretended to
be a comedian for a year.

00:36:55.715 --> 00:36:57.840
That probably threw up a
couple of wacky things.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.740
I mean, the book is
very much my story,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.280
what happened with
all this stuff,

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.040
and then how to
replicate it, and how

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.960
to do it by using comedians'
techniques to do it.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.434
So what are comedians so
good at doing on stage

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:09.850
that the average
business speakers

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.890
don't learn because
they're not clocking up

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.750
10,000 hours on stage.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.890
So is there anything you
could do or replicate?

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.806
So I'd love if any of
you guys have questions.

00:37:17.806 --> 00:37:19.212
We do have a microphone.

00:37:19.212 --> 00:37:21.170
There is one, I guess,
I got asked quite a bit.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.750
Does anyone fear
going blank on stage?

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.090
Has that ever popped
up for anyone?

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:27.604
I see a lot of head nods.

00:37:27.604 --> 00:37:29.020
I think the single
biggest thing I

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.320
learned in the whole year I
learned from Richard, actually,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.030
our fake Indian President Obama
you had in the video there,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.310
in the low budget recording.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.520
But he taught me about something
called the memory palace, which

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.978
I hadn't heard of or I wasn't
aware of, but you might have.

00:37:41.978 --> 00:37:43.760
Joshua Foer wrote a
very good book on it

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.650
called "Moonwalking
with Einstein,"

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.000
which essentially is a
way to remember your talk

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.010
or anything you need
to remember and never

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.900
worry about forgetting it
in any way, shape, or form.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.040
So do you guys-- you didn't
speak Spanish earlier.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.419
You remember the word for "to
put" or "to fit," I should say?

00:37:59.419 --> 00:38:00.085
AUDIENCE: Caber.

00:38:00.085 --> 00:38:02.090
DAVID NIHILL: Caber,
nearly everybody,

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.580
pretty much everybody.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.360
Can't test you guys on the
livestream inside of it.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.332
But you won't forget that story.

00:38:08.332 --> 00:38:09.790
That's just the
way you wrapped it.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.570
And it even gets more
powerful of a memory

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.280
if you take that story and you
put it in a specific location.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:19.690
So if I ask you guys, have you
got a favorite restaurant you

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:23.370
like in San Francisco or
the Bay Area and picture it,

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.760
and be like, when I walk
in, where's the server?

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.030
How many tables are there?

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.270
Where's the bathroom?

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.145
It's very easy for that
to come to your mind.

00:38:30.145 --> 00:38:32.644
And you're like, oh no, there's
like six tables on the left.

00:38:32.644 --> 00:38:33.830
The server's on the right.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:34.870
OK, I get it.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.930
So if you take a space like
that that you remember easily,

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.060
now make it something
super familiar,

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.340
like your house or your
office, or somewhere

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.620
where you grew up in.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.840
And you plant all
these little stories

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.240
as memories within
that structure.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.750
All of a sudden,
now you're never

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.710
trying to remember a word.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.310
You're trying to
remember a location.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.400
So you're on stage.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.700
And you're literally like,
where am I in the talk?

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.590
I'm in the kitchen.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.270
Who's in the kitchen?

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.770
OK.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:03.240
Those crazy memories I
planted there is a story.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.350
So if I'm going to talk about,
say, Mexico and economic growth

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.490
and I need to remember
the GDP of Mexico is 11%,

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:11.510
I'm literally going to
picture a Mexican guy.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.370
I open my door.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.210
And there's a guy from
Mexico on a donkey,

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:16.427
and he's got no
pants on whatsoever.

00:39:16.427 --> 00:39:18.760
And he's a bottle of Guinness
in each hand for no reason

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.220
whatsoever, and he has
a soccer Jersey on him.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.550
And 11 is the number
on the jersey.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.800
So the first thing I need
to talk about is in my talk,

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.780
I open the door.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.950
I'm starting to
talk about Mexico.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.200
I hope I have the image of it.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.700
Oh yeah.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.010
So remembered the story I
told you I told for The Moth

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.960
for 1,400 people?

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.929
That's all I had
in my back pocket.

00:39:39.929 --> 00:39:41.220
And it stays in my back pocket.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.470
I never take it out in anyway.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.594
Because if you have any
notes, people automatically

00:39:44.594 --> 00:39:47.020
assume that you didn't prepare
for this, whether you want

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.904
them to get that idea or not.

00:39:48.904 --> 00:39:49.820
And that's all I have.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.528
And you'll be looking
at thinking, that's

00:39:51.528 --> 00:39:52.750
a bit of a strange story.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.820
What are those notes?

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.380
Potatoes, 69, cookies,
fireworks, Lululemon pants.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.730
It was about my mother
coming to San Francisco

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.790
as a conservative
kind Irish lady

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.010
and getting a lot
less conservative

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.400
and going home wearing
like Lululemon pants

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.990
and getting a bit of a taste for
weed cookies, which was pretty

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.960
interesting, to say the least.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.710
But all I've done is I
positioned a little story

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.681
in every location in my room.

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.930
And the nice thing is when
you're doing your talk now,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.120
you're not looking at
a list of bullet points

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.740
anymore and trying
to remember them.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.940
And the really cool thing
is when you do this,

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.700
and you realize, OK, this works.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.770
I actually can't forget
this stuff anymore.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.560
Then you can sit in the audience
and watch the three speakers

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.180
before you.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.410
So have you ever
been to a conference

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.320
or done public speaking
and someone went on

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.110
and they talked about
the exact same thing

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.550
that the last guy talked about?

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.022
And you're sitting there
going, why is he saying this?

00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:43.980
Why doesn't he argue with
the last guy's point?

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.410
Or why is he saying
the same thing?

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:46.951
And the answer is
normally because he

00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:49.666
was backstage sweating,
reading off a load of notes.

00:40:49.666 --> 00:40:51.290
And he wasn't totally
confident that he

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.831
was going to remember it, and
the easiest way you'll ever get

00:40:53.831 --> 00:40:56.190
laughs if the really funny
guy goes on before you,

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.224
then you just talk
about how funny he was.

00:40:58.224 --> 00:40:59.890
And you make the same
jokes that he did.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.720
In comedy, they call
that a call back.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.730
And you just use something
that already worked.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.146
But when you know
you're not going

00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:08.240
to get to go blank on stage, the
shaking and the sweating calms

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.740
down a lot before you go on,
because you're like, all right,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.610
the biggest single fear, I've
just taken that off the table.

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.925
And this works 100% of the time.

00:41:15.925 --> 00:41:17.300
I've never gone
blank using this.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.841
Any of my friends
that have used this

00:41:18.841 --> 00:41:20.320
have never gone blank using it.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.590
So it's a big topic by itself,
but to be honest, that's it.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.292
Just draw out a
floor plan and create

00:41:25.292 --> 00:41:26.500
a little memory of something.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.630
Put it in each place,
and that's your talk.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.630
And when you get really
good at doing your talk,

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.671
if you've ever spoke at
a conference, some of you

00:41:32.671 --> 00:41:35.036
might relate to this where
it's a 25 minute talk.

00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:36.410
And they're like,
actually-- just

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.570
before you go on-- everybody
else ran over a bit.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.010
If you can just do 11 minutes.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.782
That'll be fine.

00:41:40.782 --> 00:41:41.740
You're like 11 minutes!

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.010
I've got like 50 slides.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.927
What am I going to do?

00:41:43.927 --> 00:41:45.551
When you get really
good at doing this,

00:41:45.551 --> 00:41:48.320
you know how long you're going
to have to spend in each room.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.810
So I know if I go
into the bathroom

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.726
and I'm talking about
the intellectual capital

00:41:51.726 --> 00:41:54.517
of California that is
Stockton, for you guys

00:41:54.517 --> 00:41:56.600
there, that's literally
going to take me a minute.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.310
So I'm like, all right.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.490
I'm not going into the bathroom.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.940
I'm going to walk straight
through the kitchen,

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.270
and that's going to take another
two minutes off the time.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.395
And all of a sudden, you
become very, very flexible

00:42:04.395 --> 00:42:05.387
with what you're doing.

00:42:05.387 --> 00:42:07.220
So I'd say of all the
tips and the takeaways

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.090
I got for the world of business,
or any form of public speaking,

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.510
this is number one for
me because it allowed

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.280
me to relax quite a lot.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.750
Still nervous beforehand,
still sweating, but got better

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.550
about managing it, and I knew
like the ultimate fear was

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.045
gone, like me to stand there
and be like, what do I do?

00:42:24.045 --> 00:42:25.920
All of sudden you get
a lot more comfortable.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.050
There were loads of little
tips like that along the way

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.110
that I was getting from
performers and comedians

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.280
that I'd never, ever seen
in the world of business.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.872
Any other kind of
wacky questions?

00:42:35.872 --> 00:42:37.580
AUDIENCE: You did that
by drawing it out?

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.490
DAVID NIHILL: Yeah, definitely.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.290
AUDIENCE: Or you picturing
yourself in the space?

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.123
DAVID NIHILL: I draw
it out just to help me.

00:42:42.123 --> 00:42:44.240
But I literally sit down
and visualize myself

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.560
walking through the house.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.960
And the crazier the
stories I concoct, kind of

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.920
like the bear in the taxi cab
and give it the extra detail,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.770
who's the person,
put some celebrities

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.570
in there, anything, the
crazier that story becomes

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.740
that you create for
each bullet point,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.140
and then I just draw it out,
just as literally something

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.840
to visualize that morning.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.400
And to be honest, once maybe
I'll run through the talk

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.320
in fast forward.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.420
And if I can't say
the word really fast,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.957
I definitely can
say it really slow.

00:43:08.957 --> 00:43:11.040
It was a really good thing
that someone taught me.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.414
Like when you put a quote in
a presentation, you're like,

00:43:13.414 --> 00:43:14.677
now I'd like to share a quote.

00:43:14.677 --> 00:43:16.260
And you're like, I
can't even remember

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.570
what the quote is because
it's not as familiar as you

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.220
thought it would be to you.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.720
And you can't say
it really fast.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.170
If you can't say it fast,
you can't say it slow.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.545
I think that was one of the
better tips somebody gave me.

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:27.480
Someone also said
along the way, you

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.612
know, filler words-- Irish
people are great for mumbling,

00:43:30.612 --> 00:43:32.320
no offense Irish people
who are watching,

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.360
but we definitely do it.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.068
And it's why I have
a hard time sometimes

00:43:35.068 --> 00:43:37.762
with foreign languages of
sounding like a native speaker

00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:38.720
when I'm studying them.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.980
But the filler words that you
use, like uhh, eh, but-- anyone

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.812
ever have problems with that
when you're public speaking?

00:43:45.812 --> 00:43:47.270
You watch it back,
and you're like,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.940
oh, I said eh so many times.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.260
But if you speak
literally like I am now,

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:57.280
10% to 15% higher than normal,
it sounds totally normal to you

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.970
guys.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.430
I feel like a lunatic.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:00.930
But it looks really,
really natural.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.013
And you know what happens?

00:44:02.013 --> 00:44:06.050
It's nearly impossible
to say uhh really loudly.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.330
You just don't.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.810
And all of a sudden,
the words come

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.940
slower because you're
talking faster,

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.150
and there isn't a
single filler word.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.820
And you've just cured that
problem as well straight away.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.380
I got that from
comedians as well.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.754
All these little
things they were

00:44:18.754 --> 00:44:20.630
doing, that I was
thinking business speakers

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:21.690
had never heard of.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.450
Like coming out to
a crowd and just get

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.810
them to applaud for anything.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.310
Have you ever been
in a comedy club,

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:28.686
and they're like, give it up
for your bar and wait staff!

00:44:28.686 --> 00:44:30.185
And you're like,
they're charging me

00:44:30.185 --> 00:44:31.330
so much money for drinks.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.610
They don't even come.

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.210
And then when the comedian tries
to talk, they talk over them.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.810
I don't want to
applaud for them.

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.684
But you do.

00:44:37.684 --> 00:44:39.350
Give it up for
yourselves for coming out

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.930
to support live comedy tonight.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:41.744
Sound familiar?

00:44:41.744 --> 00:44:44.410
Now give it up for all the great
comedians you're about to hear.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.430
The rule of three, the same
law that applies to copywriting

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:48.940
applies to your behavior.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.900
If you do something
three times like clap,

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.650
you're more likely to do
it again later in the show.

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.180
So if they walk out, and it's
a totally flat audience, what

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.890
they do is just ask them
for a round of applause.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.380
Just get them to do something.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.257
Comedians, again,
amazing at doing it.

00:45:01.257 --> 00:45:03.340
Introductions, when you're
introducing a speaker--

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.841
and that was his
point-- do you ever

00:45:04.841 --> 00:45:07.006
have someone seen him coming
to a stage and be like,

00:45:07.006 --> 00:45:08.270
John is a friend of mine.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.740
John's our next speaker.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.120
He was an early stage
investor in his company.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.350
And every time he says the
word John, you're like,

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:15.200
do we applaud now?

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.810
No, OK.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:16.690
Said the name again.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:17.550
Do we applaud now?

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.050
No.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.470
But comedy club-- ladies and
gentlemen, our next comedian

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.610
has been on at the Punchline.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:22.480
You've seen him on the improv.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.900
You've seen him
on Comedy Central.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.680
He's huge.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.790
Please give it up for,
and you as the audience

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.315
are like, [GASPS] who is it?

00:45:28.315 --> 00:45:29.940
That's the only thing
you want to know.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.990
The anticipation is building
to what's now the punchline.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:34.450
It's the same structure.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.320
And when I say that
guy's name, now he

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.060
gets a big round of applause
all of a sudden, in unison,

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.560
from everybody at the same time.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.170
Small little things like
that have a huge impact

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.310
on what's going to happen.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.625
I saw a question from yourself.

00:45:45.625 --> 00:45:47.750
Was it, all the way-- did
you have one still or no?

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:48.930
Finito.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.221
Yeah, same as don't end on
the questions and answers.

00:45:51.221 --> 00:45:52.220
Have you ever seen that?

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.761
Or anyone do a Q&amp;A session where
you're literally standing up

00:45:54.761 --> 00:45:56.900
there, and the guy
comes back, the host,

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.930
similar although he's
doing it much better.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.670
And it's literally like,
anyone got any questions?

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:02.300
Nobody?

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.470
And you're just standing
there as the speaker

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.178
going, oh my god.

00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.479
I hope somebody asks a question
at some stage now soon.

00:46:06.479 --> 00:46:09.020
And then he'll be like, oh, guy
in the back, like I just did.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.560
And the guy's like,
no, wasn't me.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.310
It's gone, straight away, no
intention of asking a question,

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:14.410
don't want to.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.240
And then the speaker, they kind
of go off stage like this, OK,

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.070
thanks.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:18.860
Bye-bye.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.360
And the conference
organizer now has

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.010
to go back in and try
and edit that video

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:23.718
and make it look like
they didn't go away

00:46:23.718 --> 00:46:25.760
on the flattest note in history.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.564
So literally, you
can change all that.

00:46:27.564 --> 00:46:29.230
A comedian would never
go out like that.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.850
It's Steve Jobs strong
ending for a comedian.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.740
Second strongest
joke at the start,

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.560
strongest joke at the finish,
out with a bang-- everybody

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.610
knows it's over.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.490
And as a business speaker,
all you have to do

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.810
is say I'm going to take a
few questions and answers

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:44.190
before making my conclusion.

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.440
And if nobody asks a
question, who cares?

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.290
I still have a
slide, which is going

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:51.230
to have how many takeaways on it
that you're going to remember?

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.870
Three.

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.590
Still cannot
pronounce that word,

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.880
but now I control the ending.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.802
So all of a sudden, I
know it's going to end.

00:46:58.802 --> 00:47:00.260
All of a sudden
you know it's over.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.840
All of a sudden the host
can say, round of applause.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.750
You guys give it.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:04.710
Everybody's happy.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.206
Makes a massive difference.

00:47:06.206 --> 00:47:07.580
Next time you go
to a conference,

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.350
you're going to see that.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:09.570
They're going to be
running around with a mic.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.120
Nobody's saying
anything to speakers,

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.812
just standing there on stage
looking totally mortified.

00:47:13.812 --> 00:47:15.270
And because you
can't control that,

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.853
you're leaving it
up to random chance.

00:47:16.853 --> 00:47:18.864
So good, good tip as well.

00:47:18.864 --> 00:47:21.370
Anything else?

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:22.030
Yeah?

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.530
Please.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.159
We'll get you a microphone,
just so they can all hear it.

00:47:26.159 --> 00:47:28.450
I better turn off my little
potato picture [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.285
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to talk to us today.

00:47:30.285 --> 00:47:30.770
DAVID NIHILL: Oh, thank you.

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:32.750
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering how long

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:36.890
it took you to stop
feeling nervous on stage.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:39.052
You said you did
this for like a year?

00:47:39.052 --> 00:47:40.760
DAVID NIHILL: Yeah,
more than a year now.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:41.826
Never.

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:43.700
And I wish someone had
told me that to start.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.850
I was like, when
does it get good?

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:46.630
No.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.650
And I'd go do
these comedy shows,

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:51.250
and you'd think a green room
backstage to a comedy show,

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.100
like 10 comedians are
in there, must be so

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.980
fun in there-- not
fun whatsoever.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.480
Never.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.610
Everyone's super nervous.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.400
Like, they're getting ready.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.191
They're doing their
own way of preparation.

00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:03.160
They're still sweating and
shaking a lot of the time.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.160
If there's consequences,
you're always nervous.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.440
And it was just reframing
that to say, I'm not nervous.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.159
I'm excited.

00:48:09.159 --> 00:48:10.200
And this is what happens.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.640
Nobody's trying to kill me
on a daily basis anymore,

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.940
so that fight or flight
moment doesn't really happen.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.110
It happens with little
things like public speaking,

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:19.690
or it happens with
like a road rage

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.400
incident that leads to nothing.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.320
It's non-threatening
things where we get that,

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.903
and you do get it
for public speaking.

00:48:24.903 --> 00:48:25.904
And it doesn't go away.

00:48:25.904 --> 00:48:26.820
It becomes manageable.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:30.070
But reframing that in your head,
that makes all the difference.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.320
You're like, oh, I'm sweating.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.153
This always happens.

00:48:32.153 --> 00:48:33.381
OK, I'm perfectly prepared.

00:48:33.381 --> 00:48:35.130
So if you get it in
your head like, right.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.910
If I was an IndyCar race car
driver, and I'm in the final,

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.910
and it's a championship
decider, would it

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.110
be a good idea if I
took a shot of vodka

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:44.250
just before I drove the
car, a shot of tequila,

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.206
to null the senses?

00:48:45.206 --> 00:48:46.080
It would be terrible.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.570
Public speaking is the same.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.127
Like if something
happens in a room,

00:48:49.127 --> 00:48:50.710
you want to react
to it straight away.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.617
And you're at your
most heightened state.

00:48:52.617 --> 00:48:54.950
That's your best condition,
when the heartbeat is going.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.177
But you do little things
like wear clothing you know

00:48:57.177 --> 00:48:59.010
is kind of sweat proof
so it doesn't show it

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:00.109
if you're getting sweaty.

00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:01.650
If there's a microphone
in the stand,

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.830
I would never take it out
for the first 30 seconds,

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.881
because I know I'm going
to be shaking so much.

00:49:05.881 --> 00:49:07.380
But the nice thing
is if I'm relying

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.800
on my stories and
my content, that's

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.140
what I'm using in my talk,
and I start with a story,

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.490
then I'm not going to forget it.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.080
It's mine.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.150
And if I mess it up,
you don't know anyway.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.970
So I get way more
comfortable about what

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.047
I'm about to talk about.

00:49:20.047 --> 00:49:21.630
And if I have all
that stuff memorized

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:22.470
that we were talking
about earlier,

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:25.230
and I know the logical sequence,
and I know I have one or two

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.130
things that will 100%
get people to laugh,

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:29.651
or I know I can
just show a video,

00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:31.400
and the video is going
to make them laugh,

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.840
or a couple of memes, and
you get really comfortable

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.486
pretty quick.

00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:36.860
So to answer your question,
you know, it never goes away.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.750
And I wish people just
said that all the time

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:39.541
and admitted to it.

00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:43.000
But if you reframe it, then it
gets pretty easy to deal with.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
So one more question
if we have one,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.570
otherwise I'll
just finish it up.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.407
Yeah?

00:49:48.407 --> 00:49:50.240
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering your thoughts

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.564
about the choice of a story.

00:49:52.564 --> 00:49:53.980
If you're talking
about something,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.810
it's not exactly public.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:59.900
But we have a lot of things that
are like [INAUDIBLE] 10 people.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.900
How you're designing this
component of a software system,

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.930
or how you're marketing--
some in between.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.562
You'd never do a TED Talk.

00:50:08.562 --> 00:50:09.770
DAVID NIHILL: No, true, true.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.410
But you don't tell a story
about your childhood.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.970
It has no relation whatsoever.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:16.470
So--

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:18.270
DAVID NIHILL: Well, I
mean, sometimes it does.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.090
But I mean, that's kind
of a different form

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.140
because it's a
bit more personal.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.790
There's five or 10
of you in the room.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.760
But why are you
making this change?

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.670
So there was a really
good example at Skype

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.800
when they launched the
video conferencing component

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.300
to Skype.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.590
Most of the staff
were against it.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.460
They're like, that's
not our core component.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.990
So the CEO brought into
their weekly meetings

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.380
they were doing at the time
customers who were literally

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.713
the people that were using this.

00:50:39.713 --> 00:50:41.660
And the guy'd come in,
and he's like, listen,

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.271
I was in the military
for six months.

00:50:43.271 --> 00:50:45.270
And the only way I kept
my relationship together

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.270
with my wife was by using the
video technology component.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.360
We have to roll out this beta.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.040
So if you weren't able to tell
the story of the user's problem

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.500
you were trying to
solve, they were actually

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.590
bringing in these people
and [INAUDIBLE] them.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.429
So I think you just
vocalize who is the end user

00:50:59.429 --> 00:51:00.720
that your problem is affecting.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.760
Where you guys, you
always have an end user.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.920
So your opinion is not as strong
a way of motivating people

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.225
as the story.

00:51:08.225 --> 00:51:09.600
Why does it affect
those persons?

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.490
What was the frustration in it
for them if we don't fix this?

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.400
Vocalize that.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.461
Now hit them with
a few solutions.

00:51:15.461 --> 00:51:15.960
Yeah.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.390
It tends to work.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.020
Yeah, I better tell you guys the
end of all this lunacy for me.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.270
And the nice thing for it,
remember this sign earlier?

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.960
The sequence of three.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.860
This is rubbish.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.300
You can nearly feel the
frustration in this sign

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:27.980
as you read it.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.660
You're like, I've tried
comedy, but it's not working.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.160
All right.

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.190
Roses are red.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:33.050
Bacon is red.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.125
Poems are hard-- bacon.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.700
It's exactly like they just
gave up on the process,

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.210
but it's still kind
of funny, right?

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.394
If you try to be funny ever,
and it doesn't get a laugh,

00:51:43.394 --> 00:51:45.310
all you have to do is
acknowledge how terrible

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.410
it was and everybody's cool.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.540
It's that guy who thinks
he's amazing at public

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.706
speaking or doing something
in front of an audience.

00:51:51.706 --> 00:51:53.325
And you're like, well, he sucks.

00:51:53.325 --> 00:51:54.700
That's when you're
not liking it.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.790
But as long as they're like,
that would joke was terrible,

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:57.220
wasn't it?

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.300
I'll never try that again.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:58.720
OK.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.010
Good.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:51:59.670
We'll remember that.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.086
It was funny last
night when I was

00:52:01.086 --> 00:52:03.900
practicing my cat-- did not
translate to the main stage

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:04.400
today.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:04.900
Cool.

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.490
Then everybody's
still happy with it.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:09.730
I mean, the nice thing
behind it, I love this metric

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.146
and I love the little cute
baby photo, obviously, as well.

00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:15.700
But we used to laugh
300 times a day,

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.250
and now they reckon
it's somewhere about 15,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.400
depending on the age
bracket, 15 to 20.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.990
So like anybody who can stick
in a little bit of laughter

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.190
there quickly becomes
a bit of a hero.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.790
And like the average
conference, it's

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.360
not the most difficult audience.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.950
The average conference
speaker is horrendous.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.339
They're literally like a
group of happy dolphins

00:52:33.339 --> 00:52:35.005
when you bring in
humor going backwards.

00:52:35.005 --> 00:52:37.100
They're like, oh,
that was so great.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:39.855
My day just got much better.

00:52:39.855 --> 00:52:41.230
That was a book
I wrote about it,

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:43.709
and there's loads of tips in
there, huge amount of tips.

00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:46.000
But if you don't want to buy
it, you can get those tips

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.490
for free, totally, just by going
to 7comedyhabits.com/80tips

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.760
and download them all.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.919
So I'm not writing this
book to write 10 books

00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:54.543
or become an expert
on public speaking.

00:52:54.543 --> 00:52:56.410
I hate public speaking.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.250
It took a lot of arm twisting
even to get me on video

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.069
and doing this one
and coming today.

00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:03.110
Because I really don't
like to be a video either.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:04.250
So I still hate public speaking.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.958
I don't want to be
going around doing it.

00:53:05.958 --> 00:53:07.937
But if you want to get
in touch, that's me.

00:53:07.937 --> 00:53:09.270
I'll put that up again in a sec.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.728
I didn't want to
leave you hanging.

00:53:10.728 --> 00:53:13.060
Remember this story I
was done for 1,400 people

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.995
and nearly laying
an egg on stage?

00:53:14.995 --> 00:53:16.370
And I was trying
to tell you guys

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.430
you never know what will happen
when you tell your story.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:20.013
So that was pretty
much the conclusion

00:53:20.013 --> 00:53:21.860
of my public
speaking experiments.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.960
I did this big
storytelling competition,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.506
and I went early
on in the night.

00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:26.630
There were 10 storytellers.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:29.404
And I was winning all
the way right to the end.

00:53:29.404 --> 00:53:31.320
And my friends were like,
you're going to win!

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.528
And I was thinking it would
be a good end to the book

00:53:33.528 --> 00:53:34.420
this one if I win.

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.640
And then the very last
lady went and won,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.770
beat me like point
point something.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:39.980
And I was like, aw.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.700
There goes the happy ending.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.210
And then two weeks later,
this guy contacted me.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:47.290
And that was a manager of a very
famous comedian but was also

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:51.220
the producer of TEDx Marin,
one of the bigger high profile

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.020
events here.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.519
And he's like, hey,
David, would you

00:53:53.519 --> 00:53:56.300
like to come and tell a story
or do a talk at our TED event?

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.720
And I was thinking, that's
quite a twist for somebody who

00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.270
hated public speaking.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.360
That's pretty cool, actually.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.818
And then before I
got carried away,

00:54:01.818 --> 00:54:03.400
I was like, oh, wait a minute.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.140
I have a friend,
and he's the reason

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.770
I got into all this stuff
when he suffered a spinal cord

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:09.460
injury.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.080
And he just did a talk,
and I helped him craft it.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.110
And he gave it.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:16.260
And he went on after Guy
Kawasaki, like his first talk

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.740
ever, and crushed it.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.350
And his second talk ever, he
used the techniques I used,

00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:22.310
the memory palace there
that I taught him,

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.660
and he got written up
in Forbes about it.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:26.410
And I was like, let
me send you his video.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:27.140
I think you'll like it.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.760
And the guy watched it,
and he wrote back to me.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.571
He's like, awesome.

00:54:29.571 --> 00:54:30.070
Booked.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:30.690
Done.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.190
If you don't mind,
we'll put him on.

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:32.990
I was like, no, man.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.490
Put him on.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:34.650
That's going to be epic.

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:35.540
So he went.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.370
He gave that TED Talk.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:38.880
That's me and him
on stage at it.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.090
I was watching backstage.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:41.490
He was the very last speaker.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.490
He got a 51-second
standing ovation,

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.990
telling them about the
case of spinal cord injury.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.910
the talk is called
"Little Big Steps."

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:51.430
And literally,
like my mother has

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.940
all her old lady
group in Ireland

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.540
watch it for
motivational reasons

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.976
because it's unbelievably cool.

00:54:55.976 --> 00:54:57.350
And at the end of
it, he actually

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:59.374
stands on his own
two feet to tell

00:54:59.374 --> 00:55:01.790
the story of how he trained
himself to be able to stand up

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:04.040
again, even though he
was told he never would

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:06.286
and proposed to his beautiful
girlfriend eye to eye.

00:55:06.286 --> 00:55:07.650
So it was pretty epic.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.670
So if you take nothing away
from this little random talk,

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:12.480
start with your
story and literally

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.700
pick out the funny
component in it

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.440
and get out there and tell it
using some comedy techniques.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.870
[INAUDIBLE] engagement.

00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:20.190
It's your story.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.870
Nobody knows it better than you.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.620
And the nice thing is,
you never know what

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:24.840
will happen when you tell it.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.420
So thank you very much.

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:30.070
[APPLAUSE]
