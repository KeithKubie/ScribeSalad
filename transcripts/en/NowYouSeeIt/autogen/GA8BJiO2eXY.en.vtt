00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
"You mean the guys in that Prince movie?"

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.920
-"Yeah, Purple Rain"

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.020
-"That shit was so gay ! Fucking 80's style"

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.980
-"Hey!" -"Never say an unkind word about the Time!"

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.900
There's no doubt that every era of movies looks back on previous eras.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.720
One full generation before is far enough back to reflect on while still being fresh.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.700
So it's pretty common for directors and producers to make movies and TV shows

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.620
that take place in that previous generation, in the generation they grew up in.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.200
"It's a Wonderful Life" goes from the 40s to the 20s,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.560
"Back to the Future" goes from the 80s to the 50s,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.480
and "That 70s Show" goes from the 2000s to the 70s.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.840
And the same thing goes for the 2010s looking back on the 1980s.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.060
But this era seems to have more of a craze than a simple homage to the 80s.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.780
Countless movies and TV shows give meticulous detail to the movies, videogames and overall style of that era,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.260
all to critical acclaim and box-office success.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.560
Nothing encapsulates our current obsession with the 1980s more than "Ready Player One",

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.160
a novel turned movie about a future world where people use virtual reality

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.840
to relive old 80's pop culture and media.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.740
It doesn't get more 80s obsessed than that.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.380
I think there are several reasons the 80s phenomenon is so much more prominent than the nostalgia of other generations.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.660
For one thing, the 80s was the birth of audio-visual entertainment with the music video,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.780
creating a whole new art form that continues to influence movies today.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.000
It was also the Golden Age of teen movies; the teens watching those movies have since become the movie creators,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700
and creating thematically complicated teenagers paved the way for casting more kids in lead roles.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.180
But I want to focus on the 80s phenomenon for another reason entirely.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.680
The perfect timing of the 80s created movies designed to be "homaged to" later on.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.687
Movies begging to be revisited. And that's because of how the directors and producers made them.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:41.300
And to understand the 80s creators, you have to understand where they came from :

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.260
Mid 60s to late 70s films, in a period referred to as "New Age Hollywood",

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.300
were defined by deviation from classical cinematic norms.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.360
These films questioned the Hollywood system, creating more experimental movies.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.740
Movies that challenged gender norms, conventional filming techniques and the Hollywood production code.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.660
Maybe the pinnacle of New Age Hollywood was "Bonnie and Clyde":

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.200
a movie with insane violence, sexually confused characters, and counterculture sentiment.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
And in this hotbed of cinematic experimentation came the pioneers of the 80s blockbuster :

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.100
The creative talent with a hyper awareness of Hollywood conventions.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.580
Conventions they themselves knew how to abide by when they wanted and break when they didn't.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.400
So the eventual leaders of the 80's blockbuster were the first generation of filmmakers to grow up during classical Hollywood,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.940
and then rise to the top during a period of extreme experimentation.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.260
So their film language is based on previous films, and their style is driven by how they follow or break film conventions.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.400
And how do I know that's how they made their movies ?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.440
Because online, there's a transcript of perhaps the two most important 80s directors

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.560
conceiving the idea for one of the best movies of the 1980s.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.900
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas discussing "Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark".

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.200
A lot of people enjoy reading the banter between the two directors, and how they thought of the iconic sequences in the movie,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.600
but I want to discuss these transcripts with a new Hollywood 80s homage perspective.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.420
Because as you read it, you realize how their entire means of communicating ideas comes from building off of previous movies.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.640
Lucas pitched the movie as a spaghetti western or James Bond, but in the 30s.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.460
They described the Indiana Jones by comparing him to other movie characters.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.980
He's professional like Mifune from "The Seven Samurai".

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.940
He has to go against people like Eli Wallace from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.260
He's a John Wayne / Clint Eastwood / Sean Connery kind of professional,

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.200
but scruffy like Humphrey Bogart in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre".

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.720
The action should be like "Wind and the Lion" and the jungle is "King Kong"-ish.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.003
Their language is built on entirely homage.

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:30.900
And in doing so, they create a completely fresh character and story by using old movies.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960
But it's more than just using old to create new.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.060
These creators also wanted to capture the spirit of movies before New Age Hollywood:

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.660
movies with less social commentary and more classic Hollywood fun.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.820
A movie to instill the 80's mindset was undoubtedly "Star Wars" in 1977

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.000
George Lucas describes the phenomenon himself :

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.560
He criticizes 70s TV shows at the time, like "Kojak" and "The Six Million Man",

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.900
that were popular and well made, but also extremely bleak and almost too realistic.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.472
Basically, they missed out on the fun.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.240
So the 80s blockbuster brought back what made movies entertaining in the first place.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.126
James Cameron's "The Terminator" is inspired by 1950s sci-fi and "The Outer Limits", a 1960 sci-fi show,

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:23.140
as are a lot of other 80s like "ET" and "Ghostbusters".

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.940
And notice how these later movies don't make aliens horrific or bleak: they make aliens whimsical and fun.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.620
Even "The Princess Bride", a fantasy movie, seems to perfectly capture the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg spirit.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.120
Many 60s and 70s teen movies are defined by their over stylized characters or plots with extreme sexual deviations.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.660
"Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me."

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.960
John Hughes was one of the first to create an honest portrayal of teenagers: one defined by clumsy romance and entertaining hijinks.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.520
I think Roger Ebert sums up what these 80s creators accomplished in his review of "Indiana Jones":

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.100
So I think that's the biggest reason why 80s movies are so popular today,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.110
and why "Stranger Things" has dozens of 80s movies references,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.020
San Junipero won two Emmys,

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.320
and "It" is the highest grossing horror movie of all time.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.900
The movies of the 80s capture the spirit of entertainment and these modern homages want to do the same.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.780
When you watch another 80s movie made in the present day, notice how there's almost always some shot

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.120
where we see what blockbuster is currently out in theaters at the time.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.460
80's movies reinvigorated that Hollywood blockbuster,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.000
and that's why we look back to that time period when we're trying to do the same today.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.820
So the next time you see a big-budget 80s movie coming out,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.240
remember there's some part of that director trying to capture the spirit that made 80s movies so timeless and fun to watch.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.080
Because they really did have everything.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.760
-"Are there sports in it ?"   -"Are you kidding?"

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.220
"Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, Giants, monsters,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.740
chases, escapes, true love,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.140
miracles."

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.480
-"It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake."
