00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now that you've simulated and simulated the down heapify algorithm on an example

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and you've seen what the code looks like, tell me what the running time of down heapify

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
would be if you have the heap of size n where the top node might be

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
violating the heap property but it satisfied everyone else.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We run down heapify on this and re-establish the heap property and it takes how long?
