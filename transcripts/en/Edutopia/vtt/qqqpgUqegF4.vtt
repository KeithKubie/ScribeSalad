00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Jeff Farden
has an enviable commute.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.266
It's about 100 yards from his home

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.216
to his home office in
New Plymouth, Idaho.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.146
Farden is a principal for the Idaho
Digital Learning Academy, or IDLA.

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:26.866
&gt;&gt;Jeff: See, as a principal, these
are the courses that I oversee.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:31.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With funding from the
state, IDLA offers a range of courses

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:34.306
to middle- and high-school students
who are learning on their own

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.676
or in classes facilitated
by onsite coordinators.

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.646
&gt;&gt;Okay, so there you have some...

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.896
&gt;&gt;Jeff: As online administrators,
one of our jobs is to ensure

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:46.136
that the coursework and the
teachers are really up-to-date

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:49.006
with the daily workings of the class.

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:52.986
We're looking for how frequent
teachers post announcements,

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.556
the overall communications
they have with their students.

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:57.736
Our primary goal is to ensure

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:01.136
that the teachers have
the resources available

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.046
to do a good job within the class.

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:05.506
Getting sent to the
principal's office

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:08.356
in a virtual world is
a little bit different.

00:01:08.356 --> 00:01:12.866
We obviously don't physically see
them, but if a teacher has a concern,

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.256
maybe inappropriate language, maybe
there's a question on a plagiarism,

00:01:17.526 --> 00:01:19.746
that's something that
can be referred to us.

00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:21.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While Farden spends most

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:25.496
of his time monitoring classes
virtually, he also hits the road

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:29.396
as a regional liaison for IDLA
and checks in at school sites

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:30.626
where the courses are delivered.

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:33.446
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Being a principal in
a brick-and-mortar school,

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:39.776
you're aware of really what teachers
have good control of their classroom.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:42.046
That may be, you know, just
through the noise level,

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:45.406
maybe through the disciplinary
referrals that they send

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:50.196
to the office, whereas in an online
environment, I really have to go

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:53.806
in there and look at the gradebook
and monitor the discussion boards.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.926
&gt;&gt;This is the only correction I have.

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:56.786
It looks really good.

00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:59.766
What I want you to do
is be specific about...

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:03.216
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I really don't want to
see a teacher just tell kids,

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:04.846
"Great job, great job, great job."

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:07.796
I'm really looking for
some personalized feedback

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:11.326
from that teacher to make a
connection with those students,

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:14.396
and then also, you know, to help
point them in the right direction

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:15.826
for their future success.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.476
&gt;&gt;Okay, let me just
see where you're at.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:20.526
&gt;&gt;Jeff: An online course,
it's something

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:23.546
that you can't just let
the kids run free with.

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:27.906
They do still need the structure,
and they need the support to ensure

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:29.876
that they're learning
the content and actually

00:02:29.876 --> 00:02:31.626
that somebody is there
to support them.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:33.606
You know, hence, my role, also.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:38.286
I am a level of support to really
help the teachers to therefore turn

00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:39.726
around and help the students.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.046
&gt;&gt;You can always get ahold of
Miss Sheldon, and I'm always

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:44.976
in here or around school.

00:02:45.076 --> 00:02:46.206
