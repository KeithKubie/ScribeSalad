00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.179
Everyone loves music.

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:05.179
Well, not everyone.

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:12.670
What's up with people who don't care about
music?

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.779
I'm Anthony Carboni, this is DNews, and about
five percent of the population just isn't

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:17.779
into music.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.980
The other ninety-five percent think they're
weird- almost to the point of distrusting

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.980
them.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.200
But is there something wrong with them or
just our reaction to them?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.160
A study out of the University of Barcelona
attempted to figure out what sort of person

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.580
isn't into music.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.480
There's a known condition called "Amusia"
in which people just can't process music-

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.300
they don't understand pitch, they can't remember
or recognize a song.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.510
It can be something someone is born with or
something that comes from damage to the brain.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.870
There's no one actual music center in the
brain, so it's usually damage to the audio

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.540
cortex or some of the memory or logic processing
areas.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.899
You might say "oh, okay, that solves it- people
who don't like music just have a case of weirdbrain."

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.930
But amusia doesn't account for everyone who's
not into music.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.559
The Barcelona study looked at these people
with healthy minds and no love for melody

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.120
and had them try a few things to elicit an
emotional response.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.190
They listened to and rated music.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.970
Then they were asked questions and given a
range of small monetary rewards if they gave

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.070
a correct answer.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.640
The idea was to check the reward center of
the brain, which shows high activity when

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.860
most people listen to music- and when they
get free money.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.880
Because reward center.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.140
Anyway, these people seem to have reward systems
that function just fine- there's nothing wrong

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.320
or different about them.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.250
They just literally don't like music.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.570
The researchers call it "specific musical
anhedonia"- an inability to experience pleasure

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.689
from music.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.619
So: why do others think they're weird?

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.729
We know that people have different interests
than us.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.049
Asking around the office, I found that people
were fine if someone didn't like TV, or sports,

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.200
or reading, or a bunch of other activities.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.370
But no one seemed to be cool with people who
didn't enjoy music- or food.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.860
Now, we've discussed a lot of our ingrained
tendencies to seek out and trust people with

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.920
similar traits before.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.240
It's a safety and survival thing from our
tribal past- people who think the way we do

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.060
make easier and safer companions because there's
less chance of stress and disagreements.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.530
Even babies tend to shun people they think
are different in some way.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.980
But why the huge distrust and disbelief when
it comes to music and food?

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.650
This is conjecture, but food's required for
survival and there's a community aspect to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.790
it- early societies built around the sharing
of it, and now our cultural clocks are built

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.650
around meal breaks and family dinners.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.450
It's not just linked to physical survival,
it seems to have a link to social survival.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.349
Maybe it's so built into us on a basic level
that we distrust people who say they don't

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.349
love it.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.139
even though in our society where most places
have enough food and obesity is an issue,

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.629
not feeling strongly about food might be the
healthier attitude.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.650
A paper published last year by the University
of Colorado says music might have a similar

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.260
social component in our development as a species.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.549
The researchers say that music was a form
of social communication- a way to signal a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.810
group's shared mental state.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.339
The study showed people who more strongly
feel a need to belong also feel a stronger

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.150
emotional connection to music.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.159
It could be people are so confused by someone
who doesn't care about music because it signals

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.620
that person as an outlier fundamentally- sort
of like food.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.090
Like I said, that's more me thinking out loud
than anything else.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.590
But as it stands, 5% of the population isn't
into music- and it seems like nothing's physically

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.049
different about most of them.

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.949
Any ideas on why we're so put-off when people
aren't into music?
