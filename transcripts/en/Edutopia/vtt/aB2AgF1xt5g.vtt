00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:13.176
[blacksmith working]

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.856
&gt;&gt;See, now I got it
spread out even more.

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:19.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These third graders in
Fairfield, California are helping

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.266
to preserve a vanishing
piece of local history.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.656
&gt;&gt;Student: How long
did you have to train

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:26.756
like for to be a real blacksmith?

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:33.646
&gt;&gt;Blacksmith: You can learn basic
blacksmithing in about six months.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:37.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students at Tolenas
Elementary School made several field

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:40.256
trips to document the
history and resources

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:42.826
of nearby Suisun Marsh
and Rush Ranch.

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:43.296
&gt;&gt;Okay. Good.

00:00:43.496 --> 00:00:49.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They plan to share their
findings online with classrooms

00:00:49.246 --> 00:00:54.396
across the country with what teacher,
Eva calls, The Geo-Literacy Project.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.016
&gt;&gt;We wanted to do something where
could take our county, our history,

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.266
our geology, our geography
and encourage students

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.436
to become literate in it.

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:05.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All of the content
on the Geo-Literacy webpage grew

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:08.796
out of self-directed inquiry
by La Mar's third graders.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.486
&gt;&gt;Eva: We started with
an essential question

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:12.686
which is why was the preservation
of Rush Ranch important?

00:01:13.526 --> 00:01:16.046
&gt;&gt;The students picked the
area they wanted to research.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:17.796
They drove their own projects.

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:20.746
The groups were looking at specific
plants and specific animals.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.346
&gt;&gt;Woman: That's called
Miner's Lettuce.

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:23.606
I don't know if it has a smell.

00:01:23.606 --> 00:01:24.736
&gt;&gt;Student: And it smells a tiny bit.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.146
&gt;&gt;Eva: We're just looking at
specific Native American issues.

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:29.906
&gt;&gt;Man: Obsidian, very good.

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:32.976
&gt;&gt;Student: They used that as a knife.

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:35.676
&gt;&gt;Eva: The blacksmith shop and
then the history of Rush Ranch

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:40.176
from pre-Columbian
all the way up to now.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:46.516
So our students became the authors,
the photographers, the videographers,

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:48.876
and the local historians working

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:51.426
with the high school
students and historians.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:54.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Tule is a wonderful
material that the Indians used

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:57.556
and the Indians made tule ducks.

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:58.616
I made this-

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:00.776
&gt;&gt;Eva: We realized that
we had some local experts.

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:03.106
A retired teacher named
Barbara Van Putten

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:04.956
who had all these wonderful
materials.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:07.776
She had original arrowheads,
she had original baskets

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:11.796
and you can't take those into every
classroom, so my students invited her

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:14.386
to come into class and
bring all her Indian tools

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:15.706
that she had and artifacts.

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:17.886
&gt;&gt;Barbara Van Putten: You're not
going to pull this apart, good.

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:18.776
Thank you.

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:21.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fairfield High School
students helped the third-graders

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:25.236
produce object rotations
by photographing artifacts

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:29.916
from different angles to create a
three-dimensional digital image.

00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:32.616
&gt;&gt;Eva: My students were the
experts with the materials

00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:35.076
with the objects being photographed,

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.416
and the high-schoolers were
the experts with the equipment.

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:38.826
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, one more picture.

00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:41.356
&gt;&gt;Eva: It was a very happy
meeting of the minds.

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:43.866
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: See you can see what
you're going to take a picture of.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:47.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Members of Armijo High
School's technology club offered

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:51.366
to capture video clips and virtual
reality stills for the webpage.

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:54.726
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: Alright, now I'm working
on the virtual tour for Rush Ranch.

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:59.496
And basically the project will go
on their website and I'm trying

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.776
to make the highest
quality panorama that I can

00:03:01.776 --> 00:03:03.666
with the footage that I took.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.126
&gt;&gt;Eva: I'm looking for
something that you learned

00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:08.976
and something that was amazing.

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:11.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: La Mar believes that
by studying their local history,

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:14.406
students can taste the
joy of lifelong learning.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.336
&gt;&gt;Student: It might have been chasing
like a salt marsh harvest mouse

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:21.166
or something because it showed like
the footprints heading to the hill

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:22.956
as if it were chasing something.

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:25.506
&gt;&gt;All of you know what
this is, right?

00:03:25.926 --> 00:03:29.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, that's
the horn of the...

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.166
&gt;&gt;Eva: They developed
a love for history.

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:34.676
They look back at choices that were
made historically and they realize

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:37.526
that this has a meaning to our lives
and that's what you really hope

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:38.766
as a teacher that you can get them

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.346
to understand is what they're
learning now does have a meaning.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.896
It's not just a hoop
they jump through.

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:45.626
They develop a love for learning.

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:47.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Using the
Fairfield webpage

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.616
as a template La Mar hopes other
communities will make their own

00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:52.286
Geo-Literacy sites.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.816
&gt;&gt;Eva: Part of this
project is the hope

00:03:54.816 --> 00:03:58.476
that we can take students anywhere
in this country that we are studying

00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:02.296
and go to that community's
Geo-Literacy site and look

00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:04.996
at their history, look at their
topography, look at their geology.

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:07.266
&gt;&gt;And some of them did like
the same things as we did,

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:10.676
we could learn different
facts off of them,

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:13.796
and like- Maybe add it to their-

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:19.706
&gt;&gt;Ours, and show everyone
what all of us have learned

00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:21.746
from off of each other, Yeah.

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:24.906
