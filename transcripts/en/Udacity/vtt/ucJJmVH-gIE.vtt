00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the implementation we are summing up the energy for all points,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is mass times gravitation acceleration times y position for every point

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the energy for every spring.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The resulting diagram may be regarded as abstract art,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but also shows the evolution of that rope.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We are starting with a random configuration,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but eventually the shape of the rope becomes plausible.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Keep in mind that this is not--I repeat--not temporal evolution,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
even though it looks like that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This shows a path of optimization toward an equilibrium.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We are not talking about forces or acceleration here.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's a search process, like finding the shortest path to connect 10 cities.
