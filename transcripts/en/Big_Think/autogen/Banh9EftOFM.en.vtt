at the body of my work it moves around
 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.280
at the body of my work it moves around
from one subject to another so it could

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290
from one subject to another so it could
 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.730
from one subject to another so it could
be mining itself where we move remove

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740

could be quarries it could be refineries
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.099
could be quarries it could be refineries
it could be a dam in China or now could

be you know the city's being built in
China and each one of those things I

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:36.409
China and each one of those things I
 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.610
China and each one of those things I
approached first as conceptually what

there is there any particular reason you

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690
there is there any particular reason you
 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.859
there is there any particular reason you
know why photograph that intersection in

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:02.869

where the freeway began so there are
 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.580
where the freeway began so there are
other components that I'll use to to

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590
other components that I'll use to to
 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.060
other components that I'll use to to
determine where my target is that I'm

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070
determine where my target is that I'm
 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.650

first refinery then I developed the kind

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160
first refinery then I developed the kind
 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.920
first refinery then I developed the kind
of a language that I felt I was

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
of a language that I felt I was
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.990
of a language that I felt I was
comfortable with and then I said ok now

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
comfortable with and then I said ok now
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.009

I'm going to try and find some other

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019
I'm going to try and find some other
 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.390
I'm going to try and find some other
refineries that might bring other

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400
refineries that might bring other
 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.550

perspectives to it or different times
that they were built different things

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
that they were built different things
 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.870
that they were built different things
that they were refining and then i would

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880
that they were refining and then i would
 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.820
that they were refining and then i would
add to that body of work until I felt

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830
add to that body of work until I felt
 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.210
add to that body of work until I felt
okay I've I feel I've exhausted this

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
okay I've I feel I've exhausted this

okay I've I feel I've exhausted this
I've somehow taken this visually as far

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
I've somehow taken this visually as far
 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.150
I've somehow taken this visually as far
as I can go i don't have anything else

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160
as I can go i don't have anything else
 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.430
as I can go i don't have anything else
that I feel I need to say about this and

that I feel I need to say about this and
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.559
that I feel I need to say about this and
then I might close a chapter to that

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569
then I might close a chapter to that
 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.910
then I might close a chapter to that
project then go on to that and that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
project then go on to that and that
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.410
project then go on to that and that
might take two or three years before I

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
might take two or three years before I
 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.110
might take two or three years before I
by the time i get access into it shooted

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
by the time i get access into it shooted
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030
by the time i get access into it shooted
and some things like the refineries took

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
and some things like the refineries took
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.240
and some things like the refineries took
three years and I was pretty much done

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250
three years and I was pretty much done
 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.130

you know how long I want to do it may be
 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.370
you know how long I want to do it may be
determined by do I feel that there's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380
determined by do I feel that there's
