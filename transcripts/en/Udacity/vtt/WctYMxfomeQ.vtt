00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.800
When an entrepreneur goes to me and
investor for the first time,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.260
I think that the most important thing
to be able to do, is articulate what

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.210
your business is and what your
vision is, quickly and so simply.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.400
People talk about pitch decks as being
ten slides is like an ideal thing.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.080
Now imagine if you're just going and
meeting somebody for coffee or

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.900
you're standing in a conference
in years just talking to them.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.750
It's got to be even more
condensed than that.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.330
And you have to be able
to demonstrate passion,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.670
knowledge of what the business is and
a real plan to succeed.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.660
And you have to be able
to do that quickly.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.500
And it takes a lot of
practice to get there.
