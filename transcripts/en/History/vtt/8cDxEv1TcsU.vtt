00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
- Hey, guys.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.100
MIKE: Hey.
- Are you Jim?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.030
- Yes, I am.
- Hey.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.470
How you doing?
Frank.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.530
- Nice to meet you, Frank.
- Hey.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.630
Mike.
Talked to Danny on the phone?

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.800
I did talk to
Danny on the phone?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.930
How's it going?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.300
He said you were trying
to thin some stuff out.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.930
We're starting to sell things
at my mom and dad's house

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.800
in order to clear up some space.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
My sister and my
dad used to actually

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.770
buy and sell antiques
and knickknacks,

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.700
and things like that.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.630
They would sell at
peddler's fairs.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.730
But they stopped doing
that a while ago,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.700
and now it's the time
to part with things.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.800
Here's a big question though.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.000
She said you guys have,
like, a scrap yard.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.700
[laughs] Well, yeah.
Some people might--

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.830
- A small one.
- --call it that.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.000
Yeah.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.430
JIM: We like to keep
things hidden around here.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.430
MIKE: Oh--

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.300
JIM: OK, that's
exactly how that works.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.300
MIKE: --here we go.
Yeah.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.300
FRANK: That was easy.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.900
I told you it was
behind the scenes.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.300
MIKE: See.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.130
My father collected car parts,
Model T's, and the collection

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.170
just kind of kept growing.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470
What you got here,
a Model T chassis?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.570
JIM: That's a 15.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.130
So this is totally
deceiving from the road.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.200
Remember in The Wizard of
Oz, it's all black and white,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.670
and then she lands
after the tornado--

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.900
[interposing voices]
MIKE: --and they open it up.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.830
It's color.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.900
Boom, you come
through the gate--

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.800
JIM: Yeah.
MIKE: --this is our color, man.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.270
My dad had a
passion for things.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.070
My mother was an
interior designer,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.470
and this was nothing
that she liked at all.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.500
[laughing]

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.430
FRANK: This wasn't
too artistic to her?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.170
JIM: The shade--
this was not her.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.370
MIKE: Yeah.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.070
JIM: And so there's a
fence going down the yard.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.830
And one side of
the yard is Mom's

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.230
side and then the other side--

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.570
FRANK: He got the sheds.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.170
JIM: --was Dad's side where
the sheds and all the stuff

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.500
is stored.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.030
If you look around, you might
find a wood lathe in here.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.600
MIKE: I decided to
just dive right in.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.000
[music playing]

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.900
Ah.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.770
There's an outboard motor.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.830
I was cracking up
inside just watching it,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.600
because that's really the
only way to get in there,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.500
is to start climbing on
stuff and digging through it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.330
Frank, you need a sledge?

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.870
He's the first person
who's been to the back

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.730
of that shed in 15 years.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.370
What are you finding?

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.770
MIKE: Ooh.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.600
FRANK: What do you got?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.230
You dent it, you buy it.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.970
Here's a seat.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.100
This is actually-- this
is early motorcycle.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.500
That's not bicycle.
- Is that what that is?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.970
Yeah, just-- you can
tell by the length.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.370
And this one here,
this is motorcycle too.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.030
These are two early
motorcycle seats.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.870
They're pre 1920.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.070
One is just a
frame, the other one

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.930
still has the leather on it.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.430
See the heavy frame?

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.600
A bicycle seat and a
motorcycle seat are similar,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.300
but they're completely
different sizes when you're

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.800
looking at the early stuff.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.900
A motorcycle seat is
going to be wider.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.130
It's going to be longer, and the
undercarriage of the motorcycle

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.230
seat is more heavy duty.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.700
It's built to be sturdier.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.830
This would be
something that would

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.370
be cool, like on a
sweaty bike, you know?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.570
Something you don't
want to restore.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.630
Sure.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.870
How about these
two right here?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.570
Would you sell those two?
JIM: Absolutely.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.470
MIKE: How about 75?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.100
[music playing]

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.270
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll--

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.230
MIKE: Do that?
- --do that.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.470
Absolutely.
- Yeah, this one here--

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.870
I mean, you could
spend the money,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.870
but it'd just be a
great parts piece.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.300
MIKE: This is encouraging
to find something

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.270
like this in these sheds.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.270
That shows me his father
isn't just buying car parts.
