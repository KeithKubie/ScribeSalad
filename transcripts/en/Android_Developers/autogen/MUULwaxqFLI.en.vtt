like you just how hard it is to get more

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
like you just how hard it is to get more
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.300
like you just how hard it is to get more
users building a really good growth

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
users building a really good growth
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.189
users building a really good growth
funnel is insanely hard and it's always

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
funnel is insanely hard and it's always
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.009
funnel is insanely hard and it's always
changing it's super complex and so as a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
changing it's super complex and so as a
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630
changing it's super complex and so as a
p.m. over the last couple years I've

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
p.m. over the last couple years I've
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.130
p.m. over the last couple years I've
been focused on this problem of growth

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
been focused on this problem of growth
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.069
been focused on this problem of growth
for mobile apps and especially focus on

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
for mobile apps and especially focus on
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979
for mobile apps and especially focus on
the identity portion of growth and a lot

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
the identity portion of growth and a lot
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.299
the identity portion of growth and a lot
of people don't think the identity is

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
of people don't think the identity is
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160
of people don't think the identity is
like a really important part of growth

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
like a really important part of growth
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170
like a really important part of growth
and growth hacking and whatever but it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
and growth hacking and whatever but it
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910
and growth hacking and whatever but it
actually really is because you can have

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
actually really is because you can have
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100
actually really is because you can have
an amazing onboarding funnel but if

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
an amazing onboarding funnel but if
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.900
an amazing onboarding funnel but if
people can't or won't log into your app

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
people can't or won't log into your app
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.540
people can't or won't log into your app
then you don't get a user you don't have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
then you don't get a user you don't have
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.810
then you don't get a user you don't have
growth and so it's super important and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
growth and so it's super important and
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189
growth and so it's super important and
we've especially seen a lot of great

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
we've especially seen a lot of great
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.549
we've especially seen a lot of great
success with using phone numbers as a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
success with using phone numbers as a
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250
success with using phone numbers as a
effective identity for growth so why

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
effective identity for growth so why
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.070
effective identity for growth so why
phone numbers one they have a lot of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
phone numbers one they have a lot of
 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.219
phone numbers one they have a lot of
great benefits one their global every

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
great benefits one their global every
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899
great benefits one their global every
single person in the world who has a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
single person in the world who has a
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450
single person in the world who has a
smartphone has a phone number that they

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
smartphone has a phone number that they
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.359
smartphone has a phone number that they
had memorized and actually in a lot of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
had memorized and actually in a lot of
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.649
had memorized and actually in a lot of
emerging markets we've learned that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
emerging markets we've learned that
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.359
emerging markets we've learned that
people prefer to use our phone numbers

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
people prefer to use our phone numbers
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370
people prefer to use our phone numbers
as our identity instead of an email

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
as our identity instead of an email
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.359
as our identity instead of an email
address or another form of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
address or another form of
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.780
address or another form of
identification and second phone numbers

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
identification and second phone numbers
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.359
identification and second phone numbers
are higher quality they give you higher

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
are higher quality they give you higher
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399
are higher quality they give you higher
quality users because they're more

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
quality users because they're more
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.289
quality users because they're more
expensive the mass produce they're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
expensive the mass produce they're
 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.850
expensive the mass produce they're
naturally resistant to the kinds of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
naturally resistant to the kinds of
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.499
naturally resistant to the kinds of
abuse and fraud you might see more often

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
abuse and fraud you might see more often
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.740
abuse and fraud you might see more often
than other types of identification and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
than other types of identification and
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270
than other types of identification and
also I think most importantly for this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
also I think most importantly for this
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969
also I think most importantly for this
discussion is they enable really low

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
discussion is they enable really low
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.420
discussion is they enable really low
friction sign-in for apps and websites

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
friction sign-in for apps and websites
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.389
friction sign-in for apps and websites
and again like I said sign-in is such an

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
and again like I said sign-in is such an
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160
and again like I said sign-in is such an
important part of your growth funnel

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
important part of your growth funnel
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590
important part of your growth funnel
over 90% of people who have issues

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
over 90% of people who have issues
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.999
over 90% of people who have issues
logging into an app are going to leave

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
logging into an app are going to leave
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.690
logging into an app are going to leave
and so I think it's a scary number but I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
and so I think it's a scary number but I
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639
and so I think it's a scary number but I
think it's a great opportunity that if

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
think it's a great opportunity that if
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.319
think it's a great opportunity that if
you really focus on identity as part of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
you really focus on identity as part of
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.880
you really focus on identity as part of
growth you can have really awesome

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
growth you can have really awesome
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.350
growth you can have really awesome
benefits and so if identity is so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
benefits and so if identity is so
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.570
benefits and so if identity is so
important to growth then why is logging

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
important to growth then why is logging
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.730
important to growth then why is logging
so hard to use and I think as

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
so hard to use and I think as
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.220
so hard to use and I think as
developers as web developers we created

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
developers as web developers we created
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.290
developers as web developers we created
the login screens and so like why are we

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
the login screens and so like why are we
 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.600
the login screens and so like why are we
making these screens so hard to use and

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
making these screens so hard to use and
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.010
making these screens so hard to use and
over the years I've noticed like they're

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
over the years I've noticed like they're
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.110
over the years I've noticed like they're
smelly too big I think two big areas of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
smelly too big I think two big areas of
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.280
smelly too big I think two big areas of
why login friction is so our login is so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
why login friction is so our login is so
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.130
why login friction is so our login is so
high friction one big one isn't a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
high friction one big one isn't a
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.590
high friction one big one isn't a
problem of optimization we're trying to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600
problem of optimization we're trying to
 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.730
problem of optimization we're trying to
do so much in a little screen that

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
do so much in a little screen that
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.370
do so much in a little screen that
should be simple as said instead in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
should be simple as said instead in
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.840
should be simple as said instead in
addition to just trying to log somebody

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
addition to just trying to log somebody
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030
addition to just trying to log somebody
in or sign them up we're also trying to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
in or sign them up we're also trying to
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.620
in or sign them up we're also trying to
get a way to contact them by getting

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630
get a way to contact them by getting
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.810
get a way to contact them by getting
their email address we're also trying to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820
their email address we're also trying to
 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.880
their email address we're also trying to
enforce some level of security usually

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
enforce some level of security usually
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.230
enforce some level of security usually
with some sort of password credential

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240
with some sort of password credential
 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.990
with some sort of password credential
criteria and we know it's developers

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000
criteria and we know it's developers
 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.760
criteria and we know it's developers
that passwords still increase security

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
that passwords still increase security
 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.950
that passwords still increase security
as much as they increase frustration and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960
as much as they increase frustration and
 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.070
as much as they increase frustration and
friction one big reason another big

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
friction one big reason another big
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.380
friction one big reason another big
reason why log in is so high friction is

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390
reason why log in is so high friction is
 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.450
reason why log in is so high friction is
on the opposite side of the spectrum and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460
on the opposite side of the spectrum and
 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.340
on the opposite side of the spectrum and
that and I'm definitely guilty of this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
that and I'm definitely guilty of this
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.160
that and I'm definitely guilty of this
myself is we're so focused on the core

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
myself is we're so focused on the core
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.110
myself is we're so focused on the core
value of the app that we're creating

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
value of the app that we're creating
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180
value of the app that we're creating
that we don't really spend a lot of time

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
that we don't really spend a lot of time
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.980
that we don't really spend a lot of time
on login it's just like something that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990
on login it's just like something that
 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.710
on login it's just like something that
we throw together before we ship but the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
we throw together before we ship but the
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.750
we throw together before we ship but the
big disconnect there is that the first

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
big disconnect there is that the first
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580
big disconnect there is that the first
screen our customers see is a login

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590
screen our customers see is a login
 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.590
screen our customers see is a login
screen often and so the last screen you

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
screen often and so the last screen you
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.540
screen often and so the last screen you
thought about it's the first screen your

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
thought about it's the first screen your
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.040
thought about it's the first screen your
customers are going to be experiencing

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050
customers are going to be experiencing
 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.840
customers are going to be experiencing
so huge disconnect and those are two big

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850
so huge disconnect and those are two big
 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.700
so huge disconnect and those are two big

authentication is great as it offers

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.190
authentication is great as it offers
 

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.730

in a user with phone numbers is still

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.020
in a user with phone numbers is still
 

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.440
in a user with phone numbers is still
problematic for Cu some users and for

app developers let's see what a sign-in

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.450
app developers let's see what a sign-in
 

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.300
app developers let's see what a sign-in
experience with phone numbers looks like

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.310
experience with phone numbers looks like
 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.050
experience with phone numbers looks like
today it involves two steps first

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.060
today it involves two steps first
 

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.910
today it involves two steps first
getting the phone number of the device

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920
getting the phone number of the device
 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.600
getting the phone number of the device
and second verifying the phone number

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:16.610
and second verifying the phone number
 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.100
and second verifying the phone number
most apps perform verification by

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.110
most apps perform verification by
 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.320
most apps perform verification by
sending an SMS to the users device with

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.330
sending an SMS to the users device with
 

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.120
sending an SMS to the users device with
a one-time verification code that the

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.130
a one-time verification code that the
 

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.730
a one-time verification code that the
application then verifies so the app has

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740
application then verifies so the app has
 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.230
application then verifies so the app has
to get the phone number of the device

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240
to get the phone number of the device
 

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.480
to get the phone number of the device
and then read the verification code from

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.490
and then read the verification code from
 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.810
and then read the verification code from
the SMS so how do the apps get these two

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:32.820
the SMS so how do the apps get these two
 

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.980
the SMS so how do the apps get these two
things most of the apps employ basically

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
things most of the apps employ basically
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.500
things most of the apps employ basically
ask the users to enter these values but

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:39.510
ask the users to enter these values but
 

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.350
ask the users to enter these values but
that's not a great solution for many

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360
that's not a great solution for many
 

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.670
that's not a great solution for many
reasons first manually inputting the

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680
reasons first manually inputting the
 

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.450
reasons first manually inputting the
phone number is painful it adds a lot of

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.460
phone number is painful it adds a lot of
 

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.310
phone number is painful it adds a lot of
friction for the users to provide phone

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320
friction for the users to provide phone
 

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.829
friction for the users to provide phone
numbers to your app it's also

00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839
numbers to your app it's also
 

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:57.560
numbers to your app it's also
error-prone it's important to note that

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:57.570
error-prone it's important to note that
 

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.140
error-prone it's important to note that
every failed verification because of a

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.150
every failed verification because of a
 

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.540
every failed verification because of a
typo in the phone number adds costs to

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:02.550
typo in the phone number adds costs to
 

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.340
typo in the phone number adds costs to
the app developers because they end up

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.350
the app developers because they end up
 

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.760
the app developers because they end up
sending an SMS to the wrong phone number

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:06.770
sending an SMS to the wrong phone number
 

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.870
sending an SMS to the wrong phone number
let's say the user provides you the

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880
let's say the user provides you the
 

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.780
let's say the user provides you the
phone number and you send the SMS to the

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:11.790
phone number and you send the SMS to the
 

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.060
phone number and you send the SMS to the
phone the next step for you is to get

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.070
phone the next step for you is to get
 

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.640
phone the next step for you is to get
the verification code from the SMS again

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:16.650
the verification code from the SMS again
 

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.560
the verification code from the SMS again
asking the user to provide you the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.570
asking the user to provide you the
 

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.900
asking the user to provide you the
verification code is painful for the

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:20.910
verification code is painful for the
 

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.540
verification code is painful for the
users it requires the users to leave

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:23.550
users it requires the users to leave
 

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.380
users it requires the users to leave
your app go to the SMS app copy or copy

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.390
your app go to the SMS app copy or copy
 

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.150
your app go to the SMS app copy or copy
or remember the verification code from

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160
or remember the verification code from
 

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.199
or remember the verification code from
there

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:30.209
there
 

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:32.059
there
come back to your app and then provide

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:32.069
come back to your app and then provide
 

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:34.009
come back to your app and then provide
it there it's a lot of work for the

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019
it there it's a lot of work for the
 

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:36.829
it there it's a lot of work for the
users many users find it confusing and

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839
users many users find it confusing and
 

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:40.699
users many users find it confusing and
it's not a great experience so many app

00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:40.709
it's not a great experience so many app
 

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:42.230
it's not a great experience so many app
developers have recognized these

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240
developers have recognized these
 

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.960
developers have recognized these
problems with the manual input and what

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
problems with the manual input and what
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.730
problems with the manual input and what
they've started to do is they are now

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740
they've started to do is they are now
 

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.650
they've started to do is they are now
reading the verification code and the

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660
reading the verification code and the
 

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.319
reading the verification code and the
phone number automatically but this

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:51.329
phone number automatically but this
 

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:56.049
phone number automatically but this
approach has its own problems let's see

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:56.059
approach has its own problems let's see
 

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:58.280
approach has its own problems let's see
getting the verification the phone

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:58.290
getting the verification the phone
 

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.590
getting the verification the phone
number from the device and the

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160
verification code from the SMS
 

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.910
verification code from the SMS
automatically requires your apps to get

looks something like this these
 

00:11:09.629 --> 00:11:11.689
looks something like this these
permissions allow the apps to get the

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:11.699

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.970
excited about this functionality the
potential it has for where we can go in

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980
potential it has for where we can go in
 

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.980

their first time from there they can go
 

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:13.250
their first time from there they can go
ahead and use some migration guides that

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260
ahead and use some migration guides that
 

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.750
