00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.780
It seems natural to most of us that we
shouldn't burp loudly in front of

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.289
strangers, touch their behinds without
permission or spit in the face of those

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.949
who annoy us but history shows us a
different story.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.500
What we might take to be normal impulses
to be modest, restrained and dignified are

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
the hard-won fruits of a long and always
unsteady civilizing process.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.530
Human beings have gradually and
painfully learned to tame the beast

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030
inside for the sake of propriety and
kindness.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800
At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us,

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
it can be fruitful to look back in time
in order to trace key moments in the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
history of manners and to search their
by for the future of manners.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.880
13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.260
W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.590
of the later cultures of the Upper
Paleolithic Age in Western Europe.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.439
Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.979
They've domesticated dogs and in their
spare time have developed a taste for

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.570
making remarkable images of the fiercest
wildlife around them especially hyena

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.870
reindeer and mammoths.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.610
We look a little different from the way we do now:

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.430
our bodies are generally heavier and
more solid with strong musculature and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.010
straight foreheads with only slight brow
ridges and prominent chins.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.120
Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.250
There is a lot of what we now call
rape. We do everything in front of one

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.210
another in our caves and most strikingly
we have an occasional habit of eating

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.829
our human enemies.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.520
Following a squabble the leader of a
group will take an enemy severed head

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
carefully remove the brains and tissues
and prepare the skull for use as a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.959
ceremonial drinking vessel.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.100
Primitive humans don't do manners.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.360
Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.860
We are at one of the high points
of ancient civilization in the West.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.500
In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.440
for another 1400 years
at least.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.100
We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100
For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.920
having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.920
violence, to policing the way men behave towards women,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.120
to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.520
breath and its effect on the
sensitivities of others.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.159
However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.209
for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.929
favorite especially from Iberian breeds.

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.929
The specifics of the Roman approach to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.419
oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.280
Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.310
in their minds from what they term the
Barbaria:

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.030
the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.030
noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.480
Humanity will have to wait a while until
Charlemagne is next recorded as

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.449
brushing his teeth with thyme.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720
Poitiers, France, 1152

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.960
French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.790
She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.139
for her and her husband.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.829
This sounds merely romantic but the
songs are not simple sentimentality.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.209
They are part of Eleanor's subtle
attempt to civilize her husband and the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.689
men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.139
She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.060
should act around women.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.949
Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and
attitude known as chivalry develops in

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.030
the courts of Europe: an idea that men
need to moderate their force and sexual

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.959
impulses to protect what is termed the
honor and dignity of women.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.389
Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early
highly coded call from ?? to what we

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.389
would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.140
London, England, 1209

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.380
The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.720
It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy
and decorum in social situations.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.680
It advises for example if you wish to
belch remember to look up to the ceiling,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.900
do not attack your enemy while he is
squatting to defecate,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.240
never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.860
Don't mount your horse in the hole and
in front of grandees do not openly

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.340
excavate your nostril by twisting your
fingers.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.080
Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.080
In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.090
ever-increasing sensor of picking one's
nose in public.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.260
Murano, Venice 1450

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.220
A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.610
flute takes Europe by storm,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.330
under the direction of the Venetian
master glass-maker Angelo Barovier.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.420
On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.210
highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.780
Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.060
Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.920
The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake;

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.230
it's not as if its maker was trying to
make it tough and hardy and then

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.830
stupidly ended up with something a child could snap.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.060
It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.433
The underlying thesis is that it's the
duty of civilization to create

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.860
environments where it's okay to be fragile.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.360
It's obvious the glass could easily be
smashed so it forces people especially

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.780
men to use their fingers very tenderly.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.800
It teaches people that moderation is
admirable and elegant not just a tedious demand.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.920
It tells us that being careful is
glamorous and exciting even fashionable.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.000
It's a moral tale about gentleness told
by means of a drinking vessel.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.300
The Venetian glass makes a big claim: being mannered and civilized involves being aware of the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.890
effect of one's strength on others.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.070
Marseille, France, 1533

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.390
14-year-old Catherine de' Medici marries the future Henry II of France.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.540
Her home city of Florence is by now the epicenter of culture in the Western world.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.880
And she brings with her new culinary fashions

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.990
that quickly become all the rage:
macaroons, gelato and most significantly

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.750
a collection of forks.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.190
The fork adds a bizarre complication to
the rituals of eating dinner: instead of

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.970
using our fingers which are ideally made for tearing meat off the bone fast,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.980
we'll slow down on purpose and may use the strange new instrument so as to

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.320
temper and guide our appetite.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.940
The fork quickly spreads around Europe, by 1600 no European court is without a large set of forks.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
This marks out the savages from the
civilized.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.060
Marais, Paris, 1750

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.700
A Swiss philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes an

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.820
extraordinary essay: "A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences".

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.840
What makes it so revolutionary and such a milestone in the history of manners is

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.350
that for the first time in Western
culture an author sticks up for the so

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.250
called "un-mannered savage".

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.460
For the guys who would have ? not brush their teeth, never employed a fork and had a lot of nasal hair,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.160
but whom Russo now contrast favorably with modern mannered
people.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.190
Rousseau tells us that people living in
what he calls the state of nature were

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.290
in his eyes far superior to educated and mannered Parisians.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.340
Their manners may have been simple but they were honest and
forthright without the sins of what he

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.820
now terms the "over-civilized".

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.340
Russa retells the story of civilization as one of loss and decline,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.860
from a primordial state of fresh-faced curiosity, honesty

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.210
and enthusiasm to barbarous over
politeness, fakery and deceit.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.320
He describes the elaborate French
court Versay as less civilized than

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.820
an early human cave.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.880
Readers across Europe are astonished and not a little impressed by this impudence.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:13.160
For hundreds of years moralists have been arguing that our natural selves are wild, harmful, over-sexual

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.940
and dangerous and that we must
learn to a tame them for the sake of others.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.400
Now Russo suggest the diametrical
opposite: civilization has gone too far,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.600
it's our mannered selves that have become the problem, and the task of a properly

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.610
evolved civilization is to throw off the
chains of manners, to relax us, strip off

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.170
the etiquette and return to primitive
frankness.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.540
Russo's point continues to echo down to our own times.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.580
It is his voice we
can here whenever someone sticks up for

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.370
the simpler life and suggest we dress
less formally, eat dinner more casually and more

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.510
readily say whatever is passing through our minds.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.700
New York, United States, 1827

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.590
A French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville is on a tour of the young United States,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.960
in an effort to understand the spirit of a new kind of society:

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.660
A democracy.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.520
He is immediately struck by American
manners or lack thereof.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.940
In Europe, reflects de Tocqueville manners have been codified to emphasize

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.180
hierarchical differences between people.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:19.360
Ordinary people defer to aristocrats, aristocrats to royalty and so on but in
the United States

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.240
everything is done so as to suggest that there are no differences between people.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.400
No one takes off their hat to anyone, a
postman can casually greet a judge, a mule

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.540
driver can strike up cheerful banter
with a wealthy merchant, and one can not

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.350
tell by someone's clothes whether they
might be living in a mansion or a hut.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.510
Expressions like "how you doing"

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.140
and "hi" are heard everywhere across the new republic.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.290
It could be charming but the
aristocratic de Tocqueville

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.530
wryly notes a problem: these casual
manners

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.510
do not do away with class and wealth
differences, they merely sentimentally

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.550
disguise them.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:58.150
The manners of old Europe
have been accused of being cruel in

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:03.170
their stress on hierarchy but now
de Tocqueville  accuses American casual

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.170
democratic manners of their own kind of cruelty:

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:11.230
because they pretend that everyone is in the same boat when clearly they're not really.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.060
At least in old Europe everyone knew who the king

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.310
and the aristocrats were, adds de Tocqueville.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.240
Now the casual manners teach everyone to think of themselves as alike and

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.300
encourage them to dream of making it to the top of the pile.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.470
But when society remains very unequal
and opportunities for genuine

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.700
advancement and not as widespread as is
thought then bitterness and a sense of

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.840
failure are likely to be the result to
de Tocqueville ? notes.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.380
Casual manners can be their own form of
fakery.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.520
Northern Ireland, June 2013

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.940
At a meeting of the G8
developed countries a few eyebrows are

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.370
raised when some of the most powerful
men in the world including Barrack Obama

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.480
of the United States

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.230
David Cameron of the United Kingdom and François Hollande of France all appear

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.670
at a press conference without ties.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.480
The men also hug and in some cases high-five each other during the course
of the summit.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.340
The absence of ties is an inadvertent and continuing tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.800
Ties have been deemed a symbol of oppression and hierarchy by the people who control the nuclear codes

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.670
and direct the world economy.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.310
Between 1996 and 2008 sales of ties in the U.S halved.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.920
In the UK, the Tirerack company, for 20 years the country's biggest seller of ties goes into administration in late 2014.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.360
By early 2015 in The United States only 18 percent of male employees regularly wear a tie to work.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.460
One-third show up in jeans at least once a week.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.660
Southwark Crown Court, London, September 2014

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:44.819
Eleanor of Aquitaine's long campaign to civilized men reaches a new milestone:

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.740
A minor British DJ Dave Lee Travis is
found guilty of indecently assaulting a woman two decades earlier.

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:56.490
He is accused by a judge of having
displayed primitive behavior when he

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.790
groped a young female employees breasts at his radio offices.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:05.880
Patting bottoms, eyeing breasts and throwing out leary comments is now deemed deeply anachronistic and

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.980
vile manners.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:12.560
Dave Lee Travis, a 69 year old father of two is roundly punished and humiliated for his actions.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.160
Travis is in a long line of men who in
the early 21st century are called to

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.230
account for their behavior towards women.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.529
They are puzzled and at a certain level
incensed by this.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:26.550
They had come of age in a period when Victorian manners towards women were on

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.190
the retreat seen as outdated and
hypocritical.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:35.120
These men had believed in messages about casualness and sexual
liberation but it seems they had fatally

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.710
misinterpreted what a world with a few
less sexual manners would actually be like.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:46.020
Slowly society is learning to re-heed some of the basic lessons of Victorian etiquette books always stressed:

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.240
That men must be
careful around women, that they must

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.610
never touch or look at them
inappropriately and that the

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.570
overwhelming priority is never to cause
anyone else discomfort through one's advances.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.880
Men like Dave Lee Travis are
judged to be pathological and sexual predators.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.680
Looked at through a longer lens
they could also simply be accused of

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.850
having forgotten their manners.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.120
The history of manners shows an ongoing
search for the best way to be kind.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.820
For long periods, it seemed that being mannered had to be about hiding and moderating the inner self

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.860
which was associated with something beastly and cruel.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.400
Then under the
influence of Rousseau and the Romantic philosophy to which he gave birth

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.630
good manners were associated with being
natural and free, letting out the inner self

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.680
which was deemed to be good and
spontaneously kind.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.580
But we have come to learn that there are in fact limitations
to the natural approach.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.840
There is unwitting cruelty and political
subterfuge in the defense of natural

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.199
manners which suggests we're all equal
when we're not which allow one gender to

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:47.239
pester another.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.420
there's a fine line between being natural about things and being bothersome to others.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.360
Aline we are continuing to explore often at great cost to all concerned.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.460
There are no doubt many behaviors which many of us
subscribe to now which a later age may

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.300
come to see is no less vulgar than
Catherine de Medici found a meal without a fork.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.540
The aspiration to be well-mannered
shouldn't be seen as pretentious or fake.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.140
It should be generously
interpreted as always belonging to a highly important wish

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.300
not to cause other
people distress through one's impulses and needs.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.900
The history of manners goes on.
