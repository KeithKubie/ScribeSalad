00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well let's see, to calculate mg, we multiply m, which is 10 kg by g which is 10 m/sÂ².

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
10&lt;i&gt;10 is a 100 N. Before we go to Fn, let's do the wall first.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If the right word force is 86.6 N and the object isn't accelerating,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
well the left word force must be bouncing it exactly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These two forces are the only horizontal forces that must be exactly equal. So this is 86.6 N.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We also know that for opposite that rests, forces up must bounce forces down

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and for us that means that the normal force that goes up must equal not just mg, which goes down,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but also mg + FRy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Those are the two downward forces and that gives me a value of 150 N.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This was a very tricky problem, if you follow along, you're doing great

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and if not go back and watch again
