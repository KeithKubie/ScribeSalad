00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.110
Stand there.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.280
You're controlling the front
end of a traffic jam, Dean.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.140
So we're going to set
up our traffic jam here.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.240
What I want you to do is when
a car arrives at the back,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.430
just pull off the
car at the front.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.990
Pull it along the road.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.490
OK, so first car coming in.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.100
Second car.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.560
Carry on.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.480
What you can see is the
traffic jam moves backwards

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.380
along the road.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.600
That's it.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.560
OK, thanks very much, Dean.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.960
So traffic jams move
backwards along the road.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.780
Now, we actually have some
real traffic data here

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.840
taken from a section of the M25.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
Now, here we have the section
between junction 10, junction

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.280
15.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.500
Cars flow in this
direction along the road.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.780
And this is a snapshot
of the traffic.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.860
Now, the dark regions
are where the traffic

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.180
is moving very slowly.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.540
So you can think of
it as a traffic jam.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.640
And the light regions
are where the traffic

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.637
is moving reasonably quickly.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.980
So there's no traffic jam there.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.960
And this was taken at 8
o'clock in the morning.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.740
Now, as time moves
on, of course,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.560
we just saw, traffic
jams move on.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.060
And so if I slide
this along, you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.300
can actually see let's
just take one traffic jam.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.520
It's black in the centre here.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.480
You can actually see it move
backwards along the road.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.940
Now, of course,
no one driver has

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.440
knowledge of what's
happening on the whole road.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.480
But if we look at
the pattern that's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.350
formed along the
road for all time,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.440
we begin to see something
that does indeed

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.930
resemble some kind
of pattern, not

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.230
completely dissimilar from
the patterns, the lines we're

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.670
getting on these mixed grains
that are rotating around there.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.640
And this pattern isn't
completely regular.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.980
But it isn't
completely irregular.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.480
If it was disordered, then
the black and the white

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.370
would be smeared out
all over the place.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.290
They'd just be
completely disorganised.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.190
But we can see some
kind of ordering there.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.670
And it's understanding
these kind

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.310
of patterns and the realisation
that the patterns that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.040
occur in things like
traffic are very

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.100
similar to the
patterns that occur

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.490
in, for example, in sand and
in many other things in nature.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.780
That's giving scientists
an understanding

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.360
about what happens in
time in these systems.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.250
And that's the key,
then, to getting

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.120
some level of predictability
about the future.
