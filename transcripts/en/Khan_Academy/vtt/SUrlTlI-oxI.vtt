00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.850
- [Instructor] Given the graph

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.670
of y equals f of x pictured below,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.010
determine the equations of
all vertical asymptotes.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.960
Let's see what's going on here.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.550
So it looks like interesting
things are happening

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.040
at x equals negative
four and x equals two.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.100
At x equals negative
four, as we approach it

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.590
from the left the value of the function

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.010
just becomes unbounded right over here.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.280
Looks like as we approach
x equals negative four

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.310
from the left, the value of
our function goes to infinity.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.270
Likewise, as we approach
x equals negative four

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.440
from the right, it looks like our,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.240
the value of our function
goes to infinity.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.160
So, I'd say that we definitely
have a vertical asymptote

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.410
at x equals negative four.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.420
Now, let's look at x equals two.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.220
As we approach x equals two from the left,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.110
the value of our function once
again approaches infinity,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.610
or it becomes unbounded.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.850
Now, from the right, we
have an interesting thing.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.320
If we look at the limit from
the right right over here,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.740
it looks like we're
approaching a finite value.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.210
As we approach x equals
two from the right,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.560
it looks like we're approaching f

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.940
of x is equal to negative four.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.820
But, just having a one-sided
limit that is unbounded,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.010
is enough to think about
this as a vertical asymptote.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.710
The function is not
defined right over here,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.470
and as we approach it from just one side,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.110
we are becoming unbounded.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.610
It looks like we're approaching infinity

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.370
or negative infinity, so that by itself,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.040
this unbounded left hand limit,
or left-side limit by itself

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.630
is enough to consider x equals
two a vertical asymptote.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.480
So, we can say that there's
a vertical asymptote

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.843
at x equals negative
four and x equals two.
