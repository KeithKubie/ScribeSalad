00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.400
 The definition of "jumping" in the dictionary is used by unimaginative filmmakers. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.500
 Cheap ways to scare the audience 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 According to many comments from my last video, many people tend to agree with this definition. 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 I also think that "jumping" has lost its former glory. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 Not only because a lot of movies are full of them, but I think a lot of filmmakers don’t use them. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.900
 But I don’t agree with many people’s places. I think it’s a place to hope for “jumping”. 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.200
 And people didn’t give enough surprises to surprise surprises. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
 So let's see what they can do 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700
 If you can't handle all the jumps 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.700
 You are just a big coward 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.000
 You are right, I am a coward. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 In short, jumping is a sudden clip, usually accompanied by scary sounds. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.200
 To introduce this technique, let us look at an example that is not a horror movie. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 I should. . . I really want to touch it again, the last time. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 What makes this more than just a simple jump scare? 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.500
 The important thing is that it is not only scary, but it highlights an important story point. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 Appeared throughout the Lord of the Rings 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.000
 Through a jump, we see how Bilbo was turned into a sin and horror creature by the Lord of the Rings. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.900
 There is no doubt that jumping is the best way to show the horrible things of the Lord of the Rings. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800
 So now, in their remaining adventures, that jump has been entangled with us. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.200
 Remind us how dangerous it is to stare at the Lord of the Rings, and how powerful the Lord of the Rings is. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
 I think the shock is misunderstood because it can do more things. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.400
 Not just to scare us 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 Jumping should increase the sense of urgency by letting us doubt any safe moments 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 After being shocked, we are nervous 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 In each of the next long pauses or dark shadows, 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.600
 There will be a deep suspense and warning because we will question everything we see. 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 This is where the director uses the jump to scare the mistake. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.800
 When used correctly, this technology will also make the quiet moments scary 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.500
 I think it is in front of us 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.500
 It may be anywhere! The fence is down and it can be worn in any area it likes. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.600
 A jump should be like real life: 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300
 Once you are scared, you will be scared for the rest of the night. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.600
 In the great movie "Witches", a very subtle and rare jump is used. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 They are not terrible in themselves, but fast clips and changes in sound 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.000
 Still adding to the overall suspense of the film 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 This technique is often misused 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.500
 Not used in scenes with surface serenity and suspense 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.400
 For example, Silent Hill: Revelation, almost everything is scared 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 Including toast 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.200
 Ok, I take back what I just said. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 You can use toast as an effective jump, 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 But it is building an excellent story. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.500
 Another person doesn’t know why it’s scary. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.600
 Take the ten most intimidating analyses of WatchMojo history: 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.900
 "" One or two mammoth faces or huge noise 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 It’s a place that makes scars very scary." 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.800
 This is a completely wrong jump analysis 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.600
 The most important thing is not to scare itself, but to create a scary 30 seconds before the moment. 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 Create time to distinguish between good jump and cheap jump 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.400
 Take the Sixth Sense as a simple example 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.000
 The tent slowly opens from the upper left corner until the lower right corner, and the lens moves with it. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 This move guides our eyes to the bottom right corner - jumping to wait for us 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.800
 This jump does not have a quick clip, and there is no discreet and scary move. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.900
 This scene is scary because of the slow lens movement camp 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.700
 Compare all the lazy jumps: the bad guys appear in the bathroom mirror 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.900
 No time to build, it is an old routine 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.700
 These guessy jumps are the reason why the scare has become notorious. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.200
 The best jump should be beyond our expectations, not as we expected 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.500
 In "Hidden", this jump is unexpected, because we subconsciously expected 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.600
 Terror will appear through flashback, not her story 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.400
 Similarly in Jaws 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.900
 The most horrible thing we guess is when he finds his teeth. 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.400
 But there are more horrible things to happen later. 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 An excellent jump is very similar to magic: it is about the performance skills that attract the audience. 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.600
 Let us use the lines in "Fatal Magic" to summarize this technique. 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.300
 All magic consists of three parts or three actions 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.700
 The first part is called "guarantee": the magician shows you the usual things. 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.300
 a stack of cards, a bird, or a person 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.200
 He shows you this object 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200
 Maybe he will ask you to check it out 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 To prove that it is an ordinary object 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.200
 You must know 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.300
 ordinary 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.700
 But of course it is probably not 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 The second part is called "turning" 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.900
 The magician holds the ordinary object 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.600
 Did an unexpected thing 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.600
 Now, you are thinking about where the secret is, but you can't find it. 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.200
 Of course, because you are not really looking for 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.600
 You don't really want to know 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.000
 You want to be entertained 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.700
 But you won’t applaud now, because it’s not enough to make something disappear. 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.000
 You need to change it back 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.500
 This is why all magic has a third action 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.500
 The hardest part 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.900
 We call it "reputation" 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.700
 Let's face it right, it's usually bad to jump, but don't die. 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.900
 Because when used correctly, they are also very powerful. 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.300
 Don't be afraid, I won't end this video with a jump. 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.300
 Or I will hhh 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.300
 Thanks for watching
