00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:02.013
- [Voiceover] In the last
video I started to talk about

00:00:02.013 --> 00:00:03.773
the formula for curvature.

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:06.464
Just to remind everyone of where we are

00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:09.571
you imagine that you have some
kind of curve in let's say

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.394
two dimensional space just
for the sake of being simple.

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:17.265
Let's say this curve is
parameterized by a function S of T.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.048
So every number T corresponds
to some point on the curve.

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.013
For the curvature you start thinking about

00:00:22.013 --> 00:00:23.812
unit tangent vectors.

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:25.652
At every given point what does the unit

00:00:25.652 --> 00:00:27.082
tangent vector look like?

00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:30.768
The curvature itself which
is denoted by this sort of

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:32.571
Greek letter Kappa

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.477
is gonna be the rate of
change of those unit vectors

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:38.264
kind of how quick they're
turning in direction

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:40.352
not with respect to the parameter t

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.216
but with respect to arc length d s.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:45.998
What I mean by arc length here is

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:48.292
just a tiny step you can think

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:52.185
the size of a tiny step
along the curve would be d s.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.969
You're wondering, as you
take a tiny step like that

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.015
does the unit tangent
vector turn a a lot or

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.405
does it turn a little bit?

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:00.616
The little schematic that I
said you might have in mind

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:02.705
is just a completely separate space

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.612
where for each one of
these unit tangent vectors

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:08.314
you go ahead and put them in that space

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:12.202
saying okay so this one would
look something like this

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:14.374
this one is pointed down
and to the right so it would

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.837
look something like this.

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:18.386
This one is pointed very much down.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:20.448
You're wondering basically
as you take tiny little steps

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:22.448
of size d s what is this

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.307
change to the unit tangent vector

00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:30.028
and that change is gonna
be some kind of vector.

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:32.323
Because the curvature's
really just a value

00:01:32.323 --> 00:01:34.699
a number that we want all
we care about is the size

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:36.296
of that vector.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.963
The size of the change
to the tangent vector

00:01:41.482 --> 00:01:44.063
as you take a tiny step in d s.

00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.495
Now this is pretty abstract right?

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:47.786
I've got these two completely
separate things that

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:51.095
are not the original functions
that you have to think about.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:54.225
You have to think about this
unit tangent vector function

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.704
and then you also have to think about this

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:57.343
notion of arc length.

00:01:57.343 --> 00:01:59.389
The reason, by the way,
that I'm using an s here

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.398
as well as here for the
parameterized of the curve

00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:05.320
is because they're actually quite related.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.160
I'll get to that a little bit below.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.262
To make it clear what this
means I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.658
and go through an example
here where let's say our

00:02:11.658 --> 00:02:14.491
parameterized with respect to t is

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:18.557
a cosine sine pair.

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:21.347
So we've got cosine of
t as the x component

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:24.051
and then sine of t as the y component

00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:24.897
sine of t.

00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:27.312
Just to make it so that
it's not completely boring

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:32.221
let's multiply both of these
components by constant r.

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:33.983
What this means, you might recognize this,

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:35.341
cosine sine pair

00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.591
what this means

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.685
is that in the x y plane

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:43.343
you're actually drawing
a circle with radius r.

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:47.928
This would be some kind of
circle with the radius r.

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.710
While I go through this example
I also want to make a note

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.984
of what things would look like
a little bit more abstractly.

00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:58.200
If we just had s of t equals
not specific functions

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.532
that I laid down but
just any general function

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:03.356
for the x component and
for the y component.

00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:06.222
The reason I want to do
this is because the concrete

00:03:06.222 --> 00:03:09.129
version is gonna be helpful
and simple and something

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.239
we can deal with but
almost so simple as to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.901
not be indicative of just
how complicated the normal

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:17.890
circumstances but the
more general circumstances

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.731
so complicated I think
it will actually confuse

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:21.084
things a little bit too much.

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:22.475
It'll be good to kind of go through

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.558
both of them in parallel.

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:27.140
The first step is to
figure out what is this

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.737
unit tangent vector?

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:31.060
What is that function
that at every given point

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.061
gives you a unit tangent
vector to the curve?

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.128
The first thing for that

00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:37.600
is to realize that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.604
we already have a notion
of what should give the

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:40.791
tangent vector

00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:43.494
the derivative of our
vector valued function

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.336
as a function of t

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:47.792
the direction in which in points is

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.470
in the tangent direction.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.620
If I go over here and if
I compute this derivative

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.453
and I say s prime of t

00:03:55.154 --> 00:03:56.547
which involves just taking the

00:03:56.547 --> 00:03:57.939
derivative of both components so the

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.022
derivative of cosine is negative sine

00:04:03.093 --> 00:04:06.123
of t multiplied by r and the derivative

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:07.540
of sine is cosine

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.559
of t multiplied by r.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.633
More abstractly, this is just gonna be

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:20.143
anytime you have two
different component functions

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:22.448
you just take the derivative of each one.

00:04:22.448 --> 00:04:24.209
Hopefully you've seen this, if not

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.094
maybe take a look of videos on

00:04:26.094 --> 00:04:30.338
taking the derivative of a
position vector valued function.

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:32.678
This we can interpret
as that tangent vector

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:34.930
but it might not be a unit vector right?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.522
We want a unit tangent vector and this

00:04:36.522 --> 00:04:38.770
only promises us the direction.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.937
What we do to normalize it

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:46.881
and get a unit tangent vector function

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.590
which I'll call capital t of lowercase t

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.819
that's kind of confusing right?

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.375
Capital t is for tangent vector

00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:00.426
lowercase t is the parameter.

00:05:00.426 --> 00:05:01.667
I'll try to keep that straight.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.932
It's sort of standard notation but

00:05:04.932 --> 00:05:07.761
there is the potential
to confuse with this.

00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:11.928
What that's gonna be is
your vector value derivative

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:16.969
but normalized. So we have to divide by

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.095
whatever it's magnitude is

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:21.261
as a function of t.

00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:23.594
In this case, in a specific example

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:27.177
that magnitude, if we
take the magnitude of

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:30.410
negative sine of t r

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.330
multiply by r

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.997
and then cosine of t

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.711
multiplied by r

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:42.628
so we're taking the magnitude
of this whole vector

00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:43.545
what we get

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.564
make myself even more room here

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:49.064
is the square root

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:51.916
of sine squared

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:54.824
negative sine squared is
just gonna be sine squared

00:05:54.824 --> 00:05:58.552
so sine squared of t
multiplied by r squared

00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:02.444
and then over here cosine
square times r squared

00:06:02.444 --> 00:06:05.361
cosine squared of t times r squared

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.447
we can bring that r squared
outside of the radical

00:06:09.447 --> 00:06:11.045
to sort of factor it out

00:06:11.045 --> 00:06:13.539
turning it into an r

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.672
and on the inside we have sine
squared plus cosine squared

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:19.803
I'm being too lazy to write
down the t's right now

00:06:19.803 --> 00:06:21.891
because no matter what
the t is that whole value

00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.224
just equals one.

00:06:24.294 --> 00:06:27.283
This entire thing is just gonna equal r.

00:06:27.283 --> 00:06:30.927
What that means is that our
unit tangent vector up here

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:34.652
is gonna be the original
function but divided by r.

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:36.087
It happens to be a
constant usually it's not

00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:38.483
but it happens to be a
constant in this case.

00:06:38.483 --> 00:06:40.860
What that looks like

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.254
given that our original function is

00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:45.203
negative sine of t times
r and cosine of t times r

00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:47.170
we're dividing out by an r

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.505
the ultimate function that we get

00:06:49.505 --> 00:06:51.672
is just negative sine of t

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.262
and then cosine of t.

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.307
For fear of running a little bit long

00:07:00.307 --> 00:07:02.230
I think I'll call it an
end to this video and

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.803
continue on with the same
argument in the next video.
