[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:05.440
SPEAKER: Welcome back.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.380
Our final guest of
the day is Chet Haase,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.750
whom you already know if
you're an Android developer.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.640
Though you might not
know that he's also

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.410
the author of "Round and Holy--

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.110
An Homage to Donuts."

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.570
Chet, welcome to the show.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.650
CHET HAASE: Thanks.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.710
SPEAKER: So we already
talked with Dan Galpin

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.680
about all the announcements
that were in the keynote.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.010
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.302
SPEAKER: So I'm hoping that
we can go more big picture.

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.410
Is that OK?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.543
CHET HAASE: You're
saying, fast forward.

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:28.710
Don't talk about that stuff.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.730
We already heard it.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.530
You're boring me.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.530
That's what I'm hearing.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.445
SPEAKER: I mean, I wouldn't
have put it that way.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:34.070
CHET HAASE: OK.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.300
SPEAKER: Anyway, Kotlin First.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.470
CHET HAASE: Kotlin First.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.390
SPEAKER: What does that mean?

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.670
And sort of like,
how do we get here?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.810
And what does it mean for
developers moving forward?

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.180
CHET HAASE: Sure.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.190
SPEAKER: So big picture.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.190
CHET HAASE: Big picture.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.343
So the big picture is
we announced Kotlin

00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:47.260
a couple of years ago.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.045
It turns out, people
really like it.

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:51.420
A lot of developers really
liked it at that time, anyway.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.462
What we announced was, we
understand you like it,

00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:56.260
and we're going to support
it as an official language.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.430
So it's a good thing.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.970
So people continued to
use it more and more.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.200
We agree with everyone.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.920
They should be using
it more and more.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.180
And now, we want to
invest in it more and more

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.225
and offer more capabilities for
them to use it more and more.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:11.100
You like that phrase?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.760
I like it a lot.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.460
I'm using it a lot.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.030
So let me give you a
couple of examples.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.613
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.060
CHET HAASE: So we have this
set of APIs called Jetpack.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.560
And increasingly,
a lot of the stuff

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.720
that we're doing in
Jetpack, including

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.640
some of the stuff that's
coming out at I/O,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
is going to be coming out
first with Kotlin capabilities,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.300
things like coroutine
integration into room,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.535
also coroutine deep
integration into life cycle

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:36.330
and live data to
make things easier.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.760
Kotlin First library is
like the new Jetpack Compose

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.885
that we just announced
we're going to be developing

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:42.100
in the open today.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.920
So we're going to be
doing much more Kotlin

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.240
stuff for Kotlin developers
outside of Android as well.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.530
We're also investing in more
training and docs and sample

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.640
code.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.710
Things like, let's see,
with JetBrains, we're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.100
doing Kotlin Everywhere.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.340
It's this global
series of events,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.780
conference-type
educational events.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.330
There's also a new
Udacity course.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.120
I think it's Developing Android
Applications with Kotlin.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.330
Just launched all of those
episodes in that course.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.030
So just a lot more training
in general to help people

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.400
learn and use Kotlin
more, because we think

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.315
they should be doing that.

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:18.440
SPEAKER: I think one of
the interesting discoveries

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.000
I made the other day is that
there are developers now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
that started as Kotlin
Android developers.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.560
CHET HAASE: That blows my mind.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.540
SPEAKER: Right?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.700
Which is, anyway, that's cool.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.992
You've been on Android
for a while now.

00:02:33.992 --> 00:02:35.950
CHET HAASE: Oh, I was
supposed to fill that in.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.250
So I joined actually nine
years ago this month.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.565
SPEAKER: Nine years.

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:39.690
CHET HAASE: Yeah, 2010.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.680
SPEAKER: Sometime.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.603
In that time, you've, I'm sure,
had a really unique perspective

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.520
on everything that's
happened in the developer

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.480
space for Android.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.280
So here's two relatively
specific questions for you.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.300
One, what's something that's
super exceptional that you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.820
didn't expect when you
started working on Android?

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.440
And what's something
that you still

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.390
want to make better
after all this time?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.822
CHET HAASE: So
super exceptional,

00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:05.530
there's a bunch of
things to choose from.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.960
There's all kinds of
interesting features.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.335
And development
software is cool,

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.320
because new stuff
happens all the time.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.050
I'm going to pick
Jetpack, because I

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.300
feel very close to this
because a lot of that work

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.580
was coming out of the team
that I was working with,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.130
the tool kit team, where we
had all these capabilities

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.983
in Support Library.

00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:23.400
Worst thing about
Support Library,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.442
we called it Support
Library, but it was actually

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.120
a plural set of libraries.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.370
So even the naming of
it was messed up, right?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.175
So we had AppCompat, and then
we had specific utilities.

00:03:32.175 --> 00:03:32.760
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.260
CHET HAASE: Recycler
View was in there,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.590
all these different things.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.730
SPEAKER: It was a lot of stuff.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.022
CHET HAASE: It was a sandbox
of stuff, all very useful.

00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:40.260
What we're doing with Jetpack
is putting it together

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.720
into cohesive parts, right?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.240
So there are these modules that
you can use either together

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.360
or separately.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.070
We're shipping it in a more
robust and predictable manner.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.420
We made sense out of the APIs.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.180
We refactored it with a
namespace that made sense.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.230
We took a lot of the
capabilities that we had,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.710
and we put it into a
more sensible form that

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.810
solves one of the biggest
problems with Android

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.520
for developers,
which is, how do I

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.890
develop for multiple
versions of Android?

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.210
Because that is the
developer reality.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.710
Right?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.740
So the ability to actually
write to a single API

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.840
and have it work on releases
all the way back to API 14

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.940
right now, I think is huge.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.310
And for us to be able
to do that in a way

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.140
where they can make
sense out of those APIs

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.270
and the documentation
and the Maven artifacts

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.683
that they have to get,
I think is really huge.

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:28.850
What was the other question?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.200
SPEAKER: Something that you
still want to make better.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.820
CHET HAASE: Everything.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.195
I want to make
everything better.

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.110
This is software.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.860
We have bugs.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.850
We have features
we want to work on.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.080
We have APIs that we regret,
because that's how APIs work.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.800
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.363
CHET HAASE: So
honestly, everything

00:04:42.363 --> 00:04:43.530
can get better all the time.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.230
I feel good about where
we're at, especially given

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.910
where we were coming from.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.960
But I also feel like we
have a lot further to go.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.460
SPEAKER: OK.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.470
That's fair.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.560
All right, so your
Twitter profile,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.780
which I looked at recently--

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.830
CHET HAASE: It
must be the truth.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.740
SPEAKER: --on research
for this interview.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.643
It says you're the lead
for the Android UI toolkit.

00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:02.310
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.340
SPEAKER: So what's that like?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.840
CHET HAASE: So the
first thing that

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.383
tells me is that I need to
go update my Twitter profile.

00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:09.300
SPEAKER: This is my
subtle way of saying that.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.967
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:10.940
It is out of date.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.660
So I was the lead for the
Android UI toolkit team.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.690
So when I joined in 2010, I
joined the UI toolkit team.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.470
I worked on animations and
graphics and performance and UI

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.658
stuff and eventually managed
the team for about the last five

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:25.450
years as the team was
growing, doing things

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.210
like Jetpack and architecture
components and all

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.490
the normal platform
toolkit stuff.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.420
And then about three months ago,
I made a change and moved to--

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.460
it's a team called
Developer Relations.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.540
I don't know if you
know what that is.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.380
SPEAKER: I've heard of them.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.590
CHET HAASE: Yeah.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.580
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.140
CHET HAASE: So I
made that switch,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.780
dropped all my management
responsibilities on the floor.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.453
And I'm now a developer
advocate in Dev Rel.

00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:47.620
SPEAKER: Well, that's great.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.578
CHET HAASE: I think so.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:50.712
SPEAKER: Welcome to the
light side or dark side?

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:52.420
CHET HAASE: I consider
it the light side,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.337
because you know what?

00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.060
New jobs always look better.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.393
And then, they become old jobs.

00:05:56.393 --> 00:05:58.060
SPEAKER: Well, let's
hope this one stays

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.130
the light side for some time.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.320
CHET HAASE: No.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.195
I'm excited about it.

00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:02.005
So the way I look
at the job change

00:06:02.005 --> 00:06:05.320
is, I now get to do my
hobby as my real job.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.822
I was doing Dev Rel stuff.

00:06:06.822 --> 00:06:08.155
I was doing a bunch of outreach.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:08.530
SPEAKER: Don't say
that on camera.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.280
Don't tell them.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.050
CHET HAASE: Why?

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.510
My bosses won't watch it.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.773
It doesn't matter.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.940
But I've been doing Dev Rel
since I got here, right?

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.520
I really love doing the
outreach stuff with developers,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.080
but I always felt
guilty about that

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.880
because that wasn't
actually my day job.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.650
And now it is.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.770
SPEAKER: Now it is.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.840
You're welcome, world.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.828
OK.

00:06:26.828 --> 00:06:28.870
Something else that you
do that I want to mention

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.643
is the ADB podcast, the
Android Developers Backstage.

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:33.310
CHET HAASE: Yes.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.272
SPEAKER: So for the
handful of people watching

00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:36.980
that haven't subscribed
to that podcast--

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.140
CHET HAASE: Wait.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.840
What?

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.000
SPEAKER: There
could be a couple.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.635
What episode is your favorite
that they should start with?

00:06:44.635 --> 00:06:46.510
CHET HAASE: OK, I'm
going to start by saying,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.630
they are all my
children, and there

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.170
is no favorite among them.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.080
But if I had to pick, I would
go way back in the archives

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.115
to back when our audio quality,
frankly, was very poor.

00:06:57.115 --> 00:06:58.990
So you're going to have
to suffer through it.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.940
It's going to sound
like one of those 1930s

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.870
just pass the talky
transition movies.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.620
But we talked to Anwar,
who was, at that time,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.210
managing the art team.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.580
We talked to him about how
garbage collectors work,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.690
and it was so fascinating.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.270
So my favorite thing
about doing ADB is we

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.770
get to learn how stuff works.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.650
We are not talking to people
about stuff that we know.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.040
We're talking about stuff
that we don't by definition.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.460
Oh, I'd like to learn more about
[INAUDIBLE] or art or Android

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.170
Studio or performance
or whatever.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.030
We grab people on the team that
know more about that stuff,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.120
and we have a
conversation with them.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.620
So we had a
conversation with Anwar.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.665
And we were so interested that
our little 45-minute episode

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:39.040
stretched onto an
hour and a half

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.870
before we ran out of words.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.680
And we cut it into two episodes.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.460
So probably my favorite
because it best represents

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.220
the, oh my gosh, do we
get into the details part.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.120
SPEAKER: OK.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.780
The art episodes.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.180
CHET HAASE: Art episodes.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.710
There's two.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.280
It's like 30s,
somewhere in the 30s.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.540
And we're now at 112.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.313
SPEAKER: OK.

00:07:58.313 --> 00:07:59.230
CHET HAASE: All right.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.400
SPEAKER: Thanks for
joining us, Chet.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.317
CHET HAASE: Thank you.

00:08:01.317 --> 00:08:05.760
