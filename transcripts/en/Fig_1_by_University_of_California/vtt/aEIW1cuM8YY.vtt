00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.259
when it comes to who identifies as LGBT
there's a generation divide in the u.s.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.200
Yas Queen between three to four point
five percent of adults identify as LGBT

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
compared to about eight to nine percent
of teenagers the thinking is that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
younger generations feel more
comfortable sharing their identity and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
it's important that we get these
statistics right the old expression is

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.939
if you aren't counted you don't count
this is Kerith Conron from UCLA's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.949
Williams Institute in talking with state
legislators and federal policy makers

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.160
the first question that people ask you
when you go into their office is how

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.300
many people live in my district and if
you can't answer that question it's very

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
hard for anybody to give your issue any
serious consideration and this is why

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
Kerith started doing this kind of
research because being counted and being

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.940
visible it really matters especially if
you want politicians or policy makers to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.600
address issues important to your
community.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.320
The US census which officially surveys the population has never
directly asked any questions about the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
LGBT community but researchers have
developed an interesting workaround in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.390
1990 the census added the term unmarried
partner as an option for households

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
mainly with straight couples in mind
this was to account for the growing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.740
number of people living together outside
of marriage researchers began to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.909
indirectly use this data to count
same-sex couples since the census also

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.840
asks the sex of each person in a
household so someone can look at that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.680
combined information to see how many
same-sex partners live together in the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.240
US but this indirect form of counting
can lead to mistakes it's much easier to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.680
just ask people directly
so in 2020 an improvement was made to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.100
the form and options include a same-sex
married partner a same-sex unmarried

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.800
partner an opposite-sex married partner
and opposite sex unmarried

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.090
partner but this doesn't mean that every
LGBT person is going to be counted the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.470
new questions are only counting same-sex
couples who live together so if you're a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.430
lesbian couple but not living together
you're not counted if you don't identify

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.330
as male or female
there's no way to note this in fact

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.110
Kerith estimates that the census
overlooks about 80 percent of people in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.330
the LGBT community I think it would be
ideal if the US census surveys as would

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.290
include questions that ask people about
their current gender identity coupled

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.530
with questions that ask about assigned
sex at birth this is in addition to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.280
questions that we ask people about their
sexual orientation identity since the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.390
90s activists in the trans community
have pushed for ways to be identified on

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.100
surveys beyond the Census and by
increasing their visibility in survey

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.960
data they've gotten results so even
doing an analysis of NIH funding for

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.010
transgender research I've seen a major
increase in the number of grants funded

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
for transgender folks over the last 10
years this is huge with this funding

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.750
researchers can develop health care
specifically for the trans community

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.470
despite the shortcomings of the current
census Kerith believes that it will

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.300
eventually grow more and more inclusive
I am confident that there are many

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.959
people within federal government that
believe that inclusive data collection

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.630
is a priority and that data collection
will move forward
