00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
was playing it more safer well I think
 

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
was playing it more safer well I think
because<00:12:18.410><c> not</c><00:12:18.650><c> only</c><00:12:18.680><c> do</c><00:12:19.040><c> they</c><00:12:19.190><c> make</c><00:12:19.339><c> these</c>

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.490 align:start position:0%
because not only do they make these
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.270 align:start position:0%
because not only do they make these
