00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.450
Once you can place cones and cylinders, another handy method to write is one

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.295
that creates capsules, also known as cheese logs. A capsule is simply a cylinder

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:10.870
with a sphere covering each end. You can build up some pretty interesting

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.962
looking objects using cheese logs. Here's the interface for a capsule. The

00:00:13.962 --> 00:00:17.732
capsule function is again, fully documented in the code itself. For this

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:20.906
exercise, I've implemented the simple part, positioning the cylinders, and I've

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:24.025
given you the code for how I want you to create the sphere's geometry. Your job

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:27.618
is to efficiently add spheres to the end of the cylinder. The open top and open

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:31.320
bottom Booleans determine whether or not a sphere is added. If you need to add

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.798
two spheres, one to each end, please use instancing. In other words, make a

00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:38.352
single sphere geometry object, and reuse it for both ends. When you're done, the

00:00:38.352 --> 00:00:41.583
scene should look like this. Notice how some of the cheese logs touch, and only

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:45.292
one sphere of a particular color is rendered at the intersection. Now, on to the

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:45.943
exercise.
