00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my answer. We got all the pieces.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We call all plays. We get back.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There is a collection of plays.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We sort them and take the last one--that'll be the highest.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We don't even have to specify what to sort by,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because of the score was the first element of the play,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so we're automatically sorting by that,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then return the best one if there are any plays otherwise.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Otherwise, then I specified no play here in case I change my mind,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but I can say no play equals None.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, I could write something that plays a complete game,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but instead I'm just going to have a simple function show&lt;u&gt;best,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which takes a hand and a board, displays the current board, and then displays the best play.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When I type it in to the interpreter, this is what I get.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It found the backbench that we had sort of laid out there, scored 64 points,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and out of all the possible plays, it found the optimal one.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So, we did it. We made it all the way through. Congratulations.
