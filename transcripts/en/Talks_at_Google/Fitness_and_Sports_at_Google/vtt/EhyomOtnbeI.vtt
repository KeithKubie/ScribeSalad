[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.360
KEN HILL: So just a quick
little video, a minute or so

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.280
of seeing what it's
like from riding

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.710
a motorcycle at that pace.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.070
And there's a lot
going on, obviously,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.050
when the motorcycle
is going that quick.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.030
And today's talk, for
the next 30 minutes,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.150
I'll get into why
riding a motorcycle

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.910
like that can work in
the rest of your life,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.950
how the things that
we do to mitigate risk

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.240
will work in the
rest of your life.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.775
So before I get into the
introduction to myself,

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.180
so why is motorcycle
racing important?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.550
And why do we look
at these habits

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.520
and these techniques of what
the best riders in the world do?

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.210
And sports, all sports
have three aspects.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.100
They have the physical aspect.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.657
They have the mental aspect.

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:48.490
Well, there's also a
lot of sports that have

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.840
a mechanical aspect as well.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.180
So when you look at-- for
instance, we take volleyball.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.670
So volleyball is very physical.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.630
It's mental, but there's
really no mechanical part of it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.700
with that sport.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.840
Then we take something
like car racing.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.930
Car racing is very mental.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.660
And also, it's mechanical,
but it's really not

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.280
all that physical.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.550
What I mean physical is,
physical being that your body

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.200
movements, what you do
changes what the sport does.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.451
And in car racing, you're
not moving your body around.

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.991
And when you get to the upper
levels of a car racing, Formula

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:26.710
One, Formula 3,000,
some of the forces

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.200
are the same as they
are on motorcycles.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.150
So motorcycles has all of
those factors of that sport.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.010
So it has the mental
side, the physical side,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.900
and the mechanical side.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.720
But there's one other
aspect of our sport

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.970
that also is a factor,
which is the risk.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.420
So here in motorcycle,
you can fall down

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
at pretty much any time.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.240
And of course, what we're trying
to do is to mitigate that.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.420
So by having, or looking at what
the best riders in the world

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.500
are doing on the bike
and off the bike,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.040
and if you can put those
in the rest of your life,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.600
even some of these
small little things,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.890
that's what's going to
make you successful in all

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:13.680
these aspects.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.100
And one of the things
that we talk about

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.160
is, how you do anything
is how you do everything.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.680
And we are looking at what
these professional guys, what

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.270
these guys do.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.070
And these guys are riding
at an incredible rates.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.380
And the competition
is so incredible.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.850
And here, we can
look at golfing,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.560
and we can look at basketball.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.230
We see how the scores are
and how close everything is.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.970
To give you an idea
in motorcycle racing,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.080
in the last MotoGP race,
the last MotoGP race

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.270
a couple of weeks
ago, that race time

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.720
was 42 minutes and six
seconds, so 2,527 seconds.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.850
The race was won by less
than 9/10 of a second.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.980
So when you look at the--

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.900
you do the math of
that, so here, they

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.220
had 42 minutes, less than
3/100 of a percent difference

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.720
between these riders.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.780
So think about these riders
riding for 42 minutes,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.510
and they're literally at that
point on those motorcycles, ice

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.032
skating around, because
that's how these bikes are.

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:12.740
They're so powerful,
and they're so fast.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.910
And to give you an
idea, for people

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.600
that aren't into
motorcycles or aren't

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.060
into motosports, motorcycles,
from a performance standpoint--

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.640
so everybody's into the fancy
cars and all that stuff.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.630
There isn't a faster
production vehicle

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.550
other than a motorcycle,
BMW 1000, for instance.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.050
We use that.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.800
Dan's got one.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.910
BMW 1000, from 0 to
145 miles an hour.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.820
You can go down,
buy one for $15,000.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.490
And there isn't anything
that will outperform

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.287
it 0 to 145 miles an hour,
period, Bugatti Veyron,

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:47.120
any of those things.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.900
It doesn't even come close.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.660
So the performance
aspect of these things

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.130
is just absolutely incredible.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.960
So what these athletes are
doing at the highest levels,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.670
and they're essentially
riding these bikes

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.310
on very small contact
patches of rubber

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.220
and being able to
not fall down--

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.440
that's, again, taking these
habits and the techniques

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.700
that they're doing to
be able to do that.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.851
So one of our local tracks,
Thunder Hill front straightaway

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:14.350
speed--

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.870
Dan's bike, for instance--
about 180 miles an hour,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.255
he's going 276 feet a second.

00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:21.220
So think about what
your thought process has

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.694
to happen at 276 feet a second.

00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:25.360
And then you think
about average speeds.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.193
The average speed of
that MotoGP race there,

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.330
about 185 feet a second.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.335
So average.

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:32.460
So think about how your
thought process has to work

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.930
and what they're trying
to do to mitigate that.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.760
And what I want to
be able to do is,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.900
I'll give you some of
these best practices,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.034
and we'll go through
them and be able to see

00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:44.950
if we can put some of
these in your own world,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.750
and see if you can get
a little bit of edge

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.458
with some of the things
that you're doing

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:50.980
and all the other
aspects of your life.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.590
And what it boils down
to is these riders

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.480
have basic fundamentals.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.370
And what they're
trying to do is have

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.467
perfect execution of these
fundamentals under pressure.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:01.800
Everybody can practice or train.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.012
You see guys a lot do that.

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:04.720
But it's what they do
on Sunday afternoon

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.270
in front of 100,000 people
that really puts it into play.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.370
So that's what the top
riders are going to do.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.040
And that's how we're-- that's
how we'll take a look at it.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.670
Races are won--

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.550
I know one of the things
that people look at,

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.460
but they may not give
enough thought to is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.250
it really is a marathon.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.365
It's not a sprint.

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:27.900
The rider that
wins the race, he's

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.930
not the rider that sets
the one single fast lap.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.110
He's the rider that sets
the most fastest laps

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.490
over the race.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.590
The rider that wins
the championship

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.470
is a rider that sets
the most fastest laps

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.820
over the whole year.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.270
That's the rider that
wins the championship.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.164
So you gotta think about it in
a little bit of the long term

00:06:47.164 --> 00:06:48.580
and what some of
these things are.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.070
And you have to look at
your short-term goals

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.486
versus your long-term
goals, which

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:53.490
we'll get into it as well.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.219
And really what it boils
down to is the fundamentals

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:58.010
and how well you're
doing the fundamentals.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.960
Motorcycling, the
fundamentals of riding,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.620
it's actually not
that difficult. It's

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.610
got two wheels, a throttle,
and a brake, and you go ride.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.310
And that's something that
people get really confused about

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.768
is they all think that there's
some sort of a silver bullet

00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:12.060
for all of these things.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.990
And there's not.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.056
Those people that are
at the top levels,

00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:16.680
they're just better
at the fundamentals

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.160
than everybody else.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.660
That's it.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.950
They're better at
perfecting the fundamentals.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.330
So I'm going to give a little
bit of introduction to myself.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.530
And I think having an
introduction is good.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.100
And I think that when
you look at people

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.680
that are in your own
space, whether you're

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.010
a manager, individual
contributor with the company,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.030
is hearing stories and being
able to look at individualism

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.422
is a pretty big deal.

00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:45.630
And because one of the things
that we pride ourselves

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.760
on in how I teach in
the schools that I

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.910
teach is our curriculums--

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.084
the curriculums are set for
the student, not the teacher.

00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:55.500
A lot of times,
we see curriculums

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.730
that are set for the
teacher, not the student.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.520
So we want to be able
to conform to what

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520
the student's needs are.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.280
So hearing their stories and
being able to relate to them

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.851
ends up being a pretty big deal.

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.100
So that's one thing that if
people come ride with me--

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.060
and these guys, a
couple of people,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.800
three people in this room
have ridden with me before--

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.790
is we find out what
they do for a living

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.970
and what some of
their backstory is.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:18.390
So my story is one--

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.590
my name is Ken Hill.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.410
And I ride motorcycles
for a living.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.530
And typically, when
people hear that, they--

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.870
I have three kids.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.930
And they'll say, you
got kids and a mortgage.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.160
You're nuts.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.660
Right?

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.640
You're a complete risk taker.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.419
And the funny part is I
work at mitigating risk

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.600
probably more than every
single person in this room.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.059
I want to go quick so when I
go to a track day or a race

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.620
day, the riders that I coach--

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.165
I'll get into that
in just a second.

00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:49.440
The riders that I
coach, very, very fast.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.970
I have to ride
with these riders.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.010
So I have to ride with
some of these guys that

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.304
have won national championships,
and they're top in their field.

00:08:56.304 --> 00:08:57.720
But I also have
to pay my mortgage

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.550
and put my kids through college.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.430
So working at
mitigating risk, that's

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.020
really what we're looking at.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.440
So I got started in the sport
pretty late, 30 years old.

00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:10.980
I was in the car business.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.771
Spent 20-some-odd years
in the car business

00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:15.780
managing parts and service
departments in the dealerships.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.590
And so I spent 20 years,
20-plus years, doing that.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.620
And of course, now-- that was
a 40-hour-a-week job, kind of.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.110
And now, I work 80 hours a week
to not work 40 hours a week.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.812
But I'm sure you guys are
all very familiar with that.

00:09:28.812 --> 00:09:30.520
So I got started in
this sport very late.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.580
I didn't have a lot of
natural talent in this sport.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.580
I wanted to do it because
I wanted to race cars.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.510
Couldn't afford to race cars.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.093
So I thought, I'll
do something cheap.

00:09:38.093 --> 00:09:39.570
I'll ride motorcycles.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.270
And when I got
into it, because I

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.690
didn't have a lot of background,
I didn't have any talent.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.344
Right?

00:09:48.344 --> 00:09:49.760
I didn't have any
of these things.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.370
So I had to build technique.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.860
So I became very
studious of our sport.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.095
And I realized that
if I want to get good,

00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:00.470
I have to study it because I
didn't have that background.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.525
So I became very
technique-based in our sport.

00:10:03.525 --> 00:10:05.900
I just did it because I didn't
have anything else to fall

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.710
on other than technique.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.420
So as I studied the sport--

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.200
and I realized at
that time that there

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.960
wasn't a lot of
information out there

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.910
that put things in
a very simple way.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.020
Right?

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.800
Just a lot of chatter
that was out there.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.340
And I went through, and I
decoded it in my own language.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.080
And as I got better
in the sport,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.120
I won local championships.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.410
I did my first professional
race at age 41.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.500
I held a professional
license up till age 43.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.460
I was top 10 in the nation
at that point at age 41.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.130
So I was able to ride
at a very high level.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.860
And through that, people asked
me, well, gosh, you're riding,

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.470
and you're kind of a older dude.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.970
What can we do to--

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.040
what can I do in my riding?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.160
And it was through that that
I developed my own language

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.130
with this sport and have
been able to communicate it.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.320
And it's my
full-time profession.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.900
So my riders, to
give you an idea

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.420
of where I'm at with
it, so my riders,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.180
I have three riders
that have all

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.050
won national championships,
so best riders

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.770
in the United States.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:15.860
2017, my riders have 59
podiums in national competition

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.640
as well as podiums with
regional riders as well.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.200
And what we look at
with our riders is,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.260
again, we take each one of
their individual attributes,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.430
and we look at these things.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.870
And we find out what's holding
them back in their riding.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.970
And we look at
their fundamentals.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.350
We build their fundamentals.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.270
The things that I work
on, and with these guys

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.130
here that I've ridden
with, with the riders

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.590
that I work with on a
national level, no different.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.940
Language is the same.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.260
The technique is the same.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.014
Just the degree of
application changes.

00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:51.680
And I think that
that's something that's

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.230
really important when you look
at fundamental-- when you build

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.660
fundamentals, it's identifying
what the right fundamentals

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.430
are, and then through that,
making those fundamentals more

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.780
precise.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.307
So that's really
the introduction

00:12:07.307 --> 00:12:08.390
I just wanted to give you.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.950
I didn't want to
make it too long.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.400
And realize that
my riders, we want

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.320
to give them a way to
continually get better.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.420
And we want to give them a
way that allows them to grow.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.850
And we look at that through,
again, fundamental building,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.170
and what's holding them back.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.790
And there's some
cool things in here

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.081
that we're going to talk
about with our best practices.

00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:33.539
So I'm just going to jump
right into some best practices

00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:35.330
because that's kind of
what everybody wants

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.920
to know is, like, what
are some of these things

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.280
that these riders are doing?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.900
What are some of these
things that these guys

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.850
are doing on the
bike and off the bike

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.351
to make them better riders,
to make them better people?

00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:48.100
So I'm just going to
jump right into that.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.030
And the first thing I'm going
to do is, if you can today, is

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.270
give your self permission
to learn something.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.560
I know it sounds silly.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.810
Give yourself permission
to learn something.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.360
And I've been to a lot
of different talks.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.610
I've heard a lot
of people present.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.110
And it almost comes off to
where it's sort of beyond you.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.510
But if you start to
read between the lines,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.637
give yourself permission
to put this in your world.

00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:16.220
I'm not going to leave my world,
but you say all these things,

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.470
put them into your world and
see how those things fit.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.910
So you can give yourself
permission to that.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.371
So first best practice
that I want to talk about,

00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:25.370
the first thing that we
look at with our riders,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.760
is something that you may
not have thought about.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.320
But realize that there's
three aspects of an athlete.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.750
And motorcycle riders,
motorcycle racers,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.390
whether you like it or
not, you guys are athletes.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.520
And if you can start to
look at yourself in that,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.280
and you're at in
your job performance,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.630
you can almost start
thinking of yourself

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.850
as a corporate athlete,
or somebody that

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.650
has to perform at a high level.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.750
Because I know every
single person in this room

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:56.180
is asked to put out as much as
they possibly can all the time.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.570
So the three aspects
of an athlete are one,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.130
it's your technique
and your craft.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.310
It's what you do.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.700
It's all the things that
you do through the day.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.026
Right?

00:14:07.026 --> 00:14:09.060
All the discipline
that you've learned,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.310
the education that you've got.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.810
Right?

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.560
That's the number one thing.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.020
Well, the second
aspect of an athlete

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.240
is their physical fitness.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.770
So the more physically
fit they are,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.310
the longer they can
access their technique.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.490
So as soon as your
fitness drops--

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.680
if you're out on
a motorcycle race,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.230
or whether you're a cyclist,
or whatever it may be,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.180
as soon as your
fitness drops, you

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.269
lose the ability to
access your technique.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:35.810
You're not going to
be able to access

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.390
your technique at a high level.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.700
The third aspect of an athlete
is your mental fitness.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.010
And this is one that I would
say on my national weekends,

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.160
my MotoAmerica weekends when
I'm working with riders,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.320
it's the number one thing I
work on is their mental fitness.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.765
Because they've done all
the hard work at that point.

00:14:54.765 --> 00:14:55.640
They're there, right?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.720
They've qualified
or whatever it is.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.610
But now, how fit
they are mentally,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.690
that's actually the tough one.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.100
And the better your
mental fitness is,

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.600
the more you're going to be
able to access your technique as

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.099
well.

00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:13.680
So if your mental fitness isn't
there for whatever reason,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.540
you wake up one morning
and you get some bad news,

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.520
or whatever-- you
got a flat tire--

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.930
whatever the issue is, and now,
your mental fitness is blocked,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.080
you're not going to be able
to access your technique.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.861
I've got a great peer group
that I work with, a peer group.

00:15:31.861 --> 00:15:33.360
The nice thing about
this peer group

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.600
is these are all people
that have come together

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.130
through motorcycles.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.890
And the peer group
that I work with,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.630
I've got some people
in high academics.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.450
I have the number
one tactical trainer

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.910
in the country as
part of my group.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.550
And also, I've got a person
that's a "Top Gun" fighter

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.050
pilot.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:56.730
And they work so much
on the mental aspect

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.630
of what they do because you
need to be able to access

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.830
that information on demand.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.770
So it's being able
to compartmentalize

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.020
what you're doing, your
technique, your craft,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.390
and being able to
access it whenever you

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.890
want to be able to access it.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.140
Because there's times where
you may not have a choice.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.220
We'll talk about that
in just a minute.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.390
So the three aspects
of an athlete--

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.210
your technique, your craft, what
you do, your physical fitness--

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.190
the fitter you
are, the longer you

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.620
can access this information.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.685
So I can guarantee you--
and guys here that-- well,

00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:32.310
anybody that's done
any type of sports.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.810
Right?

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.120
As soon as your fitness
drops off, what happens?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.560
Your focus drops off.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.490
It's gone.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.875
So that's why we work at being
very, very fit in our sport.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.250
And then the other ones we
work on is our mental fitness.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.600
We do a lot of things with our
mental fitness, whether it's--

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.080
we do a lot of visualization.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.995
We do a lot of yoga.

00:16:50.995 --> 00:16:53.600
We do a lot of
neuroscience work as well.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.100
We've got some
pretty cool companies

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.210
that are on our side that work
on the neuroscience part of it.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.680
So three aspects of
an athlete, man--

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.930
trying to be the
complete athlete

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.980
is really what
we're looking for.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.569
So the second best practice
that I want to talk about.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.089
And this is an interesting
one because for people

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:21.770
that don't ride motorcycles,
or are not into the sport,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.870
it's why do we fall down?

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.369
Why do we fall down
on a motorcycle?

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:25.869
Right?

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.550
So there's really five reasons
why you crash a motorcycle.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.635
And when I mean five
reasons, why we, we, me,

00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:33.620
and these guys are
people that ride,

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.080
it's why we crash, the things
that we do on the motorcycle

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.160
to make it not stay upright.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.800
There's lightning
strike crashes for sure,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.130
where somebody may hit you, you
may have a mechanical issue,

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.300
whether somebody put oil on
the track or whatever it is.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.260
There's those things as well.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.050
But the five reasons why
we crash our motorcycles,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.860
the five reasons why
we do something wrong--

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.760
and the first one is lack
of focus or lack of a plan,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.170
lack of focus or lack of a
plan, not being in the moment.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.550
Not being deliberate is
what it boils down to.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.026
And typically, at these speeds--

00:18:11.026 --> 00:18:12.650
I gave you some those
numbers, how fast

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.720
we go on some of these bikes.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.340
Man, you just don't
have the time.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.850
So not being in the
moment, not being

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.370
present to make that
happen, it literally

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.810
is the number one reason why
we're going to have issues.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.870
And we'll talk about
some of the triggers that

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.950
allow that to happen, that
put your brain into gear.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.520
Second one, abrupt inputs.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.170
The faster you go, the more
lean angle you have to use.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.130
So the smoother all of
your inputs have to be.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.950
So abrupt inputs--
so you think about,

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.570
I have to be super aggressive
to go fast on a motorcycle.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.570
It's completely the opposite.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.490
So to go very, very
quick, you actually

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.550
have to be incredibly
smooth and very precise

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.010
with every input
on the motorcycle,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.760
whether it's your
brake, or your throttle,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.170
or your body movement.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.940
Everything has to be just
absolutely, incredibly smooth.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.540
So we have to work on being
smoother on all of our inputs.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.940
The third reason why we crash is
what we call rushing direction.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.300
What "direction" means
is on a motorcycle,

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.460
the quickest way around a
race track on a motorcycle

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.835
is to be able to hold the
throttle wide open the longest.

00:19:22.835 --> 00:19:25.418
So the person that can hold the
throttle wide open the longest

00:19:25.418 --> 00:19:27.870
is basically going to be
accelerating the most.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.540
So the corners, unfortunately,
kind of get in the way of that.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.700
So we have to learn how to place
our motorcycle on the entry

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.740
to get a better exit.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:41.940
If we rush that placement,
if we rush bike placement,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.540
if we rush where
that spot is, that's

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.790
the third reason why we crash.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:46.290
Right?

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.840
You're actually putting the
wrong thing at the wrong time.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.730
So rushing direction.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.200
The fourth one's
repeating a mistake.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.610
We have very deliberate
report cards in our riding.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.370
And these report cards
tell us how we're doing.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.930
So if there's a
track with 10 turns,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.760
we literally have
10 opportunities

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.490
a lap to tell us
how we're doing.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.691
And whether that's what the
direction of the motorcycle,

00:20:10.691 --> 00:20:12.940
whether that's what control
we're using, whether we're

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.260
doing-- we have these report
cards available to us.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.910
And the last reason why we
crash is funny because the ones

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.880
that I would say are the
most are one and this one.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.720
So one is lack of
focus, lack of a plan.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.490
This one's overconfidence.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.040
Everything is working so great
that you can do no wrong.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.250
And that's when [CLAPS]
not good things happen,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.300
so overconfidence.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.590
So how do these relate
to you, and your job,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.140
and your regular work day?

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.150
So if you're going
to come to work,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.580
we want to be success-based.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.230
We don't want to
be failure-based.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.430
Right?

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.120
So if you think about
it, if you come to work,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.250
I would imagine you've
got a plan for your day.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.246
Whether you're an individual
or you're a manager,

00:20:59.246 --> 00:21:01.370
you're going to have some
sort of plan for the day.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.600
There's nothing worse
than, obviously,

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.090
going through your day without
some sort of a plan for what

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.380
you're doing.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.570
What that is, is
you've got to be

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.310
able to set your own
expectations as well

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.530
as your employees'
expectations as well.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.090
So lack of focus,
lack of a plan.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.300
Second one, abrupt inputs.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.090
What "abrupt inputs"
simply means--

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.400
and this really works
well with the third one--

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.980
is rushing into a
situation without having

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.960
full knowledge of
what you're doing,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.800
or not having all that
information available to you.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.380
So abrupt inputs, What we
think about on our motorcycle

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.240
is the first 5% of our inputs
and the last 5% of our inputs.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.750
Because the first 5%
is what sets you up

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.360
for the upcoming situation.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.250
The last 5% gives you the fine
direction for that situation.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.240
So the middle 90% is
completely adjustable,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.730
based on whatever
the situation may be.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.390
But if you start your
processes, you start your job,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.790
you start whatever
your project is,

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.250
you think about the
first 5% of your project

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.265
so you're in a position to
adjust for the rest of it,

00:22:12.265 --> 00:22:13.510
it will help you out a lot.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.880
Same thing with the last 5%.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.514
So the same thing with
rushing direction.

00:22:18.514 --> 00:22:19.930
We talked a little
bit about that,

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.210
rushing direction,
which is constantly

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.302
thinking about what
direction you're going

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:25.510
and how you're getting there.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.180
And we're going to work on
that one a little bit more.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.970
Repeating a mistake--
fourth reason why we crash

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.250
is repeating a mistake.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:32.750
Right?

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.450
You think about
one of the things

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.120
that the special forces
guys talk about is once is

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.490
a mistake, twice is a habit.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.380
So you think about it that way.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.973
And I'll give you a
quick story on that,

00:22:44.973 --> 00:22:46.870
that some of these
special forces guys,

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.480
depending what group
they're in, they

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.681
have to qualify for their
shooting once a quarter.

00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:53.680
So they have to qualify.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.760
They go into a room
similar to this.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.729
And they have to
shoot a certain thing.

00:22:57.729 --> 00:22:59.020
And they don't know what it is.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.880
They're told, hey, they got
to shoot this, this, or this.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.860
So if they miss once--

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.520
they miss once-- they're
basically on probation.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.630
They get docked pay.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.510
They miss twice, they
got to find a new job.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.720
So of course, we don't have
those kind of qualifications

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.280
here in this type
of environment.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.960
They're degree of application
is a little bit different.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.080
But to give you an
idea of why we're

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.884
taking a look about
repeating a mistake--

00:23:27.884 --> 00:23:30.550
so repeating a mistake, we start
doing them over and over again.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.610
It's absolutely a habit.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.530
And we want to be able
to fix those things.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.440
And the last one's
overconfidence.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.420
The reason you feel
confident is because all

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.730
of the things you did right.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.320
So if we can work on, OK, got
to fight that emotion and work

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.480
on that technique
that got you there.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.837
So technical versus emotional.

00:23:47.837 --> 00:23:50.170
We'll talk a little bit more
about that as well and what

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.200
a big deal that ends up being.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.500
So that's the five
reasons why you crash.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.360
And you can think about how
that relates to you, and even

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.424
in your job every day.

00:23:59.424 --> 00:24:01.090
That's something that
I think about just

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.660
in my own life every day,
five reasons why I crash.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:10.030
So the next one that
I want to talk about

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.700
is a different way of thinking.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:19.510
And you can think, OK,
how do we get focus?

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.690
How do we get our
technique engaged?

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.740
And where that comes
from is our eyes.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.462
So if your eyes are engaged,
your technique is engaged.

00:24:30.462 --> 00:24:31.170
Think about that.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:31.669
Right?

00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:33.360
So if you're looking
at your situation,

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.260
you want to see what's going
on, our eyes have to be engaged.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.580
More importantly than
that on our motorcycle is

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.950
our eyes have got
to be able to scan.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.260
So if your eyes
are fixed, you'll

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.160
lose perspective of where
you're going or where you're at.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.337
So it's no different than-- you
can take whatever your job is,

00:24:54.337 --> 00:24:55.920
or whatever project
you're working on.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.420
Right?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.110
If you're just so
focused on this picture

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.180
here in front of you,
you lose perspective

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.320
of what's out there, just as if
you're only worried about that,

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.690
you're going to lose the
fine detail right here.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.610
You've got to do both.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.250
So you've got to be
able to think about,

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.160
what is it going to take
to get my eyes engaged

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.487
so I see both those things?

00:25:18.487 --> 00:25:20.570
And that's what we do is
we have our eyes to scan.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.610
Our eyes scan back and forth.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.931
And in motorcycles, we've
got very specific triggers

00:25:24.931 --> 00:25:25.430
for that.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.170
As we decelerate,
our eyes move in.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.930
As we accelerate,
our eyes move out.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.170
So think about how we
get our eyes engaged.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.560
And what are your-- do you have
reference points for your days?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.100
Do you have reference
points for how you're doing?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.950
Establishing some
reference points.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.530
The motorcycle, we have five
established reference points

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.440
for every corner.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.050
There's all this stuff going on.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.900
You see a ton of things
in your peripheral vision.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.100
But with our motorcycle, we
have five established reference

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.850
points.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.430
We look at our exit apex,
our entry apex, or slowest

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.620
point of the corner,
our turning point,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.210
and where we go to the brakes.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.920
So that's it, five.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.290
So yes, there's all these
other peripheral things

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.390
that are going
on, but we're only

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.490
focused on those five points.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.530
And within those
five points, we're

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.820
only focused on one single
vital point for every corner.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.180
Because if you hit one single
vital point for every corner,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.740
the rest of them will
take care of themselves.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.587
So it's identifying one, what
are those reference points?

00:26:25.587 --> 00:26:27.170
And then the second
one is identifying

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.260
what the most vital one is.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.750
Find that out in your own deal.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.990
Right?

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.320
Find that out in your own jobs.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:33.903
Find that out.

00:26:33.903 --> 00:26:35.950
What is your most
critical reference point?

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.420
What are your reference points?

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.910
What is my end goal?

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.200
What is my short-term goal?

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.050
And how are my eyes
doing to connect those?

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.240
If I'm at my entry
apex, I'm going

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.100
to look out to my exit apex.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.590
And I want to make sure that
my trajectory is straight.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.660
So using your eyes
and your ability

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.070
to line those things up and
keep those continually moving,

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:02.670
it just helps bring
things together.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.350
So that's what we
want to look at.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.532
And you can ask yourself.

00:27:06.532 --> 00:27:08.490
One of the trigger words
that I have for myself

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.075
is I ask myself, how am I doing?

00:27:10.075 --> 00:27:10.700
How am I doing?

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.790
What are my report
cards for that?

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.090
So again, give yourself
some report cards.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.260
Whether it's for the hour,
whether it's for the day,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.580
know how you're doing.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.000
Establish those
things for the day.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.940
Something that we do
also with motorcycles

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.630
that's a little bit different--

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.713
we do it with some of the
car instruction as well.

00:27:30.713 --> 00:27:32.550
I do some car
instruction as well--

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:36.810
is we draw the track backwards.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.010
So in other words, we
draw the corner backwards.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.152
We draw the situation
backwards because the reason

00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:45.610
that we want to do that is we
know where we want to end up.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.830
Right?

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.940
We want to end up out there.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.314
But we want to
get there the most

00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:50.150
efficiently way that we can.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.754
So we'll draw the
corner backwards.

00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.420
And one of the things
that I said to you

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.253
is what lasts longest
on a motorcycle, which

00:27:55.253 --> 00:27:56.700
is acceleration.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.710
So I'm trying to put
my acceleration zone

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:05.550
as early as possible because I
know that's what lasts longest.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.940
So again, thinking
about it in your deals.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.740
If you're working on 10
different things at once--

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.990
probably a lot more than that.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.260
But if you're working
on 10 things at once

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.280
and four or five of them
really aren't that important--

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.930
you concentrate
on the things that

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.690
do make a difference, those
bigger vital points that make

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.090
a bigger part of that picture.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.590
Yeah, you still got to address
some of those smaller points.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.900
But which ones make
the biggest difference

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.330
for the longest period of time?

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.699
So we draw the track backwards
to be able to do that.

00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:37.490
We want to know where
we're going to end up

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.020
and what our end goal is.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.680
And everything adjusts to that.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.200
We also look at our sport
a little bit differently.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.580
And we look at
our sport as time.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.720
We look at it as
feet per second.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.670
We don't look at it as speed.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.910
And the reason that
that is important

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.332
is the faster you go, the
less time you have available.

00:28:57.332 --> 00:28:58.790
So if you have less
time available,

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.289
you have to be able
to adjust for that.

00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:03.080
So it all goes back to
your initial inputs,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.580
like I was talking
about, how you're

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.630
able to adjust those things.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.200
So the faster you go, the
less time you have available.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.970
And you have to be able to
adjust for those things.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.960
So how are you able to adjust?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.210
And how are you able to
put those things into play?

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.670
So something to
think about when it

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.300
comes to feet per second, and
time, and how we draw things

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.530
backwards.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.490
So all right, so I
want to talk about--

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:29.590
this is kind of a fun one.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.400
And this is one that
we've messed around

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.810
with quite a bit,
which is a proactive

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.500
versus reactive thinking
process, proactive

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.390
versus reactive.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.410
And realize that you're
training for proactive,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.930
and reactive is
actually the same.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.440
It's the same
thing, being that--

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.150
and I can take it
a quick example.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.960
2 times 2.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.490
4 jump into your head?

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.000
Right?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.980
Now, if we goes 7 times 9.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:02.210
Did it take a millisecond
longer for that

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.720
to jump into your head?

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.220
Right?

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.261
Because you haven't trained
for that one as much,

00:30:06.261 --> 00:30:08.580
though the process is identical.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.350
So proactive
decision-making process

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.720
is having the time available
to make a decision.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.121
That's really what we
all want, a proactive.

00:30:17.121 --> 00:30:17.620
Right?

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.161
I want to have time
available to make

00:30:19.161 --> 00:30:21.380
the best educated decision
for the situation that's

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.010
happening in front of me.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.260
Of course, how do we see that?

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.190
With her eyes.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.340
Right?

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.798
We talked about
that as well, being

00:30:26.798 --> 00:30:29.390
able to see the
situation sooner.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.070
So proactive is seeing
the situation early,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.990
using all the data
that's in front of you,

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.900
and being able to make the
best educated guess for that

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.790
that's based on your training.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.930
So what's a reactive
decision-making process?

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:49.280
Reactive is not having the time
available to make a decision,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.930
and you have to default
to your training.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.950
Remember, you're
going to default

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.590
to whatever your highest
level of training is.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.124
That's what it boils down to.

00:30:59.124 --> 00:31:01.040
So whatever your highest
level of training is,

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.750
that's what you're
going to default to.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.850
So that's why we look at,
what are all of our risks?

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.820
And that's the things
that we train for.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:09.950
If my motorcycle is
starting to slide,

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.980
I want to have something in my
tank, something in my toolbox

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.200
that allows me to
adjust for that.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.420
Or my brakes start to fade.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.300
I want to have something
available to be

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.370
able to adjust
for that, whatever

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.020
the different situation is.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.410
So proactive thought process
versus a reactive thought

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.050
process, the training
is identical.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.872
It's just being
able to understand

00:31:32.872 --> 00:31:34.580
how you're going to
mitigate those risks,

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.820
understanding what those risks
are, and training for them.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.380
So one thing that
tags along with that--

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.480
and I think this is
something that whether you're

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.270
an individual here, whether
you're a manager here,

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.650
something that works
is realize focus

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.590
is actually super easy to get.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.460
Focus is great.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.126
Focus is you get to
work in the morning.

00:31:54.126 --> 00:31:56.480
Like, dude, I am going to
jump on that, and I am good.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.280
And then whatever happens--

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.710
somebody comes by, drops a
load of stuff on your desk,

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.200
and then you're
completely unfocused.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.640
Focus is very easy.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.310
It's the refocus
that's the hard part.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.430
So what we work on--

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.890
and again, motorcycle
racing, you

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.350
saw a little bit in that video.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.109
You come up on a rider,
and you're inches apart,

00:32:17.109 --> 00:32:18.650
going 100-and-some-odd
miles an hour.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.750
And he makes a little bobble.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.920
Something happens.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.050
And you lose your
train of thought.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.880
So we work on having
trigger words,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.890
or trigger responses, to
put us back in the moment.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.350
Focus is easy.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.516
So my focus trigger is when
I roll out of hot pits,

00:32:36.516 --> 00:32:37.640
I stand up on my foot pegs.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.420
I sit back down.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.090
I am focused.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.400
I'm in the moment.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.070
I am only worried
about my task at hand.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.340
That's it.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.810
We have other riders.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.430
We have other riders that
wiggle their fingers.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.180
Valentino Rossi,
nine-time world champion,

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.013
goes up to his motorcycle,
leans next to it.

00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:53.900
He stands next to his foot peg.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.650
It doesn't matter.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.810
It doesn't matter how
much time is available.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.230
He's going to be a professional.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:59.480
Professionals are predictable.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:32:59.980
Right?

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.580
They're predictable
because they want

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.890
to take the same fundamental
and make it more fine.

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.052
So that's what Rossi is
going to be able to do.

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.510
So he's putting
his plan into play.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.960
He's being focused.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.220
Refocus is the tough one.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.960
So finding a refocus
word, finding a refocus

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.784
trigger to put you
back in the game, that

00:33:22.784 --> 00:33:24.200
is really the
secret sauce when it

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.390
comes to a lot of these things.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.610
I spend a lot of time--

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.280
I do yoga.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.450
I do Bikram yoga,
because, of course,

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.450
I wanted the most
difficult, gross, nasty one

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.180
that I could do so I do Bikram.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.180
And I found out that when
my eyes weren't engaged,

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.960
guess what?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.780
I'd fall out.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.580
I'd fall out of my pose.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:47.010
So I worked really hard
on my initial focus.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.220
And then I worked
hard on my refocus.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.800
And as soon as I feel myself
slipping out of a pose,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.970
something's not right, then
I have a retrigger word.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:56.550
My retrigger word's "eyes."

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.400
As soon as my eyes are
engaged, guess what?

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.220
It goes back to what I said.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.200
Your focus is engaged.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.270
Your technique is engaged.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.640
So my refocus word is "eyes."

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.230
Even if it is just
jumping my eyes up,

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.540
even on the race track,
if something happens,

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.380
I jump my eyes to the
next reference point.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.159
So that gets my
technique reengaged.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:20.560
So proactive or reactive
thought processes,

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.320
give you a little something on
that, and then also the focus

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.580
and refocus, so some pretty
good things on that one.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.459
So I have one last one, and
we'll do a little bit of a Q&amp;A.

00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:34.000
And then I have
something that I want

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.719
to talk to everybody
about, just real quickly.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.770
This is one that
I've used for years,

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.900
whether it was I was
in the car business,

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.330
whether I use it with my riders.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.409
And we do downloads quite
a bit with our riders

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.380
because we actually get
very little time to ride.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.790
And this is why we do so many
things off the motorcycle.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.440
Think about it because riding--

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.711
Dan, how many times have
you ridden this year?

00:34:58.711 --> 00:34:59.710
SPEAKER: Seven weekends.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.770
KEN HILL: Seven
weekends, six weekends.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.270
Right?

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.210
So when you think about that,
how much time and effort

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.390
he's got to invest
in the sport, he

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.610
actually gets very
little time to do it.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:07.845
Tracks are crazy expensive.

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:10.150
The bikes, everything's
expensive to do it.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.870
So you have to
consolidate your time.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.080
So this is why we
spend a lot of time

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.420
off the bike thinking about
all the different things

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.090
that we do so we can
go and not waste time

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.260
when we're there at the track.

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.420
So what we work on--

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.080
and this is something that
managers, this is a big deal.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.330
You can ask her employees.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.490
We ask them, what's
holding you back?

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:32.164
What's holding
you back the most?

00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:33.580
So the rider might
come in, right?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.650
The rider comes in, and
what ends up happening

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.675
is the crew chief runs over.

00:35:37.675 --> 00:35:39.234
He's got his clipboard there.

00:35:39.234 --> 00:35:40.900
The data guy comes
over with his laptop.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.030
They're downloading all
the data out of the bike.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.821
And their job is to essentially
find something wrong.

00:35:46.821 --> 00:35:47.320
Right?

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.876
What's wrong?

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:49.000
We want to make you better.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.500
We want your lap
time to get better.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.490
We want to beat everybody else.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:55.871
And so there's so much
information out there.

00:35:55.871 --> 00:35:57.370
So we go through
our download sheet.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.500
We do it every time that
we go out, when we ride.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.770
And out of all things we go
through, at the very end of it,

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.440
we ask our rider, what's
the one single thing that's

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.490
holding you back the most?

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.380
And there's times
the rider may say--

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.060
and this happens
more often than not.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.850
The rider will say, it's me.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.340
I'm not focused.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.780
I'm not doing a good job.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.460
Don't touch the bike.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.780
Let me come up to speed.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.517
Let me get myself tuned up.

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.600
That's what's holding him
back, just as we've also

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.080
seen the rider come
in and go, hey,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.820
we just try a new pair of forks.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.070
I can't ride the
bike to my ability

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.480
because the bike
is holding me back.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.925
But asking him, what is
holding you back the most?

00:36:40.925 --> 00:36:41.800
That one right there?

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.685
That's something again in my
personal life, regular life

00:36:44.685 --> 00:36:46.060
off the track,
I'm asking myself,

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.430
what's holding me back the most
from wanting to meet my goals?

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:56.410
So that is a really good one.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.140
Another thought on that one is--

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.130
especially for engineers,
something to think about.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.255
You guys are great on data.

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:05.190
You're fantastic.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.690
Right?

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.370
Data pretty much never lies
as long as the data is pure.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.660
One thing to think about--

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.360
stop negotiating with yourself.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.860
Stop negotiating with yourself.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.420
And what that simply means
is, look at the data,

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.140
look at the facts,
and act on it.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.744
We get too much chatter
that's going on,

00:37:22.744 --> 00:37:24.160
too much things
that are going on.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.740
And if you can stop negotiating
with yourself-- this is

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.170
something that we find
out with riders a lot,

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.632
more on the mental side,
is whether they're not

00:37:31.632 --> 00:37:33.340
good enough, they
haven't trained enough,

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.210
or whatever the issues are.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.045
And so riders, as
we get them, we

00:37:37.045 --> 00:37:39.760
say, look let's look at
our technical side of it,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.590
not our emotional side of it.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.900
If you take the emotion
out and you work just

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.620
on your technique,
man, things absolutely

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.400
start to happen that way.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.880
So you can ask yourself, what's
holding you back the most?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.450
And I think that that
is a really great one

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.410
that, again, in your own
situations, you can look at.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.630
Managers, ask that
to your employees.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.310
Ask that to the
people in your group.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:03.520
Right?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.900
What's holding
you back the most?

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.530
What can I do?

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.960
What can I do to unblock that?

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.844
What can I do to make your job
better or situation better?

00:38:10.844 --> 00:38:13.260
Individual contributors, you
can think about that as well.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:13.760
Right?

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.170
What's holding me back that
I need to convey to my team

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.970
so I can do a better job?

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.470
What's holding
you back the most?

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.331
Pick that one single
thing and work on that.

00:38:24.331 --> 00:38:29.350
A couple of things that I
mentioned before is everybody

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.851
here comes at a
pretty high level.

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:33.600
But we look at look
at things differently,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.620
where we talk about
professionals versus amateurs.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.120
Right?

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.200
Professionals--
we all have goals.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:39.700
Right?

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.380
I mean, as professionals,
we have goals.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.430
Amateurs we have goals.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.140
The difference is,
professionals have

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.480
processes to meet those goals.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:46.980
Right?

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.429
Amateurs just have the goal.

00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:49.220
I hope I get there.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.810
Hope that works.

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.070
So think about professionals.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:52.570
Right?

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:53.778
Professionals have processes.

00:38:53.778 --> 00:38:57.160
Professionals are predictable
when it comes to those things.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.487
So another thing,
a couple of things

00:39:00.487 --> 00:39:02.070
I want to just talk
a little bit about

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.280
was training versus practice.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.696
Realize that
training and practice

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.280
are two different things.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.530
Right, you train to
learn something new.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.050
You practice your training.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.640
You practice those
situations to make it better.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.910
So that's really about
all I have to give you

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.530
guys some good best practices.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.420
I know, of course,
I talked too long.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.050
Sorry, Dan.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.382
It works that way.

00:39:25.382 --> 00:39:26.840
I can take some
questions if people

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.381
have any questions on some of
the things that I talked about.

00:39:29.381 --> 00:39:31.790
I'm hoping that I gave you
a little bit of something

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.570
that you can think about,
whether it's your motorcycle

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.020
riders, or whether it's
part of your regular day.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.330
And again, you wanted
some of the things

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:46.160
that riders do, riders in a
world-class environment, riders

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.000
that are the best
at what they do.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.920
These are things that they look
at every day in their life.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.250
Whether it's on the
bike or off the bike,

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.040
these are the types of
habits that they look at

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.890
to get themselves to
be the best there is.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.340
So I hope you all enjoyed it.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.201
If you've got questions,
I'll take them.

00:40:06.201 --> 00:40:08.700
AUDIENCE: This might be-- it's
just specifically about bikes

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.199
or not.

00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.910
But I just started tracking
again and got a new vehicle.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.397
It was a 675R with
Ohlins, stalk, everything.

00:40:15.397 --> 00:40:15.980
KEN HILL: Yep.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.010
AUDIENCE: Should
have been great.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.850
I got to the track.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.891
They almost didn't let me
on tech-inspection-wise

00:40:19.891 --> 00:40:22.605
because the front
forks were too stiff.

00:40:22.605 --> 00:40:23.750
I think it scared them.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.980
And I went over to
Evolution and had them look

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.540
at it, et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.900
But applying this, this fell
outside of my competency.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.120
I didn't know what was wrong.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.140
And I don't know.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.590
Sometimes maybe in life, or--

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.772
this danger was something
that if that guy hadn't--

00:40:38.772 --> 00:40:40.230
KEN HILL: Did you
buy the bike new?

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.771
AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.480
But it had 2,000 miles
on it, one owner.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.105
KEN HILL: Yeah.

00:40:43.105 --> 00:40:44.312
And this is great.

00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:46.020
I mean, that's actually
a great question.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.060
And again, it absolutely works
in the rest of your life.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.390
Right?

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.650
So if you people
that are engineers,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.790
things work in an envelope.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:51.290
Right?

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.570
There is an absolute operating
envelope of how things work.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.180
And a bike of that caliber--
that's an amazing motorcycle.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.846
I've got a bunch of
time on those bikes.

00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:00.414
They're a fantastic bike.

00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:01.830
But one of the
things that you can

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.950
do before you ride that
bike is understand,

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.010
if you bought the bike
new, you know its history.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.870
Right?

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.610
You already know.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.776
You can look in the manual
and see where things are.

00:41:10.776 --> 00:41:12.600
Bikes that you don't
know the history,

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.580
I absolutely will spec them out.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.080
So find out where the bike is.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.640
Find out who's been in there.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.620
Find out where the
bike is, because it has

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.930
so many different adjustments.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.400
The main thing is
finding out where

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.460
you're working at, where
the bike is in its operating

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.171
envelope.

00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:28.920
That's something that
we work with, again,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.754
on a very high level with
suspension engineers,

00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:33.420
data engineers, all
the electronics that

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.060
are on the bike is,
as a rider starts

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.220
to have a preference
for something,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.250
we want to see if he's staying
within the actual operating

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.730
parameters of where the
bike is working the best.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.090
So in your case on yours,
I'd get the bike specced out,

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.250
find out where the bike is.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:55.920
And also, the problem with
that is feel means nothing.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.050
I mean, if you
bounce on the bike,

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.900
I mean, you can have
some ideas of it.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.620
But for the most
part, until you know

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.120
where the premolars of the bike
are, until you've specced it

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.891
out, I wouldn't make that
call because bikes feel--

00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:12.390
If you look at my personal bike,
the forks feel really soft,

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.350
the back is a brick.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.717
The back is super stiff.

00:42:14.717 --> 00:42:16.800
So somebody would look at
that and go, oh, my god,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.580
it's not ridable.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.890
But in fact, it is
very, very ridable.

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.385
So yeah, get it specced out.

00:42:21.385 --> 00:42:26.370
AUDIENCE: So specifically, not
a lot of suspension shops--

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.950
I mean, who do you go to
find out if a track bike

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.780
suspension is OK in this area?

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.719
Ken Moss might be--

00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:32.510
SPEAKER: Dave Moss.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.635
AUDIENCE: Dave Moss, sorry.

00:42:33.635 --> 00:42:35.910
KEN HILL: Yeah,
so again, so part

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.377
of what I've worked
on in all my life

00:42:39.377 --> 00:42:41.460
is, I want to do what the
best riders in the world

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.850
are doing because if there was
a better way, they would do it.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:45.770
Pretty simple.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.625
Right So realize that
person that I'm going to ask

00:42:50.625 --> 00:42:53.610
is somebody that has operated
at that highest level.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.860
I use Mike Canfield
in Sacramento.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.160
And I do just because he's
four-time MotoAmerica crew

00:42:59.160 --> 00:42:59.970
chief.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.100
And he's got his own
suspension shop there.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.700
So I'll use somebody
like him because, I mean,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.320
I want to work
with somebody that

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.000
has operated at the very highest
levels because they understand.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.440
Something we also talk about--

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.270
if you want the last
1%, it has to come

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.210
from somebody that
understands the last 1%,

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.915
where in your case, that
may be your last 1%.

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:23.730
It may not be his last 1%.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.430
But he's still at a point
where he can understand it.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.850
So does that makes sense?

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:28.570
OK, good.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.775
What other questions?

00:43:29.775 --> 00:43:31.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.420
I'm not a rider.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.280
But this is more
of, like, a question

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.860
for that pertains to sport
and training and all that.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:46.340
If you're trying to get to the
next level, or training for--

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.680
I don't know-- a new technique,
or specifically, say,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.020
in riding, when there's
very little room for error,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.240
how do you make that
progress and not

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.400
have a really, really
bad consequence?

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.540
KEN HILL: Yeah, so we talk about
how we build new fundamentals.

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.047
And honestly, and when we're
looking at it from a risk

00:44:07.047 --> 00:44:09.130
standpoint because riding
a motorcycle, of course,

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:09.730
can be very risky.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:11.435
And it's like dude, Scott,
yeah, just go in there

00:44:11.435 --> 00:44:12.601
and send the thing in there.

00:44:12.601 --> 00:44:13.275
You'll be fine.

00:44:13.275 --> 00:44:14.950
It doesn't work that way.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:21.360
So we work on taking things at
a very precise and deliberate

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.840
stepping level.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.790
So for instance, if we
have a rider that's--

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.784
we want him to brake
later into a corner

00:44:28.784 --> 00:44:30.450
because getting into
a corner or braking

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.180
later is probably the scariest
thing on a motorcycle.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.366
Your fear factor takes over.

00:44:36.366 --> 00:44:37.740
Instead of saying,
hey, look, you

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.410
need to go to the
brakes 200 feet later,

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.810
how about you go to the
brakes 10 feet later.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.820
And then you work up to it.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.100
So it's just like
in different sports.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.720
Cycling is the same way for me.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.220
So as a cyclist, a fairly
competitive cyclist,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.346
in my training, we
would train with power.

00:44:54.346 --> 00:44:55.470
It's the same thing, right?

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.810
If I want a certain
power increase,

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.730
I'm just not going to
expect a huge increase.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.610
Instead, I'll build my
training incrementally

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:04.200
to be able to get there.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.890
And of course,
you've got to have

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.723
good data to be able
to support that as well

00:45:06.723 --> 00:45:09.040
and have pure data to be
able to make that happen.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.410
So we'll look at things
and step them up.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.880
But again, you have
to put yourself

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.040
in a position to be able
to adjust for it as well.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.780
So this goes all back to
all of your initial inputs

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.600
have got to be smooth so we
can have that clear data.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.490
Also being able to
record that data

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.200
is a pretty big deal as well.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.850
We do a lot of work with video.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.900
Video works good for us.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.632
But we also do a lot of data
acquisition work as well.

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:36.340
And then I was using
the cycling analogy.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.090
Same thing, we use a
lot of data on cycling

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.017
to track power levels.

00:45:41.017 --> 00:45:43.350
So when we're building a new
habit or a new fundamental,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.132
one, we work on one
thing at a time.

00:45:46.132 --> 00:45:48.090
Because if you want 100%
result from something,

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.120
you work on one thing at
a time, instead of working

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.500
on 10 different things at 10%.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:57.180
So we'll spend a massive
amount of time working

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.490
on that one very single thing.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.639
I have a rider, for instance--

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:03.180
actually, I'll give
you two examples.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.990
I have a rider that we worked
on their initial brake control

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.490
for probably six months, just
on how he went to the brakes.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.600
And not only would we
practice it on the bike,

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.590
but we'd practice it in his car.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.574
So even if he was working on the
motorcycle, I needed the brain,

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:18.990
I needed the
electrical connection

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.470
in his brain to not be
aggressive with his inputs.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.000
So how he drove his car, I'd
be very deliberate on how

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.280
he went to the brakes.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.860
And that really sped
that process up.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.230
Another way of shortcutting that
process is exactly what I said.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.230
Whatever your sport is,
whatever that habit is,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.800
you can work on it off of it.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.919
I mentioned yoga.

00:46:41.919 --> 00:46:43.710
So one of the things
that I work on in yoga

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.040
is I work on the
first 5% of my pose

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.290
because one, being a
dumb male, I typically

00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.710
do things way too aggressively.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.230
If I notice that I got
into a pose too quickly,

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:57.240
I'd fall out of
the pose earlier.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.560
But if I got into the pose, the
first 5% of my pose was slower,

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.830
I could almost always hold
the pose the whole minute.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.580
So it's putting all these
things in your brain that,

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.070
again, how you do anything
is how you do everything.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:15.720
So a good thought for you there.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.680
What else?

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.270
AUDIENCE: Any
recommended reading?

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:23.400
KEN HILL: Yeah,
with the reading,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.390
I don't have anything
reading-wise that I do.

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.840
I mean, I read a lot of
books on essentially just

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.480
basic psychology, things
along those lines,

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.550
just how brains work.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.600
But I don't really have
any recommended reading

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.122
other than doing what the
best in the world are doing.

00:47:42.122 --> 00:47:44.080
So I spent a lot, like
the fighter pilot stuff.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.788
There's a lot of stuff
on how the fighter

00:47:45.788 --> 00:47:48.300
pilots look at things, even
the special forces guys.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.430
I look at a lot of
that type of reading

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.514
and the psychology
that goes behind it.

00:47:52.514 --> 00:47:54.180
All right, thanks,
everyone, for coming.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.000
Appreciate it.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.500
Good.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.550
[APPLAUSE]
