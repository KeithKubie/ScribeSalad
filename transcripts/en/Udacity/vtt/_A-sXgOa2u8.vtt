00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.160
Congratulations, you've
reached the end of lesson one.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.910
You've learned a few shell commands,
and you've gotten some practice

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.250
using the terminal and learning what
sorts of things to expect from it.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.850
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson,
you'll be exploring more commands, and

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.180
more importantly, you'll learn more
about how to learn about shell commands,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.830
using the Belton manual, and
other sources of help, too.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.330
&gt;&gt; See you then.
