00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.160
 
like I think for us what we try to find

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170
like I think for us what we try to find
 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.170
like I think for us what we try to find
is sort of two levels of intelligence we

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180
is sort of two levels of intelligence we
 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.910
is sort of two levels of intelligence we
try to find people who are book smart

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920
try to find people who are book smart
 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.780
try to find people who are book smart
so who just have raw intelligence and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790
so who just have raw intelligence and
 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.400
so who just have raw intelligence and
then what you also want is to be able to

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410
then what you also want is to be able to
 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.280
then what you also want is to be able to
find people who have street smarts

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290
find people who have street smarts
 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.630
find people who have street smarts
so if you can find a mixture of both and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640
so if you can find a mixture of both and
 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.630
so if you can find a mixture of both and
where you've got individuals who have a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640
where you've got individuals who have a
 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.310
where you've got individuals who have a
high level of book smarts and a high

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320
high level of book smarts and a high
 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.970
high level of book smarts and a high
level of street smarts I think that's

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980
level of street smarts I think that's
 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.950
level of street smarts I think that's
actually unique because what you mostly

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960
actually unique because what you mostly
 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.160
actually unique because what you mostly
find out there is people who are either

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170
find out there is people who are either
 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.240
find out there is people who are either
just very smart on the book side and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250
just very smart on the book side and
 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.560
just very smart on the book side and
then you've already find people who are

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570
then you've already find people who are
 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.840
then you've already find people who are
just very street smart and it's the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850
just very street smart and it's the
 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.060
just very street smart and it's the
mixture or the combination of those two

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070
mixture or the combination of those two
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.160
mixture or the combination of those two
talents that I think separates at least

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170
talents that I think separates at least
 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.229
talents that I think separates at least
for us those are the individuals who are

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239
for us those are the individuals who are
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.619
for us those are the individuals who are
trying to find so the higher your level

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629
trying to find so the higher your level
 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.410
trying to find so the higher your level
of raw intelligence a higher your level

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420
of raw intelligence a higher your level
 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.690
of raw intelligence a higher your level
of street smarts that's how you're going

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
of street smarts that's how you're going
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.830
of street smarts that's how you're going
to end up getting a job at our firm

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840
 
 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.390
 
yeah and look I think we've made a lot

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400
yeah and look I think we've made a lot
 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.680
yeah and look I think we've made a lot
of mistakes I mean I wish I could tell

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690
of mistakes I mean I wish I could tell
 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.030
of mistakes I mean I wish I could tell
you we didn't make mistakes I think

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040
you we didn't make mistakes I think
 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.399
you we didn't make mistakes I think
we've made a lot I think ultimately the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409
we've made a lot I think ultimately the
 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.680
we've made a lot I think ultimately the
the real issue ends up being one of

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690
the real issue ends up being one of
 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.160
the real issue ends up being one of
personality I mean it's you you've got a

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170
personality I mean it's you you've got a
 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.080
personality I mean it's you you've got a
large group of people how does everybody

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
large group of people how does everybody
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.800
large group of people how does everybody
mix how does everybody work well and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
mix how does everybody work well and
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
mix how does everybody work well and
does having that individual add to the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820
does having that individual add to the
 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.719
does having that individual add to the
team or does that having that individual

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729
team or does that having that individual
 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.780
team or does that having that individual
detract from the team and in the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790
detract from the team and in the
 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.190
detract from the team and in the
beginning you might think it would add

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200
beginning you might think it would add
 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.780
beginning you might think it would add
and then you sort of find out through

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790
and then you sort of find out through
 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.760
and then you sort of find out through
sort of the interaction that it isn't

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
sort of the interaction that it isn't
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.100
sort of the interaction that it isn't
really that beneficial I think that sort

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
really that beneficial I think that sort
 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.840
really that beneficial I think that sort
of you know that's happened a number of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850
of you know that's happened a number of
 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.560
of you know that's happened a number of
times I think the other one is you sort

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570
times I think the other one is you sort
 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.960
times I think the other one is you sort
of even though somebody you believe has

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970
of even though somebody you believe has
 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.240
of even though somebody you believe has
raw intelligence you quickly come to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
raw intelligence you quickly come to
 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.419
raw intelligence you quickly come to
realize that on a practical level

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429
realize that on a practical level
 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.050
realize that on a practical level
they're not able to make decisions I

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060
they're not able to make decisions I
 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.160
they're not able to make decisions I
think one of the things that you find in

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
think one of the things that you find in
 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.109
think one of the things that you find in
this business is that people are very

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119
this business is that people are very
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.080
this business is that people are very
good at telling you why you should do

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
good at telling you why you should do
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.540
good at telling you why you should do
something and why you shouldn't you know

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
something and why you shouldn't you know
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.479
something and why you shouldn't you know
the next step is okay I understand that

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489
the next step is okay I understand that
 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.920
the next step is okay I understand that
now should we buy it and I think it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930
now should we buy it and I think it
 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.650
now should we buy it and I think it
takes a different personality or

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
takes a different personality or
 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.319
takes a different personality or
different people to not to be able to

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329
different people to not to be able to
 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.660
different people to not to be able to
analyze it but then also to say look at

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
analyze it but then also to say look at
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.110
analyze it but then also to say look at
this price I'm a buyer so I think that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
this price I'm a buyer so I think that
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.090
this price I'm a buyer so I think that
you need to sort of see how people

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
you need to sort of see how people
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.380
you need to sort of see how people
develop and you find that people are

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390
develop and you find that people are
 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.630
develop and you find that people are
able to develop into that role or you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640
able to develop into that role or you
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.100
able to develop into that role or you
find that people can't develop into that

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
find that people can't develop into that
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.780
find that people can't develop into that
role

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
 
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.780
 
I think it's horrible it's not that I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
I think it's horrible it's not that I
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.920
I think it's horrible it's not that I
don't think it's hitting more than that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
don't think it's hitting more than that
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.580
don't think it's hitting more than that
it's there's been a huge preoccupation

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
it's there's been a huge preoccupation
 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.729
it's there's been a huge preoccupation
or focus on making money as opposed to I

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
or focus on making money as opposed to I
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.979
or focus on making money as opposed to I
think when I was growing up the focus

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
think when I was growing up the focus
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.539
think when I was growing up the focus
was how do you make it a better world

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549
was how do you make it a better world
 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.449
was how do you make it a better world
and today it's not how do I make it a

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
and today it's not how do I make it a
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.759
and today it's not how do I make it a
better world it's how do I make my world

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
better world it's how do I make my world
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.569
better world it's how do I make my world
better which I think has huge

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
better which I think has huge
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.789
better which I think has huge
consequences for the society that we

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
consequences for the society that we
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.530
consequences for the society that we
live in and that I think for me I've

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540
live in and that I think for me I've
 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.149
live in and that I think for me I've
tried we have five children we've tried

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159
tried we have five children we've tried
 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.830
tried we have five children we've tried
to push our children into something that

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
to push our children into something that
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.990
to push our children into something that
that isn't sort of in the finance sector

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000
that isn't sort of in the finance sector
 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.119
that isn't sort of in the finance sector
yeah and that you've got to try to sort

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129
yeah and that you've got to try to sort
 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.429
yeah and that you've got to try to sort
of help others and try to help the world

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439
of help others and try to help the world
 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.319
of help others and try to help the world
and try to make a difference so yeah but

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329
and try to make a difference so yeah but
 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.179
and try to make a difference so yeah but
it's easy to say and it's very easy to

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189
it's easy to say and it's very easy to
 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.129
it's easy to say and it's very easy to
say and I think I think it's hard when

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139
say and I think I think it's hard when
 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.170
say and I think I think it's hard when
you're the individual and you've got and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
you're the individual and you've got and
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690
you're the individual and you've got and
you're extremely bright you're gonna

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
you're extremely bright you're gonna
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.129
you're extremely bright you're gonna
look at and say well I can help the

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139
look at and say well I can help the
 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.830
look at and say well I can help the
world or it can help Society or I can go

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
world or it can help Society or I can go
 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.610
world or it can help Society or I can go
help myself and I don't I don't think

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
help myself and I don't I don't think
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.949
help myself and I don't I don't think
it's up I don't think it's up to us to

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
it's up I don't think it's up to us to
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.530
it's up I don't think it's up to us to
decide but I think the reason that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
decide but I think the reason that
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.729
decide but I think the reason that
people do that is the differential in

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739
people do that is the differential in
 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.059
people do that is the differential in
what you make is too great right now it

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069
what you make is too great right now it
 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.129
what you make is too great right now it
used to be I think when I graduated if

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139
used to be I think when I graduated if
 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.439
used to be I think when I graduated if
you went into finance maybe you made two

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449
you went into finance maybe you made two
 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.149
you went into finance maybe you made two
times as much or you made three times as

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159
times as much or you made three times as
 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.449
times as much or you made three times as
much as another job and therefore that's

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
much as another job and therefore that's
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.159
much as another job and therefore that's
why you saw it a lot of people doing the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169
why you saw it a lot of people doing the
 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.379
why you saw it a lot of people doing the
other jobs I think today the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389
other jobs I think today the
 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.149
other jobs I think today the
differential isn't three or four times

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159
differential isn't three or four times
 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.180
differential isn't three or four times
it's sort of 10 20 30 times so that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190
it's sort of 10 20 30 times so that
 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.270
it's sort of 10 20 30 times so that
differential is so huge that it's hard

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
differential is so huge that it's hard
 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.760
differential is so huge that it's hard
for people who are young to say I'm

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
for people who are young to say I'm
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.460
for people who are young to say I'm
going to give that up

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470
 
 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.530
