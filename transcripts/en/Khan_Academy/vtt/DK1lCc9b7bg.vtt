00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.870
In the last video, we talked a
little bit about what inflation

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.382
is, and the Consumer
Price Index.

00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:07.340
And so I thought I would
actually show you data

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.530
and maybe point out a
few interesting things

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.860
right over here.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.165
So this right over here is
the monthly press release,

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:15.900
or it's the table from the
monthly press release, issued

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.660
And this is Table
A, which is really

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.320
a summary of all the
important things.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.140
It's the percent changes in
CPI for all urban consumers,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.530
the CPI-U. And they do it for
non or urban consumers and all

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.030
the rest.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.299
But the CPI that is
quoted is the one

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.677
for urban consumers,
the US City Average.

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:38.010
And what I always find is
that the details are much more

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.970
interesting than what
you hear just on the news

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.244
when people say, oh,
the CPI changed by 0.5%.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.660
And one thing I
do want to point--

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.662
and this is true of the CPI,
this is true of all government

00:00:48.662 --> 00:00:50.620
statistics; in fact, this
is true of any report

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.380
that any company
gives you-- it's

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.846
very important to keep
in mind whether they're

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.720
giving a sequential
change or whether they're

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.800
giving a year-over-year change.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.019
So for example, there might be
a press release like this one,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.300
and the text of it, or
maybe the headline number

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.840
when you look at your local
newspaper or your news report,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.990
will say, look in June 2011
inflation on all items,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.950
on the entire basket of
goods, went down by 0.2%.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.290
And you might say, oh wow,
look, there's no inflation.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.070
In fact, prices are going down.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.832
This would be minor deflation.

00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:27.790
But it's important to
realize that this is only

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.987
the seasonally adjusted
prices from May to June.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:34.820
Now, when I talk about
seasonally adjusted--

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.120
and traditionally, maybe
people use a different amount

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.460
of energy, a different amount
of gasoline from May to June.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.290
And they try to factor
that in when they compare

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.690
the basket of good, the
price of the basket of good,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.830
from May to June.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.020
So that's what they talk
about seasonally adjusting.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780
But if you look over
here, the prices

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.470
went down for May
to June according

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.880
to adjusting it for the season.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.280
But they year-over-year
changes are still up.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.264
If you compare June 2011 to June
2010, it is still up by 3.6%.

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:07.680
And in general,
the monthly things

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.199
are going to be a little
bit more volatile.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.680
Obviously, you have the
seasonal adjustments.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.200
You have other short-term
factors that might change it.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.780
But the year-over-year
one is a stronger signal

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.877
for what is actually
happening for inflation.

00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:20.710
Although someone might
want to pay attention

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.670
to the monthly one, because
that's obviously giving you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.770
the most up to date of
what's happening now.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.510
And what you'll
often see is, they'll

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.570
give an inflation
number for everything,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.630
and then they'll subtract
out food and energy.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.634
So this is all items
less food and energy.

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.300
And that's because
food and energy, they

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.047
represent a good
bit of the basket,

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:41.380
but they're very, very volatile.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.560
You can see it right
here in this report,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.270
year-over-year energy has
gone up double digits, 20%

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.370
for energy generally.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.780
If you look at fuel oil,
35.6%, at least on this report.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.280
It's been coming
down more recently.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.950
But year-over-year it's
been up a huge amount.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.860
And so that's actually the main
driving factor for this 3.6%.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.520
If you take food and
energy out of the equation,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.750
if you compare the basket
of goods minus that,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.272
inflation was only up 1.6%.

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:11.980
It's interesting.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.620
Even within that, you can look
at which parts of the economy,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.412
or which products and
services, are getting

00:03:17.412 --> 00:03:19.745
a lot more expensive and which
ones are getting cheaper.

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.030
It's actually interesting
that used cars and trucks

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.190
are up 5.1%.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.500
That seems like a pretty strong
price increase for used things.
