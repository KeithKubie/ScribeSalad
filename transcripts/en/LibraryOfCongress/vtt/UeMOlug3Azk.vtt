Dia lot of practice of the 
special names.

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:40.263
[Laughter]
I was a French major in college.

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:49.428
So when I got to EL JARDIN, I 
wanted to say El

00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.892
 Jedin.
I got through this because of 

00:13:53.893 --> 00:13:56.421
the wonderful Maria RANA, who is

00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:58.236
here with the Library of 
Congress.

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:01.785
Marie, thank you for getting me 
through, for coaching me.

00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:05.112
I'm going to need a lot more in 
the future.

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:09.045
In my last two minutes, I'm 
going to go off

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.790
 script just a 
moment.

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:18.035
Several weeks ago, the library 
received an archive of a 

00:14:18.036 --> 00:14:21.693
wonderful photo journalist, 
Bob Edelman.

00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:26.614
Bob side Saddamly died over a 
year ago and his archives have 

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:30.452
come here.
He was an extremely 

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:35.261
interesting photo journalist, 
and a confidant of Martinez, 

00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:39.983
and Andy warhol.
How's that for a range.

00:14:40.064 --> 00:14:43.171
But he took wonderful photos  
and my dream is one day, we'll 

00:14:43.172 --> 00:14:44.810
have an exhibit of his work 
here.

00:14:44.811 --> 00:14:51.886
When we received the gift, we 
had a celebration of above 

00:14:51.887 --> 00:14:55.625
flight and Juan Felipe Herrera 
composed a poem in his honor 

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:57.626
and it was so moving, and so 
inspiring

00:15:00.578 --> 00:15:03.195
 and captureed Bob so 
beautifully.

00:15:03.498 --> 00:15:06.737
So I became really, I guess, 
inspired

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:14.532
 by Juan Felipe's 
ability to write this 

00:15:14.534 --> 00:15:17.639
wonderful poem and I decided I 
would write a poem in his 

00:15:17.641 --> 00:15:20.482
honor.
Now, I know that takes a lot 

00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:25.897
of Huspa.
I'VE NEVER WRITTEN A POEM IN 

00:15:25.898 --> 00:15:29.467
MY LIFE.
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY, JUAN 

00:15:29.468 --> 00:15:35.639
FELIPE HERRERA INSPIRED ME SO 
MY POEM CONSISTS OF 50 STANZAS

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.160

00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:40.189

YOU IN UNDER A MINUTE.

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:47.674
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I AM I I HAVE

00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:51.506

00:23:38.177 --> 00:23:38.786
.
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE 

00:23:38.787 --> 00:23:41.001
BIT ABOUT THAT PERIOD AND 
PERIOD THAT CAME JUST AFTER

00:23:44.328 --> 00:23:46.413
.
&gt;&gt; JUAN:  IT'S KIND OF UN

00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:48.686
UNDESCRIBABLE.
YOU PUT, LET'S SEE, YOU PUT FR

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:53.347
FRIJOLES, AFFIRMATIVE 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

00:24:04.445 --> 00:24:08.504
BERETS, LEAVING HOME.
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

00:24:08.702 --> 00:24:14.662
FIRST TIME, FIRST GENERATION.
GO TO THAT PLACE CALLED I 

00:24:14.664 --> 00:24:18.869
DON'T KNOW.
UCLA IS A NEW TIME, A NEW EPIC

00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:22.329
EPIC.
A NEW WORLD.

00:24:33.514 --> 00:24:37.043
THAT DAY CAME WHEN THE BIG 
ENVELOPE FROM UCLA CAME.  AND 

00:24:37.044 --> 00:24:42.819
ELOISA, WHO I MET IN 1962 WHEN 
WE WERE BOTH IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.531
WHO BECAME ONE OF ONE OF A 
PIONEERING 

00:24:45.534 --> 00:24:48.562
CHICANO POST.
WHO STARTED CRACKING THE 

00:24:48.563 --> 00:24:50.672
ANTHROPOLOGY BOOKS

00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:58.864
 HE SAYS, 
TODAY, I'M A CHICANO.

00:24:59.685 --> 00:25:00.814
I SAID WHAT WERE YOU YESTERDAY
YESTERDAY?

00:25:00.815 --> 00:25:03.439
[LAUGHTER]
SO IT WAS LIKE THAT

00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:14.070
 PLAYING IN 
THE LAST OF THE COUGH EF 

00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:18.749
HOUSES WE WOULD GO THERE, 
LUISA AND I, AND WE'D JUMP IN, 

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.705
AND WE'D PLAY CON NGAS AND I'D 
GET UP WITH HARMONICA.

00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:28.657
WHILE THERE WAS A DIGUITAR 
THAT SANG BLUES.

00:25:28.755 --> 00:25:30.755
HOT CIDER WITH SIN

00:25:33.972 --> 00:25:35.972
 MONEY STICK 
STICKS  IN IT

00:25:38.568 --> 00:25:43.114
 AND PEOPLE WERE 
SINGING, A PIRATE, A POST, YOU 

00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:47.860
KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND YOU PUT ALL THAT STUFF 

00:25:47.861 --> 00:25:52.203
TOGETHER, AND YOU PUT THE 
EXPLOSION OF THE UNION MOVE

00:25:52.206 --> 00:25:57.660
MOVEMENT AND THE PILGRIMAGES, 
LA VIRGIN DE GUADELUPE.

00:25:57.858 --> 00:26:05.943
AND YOU PUT TREKS  TO MEXICO.
TRICKS TO CUBA AND TRICKS BACK 

00:26:05.944 --> 00:26:09.019
AND LIVING ON RICE

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.120
 WATER.

00:26:18.862 --> 00:26:22.616
AND IT IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY, HAD 

00:26:22.617 --> 00:26:30.049
A VOICE, AND WE TOOK ONE OF 
THE TASKS AND SOON, WE STARTED 

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.050
WORK.

00:26:34.002 --> 00:26:36.002
COLLECTIVE

00:26:37.039 --> 00:26:40.970
, IN SAN FRANCISCO, 
AND THE WOMEN BEGAN TO GATHER 

00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:45.005
IN COTTAGES, AND THEY WENT TO 
COTTAGES AS A COLLECTIVE, AND 

00:26:45.006 --> 00:26:48.446
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THEY WERE 
LIKE, LIVING IN THEIR OWN 

00:26:48.447 --> 00:26:52.356
WORLD, AND THE WOMAN WORLD AND 
ASSERTING THE WORLD ON THEIR 

00:26:52.357 --> 00:26:54.357
OWN TERMS

00:27:04.877 --> 00:27:07.005
 SO ALL THAT IS 
TAKING PLACE WHILE THIS IS 

00:27:07.006 --> 00:27:11.480
BEGINNING TO COOK, AND WE'RE 
EXCITED BECAUSE ALL OF A S IT 

00:27:11.481 --> 00:27:14.029
REALLY WASN'T ABOUT RIDING.
OR BEING A POST.

00:27:14.073 --> 00:27:18.724
IT WAS ABOUT STANDING UP.
AND SPEAKING.

00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:27.318
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES, AND TO 
OPEN UP AND BREAK OPEN THOSE 

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:32.160
VAULTS THAT HAD OUR STORIES, 
OUR WORK, OUR SYMBOLS AND 

00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:35.451
SIGNS, AND THE MANY WAYS OF 
OUR PEOPLE, AND WE WANTED TO 

00:27:35.452 --> 00:27:41.362
BREAK OPEN THOSE VOLTS, AND 
STEP IN TO SEE THEM AND WORDS  

00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:45.819
AND FORMS, AND SONGS  AND 
MUSIC WERE A PART OF THAT 

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.240
EFFORT AND PROJECT, AND I'M SO 
HAPPY THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY.

00:27:49.342 --> 00:27:53.908
ECHOING THESE THINGS, ACTUALLY
ACTUALLY, RECREATING AND 

00:27:53.909 --> 00:28:00.072
STARTING A GREAT PANEL TODAY 
IN EVERYONE THAT'S HERE.

00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:14.877
&gt;&gt; AND THE IDEA OF VOICE, AND 
SHARING VOICE K COLLECTING 

00:28:14.878 --> 00:28:17.113

WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AS 

00:28:17.114 --> 00:28:20.375
A PANEL, IN ORDER TO GET TO

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.442
HERRERA HAS LEFT US, AS POST 
LAUREATE, BUT HOW HE IS 

00:28:30.443 --> 00:28:34.782
WORKING AS A LATINO LITERARY 
CULTURAL TRADITION THAT, 

00:28:34.783 --> 00:28:38.419
BRINGS MANY OF US TOGETHER AND 
CARRIES WITH IT, CERTAIN 

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:42.765
VALUES THAT HAVE TRANSFORMED 
THE NATIONAL CULTURE AND HAVE 

00:28:42.766 --> 00:28:46.203
PRODUCTIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO 
THE NATIONAL CULTURE.

00:28:46.407 --> 00:28:50.162
SO I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE 
REST OF THE PANEL TO YOU AND 

00:28:50.163 --> 00:28:54.097
I'D LIKE EACH OF THEM IN TURN, 
TO MAYBE TALK A LITTLE BIT HOW 

00:28:54.098 --> 00:28:57.638
THEY CAME TO THE IDEA, THE 
REALIZATION, HAVING A VOICE, 

00:28:57.639 --> 00:29:01.089
WANTING  TO SHARE A VOICE, AND 
WANTING TO SHARE THEIR VOICE 

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.513
WITH OTHERS TO FORM NEW 
COLLECTIVES AND TO BOTH THINK 

00:29:05.514 --> 00:29:11.384
IN TERMS OF THE SOCIAL WORLD 
THAT THEY INHERITED, THAT WE

ARTISTS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD 
AS WELL, TO TRANSFORM, AND 

00:29:23.827 --> 00:29:28.373
TRANSFORM THE MEDIA THAT EACH 
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAS USED 

00:29:28.374 --> 00:29:33.826
IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE THE 
NATURE OF THAT MEDIA, AS THAT 

00:29:33.827 --> 00:29:40.805
MEDIA CHALLENGES THE NATURE OF 
OUR SOCIAL HEARD, AND SOCIAL 

00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:43.113
HIERARCHY.

00:31:23.827 --> 00:31:26.354
EXTRAORDINARILY RICH FORM OF

THAT HAS VERY, VERY DEEP ROOTS 
N INDIGENOUS SOUNDS AND 

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:36.530
AFRICAN SOUNDS.
IN 2014, HER STOMP BOX WHICH 

00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:40.472
WAS FEATURED EARLY ON THE 
STAGE, IT WAS USED AS A 

00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:43.515
PLATFORM.
&gt;&gt; A BAROS ONE.

00:31:43.719 --> 00:31:46.343
&gt;&gt; IT'S A SOUND BOX USE 
FORWARD DANCING.

00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:51.304
HER TARIMA WAS ACQUIRED BY THE 
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATIONAL

PLEASURE TO BRUCE MORGAN TO 

00:32:15.209 --> 00:32:19.099

00:32:30.407 --> 00:32:33.921
&gt;&gt; IT'S A RELOAN OR TO BE UP 
HERE WITH THESE ARTISTS, AND 

00:32:33.922 --> 00:32:38.295
THINKERS AND POST LAUREATES.
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE, 

00:32:38.296 --> 00:32:41.531
I WAS ALL TORN UP IN THE 
BATHROOM, AND I THOUGHT, WHAT 

00:32:41.532 --> 00:32:46.782
AM I DOING HERE?
ANY HOW, T.M.I.

00:32:46.814 --> 00:32:48.814
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I HAD TO SAY THAT.

00:32:49.114 --> 00:32:54.873
I REALLY FEEL SO MUCH 
INFLUENCE DIRECTLY, BY ALL OF 

00:32:54.874 --> 00:32:59.122
THESE MEN UP HERE IN SOME WAY, 
SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE 

00:32:59.123 --> 00:33:01.846
AND I'M ALSO PROUD TO BE ONE 
OF THE FEW WOMEN UP HERE AS 

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:03.847
WELL.
THE ONLY WOMAN UP HERE.

00:33:05.596 --> 00:33:07.596
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:13.361 --> 00:33:14.578
.
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 

00:33:14.579 --> 00:33:18.031
MANY OTHERS.
AND THINKING ABOUT VOICE, 

00:33:18.032 --> 00:33:20.252
THERE ARE TWO THINGS I'D LIKE 
TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND ONE OF 

00:33:20.254 --> 00:33:24.513
THE THINGS IS FIRST OF ALL, 
YOU NEED TO SEE AN EXAMPLE.

00:33:26.312 --> 00:33:29.548
TO FIND A VOICE FOR ME IS 
SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE, EXPRESS.

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:34.606
LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL WORDS THAT 
OUR POST LAUREATE SAID AT THIS 

00:33:34.607 --> 00:33:36.623
TIME IT'D.
YOU PUT A MIRROR TO THE FACE.  

00:33:36.624 --> 00:33:39.860
AND SHOW YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL 
YOUR CULTURE IS AND HOW IT'S 

00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:44.721
NOT BAD TO MIX ENGLISH AND 
SPANISH, AND TO CREATE NEW 

00:33:44.722 --> 00:33:47.862
LANGUAGE LIKE SPANGLISH AND 
SAY IT IN A WAY THAT FULFILLS 

00:33:47.863 --> 00:33:52.833
WITH YOU PRIDE, WHERE YOU 
FLUFF UP

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.111
 I HAVE AN UNDER 
GRADUATE DEGREE I WENT TO UCLA 

00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:07.951
AND EVEN THOUGH THIS WONDERFUL 
MAN GRACED THE HALLWAYS OF 

00:34:07.952 --> 00:34:11.596
THIS PLACE, UNFORTUNATELY, 
THERE ARE ELEMENTS AT UCLA

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:19.363
CHANGE THAT WOULD MUCH.
I IMAGINE, IT WAS EVEN MORE 

00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:22.814
EXPRESSIVE BACK IN THE DAY.
BUT IN MY TIME, YOU COULD RUN 

00:34:22.815 --> 00:34:30.942
INTO GREAT SCHOLARS, OF COURSE
COURSE, BUT TO KNOW THAT WELL, 

00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:34.763
JUAN FILIPE HAS BEEN THERE, 
AND TON THAT HE'S AN INFLUENCE 

00:34:34.764 --> 00:34:38.564
OTHERS TRAJECTORY AND BODY OF 
WORK THAT WE HAVE IS EXTREME 

00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:44.424
EXTREMELY IMPACTFUL.
SO FOR ME, IS TO WITNESS AND 

00:34:44.425 --> 00:34:49.891
SEE READINGS SUCH AS THESE, 
SUCH AS SANDRA CISNEROS, 

00:34:49.892 --> 00:34:54.736
SHERRY MORAGA, SO MANY POETS 
THAT REFLECTED MY EXPERIENCE, 

00:34:54.737 --> 00:34:57.786
WELL, THE FIRST THING IS AN 
EXAMPLE, THE SECOND THING, I 

00:34:57.787 --> 00:35:03.327
THINK FOR ME HAS BEEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A LIGHT IN 

00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:07.280
YOUR FACE AND BE ABLE TO SAY 
SOMETHING ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:10.430
SOMEONE PUTS THE MIC IN YOUR 
FACE, GO AHEAD.

00:35:10.624 --> 00:35:13.050
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE

00:35:13.065 --> 00:35:14.384
CONTRIBUTE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY?

00:35:14.385 --> 00:35:17.800
AT SOME POINT, YOU TAKE IT 
SERIOUSLY, AND YOU'RE GIVEN 

00:35:17.801 --> 00:35:20.233
THE OPPORTUNITY.
AND WOW, NOBODY'S EVER ASKED 

00:35:20.234 --> 00:35:24.879
ME WHAT I THINK, WHAT I EN
ENVISION FOR THE FUTURE, WHAT 

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.409
I CAN IMAGINE, WHAT I STAND TO 
CREATE.

00:35:27.717 --> 00:35:31.872
WHAT I STAND TO CREATE, AND 
CONTRIBUTE.

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:37.311
SO FIRST, IT WAS AN EXAMPLE OF 
MUJERAS AND OTHER WONDERFUL 

00:35:37.312 --> 00:35:39.341
POETS.
FOR ME, IT WAS ALSO HAVING THE 

00:35:39.342 --> 00:35:46.515
OPPORTUNITY, AND I THINK MY 
BAND QUETZAL AND WHEN I MET MY 

00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:50.659
PARTNER, HE SAID, WHY DON'T 
YOU WRITE SOMETHING.

00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:52.960
WHAT?
TELL ME WHAT TO SING.

00:35:52.961 --> 00:35:55.028
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL WHAT YOU 
TO SING.

00:35:55.078 --> 00:35:57.660
YOU'RE THE SINGER.
I WAS LIKE DANG, SO NEXT THING 

00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:00.892
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO WRITE.
AND I REALLY STARTED PAYING 

00:36:00.893 --> 00:36:04.217
ATTENTION TO WORD SMITHING  
AND HOW THINGS WERE BEING PUT 

00:36:04.218 --> 00:36:06.453
TOGETHER AND IT BECAME REALLY 
EXCITING.

00:36:06.752 --> 00:36:10.126
AND AS AN EXAMPLE, AND THEN 
THE OPPORTUNITY.

00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:14.204

.
&gt;&gt; GRACIAS, RAFAEL.

00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:22.151
&gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES ME RAISE MY 
VOICE.

00:38:22.193 --> 00:38:27.583
I'M AN INDIO FROM AWAY HAWKA

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:40.734
AS CHILDREN, WE ARE NOT 
SUPPOSED TO RAISE OUR VOICE.

00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:43.380
EVEN IN SCHOOL.

00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:57.560
[MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]
&gt;&gt; YOUR MIC IS A LITTLE --

00:38:57.589 --> 00:39:00.096
&gt;&gt; THERE WE GO.
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:39:00.296 --> 00:39:02.296
MUCH BETTER.
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.127 --> 00:39:05.333
.
SO ANYWAY, I'LL TALK A LITTLE 

00:39:05.334 --> 00:39:11.691
BIT LATER ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.
SO ANY WAY, SO IT WAS VERY 

00:39:11.692 --> 00:39:17.763
INTERESTING, BECAUSE LIKE ANY 
CHILD, WE HAVE A LOT OF 

00:39:17.764 --> 00:39:23.159
QUESTIONS, RIGHT?
BUT I COULD NOT ASK THAT AND I 

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.268
WAS RAISE BY THE A SINGLE MOM, 
BECAUSE MY FATHER, RAFAEL WAS 

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:30.269
IN THE UNITED STATES

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:37.939
 WORKING.
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS, AS A 

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.482
CHILD, I WAS ACTUALLY VERY 
TIMID AND A MAMMA'S BOY.

00:39:41.686 --> 00:39:44.115
I WAS ALWAYS WITH MY MOTHER, 
AND BEING PROTECTIVE.

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:52.003
BUT THEN MY FATHER, AROUND 19
1967, AND THEN NEXT YEAR, HE 

00:39:52.004 --> 00:39:59.538
BROUGHT THE WHOLE FAMILY.
THE BROTHER, WE JOINED HIM IN 

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:05.124
CALIFORNIA, IN SONOMA COUNTY.
SO IT WAS VERY INTERESTING, 

00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:10.290
BECAUSE THERE'S WHERE I GOT 
INTRODUCED TO MULTI CULTURAL

00:40:10.293 --> 00:40:15.742
CULTURALLISM.
I DID PICK PRUNES, AND CROPS.

00:40:15.743 --> 00:40:17.955
POOR BLACK KIDS, POOR WHITE 
KIDS.

00:40:18.357 --> 00:40:22.947
FILIPINOS, SO ALL THIS KIND OF 
CAME TOGETHER

00:40:31.577 --> 00:40:35.109
.
WE ENLISTED IN ONE LABOR CAMP 

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:40.361
AND WE STAYED THERE.  WE WERE 
REALLY EXCITED TO SEE LIKE 

00:40:40.362 --> 00:40:44.917
FELIPE'S FAMILY, TO COME BY.
WE WERE MEETING NEW KIDS IN 

00:40:44.919 --> 00:40:49.872
THE SUMMERS.
SO ANY WAY, SO IT WAS AROUND, 

00:40:49.873 --> 00:40:55.419
I THINK WHEN I WAS 12, 13 
YEARS OLD, I REALLY REALIZED I 

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.065
HAD TO SPEAK OUT.
OF COURSE, I WAS BROUGHT HERE 

00:41:00.066 --> 00:41:02.066
TO THE UNITED STATES

00:41:05.942 --> 00:41:08.869
 BY THE 
AGE OF 12, I DEVELOPED 

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.753
TUBERCULOSIS.
I WAS IN A SANITARIUM SANITARIUM

00:41:12.365 --> 00:41:14.598
 FOR A 
WHOLE YEAR.

00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:23.183
SO WITH NO BATH, NO BATHROOM, 
NO RADIO, NO TV, SO THAT WAS

00:41:26.812 --> 00:41:29.638
TIME.
I BEGAN TO READ WHAT SOME OF 

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:34.391
THE PEOPLE THOUGHT.
ABOUT POOR PEOPLE.

00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:37.536
THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE POOR.
THEY DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 

00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:40.363
OPPORTUNITY.
SO THAT'S WHEN AND OTHER 

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:45.304
THINGS, AND HOW THEY THOUGHT 
ABOUT US.

00:41:45.409 --> 00:41:47.240
THEY WERE DIRTY, UNDESERVING, 
ET CETERA.

00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:49.875
AND ALSO, WE DESERVED TO BE 
POOR BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE 

00:41:49.878 --> 00:41:51.878
THE INITIATIVE OR THE 
MENTALITY.

00:41:52.599 --> 00:41:55.552
THAT'S WHAT I DECIDED TO SPEAK 
OUT.

00:42:31.866 --> 00:42:35.201
-- SO WHAT I DID IS, I CALLED, 
I DID A CALL OUT TO THE 

00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:38.327
COMMUNITY FROM THE RADIO 
STATION, TO THE ENTIRE BOSTON 

00:42:38.328 --> 00:42:43.109
AREA AND THAT'S HOW I I WAS 
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE ON THE 

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:47.796
RADIO.
SO I GAVE THE VOICE TO THE 

00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:50.743
PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY IN 
BOSTON.

00:42:50.954 --> 00:42:52.969
AND THEN ALSO TO ALL THE 
LATINOS.

00:42:53.176 --> 00:42:59.736
I ENDED UP [INDISCERNIBLE] THE 
SOUND INITIAL OF ALL THINGS  

00:42:59.737 --> 00:43:04.704
AND THEN I GOT THE IDEA OF OF 
ROAD

00:43:14.617 --> 00:43:16.128
ALL THE FARMWORKES, WERE 
LISTENING 

00:43:16.129 --> 00:43:18.129
LISTENING IN SO

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:25.464

[APPLAUSE]

.
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE 

00:46:24.784 --> 00:46:28.013
HERE.
WE WERE TALKING IN THE GREEN 

00:46:28.014 --> 00:46:32.255
ROOM WHEN, WE FIRST MET BACK 
IN THE EARL 70'S, AT BALBOA 

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:38.429
PARK, AT CENTER CULTURAL SAN 
DIEGO, WAY BACK WHEN OUR HAIR 

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:43.365
WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONGER AND A 
LOT DARKER AND IT'S GREAT TO 

00:46:43.366 --> 00:46:45.414
BE HERE.

00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:54.656
THIS CRAZY THING CALLED 
ANOTHER STARTED WITH ME A LONG 

00:46:54.657 --> 00:46:57.703
TIME AGO, WHEN I WAS A KID 
GROWING UP IN EAST L.A.

00:46:57.911 --> 00:47:02.141
AND ACTUALLY, IT WAS KIND OF 
LIKE A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.

00:47:02.142 --> 00:47:05.524
I WAS A TERRIBLE DANCER AND

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.937
 I 
COULDN'T SWIM TO SAVE MY LIFE 

00:47:12.938 --> 00:47:17.802
AND I WAS EVEN A WORSE 
BASEBALL PLAYER SO I BECAME A 

00:47:17.803 --> 00:47:20.426
MUSICIAN.
AS AN INSPIRATION, I WAS 

00:47:20.427 --> 00:47:23.257
LISTENING TO MEXICAN MUSE THAT 
I CAN MY MOTHER PLAYED AT HOME

00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:28.501
HOME.
SHE SANG AT HOME AND INSPIRED 

00:47:28.502 --> 00:47:32.758
ME IN MANY WAYS.
OF COURSE, I LISTENED TO RADIO

00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:34.886
RADIO.
MEXICAN MUSIC WHEN I WAS VERY 

00:47:34.887 --> 00:47:38.617
LITTLE, AND BY THE TIME I GOT 
OLD ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO REACH 

00:47:38.618 --> 00:47:44.387
THE KNOB ON THE RADIO, I 
DISCOVERED, THAT'S WHEN JIMMY 

00:47:44.388 --> 00:47:47.113
HENDRIX, JAMES BROWN, AND 
EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN CAME INTO 

00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:50.252
MY LIFE.
MY MOTHER BOUGHT ME A GUITAR 

00:47:50.253 --> 00:47:54.994
WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD IN 
SORT OF HER OWN YOUTH DI

00:47:54.996 --> 00:47:57.017
DIVERSION PROGRAM.
I THINK IT WAS TO KEEP ME OFF 

00:47:57.018 --> 00:48:00.643
THE STREET BECAUSE SHE LOVED 
MUSIC, TOO.

00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:06.000
SHE ALSO INSPIRED ME BY THE 
THINGS THAT SHE DID.

00:48:08.734 --> 00:48:10.734
I ALSO GREW UP WITHOUT A 
FATHER.

00:48:11.284 --> 00:48:14.668
HE DIED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8 
YEARS OLD.

00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:23.251
STRONG WOMEN, RIGHT?
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:30.963 --> 00:48:36.784
.
SHE TAUGHT ME BY HER EXAMPLE 

00:48:36.785 --> 00:48:39.515
BY FEEDING HOMELESS PEOPLE ON 
MY FRONT PORCH.

00:48:39.813 --> 00:48:43.545
ONE DAY WHEN I CAME UP THE 
WALK, SHE WAS, THERE WAS A 

00:48:43.546 --> 00:48:47.389
HOMELESS PERSON DRINKING OUT 
OF MY KOOL-AID MUG I HAD SENT 

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:53.347
FOR IN THE MAIL.
AND I WAS KIND OF APPALLED BY 

00:48:53.348 --> 00:48:56.497
THAT AND THEN I REALIZED, MY 
MOTHER WAS ACTUALLY TEACHING 

00:48:56.498 --> 00:48:58.813
ME SOMETHING.
SHE WAS TEACHING ME THAT IN 

00:48:58.814 --> 00:49:02.452
THIS LIFE, WE REALLY DON'T OWN 
ANYTHING AND IF WE DO, WE HAVE 

00:49:02.453 --> 00:49:09.421
TO SHARE WITH OTHERS.
SO MUSICALLY, YOU KNOW, I 

00:49:09.422 --> 00:49:14.242
LISTENED TO EVERYTHING I COULD 
PH I COULD GET MY HANDS O. LOS 

00:49:14.243 --> 00:49:21.753
LOBOS FORMED IN 1973, KIDS 
GROWING UP IN EAST L.A. AND WE 

00:49:21.754 --> 00:49:25.433
PUT AWAY ELECTRIC GUITARS, 
BECAUSE WE WERE ALL IN ROCK 

00:49:25.434 --> 00:49:29.628
BANDS AND WE FORMED  IN BAND 
TO PLAY TRADITIONAL MEXICAN 

00:49:29.629 --> 00:49:34.373
MUSIC, WHICH WAS UNHEARD OF AT 
THE TIME.

00:49:34.441 --> 00:49:38.004
WE WERE TIPPAL EARLY 70'S KIDS 
WITH LONG HAIR AND FLANNEL 

00:49:38.005 --> 00:49:43.667
SHIRTS, PLAYING MEXICAN MUSIC.
SO IT WAS KIND OF UNHEARD OF 

00:49:43.668 --> 00:49:45.668
AT THE TIME.
BUT

00:49:51.131 --> 00:50:00.566
 CHICANO MOVIMIENTOAND WE 
LENT OUR MUSICAL SERVICES TO 

00:50:00.567 --> 00:50:04.062
CESAR CHAVEZ AND UNITED 
FARMWORKERS, AND JUST ABOUT 

00:50:04.063 --> 00:50:08.018
ANY CHICANO CAUSE HAPPENING AT 
THE MOMENT, WHICH IS MANY.

00:50:08.221 --> 00:50:14.684
WE FOUND A REGULAR GIG IN 
PLAYING AT ALL THE MECCHAS IN 

00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:18.768
CALIFORNIA, AT STATE COLLEGES, 
AND UNIVERSITY.

00:50:30.562 --> 00:50:34.589
I GREW UP IN EAST LOS ANGELES.
IT'S A SPRING OF BEAUTY, PAIN, 

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:36.832
SORROW AND JOY.

00:50:43.452 --> 00:50:47.654
SO I DRAW FROM THAT FROM ALL 
OF MY WORK.

00:50:55.264 --> 00:50:59.420
IT'S A BOTTOMLESS AND 
BOUNTIFUL AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE 

00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:02.553
THAT I CAN DRAW FROM AND I 
CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT WHERE 

00:51:02.554 --> 00:51:10.032
WE COME FROM.
I'LL NEVER FORGET, AND IT IS 

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.033
CLOSE TO MY HEART THIS DAY.
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:22.951 --> 00:51:24.467
.
I THINK OUR SPEAKERS HAVE EACH 

00:51:24.468 --> 00:51:30.374
NOTED THE WAY IN WHICH THEIR 
CONNECTION TO LOBOS CAL

00:51:34.365 --> 00:51:36.388
 LOWELL, AND THE 
INFLUENCE OF OTHER WHO IS CAME 

00:51:36.389 --> 00:51:42.441
BEFORE, THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PARENTS, ROLE MODELS.

00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:46.597
FIGURES, WHO'S MODEL WE CAN 
DRAW UPON.

00:51:46.688 --> 00:51:50.237
WHO'S IMAGES AND LESSONS WE 
COULD DRAW UPON, IN ORDER TO 

00:51:50.238 --> 00:51:56.188
MOVE THINGS FORWARD AND 
EARLIER JUAN FELIPE HERRERA IN 

00:51:56.189 --> 00:52:00.781
HIS POETRY STATED, THIS 
AFTERNOON, IN THE PREVIOUS 

00:52:00.782 --> 00:52:05.279
EVENT, OUR ANCESTORS GIVE US 
THEIR VOICE.

00:52:05.327 --> 00:52:07.785
OUR ANCESTORS GIVE US THEIR 
VOICE TO SPEAK AGAIN.

00:52:08.094 --> 00:52:11.122
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SENTIMENT, 
AND I THINK THAT ENCAPSULATES 

00:52:11.123 --> 00:52:14.812
THE SENSE OF TRADITION AND THE 
COMMITMENT TO TRADITION THAT 

00:52:14.813 --> 00:52:20.621
IS A PART OF LATINO CULTURE, 
LATINO HERITAGE AND PART OF 

00:52:20.622 --> 00:52:26.806
WHAT GIVES LATINO COMMUNITIES, 
A SENSE OF STRENGTH, AND 

00:52:26.808 --> 00:52:28.514
PURPOSE.
BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK EACH OF 

00:52:28.515 --> 00:52:32.951
OUR PANEL MEASURES, WHAT 
TRADITION SIGNIFIES WHAT, IT 

00:52:32.952 --> 00:52:36.486
MEANS TO THEM.
WHAT IS TRADITION AS FAR AS 

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:41.944
BEING A WELL SPRING, BUT ALSO 
PERHAPS BEING A SOURCE OF 

00:52:41.945 --> 00:52:44.483
CONCERN.
ARE THERE TRADITIONS THAT ARE 

00:52:44.484 --> 00:52:46.793
PERHAPS BEST LEFT BEHIND

00:52:55.474 --> 00:52:56.388
 BEHIND 
TRADITION KECKSES  TO THE PAST 

00:52:56.389 --> 00:52:59.654
AND ALLOWSES  TO MOVE INTO THE 
FUTURE

00:53:21.317 --> 00:53:22.540
.
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN SHOULD 

00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:24.073
BE STOPPED.
[APPLAUSE].

00:53:24.074 --> 00:53:27.196
ALCOHOLISM, I THINK SHOULD BE 
STOPPED.

00:53:27.467 --> 00:53:30.100
AMONG MY PEOPLE.
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

00:53:31.115 --> 00:53:37.773
TOO MUCH ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION 
AND TO ME, IT APPEARS TO BE A 

00:53:37.774 --> 00:53:40.157
CONSPIRACY, I DON'T KNOW BY 
WHOM.

00:53:40.198 --> 00:53:43.769
DEFINITELY, CORPORATIONS, TO 
KEEP US DRUNK.

00:53:46.661 --> 00:53:50.609
AND IT'S JUST SUCH A TERRIBLE 
THING TO SEE DRUGS AND 

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.565
VIOLENCE AMONG OUR NATIVE 
PEOPLE.

00:53:55.044 --> 00:53:57.780
THERE ARE A LOT OF BRIGHT, 
TALENTED FOLKS.

00:53:58.077 --> 00:54:03.138
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT GOING.
BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY IS 

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.180
THIS INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

00:54:09.693 --> 00:54:12.423
POTTERY, FOR EXAMPLE, OR

00:54:15.445 --> 00:54:17.764
 DANCE 
OF THE DIABLOS.

00:54:19.786 --> 00:54:26.506
CELEBRATE OUR SPIRIT AS INDIOS 
AND SPIRIT IN OUR HEARTS AND 

00:54:26.507 --> 00:54:30.003
WE DANCED TO THE BEAUTY OF OUR 
PEOPLE, AND THE BEAUTY OF OUR 

00:54:30.004 --> 00:54:32.004
FUTURE, AND THE FUTURE OF OUR 
SOULS.

00:54:32.063 --> 00:54:37.783
YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.
AND OUR MUSIC TO ME, HAS 

00:54:37.784 --> 00:54:42.939
REALLY HIT OUR HEARTS BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT SOPHISTICATED.

00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:49.999
IT REALLY HITS OUR HEARTS THE 
WAY, IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:54:50.404 --> 00:54:55.114
IT REALLY BRINGS A SENSE OF 
COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND IT'S SO 

00:54:55.115 --> 00:54:59.102
BEAUTIFUL.
AND ALSO OUR SENSE OF 

00:54:59.103 --> 00:55:01.103
ORGANIZATION

00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:06.861
.
THESE FOLKS ARE THE MOST 

00:55:06.862 --> 00:55:10.003
ORGANIZED PEOPLE AMONG THE 
LATINO PEOPLE.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.240
AND IT'S BECAUSE IN OUR OWN 
HOMELAND WE'RE NOT UNITED BUT 

00:55:14.241 --> 00:55:16.873
WE COME HERE AND WE'RE BEING 
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

00:55:17.076 --> 00:55:23.234
YOU KNOW, IN OUR PLACE, IN MAD
MADERA COUNTY, JUST NORTH OF 

00:55:23.235 --> 00:55:28.485
FRESNO COUNTY.
OUTSIDE OF MEXICO.

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:38.285
AND THERE, YOU KNOW, ALWAYS OF 
MEXECOS, WHERE DO WE GET OUR 

00:55:38.286 --> 00:55:42.937
GREEN, RIGHT?
THE GOOD STUFF?

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.970
IT'S FROM

00:55:49.076 --> 00:55:51.192
 THE MARKET.
SUNDAY.

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:56.093
WHEN WE DON'T WORK.
SO WHAT DO THEY DO?

00:55:56.136 --> 00:56:02.018
THEY CHARGE $1 EVERY HEAD.
I DON'T SEE PEOPLE, GOING TO 

00:56:02.019 --> 00:56:06.453
THE GIANT OR WHATEVER.
ANY KIND OF GROCERY STORES.

00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:10.002
AND HAVING TO PAY TO GET IN.
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF EXPLOIT

00:56:10.408 --> 00:56:13.752
EXPLOITATION WE CAN TAKE.
SO I SEE, THERE ARE A LOT WE 

00:56:13.753 --> 00:56:18.191
NEED TO PRESERVE AS INDIOS AND 
ALSO OUR IDENTITY.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.329
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 
THINGS MY FATHER INSTILLED ON 

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:25.270
US AS A FAMILY.
WE SHOULD BE PROUD TO BE INDIO

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.643
INDIOS, TO HAVE A RICH HISTORY
HISTORY, A RICH TRADITION AND 

00:56:29.644 --> 00:56:34.373
IT'S A LOT FOR US TO CONFIGURE 
TO THIS COMMUNITY TO MAKE 

00:56:34.374 --> 00:56:36.374
AMERICA, EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT 
IT IS.

00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:39.124
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT I SEE.

00:56:42.752 --> 00:56:46.700
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT TRADITION IS 
A SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:50.060
SO WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT TO 
CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 

00:56:50.061 --> 00:56:53.873
BENEFICIAL TO SAY LIKE WOMEN],
WOMEN],THEN WE HAVE THE POWER 

00:56:53.874 --> 00:56:59.732
TO DO THAT.
THE COMMUNIDAD.

00:57:00.233 --> 00:57:02.896
THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO 
CHANGE IT

00:57:07.409 --> 00:57:09.043
 THERE'S A BALANCE IN 
TRADITIONS, WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:09.044 --> 00:57:11.953
EXAMPLE, MY DAD BELIEVED VERY 
STRONGLY IN DOING CERTAIN 

00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:17.014
THINGS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES, 
YOU KNOW, HE LEFT WHEN I WAS 

00:57:17.015 --> 00:57:20.075
11.
I GREW UP IN BOYLE HEIGHTS, 

00:57:20.076 --> 00:57:21.971
EAST L.A.
WHEN HE LEFT, BEFORE HE LEFT, 

00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:25.823
HE DIDN'T ALLOW ENGLISH IN THE 
HOUSE WHATSOEVER.

00:57:25.877 --> 00:57:27.232
THAT WAS THE TRADITION OF THE 
HOME.

00:57:27.233 --> 00:57:28.755
NO ENGLISH.
NOTHING HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

00:57:28.756 --> 00:57:34.100
UNDERSTAND.
WHEN HE LEFT, YOU KNOW, MUSIC 

00:57:34.101 --> 00:57:36.101
AND ENGLISH

00:57:37.129 --> 00:57:40.360
 ROCK 'N' ROLL, R&amp;B 
STARTED COMING UP INTO THE 

00:57:40.362 --> 00:57:42.075
HOUSE.
SO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE, THE 

00:57:42.076 --> 00:57:45.329
MAN WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE, SO 
MY MOM WAS LIKE, YEAH, SURE, 

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.158
GO AHEAD.
LISTEN TO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:50.048
SO WE WERE LIKE, YEAH!

00:58:00.365 --> 00:58:04.204
WHEN I THINK OF CULTURES, DEEP
DEEP, TRADITIONAL CULTURES  

00:58:04.207 --> 00:58:06.533
AND OTHERS.
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO 

00:58:06.534 --> 00:58:09.520
HAVE, WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY 
DAD, I THINK IT'S AUTOS GREAT 

00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:12.295
THAT HE DIDN'T ALLOW ENGLISH 
IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE I WAS 

00:58:12.297 --> 00:58:15.330
ABLE TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE TO 
A CERTAIN EXTENT IN A WAY THAT 

00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:18.263
WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME 
LATER N TERMS OF EXPRESSION 

00:58:18.264 --> 00:58:20.998
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS, BUT 
IN TERMS OF ALLOWING NEW 

00:58:20.999 --> 00:58:23.533
SOUNDS, REALLY OPENED MY EYES  
TO OTHER THINGS AS WELL.

00:58:23.568 --> 00:58:26.532
BUT TO HAVE THE BALANCE OF 
PEOPLE IN EVERY TRADITION.

00:58:26.867 --> 00:58:30.718
THE DIE-HARDS THAT JUST WANT 
TO KEEP IT, THEY BELIEVE THAT 

00:58:30.719 --> 00:58:34.451
TRADITION IS NONSTATIC, THAT 
YOU JUST NEED TO KEEP CERTAIN 

00:58:34.452 --> 00:58:36.170
TRADITIONS.
AND HAVE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY 

00:58:36.171 --> 00:58:38.703
SAY LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, 
TRADITION NEEDS  TO CHANGE.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:41.843
TRADITION IS FLUID FOR THIS 
AND IT IS EVER CHARGING.

00:58:42.034 --> 00:58:43.656
I THINK I BELIEVE BOTH OF 
THOSE.

00:58:43.657 --> 00:58:47.194
WE NEED THOSE TWO.
LIVES.

00:58:47.388 --> 00:58:49.721
YES, NO,.
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:49.751 --> 00:58:51.641
YOU KNOW, WE NEED THAT BALANCE
BALANCE, AND SOME OF THE 

00:58:51.642 --> 00:58:53.642
THINGS WE REALLY NEED TO 
CHANGE.

00:58:55.175 --> 00:58:59.320
BUT I THINK EVERY PERSON PLAY 
ACE ROLE.

00:59:05.676 --> 00:59:08.718
&gt;&gt; IT'S AN INTERESTING THING 
ABOUT TRADITION, ISN'T IT?

00:59:08.749 --> 00:59:13.767
EVERYONE IS A VIBRANT HUMAN 
BEING AND EVERY GROUP HAS A 

00:59:13.768 --> 00:59:18.306
VIBRANT LIFE AND EVERY CULTURE 
IS A VIBRANT, LIVING, 

00:59:18.307 --> 00:59:21.347
BEAUTIFUL, HAS A BEAUTIFUL 
SYSTEM OF DOING ALL THESE 

00:59:21.348 --> 00:59:25.282
THINGS.
WHAT HAPPENS IS, WE PUT POWER 

00:59:25.283 --> 00:59:28.724
INTO THE PICTURE.
WE PUT A DROP OF POWER OR A 

00:59:28.725 --> 00:59:32.553
GALLON OF POWER, THEN ONE 
GROUP BECOMES TRADITIONAL AND 

00:59:32.554 --> 00:59:35.324
OTHER GROUP BECOMES MODERN.

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:54.160
LIFE TAKEN, AND USED 
COMMERCIALLY AND THAT GROUP, 

00:59:54.161 --> 00:59:57.487
SOMEHOW THROUGH VARIOUS 
PROCESSES, IS KIND OF KEPT AT 

00:59:57.488 --> 00:59:59.909
THE MARGIN.
SO THAT'S WHEN WE RUN INTO 

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:08.896
PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW, BUT WE 
HAVE INDIAN WOMEN'S WEAVING 

01:00:08.898 --> 01:00:10.898
AND

01:00:13.266 --> 01:00:17.868
 PLACES FOR WOMEN OR 
APPAREL W WEAVING AND PATTERNS

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:19.881
PATTERNS.

01:00:21.337 --> 01:00:23.242
COMMERCIALLY YOU REALLY STEP 
INTO THE CULTURE AND YOU 

01:00:23.243 --> 01:00:26.877
REALLY LOOK.
IT'S KIND OF JUST BEEN 

01:00:26.878 --> 01:00:30.020
MARKETED.
REALLY, WITHOUT ANY DEEP 

01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:32.042
NOTIONS OF IT

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:44.660
 THERE ARE A 
NUMBER OF CORPORATE DISPLAYS 

01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:49.700
AND CLASS 1 AND THE GROUP OF 
WHERE THE MATERIAL COMES FROM, 

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.946
IS KEPT AT BAY.
IT'S KEPT ON THE SIDE AND ON 

01:00:52.947 --> 01:00:55.472
THE OUTSIDE.
WHEN IN FACT F YOU LOOK AT 

01:00:55.473 --> 01:01:01.629
THOSE PATTERNS, AND MIN 
TERRITORY, PERHAPS WEAVING 

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:05.577
TRADITION, ARE THOSE SYMBOLS, 
COLORS, AND PATTERNS, HAVE 

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:08.502
MANY DEEP STORIES CONNECTED TO 
THEM.

01:01:08.703 --> 01:01:14.161
AND THEY'RE KIND OF STORIES OF 
THE CREATION, AND STORY OF A 

01:01:14.162 --> 01:01:19.927
VILLAGE, AND THE WEAVER, SO 
THAT'S WHAT GETS CRITICAL WHEN 

01:01:19.928 --> 01:01:24.264
I LOOK INTO IT, WHEN I THINK 
ABOUT IT.

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:27.002
ONE GROUP HAS APOLOGIZE, AND 
THE OTHER GROUP DOESN'T.

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:31.655
AND THEN THE OTHER GROUP USES 
THOSE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, 

01:01:31.656 --> 01:01:35.188
TRADITIONS  TO KIND OF DISPLAY 
ITSELF AS A CULTURAL, 

01:01:35.189 --> 01:01:42.470
DEMOCRATIC OR PLURAL GROUP AND 
YET THE RESOURCES ARE REALLY 

01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:45.613
GOING TO THE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, 
TRADITIONS ARE ROOTED IN.

01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:51.159
SO THAT'S WHAT GETS ME.
BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TRADITION

01:01:51.369 --> 01:01:56.647
TRADITION.
AND YET, SOMEHOW, VARIOUS 

01:01:56.648 --> 01:01:59.642
GROUPS AT TIMES, WE DON'T HAVE 
ANYMORE TRADITIONS.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.176
WE'RE KIND OF MODERN NOW, AND 
WE'RE JUST KIND OF BEING 

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:06.427
OURSELVES, AND BEING A HUMAN 
BEING.

01:02:06.724 --> 01:02:11.278
WEARING MATERIALS AND ITEMS 
AND PIXELS, AND THE OTHER 

01:02:11.279 --> 01:02:19.343
GROUP IS CHEWING CORN AND 
BURNING YERBA AND WE HAVE TO 

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:24.311
RESPECT THE RERBA AND THE 
BURNING.

01:02:27.128 --> 01:02:31.159
FOR ME, IT'S THE MOST 
IMPORTANT TO CREATE UNITY AND 

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160
TO HAVE KIND OF A DEEPER

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.583
TO OPEN THE FLOW OF THE 
RESOURCES, AND LET DEEP 

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:44.201
KNOWLEDGE FLOW FROM ALL 
PEOPLES, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE 

01:02:44.202 --> 01:02:48.252
THAT WE THINK HAVE TRADITIONS, 
WHICH THEY DO, BUT NOT IN A 

01:02:48.253 --> 01:02:50.253
CORPORATE

01:02:51.406 --> 01:02:53.406
 MANNER,

01:02:55.516 --> 01:02:57.647
 BRUIN A 
VIBRANT, EVOLVING MANNER.

01:02:58.446 --> 01:03:00.660
TO THIS DAY, WE HAVE KEPT EACH 
OTHER APART AND WE HAVE PUSHED

01:03:01.164 --> 01:03:05.503
PUSHED, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
OUR BEAUTIFUL INDIGENOUS 

01:03:05.504 --> 01:03:11.457
GROUPS, TO THE OUTSIDE AND 
FEEL THAT WE ARE ON THE INSIDE

01:03:11.466 --> 01:03:14.188
INSIDE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE ON 

01:03:14.189 --> 01:03:16.246
THE OUTSIDE.

01:03:24.877 --> 01:03:28.420
I THINK IT'S ONE THING THAT 
JUAN FELIPE HERRERA AND 

01:03:28.421 --> 01:03:32.568
EVERYBODY AND THAT LATINO 
CULTURE IN GENERAL IS SEEKING  

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:36.201
TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND.
AS PART OF THIS, OUR PROGRAM 

01:03:36.202 --> 01:03:40.018
IS RUNNING DOWN, BUT DOWN, BUT 
PIED LIKE 

01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:43.481
JUAN TO READ A POEM, WHICH WAS 
ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY STUDENTS 

01:03:43.482 --> 01:03:51.889
AT FIRST AND THEN WRITTEN AS 
PART OF JUAN FILIPE'S WORLD'S 

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.097
LONGEST POEM PROJECT, WHICH IS 
ONE OF THE POST LAUREATE 

01:03:54.098 --> 01:03:58.139
PROJECTS, THAT'S BEEN GOING ON 
AND SO IF JUAN FELIPE HERRERA, 

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.264
IN ORDER TO CLOSE THIS OUT 
THIS EVEN AND IN ORDER TO 

01:04:01.265 --> 01:04:05.848
SHARE BOTH YOUR WORDS, AND THE 
WORDS OF OTHERS, BRINGING 

01:04:05.849 --> 01:04:07.631
DIFFERENT VOICES AND MULTIPLE 
CHOICES TOGETHER.

01:04:07.632 --> 01:04:09.167
IF YOU WOULD PLEASE SHARE THAT 
WITH US.

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:13.796
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL, YOU 
KNOW, EVERYONE THAT'S HERE 

01:04:13.797 --> 01:04:18.698
RIGHT NOW, JUST BY HANGING OUT 
AND SAYING HELLO AGAIN.

01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:28.846
WHAT ABOUT YOU, WELL, I JUST 
GOT THIS GUITAR RECENTLY.

01:04:29.061 --> 01:04:33.295
REMEMBER THE RADIO?
YEAH, WHY DON'T WE GET BACK 

01:04:33.296 --> 01:04:37.544
INTO IT, YOU KNOW.
LET'S WRITE A SONG TOGETHER.

01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:42.593
SO YOU SEE, THAT'S HOW TO DO 
IT, DON'T YOU THINK?

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.625
YEAH.
THAT'S HOW WE CAN DO IT.

01:04:46.248 --> 01:04:48.849
YEAH.
IT'S ART AND CREATIVITY ARE 

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:50.955
OPEN DOORS.

01:04:55.598 --> 01:04:57.598
THEY'RE A COLLECTIVE

01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:01.555
 PRISM OF 
OPEN DOORS.

01:05:01.556 --> 01:05:03.556
WE GET INSPIREED AND WE WANT TO 
CLAP.

01:05:03.576 --> 01:05:06.613
THAT'S THE IDEA AND THAT'S 
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:11.470
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS, I WENT TO 
WYOMING, TO JACKSONVILLE, 

01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:16.217
WYOMING AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL 
NIGHT WITH COMMUNITIES THERE, 

01:05:16.218 --> 01:05:19.505
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF 
BEAUTIFUL WORK WITH THE 

01:05:19.506 --> 01:05:23.917
MIGRANT STUDENTS AND IN THE 
HIGH SCHOOLS, AND THE JUNIOR 

01:05:23.918 --> 01:05:27.232
HIGH SCHOOLS.
SO I WITHIN INTO THE MIDDLE 

01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:31.117
SCHOOL, AND TO THE 8TH GRADE 
CLASS.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:35.220
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, L HOW ARE 
YOU?

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:39.562
AND THEN THE STUDENT SAID, 
WELL, JUAN FILIPE, WE SAW THAT 

01:05:39.563 --> 01:05:41.074
YOU HAD A POEM.
OH.

01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:43.915
VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

01:05:43.961 --> 01:05:50.778
AND WE NOTICE THAT YOU WROTE A 
POEM CALLED EVERY DAY WE GET 

01:05:50.779 --> 01:05:53.951
MORE ILLEGAL.
REALLY?

01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:59.179
IS THAT THE POEM YOU'RE 
TALKING WITH? ABOUT?

01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:01.079
OKAY.
IT'S A REALLY GOOD POEM.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.034
BUT YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF RE
REWROTE IT FOR YOU.

01:06:06.048 --> 01:06:08.048
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.990
I THINK I'M GOING TO SIT DOWN 
NOW, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

01:06:21.097 --> 01:06:24.318
THIS IS IT.
AND I'M TELLING YOU, IT IS.

01:06:25.033 --> 01:06:27.965
A MUCH BETTER PIECE.
IT IS.

01:06:28.765 --> 01:06:35.937
THE NAME OF THE POEM IS "EVERY 
DAY WE GET MORE ILLEGAL."

01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:40.281
LEFT FOR AMERICAA ON PLANE, 
BUSES, ADVANCE, THEY SAID.

01:06:41.295 --> 01:06:43.726
I REMEMBER.
UNDER THE SILVER DARKNESS, IT 

01:06:43.727 --> 01:06:48.581
IS ALL IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT.
I IMAGINE GOING THROUGH A 

01:06:48.582 --> 01:06:53.529
TUNNEL, TO A BETTER LIFE, 
BUILT BY A FUTURE, YET, YOU 

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.865
STAY BROKEN.
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY PARENTS IN 9 

01:06:55.866 --> 01:06:57.873
YEARS.
MY MOM SAID.

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:04.631

RARE VISITS FOR THE LUCKY ONCE

01:07:08.992 --> 01:07:11.959
ONCE.
EXPIRED VISA, BOARDS AT DIVIDE 

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:16.968
MEANS THEY WON'T COME ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW HALF OF WHO I AM 

01:07:16.969 --> 01:07:18.969
MISSING.

01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:25.764
MY DAD'S THANK YOU RANCH LA, 
MY MOM'S TURTLE.

01:07:25.883 --> 01:07:29.908

SO THIS NEXT SONG IS ABOUT 

01:36:41.953 --> 01:36:46.432
STRUGGLE, AND THE STRUGGLE WE 
SAW IN MEXICO, AFTER SEEING A 

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.733
CHILD BE A FIRE BREATHER ON 
THE STREETS FOR CHANGE.

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:52.783
IT WASN'T BECAUSE HE WAS PART 
OF SOME PRESTIGIOUS CIRCUS, 

01:36:52.786 --> 01:36:56.926
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO 
MAKE A LIVING FOR HE AND HIS 

01:36:56.927 --> 01:37:00.263
FAMILY AND IT WAS ONE OF THE 
SADDEST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN, 

01:37:00.264 --> 01:37:03.812
AND THIS SONG WAS WRITTEN AS A 
RESULT OF THAT.

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.634
[MUSIC]

01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:36.782

 Si pasas por el rosal
 Cuidado con las espinas

 No te vayas a espinar
 Porque la sangre lastima

01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:49.830
 Sin poderlo remediar

01:43:59.052 --> 01:44:01.052
 Ay de mi Llorona

 Es que no te supe amar

01:46:33.579 --> 01:46:35.579
 Ahora empiezo a caminar

01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:39.103

HERE WE GO.
¶

01:52:42.748 --> 01:52:44.458
 People asking “Why?”
 Mother’s crying, “Cry”

01:52:44.459 --> 01:52:46.561
 Authorities building lies
 It's a critical time

01:52:46.566 --> 01:52:48.655
 Books and faces, faces in books
 Where the truth weathers

01:52:48.659 --> 01:52:51.203
Through moving pictures
 Recording deaths that spark

01:52:51.206 --> 01:52:54.344
 A million man march
 It is no coincidence

01:52:54.348 --> 01:52:56.348
 The collective skin tone of the

01:53:01.895 --> 01:53:05.558
innocent
 Sparks in all of us

01:53:05.561 --> 01:53:10.276
 A discontent
 Initiating those

01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:12.281
 Who were once reticent
 Moment in time

01:53:36.834 --> 01:53:38.200
 People asking “Why?”
 Mother’s crying, “Cry”

01:53:38.201 --> 01:53:40.201
 Authorities building lies
 It's a critical time

01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:49.269
 Moment in time
 Times of the moment

01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:51.368
 Riots, Patrolmen
 People and Showmen

01:53:51.372 --> 01:53:55.112
 Chanting soon dissipates
 As infiltrates instigate

01:53:55.115 --> 01:53:57.115
 People disperse
 As the suffering

01:54:14.288 --> 01:54:16.067
 The Media soon mitigates
 Sparks in all of us a

01:54:16.068 --> 01:54:18.068
discontent
 Initiating those who were once

01:54:22.475 --> 01:54:24.475
reticent
 How do you harness the energy

01:54:25.863 --> 01:54:27.863
of the march?

01:54:29.988 --> 01:54:32.147
 How do you instill the momentum
given the dark?

01:54:32.152 --> 01:54:34.152
 Beyond the picket, the boycott
 and the trend that will soon be

01:54:34.432 --> 01:54:36.432
abated
 That all of these deaths are

01:54:37.346 --> 01:54:39.147
interrelated
 Ferguson, Emmett, Guerrero and

01:54:39.148 --> 01:54:40.474
Brown
 How do we initiate our people

01:54:40.475 --> 01:54:42.475
to
 The Eternal Get Down?

01:54:54.575 --> 01:54:56.012
para sanar
 Critical Time

01:54:56.013 --> 01:54:58.206
 People asking “Why?”
 Mother’s crying, “Cry”

01:54:58.210 --> 01:55:00.210
 Authorities building lies
 It's a critical time

01:55:13.166 --> 01:55:15.166
 It's a critical time

01:56:31.936 --> 01:56:39.611
WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY?
WE NEED TO FEEL, WE NEED TO

FLY.
WE NEED TO
