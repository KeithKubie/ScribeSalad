00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.969
(scratching)

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.138
(buzzer)

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.608
- Look, I hate to sound like
a click baity Jezebel article,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.444 align:start size:88% position:13%
but this is just
seasonal sexual assault.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.912
You shouldn't be
able to plant one

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.314
on an unsuspecting friend

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.182 align:start size:84% position:16%
wearing a particularly
perky sweater,

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.385
because the holidays.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.555 align:start size:97% position:3%
A piece of plant doesn't
make someone your ho, ho, ho.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.292
(scratching)

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.794
(buzzer)

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.697
A Charlie Brown Christmas
is horribly depressing.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.132
Bad animation.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.933
Obnoxious real kid voices,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.136 align:start size:81% position:19%
and a contemporary
jazz soundtrack

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.506
that goes well with a nice
mix of eggnog and Drano.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.241
It is best watched
when you're alone,

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.110
and you know things won't
get better anytime soon.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.513
And at the end, the kid
who clings to his blanket

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.481
starts yapping about Jesus.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.883
It's a Christmas special.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.885
I don't wanna hear about Jesus.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.853 align:start size:84% position:16%
The greatest
Christmas special is

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.755
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
Drunk ass bro
lives, misfit toys,

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
a dentist elf that looks
like Ellen DeGeneres.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.730 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Yukon Cornelius,
a broddy explorer

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.399
that also looks like
every Brooklyn drummer,

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.570 align:start size:94% position:6%
or just me without glasses
after CrossFit lessons.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:13.907
(scratching)

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.375
(buzzer)

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.410
Mariah Carey has three
things going for her

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.579
that make her better
than Whitney Houston.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.415 align:start size:97% position:3%
One, that cool whistley thing
she does with her voice.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.918
Two, the ability to
just revive a bath.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
And three, the fact that
she's the only person

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
to make a new Christmas song
that's an instant classic

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.691
in All I Want for
Christmas is You.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.094
Michael BublÃ©, Adam
Levine, Josh Grobin,

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.662 align:start size:84% position:16%
and every other
singer you don't get,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.363
but your mom wants to fuck,

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start size:97% position:3%
have attempted new Christmas
classics and failed.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.470
Many people can try-a, yet
no one's done it but Mariah.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.138
And no I'm not sure if
I should be more ashamed

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.507 align:start size:84% position:16%
that that rhymed,
or the bathtub joke.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.676
