Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.730
and today on our podcast we have four little stops we're going to make all

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.450
centered around that thing which none of us can avoid. That's coming for us all.

4
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:15.450
I'm talking of course about the big d. Well,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.580
we all know we're going to die except some of our science friends.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.430
Remember when we were at Harvard and we're talking to George Church,

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.353
George Church

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.680
<v 1>professors genetics at Harvard medical school.</v>

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.740
Are we doing this show about bioengineering?

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.830
Here's an example where we might grow up a large batch of of cells in a,

11
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:34.990
in a fermentor.

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.530
<v 0>Yeah. George Church was the guy who was trying to use a little bacteria to make</v>

13
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.310
gasoline a couple of liters. He is manipulating lives. Right?

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.080
He also flirts around with the idea of eliminating

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.600
<v 1>the concept of death. I think. I think we,</v>

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.760
I think I disagree that there is a quantum leap between living and nonliving.

17
00:00:55.761 --> 00:01:00.020
I think there's a continuum between non-living and living and you can create all

18
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:03.990
sorts of, wait, wait. At some point, if I were to shoot you in the head. Yeah.

19
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.520
And you would fall on the floor with a hole in your head and bleed.

20
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:09.220
And I have no nurse or no doctor help you at some point,

21
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.680
good state will have changed fundamentally.

22
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.260
You'll stop breathing and you'll be over. Um, but I won't necessarily, yes,

23
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.094
you will be dead.

24
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm saying that depending on the probability of a doctor coming into the room

25
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:27.170
and fixing me on the probability of more advanced technology and being able to

26
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:30.230
reverse the all kinds of pathological damage,

27
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.270
there's a value to saying that,

28
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.700
that there is a continuum between life and death.

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.140
And I can give you the continuum,

30
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.360
but I'm also thinking there will be a certain point in which you are

31
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:42.300
unmistakably over with current technology, uh,

32
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.440
but not necessarily with future technology. And, and there,

33
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.310
there may be you're saying that it is possible that you can never be totally

34
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:51.900
dead. That that might be a reversible state at some point. Well,

35
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.390
if we recorded the position,

36
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:58.030
all my atoms and we could recreate those position of all those Adams, uh,

37
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.100
you could completely burn me into Adams and then reassemble and isn't the,

38
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.270
isn't there? Isn't at the end, I'm alive again. I, yes,

39
00:02:08.271 --> 00:02:12.800
I suppose in the conceptual, if you get to be really, really, really clever,

40
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.930
I guess you could re re reverse everything,

41
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.890
but maybe we could never get that clever or do you think that that, I mean,

42
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.310
I just, I, I think it's gonna boil down to cost. You know,

43
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.670
the idea of death implies that there is a sharp point at which you,

44
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.310
a point of no return. And I'm seeing this gets,

45
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:36.190
gets harder and harder and harder, um, and possible.

46
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.330
And I don't see that as particularly impossible. I mean,

47
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.540
if you've recorded the state of the living thing before it,

48
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.810
it starts going into this impossible decay.

49
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.160
If you just start from scratch and you build it from scratch,

50
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.180
nothing is really completely lost and nothing is completely gained.

51
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.330
The main thing that is retained through all this is the information

52
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.360
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

53
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 1>and George Church thinks that being alive</v>

54
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.030
<v 2>is having all that information. So Jen,</v>

55
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.370
if I knew where all your atoms are right now, you could always come back.

56
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.870
That's his view back.

57
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.490
That terrible thought for you, isn't it?

58
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.030
<v 3>For my taste. There's a much more pleasant way to think about it. That's that.</v>

59
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.260
Um, the other way to think about it is to think like Burt Heinrich,

60
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.160
a professor at the University of Vermont who got a curious letter and,

61
00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:34.700
and a wonderful letter I think from a student of his named bill.

62
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.740
<v 4>He was a grad student in entomology at UC Berkeley when I was teaching there.</v>

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.620
And uh, he came out and, and visited at the camp in Maine.

64
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.230
<v 3>Burn you see, has a cabin in, in,</v>

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.630
in the western part of me and up on top of a mountain.

66
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:52.650
It's actually very beautiful set in the woods, a spruce and pine bill.

67
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:56.010
The Grad student did spend some time there and then he moved back to southern

68
00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:00.120
California in a few years passed. And then this letter arrived.

69
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.780
Did you have any sense that there was anything wrong before you got the letter?

70
00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:04.614
Or was this out of the

71
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.140
<v 4>no, no, I had no sense whatsoever. No,</v>

72
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.230
he was feeling hardy and then I got that letter.

73
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.500
<v 3>So here's how the letter went. It begins. Yo Bernd.</v>

74
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.880
I have been diagnosed with a severe illness and I'm trying to get my final

75
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:20.730
disposition arranged in case I drop sooner than I hoped.

76
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.900
I want an Abbey burial. This phrase,

77
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.010
happy burial refers to a guy named Edward Abbey who was a very,

78
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:34.011
very famous ecologist and who was brought into the desert by his best friends in

79
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:38.310
a sleeping bag when after he died and just put in the ground, no embalming,

80
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.480
no coffin,

81
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.470
lightly covered with sand and that's where they left him.

82
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.400
That is what bill wanted to have happen. Anyhow,

83
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:51.600
the upshot is he wrote one of the options is burial on private property.

84
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.100
What are your thoughts on having an old friend as a permanent resident at the

85
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:59.850
camp signed bill? In other words,

86
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.730
build wanted it to be laid out on the ground,

87
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:06.390
not even under the ground at burns place in Maine.

88
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.890
<v 4>I wrote him a, I think a, I don't think I would,</v>

89
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.720
I would want to have him laid out in front of my camp in Maine. I think that's,

90
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.470
uh, although, you know, uh, if it was a wilderness where, you know,

91
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.070
people are not going to be walking around, uh, then, uh, you know, I,

92
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:25.320
I would think more favorably of it.

93
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.680
I think right now I don't think we want to have carcasses lying around in the

94
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:30.450
woods. You know, I definitely don't think that,

95
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.420
<v 3>but he did write bill this, he wrote,</v>

96
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.210
I read you loud and clear when it's my turn. I too want no less for myself.

97
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.790
A casket would be for you as it was for Edward Abby,

98
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:45.791
an unacceptable cage for otherwise free and ever recycling molecules that would

99
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:50.000
soon become incorporated into the earth's ecosystem.

100
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.320
<v 4>You know, I, I agree with the idea. I just feel that, you know,</v>

101
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:59.321
being sealed up on totally removed all the natural processes that normally occur

102
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:04.760
with every animal on earth is very somehow frightening.

103
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.060
It's seems unnatural and I dunno, it just a,

104
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.740
<v 5>it's funny that you'd use the word frightening.</v>

105
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.860
I think most people lock themselves up in the casket because they're frightened

106
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:15.820
to be munched on by worms and beetles and things.

107
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.840
<v 4>Yeah, no, I don't. I don't find that frightening at all.</v>

108
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.930
I find that comforting to be part of the ecosystem, to be compost into grass,

109
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.680
to be compost into Ravens Doobie,

110
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.690
compost into flowers and trees. You know that,

111
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.310
that's a comforting thought to me.

112
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.130
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

113
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.890
<v 6>that's the other way to think about it is that you're releasing yourself for the</v>

114
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:46.790
chance to be lots and lots and lots and lots of different do and more beautiful

115
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.330
lives that will succeed you, which I don't know. Wait, wait, wait.

116
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.100
I would say that if I could become plants,

117
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.600
new animals, what would that make you swoon? No,

118
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.450
it would make me feel like I'm like, I'm a collection of molecules.

119
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:05.330
I'm here for a season, 60 70 80 years, whatever,

120
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:09.470
and then I let my molecules go,

121
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.640
I disappear and the molecules go on to new adventures. Yeah, but that,

122
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.200
but then you're gone. You're gone. You're lost. Well,

123
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.100
the unit was here for 60 70 80 years, whatever is suddenly not here anymore.

124
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:27.080
And there isn't that an absence is a vacancy. Don't you feel that? I mean,

125
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.750
I love for the beetles and the things in the everyone to be

126
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.270
<v 0>together again, but there is also the sense that when you disappear,</v>

127
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.350
you're gone. You're done. I mean,

128
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.920
I understand on some level what George Church was saying to you. I mean, why,

129
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:41.150
if you've got the technology,

130
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480
would you want to lose something so precious as a friend or a family member or a

131
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:49.580
lover or something or a cohost when you,

132
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.790
when you can bring that person back and, and you know what?

133
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.640
Forget us because it gets kind of egocentric when you're talking about bringing

134
00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:00.410
yourself back. What about collections of ideas that are lost forever?

135
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.480
Like a language? I think the status,

136
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:07.481
like one language disappears every 14 days disappears from the earth never to be

137
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:12.170
spoken again because the last speaker of that language dies and then decomposes

138
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.610
and is eaten by the Beatles according to your fantasy. Well,

139
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.530
how would you be coped with them? Well, who knows, but we were talking to a guy,

140
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.260
David Eagleman, he's a neuroscientists.

141
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.720
I don't know what a neuroscientist would usually know about such things,

142
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:28.640
but he mentioned this thought experiment that has to do with lost language.

143
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.980
<v 5>For example, nobody knows what Latin sounds like, right?</v>

144
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:35.980
It's dead because all the people who spoke Latin,

145
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.530
there weren't tape recorders around when they were doing it.

146
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.430
And so essentially we all say, all right, that's, that's uh, it's dead.

147
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.293
It's gone.

148
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.690
But it turns out somebody made a proposal that probably wouldn't work,

149
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:50.250
but it was so stunning in its creativity, uh,

150
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.350
that I thought it was very interesting, which is he said, look,

151
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.150
sometimes these Roman pottery, if you can imagine these, uh,

152
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.520
wheels that turn these pottery wheels and you have a little stylists against the

153
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.050
piece of pottery, um, to make the line that spirals down.

154
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.100
He said, if there were people talking in the room while that was happening,

155
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.510
there might be micro vibrations that caused this stylist to move in and out.

156
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.560
And as a result, it essentially could act like a record.

157
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.640
And if you could play it back from these pieces of Roman pottery,

158
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.920
you could actually hear the people in the room talking in Latin. Ha,

159
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.690
<v 7>well, fuck no.</v>

160
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 5>Well, you could play a vase like a, like an LP, and then here like, um,</v>

161
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.200
[inaudible] you know, the, the potter, you could hear his voice precisely.

162
00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:43.220
Now the thing is it probably won't work exactly like that.

163
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.230
But what's interesting about the idea is that we're constantly coming up with

164
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:52.130
new technologies where then we can retrieve things that we once thought were

165
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:56.570
dead. [inaudible] W W in other words,

166
00:09:56.571 --> 00:09:59.510
we thought the information sort of scattered off into the universe.

167
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.310
And then we're finding with the new technology,

168
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:09.230
we're able to bring it all back together. [inaudible] what was that?

169
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.210
We, those are, those are dead languages coming back. I don't know what that is.

170
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.090
It would probably [inaudible] for all those languages that were disappearing.

171
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.700
That's the Richard Gesture.

172
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.610
I was trying to evoke the sense of languages returning from the Cosmos and

173
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.370
brilliantly done brilliantly by all right. Smart Guy. You know,

174
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.080
if you want to stand for the proposition as you were earlier, that uh, you,

175
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.910
you'd be happy to decompose and become part of Mother Nature again in my time.

176
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.990
Well, that's what I was gonna ask you.

177
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.410
What if you had the choice right now to persist or let,

178
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:44.990
I don't know. I can't, obviously. We'll, okay.

179
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:49.670
Then let's end with a sort of owed to the persisters and this one comes from our

180
00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:50.630
producer Ellen Horne,

181
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.600
<v 0>so everybody's going to count them out. Okay. Set the scene for me.</v>

182
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:55.480
Where are we? Well, we're,

183
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.640
we're near Wall Street and Manhattan and this is a CPR class.

184
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:04.080
It's a Sunday afternoon. Okay. Everybody ready? There's about 25 students here

185
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.600
and everyone's sort of basically pressing on dummies. Is that what's happening?

186
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.470
Yeah,

187
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.470
they crest in the middle of the chest 30 times 30 and then they tip the

188
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.690
mannequins head back can lift good and blow into the mouth twice.

189
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.610
But here's the central problem with doing CPR really well. It's the tempo.

190
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:35.570
You need to get the tempo right. If you do it too slow,

191
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.070
you don't get up enough pressure up to get the blood moving around the body.

192
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.930
And if you do it too fast, then the heart doesn't have time to fill back up.

193
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.730
And what's the ideal speed?

194
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.810
This hundred

195
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.643
<v 8>beats per minute</v>

196
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 0>and this class, the class, it's just learning CPR. It's hard to hear.</v>

197
00:11:58.841 --> 00:11:59.830
But if you listen

198
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:05.993
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

199
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.130
<v 0>just a little bit too fast.</v>

200
00:12:08.131 --> 00:12:10.560
And how exactly do you get people to do a hundred beats per minute?

201
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.640
That seems like abstract or something? Well, it's been shown,

202
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.620
if you ask people to think of a song,

203
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.520
they always remember it at the right tempo. Really. There's this guy,

204
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.700
Alison and Knob,

205
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.500
<v 9>I'm a pediatric emergency medicine physician in Honolulu, Hawaii</v>

206
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.760
<v 0>teach a CPR. And he was trying to figure out a good way</v>

207
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.650
<v 9>to remember what a hundred compressions a minute should feel like when you're</v>

208
00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:34.860
doing CPR. So I thought find a song,

209
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:39.120
a popular song that had a beat of approximately a hundred beats per minute.

210
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.210
<v 0>So what's the song on the song? He came up with,</v>

211
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.293
<v 8>uh,</v>

212
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.580
help people stay alive.

213
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.910
<v 5>Wow. And they did this, the class you went to,</v>

214
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.360
this is caught fire CPR classes all over the world.

215
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.770
<v 9>Egypt, Argentina, Botswana in Japan.</v>

216
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.510
<v 0>Using this to teach the right tempo of CPR</v>

217
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.710
<v 9>just happened to stumble upon it. And uh, it was a,</v>

218
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.260
I think one of the best teaching tips I came up with in my career. So

219
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.120
<v 5>there is another song though that's has a much simpler,</v>

220
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.030
more direct downbeat, same tempo, same tempo.

221
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.240
And I asked the class to try this song

222
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.253
queen

223
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.640
another one bites the best. Oh, that's so wrong.

224
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.870
No one buys the dusty

225
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.823
[inaudible].

226
00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.790
<v 0>It's got a better beat in a way that then the death and it's certainly more</v>

227
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:04.700
friends. Yes. But we should, we should let this cast die.

228
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.770
And speaking of which,

229
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.480
just want to urge you before we close to support your public radio station,

230
00:14:11.481 --> 00:14:15.050
radio lobby's carried on more than 200 stations across the country.

231
00:14:15.051 --> 00:14:19.370
You can check radio lab.org to see if your station carries us. If they do,

232
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.990
even if they don't, please consider making a gift to support that station.

233
00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:26.810
Because without them, without you, we wouldn't exist.

234
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.980
<v 5>Di Don't want to sty.</v>

235
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.140
Radiolab is supported by the Sloan Foundation. Yes. Number One,

236
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.980
alphabet, peace loan. And number two, the National Science Foundation.

237
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.860
And number three, the corporation for public broadcasting.

238
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.880
I'm Jad Abumrad I rubber quote. Thanks for listening.
