intelligence I am skeptical about what

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
intelligence I am skeptical about what
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.509
intelligence I am skeptical about what
some of this intelligence is buying and

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519
some of this intelligence is buying and
 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.469

doing all right I'm skeptical right

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479
doing all right I'm skeptical right
 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.149
doing all right I'm skeptical right
intelligence in general is what you need

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159
intelligence in general is what you need
 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.340
intelligence in general is what you need
for defense or offense you need it for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
for defense or offense you need it for
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050

right intelligence you need to run a
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.609

great power strategy but I'd like to

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619
great power strategy but I'd like to
 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.959
great power strategy but I'd like to
unpack what it is we're doing a little

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969
unpack what it is we're doing a little
 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.910
unpack what it is we're doing a little
bit better and look at some of these

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
bit better and look at some of these
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.569
bit better and look at some of these
activities and ask is this really

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579
activities and ask is this really
 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.660
activities and ask is this really
necessary because my impression is we

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
necessary because my impression is we
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359
necessary because my impression is we
pretty much spy on everything given the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
pretty much spy on everything given the
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.459

really sorting out the legal

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
really sorting out the legal
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.060
really sorting out the legal
ramifications of it we collected vast

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
ramifications of it we collected vast
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.539
ramifications of it we collected vast
amounts of metadata stored it this is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
amounts of metadata stored it this is
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.669

spying on Americans right now we're

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679
spying on Americans right now we're
 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.169
spying on Americans right now we're
doing a little bit less of it now but

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179
doing a little bit less of it now but
 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.330
doing a little bit less of it now but
it's not very hard for an American who

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
it's not very hard for an American who
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.779
it's not very hard for an American who
has friends abroad to get caught up in

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789
has friends abroad to get caught up in
 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.310

surveillance right there's just a lot of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
surveillance right there's just a lot of
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.609

collection a lot of collection right and
 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.099
collection a lot of collection right and
a lot of this information is stored so

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109
a lot of this information is stored so
 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.919
a lot of this information is stored so
that if something happens the I see you

I'm a little uncomfortable with it I

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490
I'm a little uncomfortable with it I
 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.520
I'm a little uncomfortable with it I
have to say right but I don't think it's

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
have to say right but I don't think it's
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.860
have to say right but I don't think it's
an open-shut straightforward matter I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870
an open-shut straightforward matter I
 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.380
an open-shut straightforward matter I
think this is these things about the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390
think this is these things about the
 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.670
think this is these things about the
magnitude of the American intelligence

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
magnitude of the American intelligence
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.120
magnitude of the American intelligence
effort worldwide what the what that

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130
effort worldwide what the what that
 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.010
effort worldwide what the what that
effort is focusing on how much

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020
effort is focusing on how much
 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.500
effort is focusing on how much
information its ends up collecting at

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
information its ends up collecting at
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.980

right this is something that really

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520
right this is something that really
 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.460
right this is something that really
needs to be discussed because it I think

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470
needs to be discussed because it I think
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.840
needs to be discussed because it I think
it has something to do with American

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850
it has something to do with American
 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.340
it has something to do with American
liberties right and so you know this is

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350
liberties right and so you know this is
 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.020
liberties right and so you know this is
not particularly what I spend my days

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
not particularly what I spend my days
 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.650
not particularly what I spend my days
doing but I do have some I do feel

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
doing but I do have some I do feel
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.220
doing but I do have some I do feel
uneasy about it and and I I do tend to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230
uneasy about it and and I I do tend to
 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.800
uneasy about it and and I I do tend to
believe that the more active we are in

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810
believe that the more active we are in
 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.540
believe that the more active we are in
international politics the more this

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550
international politics the more this
 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.880
international politics the more this
machine grinds on the more we collect

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890
