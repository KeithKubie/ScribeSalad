00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.242
We covered a number of topics so far.

00:00:03.242 --> 00:00:05.990
But you'll see that all of
them have focused on problems

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.830
that we address in the context
of a single computer.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.830
Unfortunately, a single computer
is not very interesting by itself.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.100
It has to be connected to a network.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.670
And when we connect
computer to our networks,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.740
that brings in a whole bunch
of new security problems.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.860
That's where we're going to go on
to the second part of the course.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.370
We have a world-class
network security researcher

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.900
who's actually going to take you there.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.370
&gt;&gt; For part of this course,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.190
we're going to cover a number of
major topics in network security.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.950
We're going to start off with
malware and network defenses.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.042
Then we're going to move on topography,
security protocols, web security and

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.037
mobile security.
