being is such that it would be better if
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.750
being is such that it would be better if
it had never been and that's a very I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760
it had never been and that's a very I
 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.240

end that the answer to that can't be to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070
end that the answer to that can't be to
 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.410
end that the answer to that can't be to
produce more suffering

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
produce more suffering
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.990
produce more suffering
that just doesn't make sense and my

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
that just doesn't make sense and my
 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.120
that just doesn't make sense and my
observation has been that people who act

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130
observation has been that people who act
 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.550

out the Memphis to fillion philosophy
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.070
out the Memphis to fillion philosophy
inevitably makes suffering far worse and

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
inevitably makes suffering far worse and
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.260
inevitably makes suffering far worse and
so and then that raises the other

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270
so and then that raises the other
 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.200
so and then that raises the other
specter of well do they want being just

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210
specter of well do they want being just
 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.000
specter of well do they want being just
to cease or are they just out for bloody

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
to cease or are they just out for bloody
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.400
to cease or are they just out for bloody
revenge at every at any cost and my

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410
revenge at every at any cost and my
 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.230
revenge at every at any cost and my
conclusion has always been that is that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240
conclusion has always been that is that
 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.170
conclusion has always been that is that
the mask is well being shouldn't exist

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180
the mask is well being shouldn't exist
 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.210
the mask is well being shouldn't exist
because it's too terrible but the true

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
because it's too terrible but the true
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.800
because it's too terrible but the true
motivation is I'm gonna make everyone

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
motivation is I'm gonna make everyone
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.930
motivation is I'm gonna make everyone

I say goodbye to this place if you read
the writings of people like the kids who

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080
the writings of people like the kids who
 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.540
the writings of people like the kids who
showed up to call them by in high school

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550
showed up to call them by in high school
 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.400
showed up to call them by in high school
they'll tell you exactly that that's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410
they'll tell you exactly that that's
 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.560
they'll tell you exactly that that's
precisely and exactly what they

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570
precisely and exactly what they
 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.480
precisely and exactly what they
concluded and then act it out

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490
concluded and then act it out
 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.000
concluded and then act it out
so anyways but in this God says that it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010
so anyways but in this God says that it
 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.710
so anyways but in this God says that it
was good and I thought about that a lot

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
was good and I thought about that a lot
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.360
was good and I thought about that a lot
is like because the question is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370
is like because the question is
 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.100
is like because the question is
something like well is is something

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110
something like well is is something
 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.830
something like well is is something
better than nothing because that's a

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
better than nothing because that's a
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.960
better than nothing because that's a
really good question you know and I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970
really good question you know and I
 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.060
really good question you know and I
thought about two things in relationship

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070
thought about two things in relationship
 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.300
thought about two things in relationship
to that and one is one is well maybe it

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310
to that and one is one is well maybe it
 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.850
to that and one is one is well maybe it
depends on how it is that you are right

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860
depends on how it is that you are right
 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.220
depends on how it is that you are right
because it could be that there are ways

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230
because it could be that there are ways
 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.199
because it could be that there are ways
of being in the world that justify the

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209
of being in the world that justify the
 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.390
of being in the world that justify the
world and their ways of being in the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400
world and their ways of being in the
 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.100
world and their ways of being in the
world that make the world unbearable and

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110
world that make the world unbearable and
 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.650
world that make the world unbearable and
I believe that the narrative that runs

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660
I believe that the narrative that runs
 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.060
I believe that the narrative that runs
through the biblical stories is

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070
through the biblical stories is
 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.310
through the biblical stories is
precisely a dialogue between those two

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320
precisely a dialogue between those two
 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.560
precisely a dialogue between those two
types of being and the optimistic part

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570
types of being and the optimistic part
 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.980
types of being and the optimistic part
of the story is that being requires

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990
of the story is that being requires
 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.960
of the story is that being requires
limitation and suffering there's no

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970
limitation and suffering there's no
 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.820
limitation and suffering there's no
escape from that but there are modes of

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830
escape from that but there are modes of
 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.580
escape from that but there are modes of
being that allow that to be perhaps even

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
being that allow that to be perhaps even
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.380
being that allow that to be perhaps even
more than tolerable perhaps there are

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390
more than tolerable perhaps there are
 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.790
more than tolerable perhaps there are
modes of being that allow that to be

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
modes of being that allow that to be
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.550
modes of being that allow that to be
good and it's a straight and narrow road

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560
good and it's a straight and narrow road
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.360
good and it's a straight and narrow road
it's a very

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370
it's a very
 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.610
it's a very
difficult road to tread so so I think

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620
difficult road to tread so so I think
 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.010
difficult road to tread so so I think
well that that's possible you know I'm

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020
well that that's possible you know I'm
 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.129
well that that's possible you know I'm
not an optimist by nature and but that's

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139
not an optimist by nature and but that's
 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.040
not an optimist by nature and but that's
that's one of the things that I've

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050
that's one of the things that I've
 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.120
that's one of the things that I've
conceptualized and read about that I

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
conceptualized and read about that I
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.980
conceptualized and read about that I
actually find plausible because it's

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
actually find plausible because it's
 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.659
actually find plausible because it's
certainly the case everyone knows this

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669
certainly the case everyone knows this
 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.920
certainly the case everyone knows this
that there are ways that you can act

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930
that there are ways that you can act
 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.030
that there are ways that you can act
that make things worse

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
that make things worse
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.790
that make things worse
everyone knows that and so if that's the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800
everyone knows that and so if that's the
 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.620
everyone knows that and so if that's the
case there has to be the opposite right

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630
case there has to be the opposite right
 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.540
case there has to be the opposite right
there has to be ways that you could act

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
there has to be ways that you could act
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.150
there has to be ways that you could act
that make things better and obviously

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160
that make things better and obviously
 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.590
that make things better and obviously
you can act in ways that make things

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600
you can act in ways that make things
 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.370
you can act in ways that make things
really way worse and so the question is

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380
really way worse and so the question is
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.930
really way worse and so the question is
well are there ways that you can act

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940
well are there ways that you can act
 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480
well are there ways that you can act
that make things really much better and

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490
that make things really much better and
 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.430
that make things really much better and
I think that's the question is can we

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
I think that's the question is can we
 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.770
I think that's the question is can we
have our cake and eat it too can we have

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780
have our cake and eat it too can we have
 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.990
have our cake and eat it too can we have
the being that requires limitation and

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000
the being that requires limitation and
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.990
the being that requires limitation and
suffering and also simultaneously

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000
suffering and also simultaneously
 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.610
suffering and also simultaneously
transcend that by our mode of being and

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620
transcend that by our mode of being and
 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.800
transcend that by our mode of being and
I believe that the biblical stories and

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810
I believe that the biblical stories and
 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.960
I believe that the biblical stories and
perhaps not only the biblical stories

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970
perhaps not only the biblical stories
 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.480
perhaps not only the biblical stories
but the biblical stories are the human

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
but the biblical stories are the human
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.520
but the biblical stories are the human
imagined one of the human imaginations

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530
imagined one of the human imaginations
 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.490
imagined one of the human imaginations
best attempts to address and answer that

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500
best attempts to address and answer that
 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.950
best attempts to address and answer that
question that's what the entire story is

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960
question that's what the entire story is
 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960
question that's what the entire story is
about so the first of it is the

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970
about so the first of it is the
 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.000
about so the first of it is the
catastrophe of the collapse of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010
catastrophe of the collapse of
 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.920
catastrophe of the collapse of
self-consciousness and the entrance of

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930
self-consciousness and the entrance of
 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.140
self-consciousness and the entrance of
humanity into history and the rest of it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150
humanity into history and the rest of it
 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.659
humanity into history and the rest of it
is okay now we're in history now we know

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669
is okay now we're in history now we know
 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.400
is okay now we're in history now we know
that we're going to die we know about

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410
that we're going to die we know about
 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.560
that we're going to die we know about
our mortality we're conscious of our own

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570
our mortality we're conscious of our own
 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.810
our mortality we're conscious of our own
being is there a mode of acting in the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820
being is there a mode of acting in the
 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.690
being is there a mode of acting in the
world that allows that to be justifiable

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700
world that allows that to be justifiable
 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.310
world that allows that to be justifiable
or maybe even more that allows that to

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
or maybe even more that allows that to
 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.219
or maybe even more that allows that to
be triumphant and then I would also say

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229
be triumphant and then I would also say
 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.520
be triumphant and then I would also say
maybe it's worth finding out you know

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530
maybe it's worth finding out you know
 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.990
maybe it's worth finding out you know
that's the other thing that's so

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
that's the other thing that's so
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.370
that's the other thing that's so
interesting because you've got this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380
interesting because you've got this
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.439
interesting because you've got this
short time on earth and there's lots of

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449
short time on earth and there's lots of
 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.939
short time on earth and there's lots of
things that are very very difficult to

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949
things that are very very difficult to
 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.339
things that are very very difficult to
contend with and and you have the

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349
contend with and and you have the
 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.070
contend with and and you have the
problem of tolerating yourself even in

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080
problem of tolerating yourself even in
 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.990
problem of tolerating yourself even in
all your insufficiency and one of the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000
all your insufficiency and one of the
 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.490
all your insufficiency and one of the
things that seems to me to be the case

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500
things that seems to me to be the case
 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.650
things that seems to me to be the case
is that if you adopt a sufficiently

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660
is that if you adopt a sufficiently
 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.629
is that if you adopt a sufficiently
profound mode of being if you attempt to

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639
profound mode of being if you attempt to
 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:19.230
profound mode of being if you attempt to
do that then the mere act of lifting up

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240
do that then the mere act of lifting up
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.659
do that then the mere act of lifting up
that weight is enough to justify the

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669
that weight is enough to justify the
 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.029
that weight is enough to justify the
fact that you're insufficient and mortal

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039
fact that you're insufficient and mortal
 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.089
fact that you're insufficient and mortal

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:28.680
and and and bound by tragedy and I
believe that and I believe people

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690
believe that and I believe people
 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.200
believe that and I believe people
believe that because if you watch how

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210
believe that because if you watch how
 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.210
believe that because if you watch how
people act they look for people they

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220
people act they look for people they
 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.940
people act they look for people they
admire and they do admire people right

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950
admire and they do admire people right
 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.640

that argument it's only a matter of
 

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.469
that argument it's only a matter of
practicality and and and it seems to me

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479
practicality and and and it seems to me
 

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:33.209
practicality and and and it seems to me
that that's that's not the right

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:33.219
that that's that's not the right
 

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:36.269

conclusion to draw that's how it seems
 

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:38.159
conclusion to draw that's how it seems
to me and that's what Solzhenitsyn

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.169
to me and that's what Solzhenitsyn
 

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.269
to me and that's what Solzhenitsyn
concluded when he looked at the

concluded when he looked at the
 

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:44.069
concluded when he looked at the
Nuremberg trials so the notion that the

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:44.079
Nuremberg trials so the notion that the
 

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:47.310
Nuremberg trials so the notion that the
notion that it was good well even if you

notion that it was good well even if you
 

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.230
notion that it was good well even if you
don't believe that and you know because

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240
don't believe that and you know because
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.939
don't believe that and you know because
maybe it's not as good as it could be I

existence more than that and you know
 

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.720

you're desperate and maybe you're

light in the darkness and that lifts

light in the darkness and that lifts
your spirit up and gives you a little

your spirit up and gives you a little

your spirit up and gives you a little
bit of hope and maybe helps you continue

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:30.770
bit of hope and maybe helps you continue
 

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.160
bit of hope and maybe helps you continue
on it's well that's obviously a call to

on it's well that's obviously a call to
 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.560
on it's well that's obviously a call to
being it's it's a it's a statement from

being it's it's a it's a statement from
 

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.180
being it's it's a it's a statement from
your old soul that says well there's

something about that that's how you
 

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.100
something about that that's how you
should be and maybe then well we get a
