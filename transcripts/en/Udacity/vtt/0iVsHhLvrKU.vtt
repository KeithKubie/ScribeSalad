00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.184
The goal of encryption is to transform
a plaintext into an intelligible form.

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:10.487
That is, given that the attacker
can obtain the ciphertext,

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:15.220
we don't want the attacker to be
able to learn about the plaintext.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.280
In order to accomplish this,
we apply two principles.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.700
The first is called confusion,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.000
it is a way to obscure the relationship
between a key and a ciphertext.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.820
That is, although the attacker
can obtain the ciphertext,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.660
the attacker will not be
able to find out the key.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.230
This is typically achieved
with substitution.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.756
For example, in the generalized
substitution ciphers that we

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:46.210
have discussed, each letter can
be mapped to any other letter.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.884
Confusion or
substitution alone is not sufficient.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:56.579
For example, even when a letter can be
mapped to any other letter, the attacker

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.694
can use statistical analysis of data
frequencies to break the scheme.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:05.300
Therefore, the second
principle is diffusion.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.157
This means that the influence of one
plaintext bit is spread over many

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:11.831
bits in a ciphertext and

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:16.454
the goal is to hide the statistical
properties of the plaintext.

00:01:16.454 --> 00:01:21.354
For example, in stead of mapping
an English letter to another

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:26.644
English letter, we can map a letter
to parts of many a bit letters.

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:31.431
And if you do that, then the frequency
distribution of English letters will not

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.120
be very useful in cryptanalysis.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.420
We can achieve diffusion
with permutations.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.261
Further, we need this combination to
effect every bit of the ciphertext.

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:47.055
Therefore, typically,
a block cipher has multiple rounds

00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:51.764
where each round combines
substitution and permutation.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:56.751
That is, the first round affects some
parts of the ciphertext and the next

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:02.020
round further propagates these effects
into other parts of the ciphertext.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.340
Eventually, all bits of
ciphertext are affected.
