drove in from the apartment to look to
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710

work so obviously they weren't there to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
work so obviously they weren't there to
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810
work so obviously they weren't there to
arrest me and I didn't think that they

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
arrest me and I didn't think that they
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789
