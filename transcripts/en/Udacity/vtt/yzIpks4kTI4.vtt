00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.220
The course that you're taking is
about native JavaScript promises.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.370
They started showing up in
browsers around the end of 2014,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.260
but polyfills for promises have been
around for much longer actually.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.580
JQuery, which is obviously
a very popular library,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.710
implements its own version of promises,
but they have some serious issues.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.120
So I definitely recommend reading up
on them in the instructor notes if you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.390
want to use them.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.940
The first version of Angular
uses Q style promises.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.400
These are mostly the same
as native promises, but

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.390
have some slight differences.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.340
Angular 2,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.920
however, will actually be taking
advantage of native JavaScript promises.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.250
Once again, check the links in
the instructor notes to learn more.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
As of this filming right now in December
of 2015, native promises are safe

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.470
to use with every major browser, except
for Internet Explorer and Opera Mini.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.940
You'll need to make sure that
you include a polyfill or

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.420
some other kind of fall-back
on your production sites.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.240
There are some new APIs that are also
taking advantage of promises.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.040
For instance,
they're the recommended strategy for

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.160
interacting with the new
service worker API.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.670
Service workers
are a total game changer.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.270
They allow you to add a powerful
layer of control between your app and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.540
the network, and that means that you can
actually create apps that work offline.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.820
Seriously, it's amazing.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.350
And you should check the instructor
notes to learn more.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.920
In the next quiz you'll be using
another new API called the Fetch API.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.840
It uses native promises to
simplify xml http requests.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870
That's really hard to say.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.950
Substantially.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.130
So let's go ahead and do it.
