that's something that I'm assuming is
 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.740
that's something that I'm assuming is
more like either happening now where

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750
more like either happening now where
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.270
more like either happening now where
it's going to be happening well that

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280
it's going to be happening well that
 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.020
it's going to be happening well that
would be the future

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.030
would be the future
 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.820
would be the future
yeah the future and then the same thing

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830
yeah the future and then the same thing
 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.170

something productive instead of just
kind of running around like idiots to an

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:41.870
kind of running around like idiots to an
 

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.990
kind of running around like idiots to an
extent and lemongrab wanting to can like

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000
extent and lemongrab wanting to can like
 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.059
extent and lemongrab wanting to can like
figure out more it's like huh I wonder

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:49.069
figure out more it's like huh I wonder
 

00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:51.999

what else is going on to an extent is

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:52.009
what else is going on to an extent is
 

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:54.009
what else is going on to an extent is
showing growth but yeah in the end it's

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:54.019
showing growth but yeah in the end it's
 

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:56.650
showing growth but yeah in the end it's
kind of like it's not like a philosopher

himself is like a crack and then when he
 

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.380
himself is like a crack and then when he
gets back he fixes it like you know I

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:21.390
gets back he fixes it like you know I
 

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.790
gets back he fixes it like you know I
fix that but you mix it with the stuff

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800
