00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:03.403
In the previous video we were able
to apply the binomial theorem

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:06.466
in order to figure out what
a plus b to fourth power is

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.816
in order to expand this out.

00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:10.381
And we did it. And it was
a little bit tedious but

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:11.781
hopefully you appreciated it.

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:14.471
It would have been useful
if we did even a higher power--

00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:17.297
a plus b to the seventh power,
a plus b to the eighth power.

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.557
But what I want to do
in this video is show you

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:21.652
that there's another way
of thinking about it

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:24.732
and this would be using
"Pascal's Triangle".

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:27.095
And if we have time we'll also think about

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.605
why these two ideas
are so closely related.

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:36.474
So instead of doing a plus b to the fourth
using this traditional binomial theorem--

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:40.026
I guess you could say-- formula right over
here, I'm going to calculate it

00:00:40.026 --> 00:00:42.280
using Pascal's triangle
and some of the patterns

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.800
that we know about the expansion.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.634
So once again let me write down
what we're trying to calculate.

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:59.014
We're trying to calculate a plus b

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:03.059
to the fourth power--

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.134
I'll just do this in a different color--
to the fourth power.

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:10.867
So what I'm going to do is set up
Pascal's triangle. So Pascal's triangle--

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:14.499
so we'll start with a one at the top.
And one way to think about it is,

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.089
it's a triangle where if you start it
up here, at each level you're really

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:22.358
counting the different ways
that you can get to the different nodes.

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:26.387
So one-- and so I'm going to set up
a triangle. So if I start here

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:28.147
there's only one way I can get here

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:30.392
and there's only one way
that I could get there.

00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:32.284
But now this third level--

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:34.524
if I were to say
how many ways can I get here--

00:01:34.524 --> 00:01:37.704
well, one way to get here,
one way to get here.

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:39.335
So there's two ways to get here.

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.945
One way to get there,
one way to get there.

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:45.783
The only way I get there is like that,
the only way I can get there is like that.

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:49.503
But the way I could get here, I could
go like this, or I could go like this.

00:01:49.503 --> 00:01:54.259
And then we could add a fourth level
where-- let's see, if I have--

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.979
there's only one way to go there
but there's three ways to go here.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.269
One plus two. How are there three ways?

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:04.269
You could go like this,
you could go like this,

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:06.896
or you could go like that.

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:10.476
Same exact logic:
there's three ways to get to this point.

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:14.773
And then there's only one way
to get to that point right over there.

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:19.227
And so let's add a fifth level because
this was actually what we care about

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.774
when we think about
something to the fourth power.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:26.200
This is essentially zeroth power--
binomial to zeroth power, first power,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.945
second power, third power.
So let's go to the fourth power.

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:33.915
So how many ways are there to get here?

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:37.263
Well I just have to go all the way
straight down along this left side

00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:39.121
to get here, so there's only one way.

00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:44.041
There's four ways to get here. I could
go like that, I could go like that,

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.803
I could go like that,
and I can go like that.

00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:49.932
There's six ways to go here.

00:02:49.932 --> 00:02:53.032
Three ways to get to this place,
three ways to get to this place.

00:02:53.032 --> 00:02:56.791
So six ways to get to that and, if you
have the time, you could figure that out.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.150
There's three plus one--
four ways to get here.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.880
And then there's one way to get there.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.333
And now I'm claiming that
these are the coefficients

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:13.069
when I'm taking something to the-- if
I'm taking something to the zeroth power.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.609
This is if I'm taking a binomial
to the first power,

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.699
to the second power.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.629
Obviously a binomial to the first power,

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.439
the coefficients on a and b
are just one and one.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.641
But when you square it, it would be
a squared plus two ab plus b squared.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.238
If you take the third power, these
are the coefficients-- third power.

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:34.394
And to the fourth power,
these are the coefficients.

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:35.934
So let's write them down.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.169
The coefficients, I'm claiming,
are going to be

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:44.469
one, four, six, four, and one.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.337
And how do I know what
the powers of a and b are going to be?

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:49.262
Well I start a, I start this first term,

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.072
at the highest power: a to the fourth.

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:53.522
And then I go down from there.

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:55.652
a to the fourth, a to the third,

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.475
a squared, a to the first,

00:03:58.475 --> 00:03:59.965
and I guess I could write

00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:04.618
a to the zero which of course is just one.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:08.568
And then for the second term
I start at the lowest power, at zero.

00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:12.533
And then b to first, b squared,

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:14.213
b to the third power,

00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:15.533
and then b to the fourth,

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:19.456
and then I just add those terms together.

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:20.956
And there you have it.

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:23.198
I have just figured out the expansion

00:04:23.198 --> 00:04:28.338
of a plus b to the fourth power.

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:30.398
It's exactly what I just wrote down.

00:04:30.398 --> 00:04:33.915
This term right over here,
a to the fourth, that's what this term is.

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:36.945
One a to the fourth b to the zero:
that's just a to the fourth.

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:39.555
This term right over here is equivalent to

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.685
this term right over there.

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:46.201
And so I guess you see that
this gave me an equivalent result.

00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:52.667
Now an interesting question is
'why did this work?'

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:57.012
And I encourage you to pause this video
and think about it on your own.

00:04:57.012 --> 00:05:02.036
Well, to realize why it works let's just
go to these first levels right over here.

00:05:02.036 --> 00:05:06.068
If I just were to take
a plus b to the second power.

00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:16.531
a plus b to the second power.

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:18.451
This is going to be, 
we've already seen it,

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.121
this is going to be
a plus b times a plus b

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:24.691
so let me just write that down:
a plus b times a plus b.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:31.573
So we have an a, an a.
We have a b, and a b.

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:35.875
We're going to add these together.
And then when you multiply it, you have--

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:40.674
so this is going to be equal to a times a.
You get a squared.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:45.364
And that's the only way. That's the
only way to get an a squared term.

00:05:45.364 --> 00:05:50.246
There's only one way of getting
an a squared term.

00:05:50.246 --> 00:06:04.527
Then you're going to have
plus a times b. So-- plus a times b.

00:06:04.527 --> 00:06:09.929
And then you're going to have
plus this b times that a

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:16.359
so that's going to be another a times b.

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:21.599
Plus b times b which is b squared.

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.723
Now this is interesting right over here.

00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:25.923
How many ways can you get
an a squared term?

00:06:25.923 --> 00:06:29.084
Well there's only one way. You're
multiplying this a times that a.

00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:33.035
There's one way of getting there.

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:37.565
Now how many ways are there
of getting the b squared term?

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.198
How many ways are there
of getting the b squared term?

00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:42.935
Well there's only one way.
Multiply this b times this b.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.896
There's only one way of getting that.

00:06:44.896 --> 00:06:47.896
But how many ways are there
of getting the ab term?

00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:50.076
The a to the first b to the first term.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.915
Well there's two ways. You can multiply
this a times that b,

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:58.210
or this b times that a. There are--
just hit the point home--

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.750
there are two ways,
two ways of getting an ab term.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.767
And so, when you take the sum of these two

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:19.107
you are left with a squared plus
two times ab plus b squared.

00:07:19.107 --> 00:07:21.160
Notice the exact same coefficients:

00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:24.161
one two one, one two one.

00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:28.108
Why is that like that? Well there is only
one way to get an a squared,

00:07:28.108 --> 00:07:29.808
there's two ways to get an ab, and

00:07:29.808 --> 00:07:32.668
there's only one way to get a b squared.

00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:38.776
If you set it to the third power you'd say
okay, there's only one way to get to

00:07:38.776 --> 00:07:41.092
a to the third power.

00:07:41.092 --> 00:07:43.872
You just multiply
the first a's all together.

00:07:43.872 --> 00:07:48.902
And there is only one way
to get to b to the third power.

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:51.256
But there's three ways to get to

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:54.256
a squared b.

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:56.456
And you could multiply it out,
and we did it.

00:07:56.456 --> 00:07:59.316
We did it all the way back over here.

00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:02.006
There's three ways to get a squared b.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:04.066
We saw that right over there.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.293
And there are three ways

00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:08.233
to get a b squared.

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:11.763
Three ways to get a b squared.

00:08:11.763 --> 00:08:16.700
And if you sum this up you have the
expansion of a plus b to the third power.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.359
So hopefully you found that interesting.
