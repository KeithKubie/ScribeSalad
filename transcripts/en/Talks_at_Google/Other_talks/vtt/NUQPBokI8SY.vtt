GOPI KALLAYIL: Good afternoon.

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:06.240
My name is Gopi Kallayil.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.730
And I'm delighted to
welcome to the Google

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.600
campus for the fourth
time Radhanath Swami,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.020
the author of the international
bestseller "The Journey Home"

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.310
and now the "New York
Times" bestseller,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.718
"The Journey Within."

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:28.120
I had my first
opportunity to learn

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.405
about Radhanath Swami of all the
things in a video about Burning

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:33.905
Man.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.570
He does get around to the
most interesting of places.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.140
But during the
Burning Man interview

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
in response to a
question, he said,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.250
everybody's looking
for happiness.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.320
And in search of the happiness,
we change your externalities.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.800
Whereas, to find
true happiness, we

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.265
need to shift our consciousness.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.140
And the way Radhanath
Swami reached

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.630
this very important
insight was through

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.730
his own personal journey,
where when he was 19 years old,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.710
he left Chicago.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.320
And in search of what is the
source of true happiness,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.740
he hitchhiked his way across
Europe, Central Asia, all

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.980
the way to India
and arrived there

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.330
on the borders with no money.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.500
And they would not let him in.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.010
And he persuaded them
to allow him to come in.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.850
And he said you would do
something for humanity

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.129
at large and, particularly,
for the people of India.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:31.670
But during the course
of his journey,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.560
what he realized that the
cost for most problems in life

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.040
was human frailties that happen
irrespective of who you are

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.840
and what your background is.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.850
And he's committed
himself to really studying

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.960
human consciousness, the
relationship between people,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.580
and how that can be
a source of happiness

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.900
if you approach
it the right way.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.570
And in exploring
all of these issues

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.530
with very little
resources-- as a monk,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.220
he has no bank
account, no money.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.510
But he's managed to persuade
a large group of people

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.020
to work alongside him and create
several humanitarian projects

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.410
around the world, including
a midday meal program that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.010
feeds 1.2 million children
every school day in India,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.500
ecovillage outside Mumbai,
a hospital that provides

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.110
free or low cost holistic care,
and a number of other projects

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.930
like that around the world,
demonstrating to us that, more

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.360
than resources, it is like an
inner commitment that comes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.860
from somewhere deep within,
as the path of yoga dicted,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.700
that can really allow us to
manifest our fullest potential.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.980
And here to discuss
more about this topic

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.150
and to explore this with
us-- his own journey,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.532
as well as what it
means in our lives--

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:47.990
please help me
welcome to the stage

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.540
at Google for the fourth
time Mr. Radhanath Swami.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.701
RADHANATH SWAMI: (CHANTING)

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.010
I'm very grateful to be
with all of you today.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.580
Thank you, Gopi, for
opening the doors

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.500
to this world-renowned,
most influential institution

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:31.180
of Goggle for me to share
some thoughts with you.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.560
And my sincere gratitude to
each and every one of you

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.555
who has come today.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.220
I was asked to speak on
the subject of the currency

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.021
of relationships.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:06:03.440
Generally, we think of currency
as a medium for exchange,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.144
as a means of expressing
what has value.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.870
And so often in
the world today, we

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.210
underestimate the
currency of relationships,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:30.960
because we become distracted
from what we really

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.280
want to achieve in our life.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.630
Emerson wrote that
the reason why

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:47.370
this world is in so
much chaos and conflict

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.550
with so much dissatisfaction is
because people are disconnected

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.020
from their own selves.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.660
What is happiness?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.430
What are we really looking for?

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.440
The tendency, not
only today, but always

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.860
throughout human history
is that we become so

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:24.060
distracted toward things that
are relatively superficial,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.654
and we lose our scope of what's
really important in life.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.270
There's an analogy I
learned in South India.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.880
There's a fish--
I'm sorry, there's

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.580
a bird called the crane--
white feathers, long beak,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:56.720
stands on one leg in a stream
of water, looking down for food.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.650
And so many little
fish are passing--

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.770
dozens and dozens of little
fish, hundreds of little fish,

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.640
thousands of little fish.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.570
The crane observes,
lets them pass.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:18.380
When a big fish comes [GULP],
he eats it and feasts.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.070
Now, I don't eat fish.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.110
But the analogy is appropriate.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.890
He's keeping his
attention focused

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.830
on what is actually
significant and lets

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.400
all the little things go.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.289
Unless we are focused on
the higher principles,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.010
the more valuable things
that are really in our lives,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:52.090
then we're easily distracted
by every single little fish.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.917
And we never find the big one.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.220
It's so easy to see a
little pebble as a mountain,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.700
unless we're focused
on a real mountain,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.430
because [NON-ENGLISH],
everyone is seeking pleasure,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.320
everyone is seeking meaning.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.230
Unless we're focused
on deep issues,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.280
then we will be obsessed
with little things.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.786
And this is especially
true with relationships.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:42.020
I often cite an example of
my own mother and father.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.110
When I was about
eight years old,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:51.500
my mother told me, as I
was sitting on her bed,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.530
that everyone loves your
father and everyone loves me,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.750
but we do not love each other.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.810
We have decided we're
going to separate.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:09.700
Now, as a little child, I
couldn't even fathom that idea.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.460
My parents don't love each
other, and they're separating?

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.230
I was so disoriented, so
broken hearted by hearing that,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.480
that I couldn't say a word.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.430
I just sat and cried.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.010
My mother was shocked
to see my reaction.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.260
She didn't know what to say.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.210
And I got up, and I ran out
the door, down the hall,

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.780
down the stairs, through the
living room, out the door,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.694
and ran for blocks and blocks,
and hid in some bushes.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.320
This was almost 60 years ago.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.070
I waited a few hours.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.050
And then I saw my father's
car coming down the road.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.417
And I knew he was coming home.

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:03.750
And I knew my mother was going
to tell him what happened

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.160
and my reaction.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.830
So after he went in
the door, I secretly

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.420
snuck in the back door.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.295
And when he went into his
bedroom to meet my mother

00:11:17.295 --> 00:11:20.600
and they closed the
door, I secretly

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.220
put my ear to the
door, because I

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.610
wanted to hear what they
were going to discuss.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:34.766
My mother told my father what
she said and what happened.

00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:35.890
There was complete silence.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.770
And then I heard them both say,
for the sake of our children,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:49.370
we are going to make this work.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.780
It wasn't easy for them.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.200
They struggled, but they
had a higher principle

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.110
than their own disagreements.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:03.070
They had a big fish to focus on.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.510
And over the years, it was
hard work for them, I know,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:14.570
but I saw perhaps the most
united, loving relationship

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.310
between two people
that I had seen.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.850
They earned it by focusing
on the higher principle.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.750
They let all the
little things pass.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.450
And my own guru,
Srila Prabhupada, I

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:36.660
remember he was giving
a talk at a marriage.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.806
And he gave an analogy
about Mahatma Gandhi.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.470
He said-- he's quoting from
Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.070
I believe-- one time,
Gandhi and his wife

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.980
had a serious argument.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.570
And Gandhi got angry and
said, get out from here.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.910
So his wife left.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.900
And she sat out on
the street in front

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.240
of the house for some hours.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.180
And then Gandhi came out, and
he saw his wife still there.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.280
And he says, what are
you still doing here?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.190
And she said, I
have nowhere to go.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.350
And he said, all right,
let's just forget it.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.905
And she said, yes,
let's just forget.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:33.710
And Srila Prabhupada explained,
when we have disagreements,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:39.040
if we have a higher purpose that
we're recognizing of why we're

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.100
together, then we can
easily, or maybe not

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.740
easily, but we
understand the necessity

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.730
of forgetting all these
little things, somehow

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.555
or other adjusting.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.540
I left college
after one semester,

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.040
so I don't know too much
about technology or medicine.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.170
But as far as I know, when
you're developing electronics,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.640
there's conductors
and superconductors

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.000
and semiconductors,
so that the current

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.030
can flow in an
effective way to fulfill

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.050
the purpose of that device
without overheating,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:34.600
without conflict between
the different components.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:43.310
That type of circuitry is
required in our relationships

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.100
with each other.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.600
Ultimately, things can
give some pleasure,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.930
some fulfillment to the body and
to the senses and to the mind,

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.100
but not to the heart.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.570
Essentially, people
are looking for love.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:09.690
Only love can give
fulfillment to the heart.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.710
And that flow of
love, like the heart

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:21.180
itself, pumps blood
and receives blood.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.740
But if there's plaque
in the arteries,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.450
then the flow both
within and out

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:40.280
of the heart is blocked--
the plaque of selfish desires

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:49.910
of false ego or arrogance, when
it blocks our ability to love

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.080
and experience love.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.220
The principle of yoga, the
principle of spirituality,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.790
the true quality of humanity
is when we learn how to love

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.947
and how to be loved.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:16.120
I was seeing Gopi's
book about "The Internet

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.348
to the Inner-Net."

00:16:20.348 --> 00:16:24.380
And it's a brilliant conception.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:30.880
And Gopi is a person who has
realization and experience,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.410
seeing the world, how
the things, whether it's

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.820
technology, strength,
intelligence,

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:54.950
it can develop into a great
benefit or a great danger,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.540
depending on us.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.760
A knife is neither good or bad.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.130
It's determined by
who has that knife.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:11.130
A thief will use the
knife to kill someone,

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.369
to take what they have.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:21.349
And a doctor will use the same
knife to save a person's life.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:27.280
Our bodies, our wealth, our
science, our technology,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.290
our currency of
economics, everything

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.900
is potentially either
destructive or constructive

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:44.560
for the well-being of ourselves
and others or for the opposite,

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.865
according to what's
within our own hearts.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:57.140
The ecology today,
there's so much pollution.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.390
Why?

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.430
Because people's
hearts are polluted.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.920
You cannot really sustainably
clean up the ecology

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.810
of the world until we learn to
clean the ecology of the human

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.180
heart.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:27.050
Greed, insatiable,
selfishness, arrogance--

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:34.190
as long as that's there,
the pollution within will

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:39.640
manifest as the pollution
in our relationships

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.810
and in the
environment around us.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.050
The concept of yoga
or spirituality

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:53.930
is cleansing the
ecology of the heart,

00:18:53.930 --> 00:19:00.450
learning to help one another to
focus and unite on the really

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.546
higher meaningful principles.

00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:11.920
Srila Prabhupada, my
teacher, gave an example.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.510
If you throw a stone in
the middle of a pond,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.290
the circles that
come out will all

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.540
be harmonious with each other.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.990
But if throw different
stones in different parts

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.260
of the same pond, all
the different circles

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:37.224
will collide, because they
have a different center point.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.210
Yes, there are different
religions in this world,

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.960
and there are different races,
and different nationalities,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.680
and different people with
different occupational

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.545
tendencies in different
roles in society.

00:19:57.545 --> 00:20:02.180
But what do we all
have in common?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.571
What is this higher principle?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.116
Who are we?

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.120
It's very difficult to
see the unity among us

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.605
unless we really have
something to unify.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.450
In the Bible, it is
said, what profiteth

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.210
the person who gains
the whole world

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.440
but loses their eternal soul.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.650
It also says that
the first commandment

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.540
is to love God with all your
heart, mind, and a soul.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.270
And the natural
byproduct of that is you

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.500
will love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.310
And you'll recognize everyone
of all races, of all religions,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.470
of all species is our neighbor.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:06.798
In the "Bhagavad Gita," there
is the same principle stated.

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:20.380
[NON-ENGLISH], that true
knowledge is when we see with

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.930
equal vision the higher
principle of what

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:32.800
our relationship is with others,
when we understand who we are.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:43.310
Am I this body, or
am I in this body?

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.530
Am I this mind, or
am I witnessing life

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.090
through this mind?

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.310
These are serious
questions that are rarely

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.074
pondered in today's world.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.030
The beginning of true
spiritual knowledge

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:11.370
in all various traditions
is to understand who am I

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.120
and what is my
relationship with others.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.340
The "Bhagavad Gita"
tells [NON-ENGLISH],

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.220
that we are the atma, the living
force that is seeing through

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.060
the eyes and tasting
through the tongue,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.720
and hearing through the ears.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:39.910
The nature of that
spirit is it is

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.870
beyond birth and beyond death.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.960
It is a part of God.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.710
And every living being
is of the same source.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.240
When we actually connect
to the truth of who we are,

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:02.910
we can understand our
relationship with others.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:09.080
The nature of life itself,
the nature of the soul

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.730
is to love and to experience the
infinite love of the Supreme,

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.838
to be an instrument
of that love.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:31.920
When that is the principle,
that is our focus,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.670
then we can remain
united with respect

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.180
under all of the various stormy
conditions of this world.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.165
This building is very beautiful.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.360
But it's only here because
there's a foundation.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.940
Without that foundation,
however architecturally pleasing

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.482
a structure may be, when the
storm comes, it will collapse.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:18.600
What is the foundation of
our own state of being?

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.620
What is the
foundational principle

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.290
of our occupation, our
family relationships,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.170
in our interactions with the
environment and the world?

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.830
When we have a strong
inner foundation,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.010
when we find that peace,
that inner fulfillment,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:46.810
that inner love, that is
within us that is our nature,

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.290
then whatever
temptations or fears may

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:58.200
come in life, whatever storms
may appear, we remain strong.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.390
We remain stable.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:04.345
We remain focused on
what is really important.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:15.250
There are limitless reasons to
fight, to disagree, to hate.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:26.140
But there is one really special
important reason to respect,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:32.290
to love, and to
live with integrity,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.320
because that is truth.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.960
That is what is pleasing to
God, however we may know.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.280
And that is the only way we can
find meaning and fulfillment

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.086
in our lives.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.745
What is within us is expressed.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:03.670
And I'll end with one little
story that I love to tell.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:11.090
Years ago, I was sitting on
the bank of the river Ganges.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.145
It was a summer day.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.120
And because it was a summer
day, this is in India,

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.880
it was probably 110
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.340
There was no one around.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.350
It was just me.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.420
There wasn't a cloud in the sky.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.510
It was burning hot.

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.110
And I was eager to
go in the river.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.720
But first, I wanted to sit and
meditate for a few minutes.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.938
And I saw over my head,
there was a huge hawk.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:53.430
His brown feathers were
shining in the sun.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.460
He had yellow eyes
that were glistening,

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.750
very sharp claws and beak.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.470
And he was looking down.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.650
He was right over my
head, maybe about 20 feet.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:13.150
And he was circling lower
and lower and lower.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.746
I kept looking up.

00:27:15.746 --> 00:27:20.460
And it looked like he was
looking at me, because there

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.920
was no one else around.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.090
I said a little prayer.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.730
Suddenly, [WHOOSH] he
dove right into the river

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.000
just a few feet in front
of me and was underwater.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.380
There was a skirmish, and then
he came out from the river.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.780
And in his claws was a
fish about a foot long.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.880
And because it was
so close to me,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.540
I could see the eyes
of that little fish.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.560
He looked so bewildered.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.550
He looked so disoriented.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.600
And I was thinking that this
little fish was probably

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.900
going about his day
like every other day,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.890
swimming up stream, swimming
downstream, swimming

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:20.490
across stream, maybe
with his family of fish,

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.510
looking for food, playing.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.310
Suddenly, at the least expected
moment, the hawk of fate

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:33.920
ripped him right out
of his ordinary life.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:45.220
And he was flapping desperately
as the hawk carried him

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.794
further and further and
further into the forest.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.280
I was thinking what, am I
supposed to learn from this?

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.080
Like that little fish,
we go about our life.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.460
But at any moment, we could be
ripped out of our complacency.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.300
We read about it.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.570
We hear about it.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.922
It's happened to us.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:27.900
But if that fish
was swimming deeper,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.320
the hawk could not reach it.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.580
And similarly, when we find
our meaning, our purpose,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.410
and our fulfillment within
ourselves in a deeper way,

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:47.690
and when our relationships
are focused in a deeper way

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:55.640
for a higher purpose, then
the inevitable changes of this

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.310
world, the sunny days
and the stormy days,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.620
cannot to starve us.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.640
Humanity is based
on the principle

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.350
of brotherhood and sisterhood.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.956
But on the physical level,
it's very superficial.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.160
It is in the brotherhood
and sisterhood of life,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:35.140
on the basis of the
depth of our own souls,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:43.740
beyond sectarian concepts that
we can understand our unity

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.915
and the necessity of that unity.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.630
When we keep focused
on higher principles,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:59.900
we can easily adjust
and effectively

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:06.830
deal with the
circumstances around us.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:11.100
If we're depending on
our unity and depending

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:17.290
on our inner fulfillment
on those circumstances--

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.350
and so much is
beyond our control--

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.720
it is simply unsustainable.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:37.160
Great leaders help people
to unite on these higher

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:49.930
principles-- parents, political
leaders, spiritual leaders,

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.365
leaders within various
types of companies.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.540
And the highest,
deepest connection

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.242
comes from learning how to love.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.170
Love is an expression
of the heart.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:26.180
Love is when we value
unselfish service

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.976
for the well-being of others.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.972
Compassion is the natural
expression of a loving heart.

00:32:39.252 --> 00:32:40.710
It's the greatest
need in the world

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:49.020
today in all of our companies
and all of our relationships

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.004
to learn the value
of compassion.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.080
Thank you very much.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.418
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:12.620
The question is, does the world
create consciousness or does

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.255
consciousness create the world?

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:30.380
In the Vedic literatures,
there is a particular book that

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.020
is called the "Brahma Sutra."

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:40.900
It is the summary of the essence
of a huge body of literature

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.240
dealing with so many
various subject matters.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:51.090
And the first verse
is [NON-ENGLISH],

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:57.440
that everything is
coming from one source.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:05.560
That source has many names--
Bhagavan, Para Brahman, God,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.250
Krishna.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.820
We understand that
ultimately everything

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.889
is coming from the ultimate
state of consciousness,

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.015
the cause of all causes.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.570
And everything is
within material nature

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.919
is orchestrated by
that Supreme conscious.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:42.420
In our own little
bodies, we grow

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.449
because there is consciousness.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.460
At the beginning, the father
and the mother come together,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.679
and there's a little tiny seed.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:57.241
And it begins to grow, because
there's consciousness there.

00:34:57.241 --> 00:35:01.950
And it grows into
a little embryo.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.720
And then it's born,
it's a little infant.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.310
Then it becomes a
baby, and then it

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.480
grows through childhood
throughout adolescence,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.088
through middle age, old age.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.210
When that conscious
force leaves the body,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.850
there's no more growth.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.390
There's only dwindling, yes?

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.750
Similarly, today, I
was taking a walk,

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.953
and I saw this
enormous Redwood tree.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.130
It's-- I don't know how
many centuries old it is,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.940
but it's still growing
and growing and growing,

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.450
because there's conscious
life within that tree.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.070
But when the conscious
life is no longer there,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.018
it cannot grow.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.800
The little flower,
there is consciousness

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.640
within that little flower that
makes it bloom and gives it

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.970
its fragrance.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.830
So we see in our own
practical experience

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.307
how, wherever there is
consciousness, there's growth,

00:36:14.307 --> 00:36:15.140
there's development.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.890
So from a spiritual
perspective, it

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:24.560
is consciousness that is the
source of everything that

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.190
exists.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.390
And there is an ultimate
Supreme consciousness that's

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.698
the source of everything.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:41.320
Is there a recipe to keeping
focused on these higher

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.828
principles in our lives?

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:59.260
In our tradition, there's
three very important principles

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.350
that help us remain focused.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.220
One is Satsang.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:10.080
Satsang means to be
with enlightened people

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.700
and to be with people
who are striving

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:17.190
for enlightenment, to
help us remain focus,

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.690
to help inspire us.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.770
It's very important

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.550
Who we associate,
what we associate

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:35.910
with very much influences the
values we have in our life.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.820
If you put an iron rod
in fire, after time,

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.480
it becomes red
and hot like fire.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.230
If you put that same iron
rod in ice, after some time

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.230
it becomes as cold as ice.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.660
I know many people
who are helplessly

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.080
drug addicts and alcoholics.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:04.930
And in Alcoholics Anonymous
or Narcotics Anonymous,

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.610
because they had an
assembly of people

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.770
with the common interests of
becoming sober and remaining

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.714
sober, they were able to
overcome those distractions.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.200
In this world, people are so
much addicted to greed and envy

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.380
and selfishness and arrogance.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.420
We need each other
to help, to actually

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:39.200
give the strength,
the clarity of vision,

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.150
so that we don't fall
into these trappings.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:52.590
In a Redwood forest, the roots
underground are interconnected

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.730
and give support.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.110
Every tree in the Redwood
forest is directly or indirectly

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.270
giving support to each other.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.930
And even in the face of
earthquakes and massive storms,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.320
they keep growing
together, because they

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.950
support each other.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.000
Satsang is very important,
where we come together

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.440
to help each other
focus on that big fish,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.740
on the higher principles that
are really of value in life

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.600
and help each other
to overcome and resist

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:38.600
falling into temptations
and fears that distract us

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.700
from our real purpose.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.130
And putting some time of
day for a spiritual practice

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.918
to make that inner
connection is very important.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.990
The other day, I was speaking
at the Apple Corporation.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:01.180
And I was remembering
how in their computers

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.580
they have batteries.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.243
And how long the battery
lasts is very important.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.770
You have to keep
recharging that battery.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:16.450
So similarly, in our
own spiritual batteries,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:25.260
our own integrity and
focus, to recharge it

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.290
through proper company,
through our prayers,

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.230
through our meditation--
in our tradition,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:36.300
we chant god's names--
it keeps us charged

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:45.000
with spiritual strength and with
a clear vision of what really

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.242
is important in our lives and
what we really want to achieve.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.720
And then Sadachar.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:41:00.210
Sadachar is integrating
the blessings

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.330
we receive through
the company we keep

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.820
and through our spiritual
practices in our life,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.616
to live with character,
to live with integrity.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:24.280
This human body, there are
various limbs and organs,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.650
and each one has its
own unique function.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.210
The heart is pumping the blood.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:36.420
The brain has a function,
the lungs, the pancreas,

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.100
the kidneys.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.770
One cannot do what
the other does.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:45.810
They have different
shapes, different colors,

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.970
and very different functions.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.490
What is a healthy body?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:55.630
If the stomach is thinking,
I'm the one supplying food

00:41:55.630 --> 00:42:00.470
to every part of the
body, I don't like you,

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.920
kidneys, I'm not going
to give you anything.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.480
If the stomach thinks
like that, the whole body

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.800
becomes sick,
including the stomach.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.280
Every part of the body
recognizes, appreciates,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.630
and respects every
other part of the body.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:24.810
So within this
social body, we have

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:31.200
engineers, farmers, scientists.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.930
We have bankers.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.880
We have people in politics.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.950
There are so many
various professions.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:40.974
We also have swamis and priests.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.970
They are all serving
a particular function,

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:53.340
but with appreciation and
respect for the contribution

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.310
of each other.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.880
We need farmers.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.510
We need bankers.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.950
Technology is
absolutely wonderful,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.712
if it's utilized for
wonderful purpose.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.380
Philosophy is wonderful, if it's
used for wonderful purposes.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:23.370
So the principle of
dharma or spirituality

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:32.150
is to understand the difference
between material and spiritual.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:36.540
Everything is potentially
spiritual, if we understand

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.850
its relationship
with the Supreme,

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.370
if we understand the
relationship we all have

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.730
with each other on that basis.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.060
And just like that
knife analogy I

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:59.120
was giving, if we
recognize that, then we

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.550
can express the highest
dharma in whatever occupation

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.910
we may be in.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.540
Sitting here today
is one of my dearest

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.390
friends and brothers, Gurudas.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:22.250
And years ago, he was living
in John Lennon's estate

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.360
just outside of London.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.310
This was in the 1960s.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.620
John Lennon is from the Beatles.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.890
And George Harrison
became very serious

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:39.820
about this bhakti yoga,
or Krishna consciousness.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.900
And he came to our
guru Srila Prabhupada.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.690
And he asked permission
to shave his head

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.900
and become a resident
of the ashram.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:59.590
And Srila Prabhupada, our guru,
told him, you're a musician,

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.938
you have fame, you have
wealth, you're a Beatle.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.360
You can serve better
by just doing it

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.930
with a spiritual purpose.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:14.880
And he did.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.020
And he affected more people
with spiritual values

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.440
than most-- any monk ever did.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.590
So spiritual life is not
about changing our occupation.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.020
It's about changing
our consciousness,

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.251
changing our values.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:42.580
I know CEOs of corporations,
international corporations,

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:49.170
with families, who are really
saints, because they're not

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.400
trying to exploit people.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.950
They have inner integrity.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:59.300
They've developed and
excavated that inner love.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.510
And they express it
through their work.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:04.896
And it's beautiful.

00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:06.520
GOPI KALLAYIL: And
with that, on behalf

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.061
of everyone here
and Google, I'd like

00:46:08.061 --> 00:46:10.250
to thank Radhanath
Swami for spending time

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.580
with us, sharing his
incredible wisdom.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:13.430
Thank you.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:14.980
[APPLAUSE]
