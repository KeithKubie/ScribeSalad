Matt: Hi YouTube, this is Matt from British
council.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.260
I've just been in the BBC debate on the financial
crisis.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.400
It's been very interesting, very exciting,
quite a tough discussion.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.810
But one thing thatâ€™s on my mind after this
discussion, after hearing this discussion

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.140
is that several of the people on stage said
that the current financial crisis is not due

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.160
to individuals or companies doing something
wrong.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.250
It's actually a systemic thing.
So it's the system that is wrong.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.660
Now what I'm wondering is, once we've solved
the crisis -- touch wood -- and things go

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.330
well again.
I wonder if they're also going to say well

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.290
it's not because of us that we're making so
much money, it's because of the system.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.760
So I think that the big trick out there is
that there is huge lack of taking any responsibility.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140
We can't probably make the banks and companies
responsible for everything now that's gone

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.470
wrong, but If they don't take any responsibility,
how are we going to trust you again.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.229
Thank you very much.
