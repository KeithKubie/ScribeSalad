00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:03.795
WIL WILLIS: The trench knife
was developed for US World War I

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.296
troops in need of
a versatile weapon

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:07.507
to employ in the hand-to-hand
combat they faced

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.092
while raiding enemy trenches.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.761
Featuring a pointed blade
and four-fingered guard,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.597
or knuckle duster, the
weapon was used for stabbing,

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.057
slashing, and punching.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:18.393
The solid steel knuckle
duster prevented enemies

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.062
from seizing the knife and could
be used like brass knuckles

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.148
to issue devastating blows.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.775
Your knives must include
an integral handle

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.777
made from the same piece
of steel as the blade.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.739
You must include
four finger holes.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.782
You will have four hours
in which to complete this,

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:36.035
but only one of you can be
working the steel at a time.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.830
So we will rotate at
30 minute intervals.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.957
Apprentices, you're up first.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:45.670
Your four hour foraging
time starts now.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.629
Get it back in there.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.048
Go find some bigger tongs.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:51.426
We're so used to foraging
against the clock being

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.261
in horse show contests--

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:54.888
There you go!

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.098
That's kind of old
rap for us, I think.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:57.974
It's fun.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:58.850
RALEIGH: Yeah, it's fun.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.268
It's what we do for fun.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.978
Hey, can you block that
side up a little bit?

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.146
KELLY: Yeah, I can.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.023
And then open up
your tools here?

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.275
Am I being too bossy?
KELLY: No, no, keep talking?

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.318
RALEIGH: Follow their footsteps.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.153
You gotta let it prep.
There!

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.571
Yeah!

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.032
I see a lot of intense
coaching from Raleigh.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.950
There you go!

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.368
Yeah!

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.328
[laughter]

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.705
That's [bleep] awesome.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.081
WIL WILLIS: Switch!

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.083
Kelly got us pretty
well-sorted out.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:29.047
Now, it's my job to do something
about these finger holes.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.715
Because I'm not real
sure about them.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:31.966
I've never made any.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.052
I'm going to just drift them in.
- Whoo!

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:34.969
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.347
Yeah, I got your back!

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.600
And then we'll file them
and grind them into shape.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.851
Nice.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.478
Look at rally hammer.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:45.480
You got a farrier
with a vengeance.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.732
I just wanted
to hit something.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:48.900
WIL WILLIS: Switch!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.152
Half your time has
already elapsed.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.863
Make sure you got it
real secure in there, Kel.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.114
Start grinding that [bleep].

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.491
Hoo-wah, she's
already on the grinding.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.496
KELLY: I need a band-aid.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:02.497
RALEIGH: Going good?

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:03.456
KELLY: Yeah, I'm good.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.791
I just need a band-aid.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.125
Uh-oh.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.378
Whoa.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:09.796
That's a lot of blood.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.505
It's not a cut.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.548
It's a tear.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.757
We've got the medic coming in.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.050
No, no, I don't have time.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.802
No, no it's not [inaudible].
Please, no.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.178
The grinder attacked me.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.097
[laughter]

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.767
Just give me a
band-aid right there.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:23.560
That's all I need.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.811
It's not bad.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.563
Kelly over there,
it looks like she

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.149
messed up her finger pretty bad,
and she's still trying to work.

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.442
KELLY: I don't want
to leave the floor.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:33.194
It was just a little bitty cut.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.989
I broke my foot in four places
and shod 10 horses afterward.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.533
I just need to keep working.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.868
I don't have time.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.286
I don't have time for this.
- All right.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.829
Thanks.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.455
We don't worry about little
flesh wound around here.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:45.540
It's all good.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.749
Switch!

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.042
RALEIGH: Kelly,
we better [bleep]

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.378
hope that we can rasp this.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.796
We should have checked.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.465
I'm grinding on this
blade and all of a sudden,

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:56.968
I start thinking, this
blade's pretty hard.

00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.511
We might be in trouble.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:03.641
Because I'm not sure our
plan to rasp out these holes

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.476
is going to go as
easily as planned.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.103
KELLY: I should have
punched them bigger.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.814
We underestimated the work
hardness of a [inaudible]..

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.774
Hand rasping is not easy.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:13.902
RALEIGH: If we don't get these
finger holes sorted out so

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.029
that the judges can
fit their fingers in,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.322
we're going to have a problem.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:22.535
WIL WILLIS: 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, bladesmen,

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.953
shut down your machines.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.455
Drop your tools.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.458
This first round of
competition is over.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:30.877
That was fun.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.713
Masters and apprentices,
it's time for the judges

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.757
to take a look at your work.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:41.095
Raleigh, Kelly, please, present
your blade to the judges.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:42.513
That's a heck of a knife.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:44.724
I don't see any kind
of cracking or problems

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.267
with the steel itself.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:50.104
But the big thing is these
holes are pretty small.

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:53.775
I would really like to see these
holes opened up a little bit.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.110
No one swings hammers
like farriers do.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.279
But remember one of these
tests is a stab test,

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.075
and that's a very
wide point for a stab.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.620
WIL WILLIS: Joe, Casey,
your team's up next.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.622
Man, that's an
aggressive design.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.540
It's just really intimidating.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.334
All in all, I think
you did a great job.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.877
Well done.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.546
WIL WILLIS: Tyler and
Leon, you guys are up next.

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:19.717
In the competition where the
defining part of this design

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.929
is all about the
handle, it's unfinished.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.932
I can't even get my fingers to
make it workable at this stage,

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.851
and that's very important.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.771
WIL WILLIS: It's time for one
of you teams to leave the fore.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.236
Leon and Tyler, your blade
did not make the cut.
