Impossible to a scene I can still watch
this movie for what it is like I can

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580
this movie for what it is like I can
 

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.310
this movie for what it is like I can
have it on I can appreciate some of the

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320
have it on I can appreciate some of the
 

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.470
have it on I can appreciate some of the
action scenes but the over serious tone

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480
action scenes but the over serious tone
 

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.650
action scenes but the over serious tone
is just not the right style or feel for

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660
is just not the right style or feel for
 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.390
is just not the right style or feel for
a Mission Impossible movie and I think

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:50.400
a Mission Impossible movie and I think
 

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.620
a Mission Impossible movie and I think
if this movie wasn't called Mission

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:51.630
if this movie wasn't called Mission
 

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.710
if this movie wasn't called Mission
Impossible - if it was called like

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720
Impossible - if it was called like
 

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.710
Impossible - if it was called like
slow-mo shots or something then it would

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720
slow-mo shots or something then it would
 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.990
slow-mo shots or something then it would
be perfect to be a great movie but not a

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000
be perfect to be a great movie but not a
 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.520
be perfect to be a great movie but not a
