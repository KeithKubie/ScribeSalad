the piracy paradox is a paradox related

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750
the piracy paradox is a paradox related
 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.789
the piracy paradox is a paradox related
to a fashion design may be related to

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799
to a fashion design may be related to
 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.980
to a fashion design may be related to
other things but mostly related to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990
other things but mostly related to

other things but mostly related to
fashion design the paradox arises from

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970
fashion design the paradox arises from
 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.530
fashion design the paradox arises from
the following kind of puzzle which is we

usually think of intellectual property

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770
usually think of intellectual property
 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.340

if they think their works are just going
 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.380
if they think their works are just going
to be stolen and so that's why piracy is

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390
to be stolen and so that's why piracy is
 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.299
to be stolen and so that's why piracy is
such a problem what's interesting about

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309
such a problem what's interesting about
 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.280
such a problem what's interesting about
fashion design is you see a lot of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290
fashion design is you see a lot of
 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.350
fashion design is you see a lot of
creativity in the fashion world and yet

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
creativity in the fashion world and yet

piracy paradox is looks at this puzzle

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670
piracy paradox is looks at this puzzle
 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.619
piracy paradox is looks at this puzzle
and and the idea is that unlike other

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629
and and the idea is that unlike other
 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.570
and and the idea is that unlike other
industries in which piracy seems to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580
industries in which piracy seems to
 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.180
industries in which piracy seems to
drive out creativity in fashion it

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190
drive out creativity in fashion it
 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.070
drive out creativity in fashion it
doesn't drive it out and in fact it

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080
doesn't drive it out and in fact it
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.849
doesn't drive it out and in fact it
seems to accelerate it and the reason is

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859
seems to accelerate it and the reason is
 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.940
seems to accelerate it and the reason is
that copying of the copying of designs

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950
that copying of the copying of designs
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.880
that copying of the copying of designs
as it spreads out into the marketplace

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890
as it spreads out into the marketplace
 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.279
as it spreads out into the marketplace
makes the original buyer they were the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289
makes the original buyer they were the
 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:19.929
makes the original buyer they were the
early adopter of a particular design

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939
early adopter of a particular design

all right so fashion is always cycling

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469
all right so fashion is always cycling
 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.849
all right so fashion is always cycling
and so one way to think about it is it

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859
and so one way to think about it is it
 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.039
and so one way to think about it is it
accelerates the fashion cycle so it's

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049
accelerates the fashion cycle so it's
 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.880
accelerates the fashion cycle so it's
paradoxically helpful

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890
 
 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.970
 
couple of implications one is that we

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980
couple of implications one is that we
 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.510
couple of implications one is that we
probably that our understanding of what

probably that our understanding of what
 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.180
probably that our understanding of what
creativity requires which is very

needs to be a little more nuanced and so

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930
needs to be a little more nuanced and so
 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.090
needs to be a little more nuanced and so
when we think of it as a public policy

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100
when we think of it as a public policy
 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.710

rights which is what copyrights and

rights which is what copyrights and

think about how different industries we

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990
think about how different industries we
 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.120
think about how different industries we
need to be a little more industry

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130
need to be a little more industry
 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.580
need to be a little more industry
specific so rather than a blanket set of

fashion designers a kind of copyright
 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.110
fashion designers a kind of copyright
and that's probably not necessary right

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
and that's probably not necessary right
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.850
and that's probably not necessary right
so and there may be other cases in which

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
so and there may be other cases in which
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.449
so and there may be other cases in which
it's not necessary I think generally

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459
it's not necessary I think generally

we're very aggressive about intellectual

we're very aggressive about intellectual

understandably aggressive about

protecting it and that i think has been

an economic question right so one of the

an economic question right so one of the

an economic question right so one of the
things that we ought to think about when

things that we ought to think about when
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.229
things that we ought to think about when
we're thinking about how much protection

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239
we're thinking about how much protection
 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.020
we're thinking about how much protection
should be given is what should be in the

should the protection be and there i

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549
should the protection be and there i

we've kind of
gone well beyond what's reasonable and
