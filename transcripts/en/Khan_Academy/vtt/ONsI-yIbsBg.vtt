00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:03.567
- [Voiceover] Order the
fractions from least to greatest.

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:05.065
So we have three fractions,

00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:07.781
and we wanna decide which
one is the smallest,

00:00:07.781 --> 00:00:09.123
which one's in the middle,

00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:11.658
and which is the greatest.

00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:14.400
So one thing we could do
is look at the fractions,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.963
think about what they
mean, and then estimate.

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:20.367
7/10, let's say maybe that could represent

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.380
seven of your 10 friends
are wearing blue jeans.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.407
Well, that's most.

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:27.462
Most of your friends
are wearing blue jeans,

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:28.691
and then for 1/3,

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:31.983
we could say one of your
three teachers wears glasses.

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:33.061
Well, that's not most.

00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.418
If only one of the three wears glasses,

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.269
that's not most of the group.

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.783
So here's a fraction that
represents most of the group.

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:42.275
Here's one that doesn't.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.757
So the most is probably greater.

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:45.874
These two we could compare

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:48.684
by estimating and see that this one, 7/10,

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:51.685
is probably greater than 1/3.

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.895
But then we get over here to 5/6,

00:00:53.895 --> 00:00:55.476
and five out of six,

00:00:55.476 --> 00:00:57.699
well, again, that's most of the group,

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.243
but is this most of the group

00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:01.783
greater than the seven
tenths most of the group?

00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:04.616
That gets a lot trickier.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:07.582
So what we can do is we can try to change

00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:11.111
these fractions to make
them easier to compare

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.732
so we don't have to
compare 10ths to thirds

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:15.980
to sixths because those
are all different sizes,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.011
different sized groups,
different sized pieces,

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.507
that's tricky to compare.

00:01:20.507 --> 00:01:24.137
So we wanna change these
to be the same size.

00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:28.484
So we need some number, a
multiple of 10, three, and six,

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:32.542
something we can multiply
10, three, and six by

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:34.214
to get a new denominator

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:37.547
that will work for all of the fractions.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:40.353
One way I like to figure this out

00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:41.917
is I look at the biggest denominator,

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:43.334
which is 10,

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.372
and I think of its multiples.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:49.315
The first multiple is 10,
cause 10 times one is 10.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.815
Can we change thirds and sixths to have 10

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.277
as a denominator?

00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:57.286
Is there any whole number you can multiply

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:59.532
three times to get 10?

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:01.715
There's not, so we need to keep going.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:02.835
10 doesn't work.

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:05.378
The next multiple of 10 is 10 times two,

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.378
which is 20.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.330
Again, three and six,
is there a whole number

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.337
we can multiply them by to get 20?

00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:15.500
Again, no, so 20 doesn't work.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.583
How about 30?

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:20.506
Let's see, three,

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.953
we can multiple three times 10 to get 30,

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:24.917
so 30 works for three.

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.218
How about six?

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:28.800
Six times five equals 30, so yes.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.835
30 can work to be our common denominator.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:35.668
30ths, 30 is a multiple
of 10, three, and six.

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:39.928
So let's start converting our fractions

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:42.301
to have denominators of 30.

00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.408
We'll start with 7/10,

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:49.281
and we want it to have
a denominator of 30,

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.792
so what do we need to multiply by?

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:53.542
10 times three is 30.

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:56.967
We always multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:59.266
by the same number.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.516
So seven times three is 21.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.939
So 7/10 is equal to 21/30.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.204
These are equal.

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.016
We've just changed the size of the group.

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.947
We've changed the denominator

00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:15.483
so that they will be easier to compare,

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:18.635
but we've not changed
what portion of the group

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:20.076
we're representing.

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:22.404
Seven out of 10 is the same portion

00:03:22.404 --> 00:03:23.737
as 21 out of 30,

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.097
and then let's keep going with 1/3.

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:31.356
Again, we want a denominator of 30,

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:34.490
so this time we'll multiply three times 10

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.936
to get 30.

00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:38.059
Again, numerator also times 10.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.642
One times 10 is 10.

00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:43.929
10 out of 30 is the same as 1/3.

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:46.923
If you have 10 of the 30 people,

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:49.059
again, we'll use the wear glasses example,

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.213
or 1/3, that is the
same size of the group,

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:54.314
the same portion,

00:03:54.314 --> 00:03:58.123
and finally 5/6, what do
we need to multiply here

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.093
to get 30?

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:01.339
Six times five is 30,

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.603
so we multiply the numerator times five,

00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:05.770
and five times five is 25.

00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:10.888
So now, instead of
these original fractions

00:04:10.888 --> 00:04:13.042
that were tricky to compare,

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:15.021
we have much easier numbers to compare.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:17.104
We have 21/30,

00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:20.479
10/30,

00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:24.455
and 25/30.

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.064
So in this case,

00:04:28.064 --> 00:04:30.422
the pieces are all 30ths.

00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:32.129
They're all groups of 30.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.351
So this is much easier to compare.

00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:37.754
We can simply look at the numerators

00:04:37.754 --> 00:04:40.894
to see what portion of those 30

00:04:40.894 --> 00:04:42.855
the fraction represents.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:47.697
So the first 7/10 is the
same as 21 out of 30,

00:04:47.697 --> 00:04:50.019
whereas 1/3 is 10 out of 30.

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:53.961
Well, clearly 21 out of
30 is a larger portion

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.090
of the group than 10 out of 30.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.066
So we were right when we estimated up here

00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:01.659
that 7/10 is larger than 1/3,

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.290
but then the trickier one over here,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.892
now we can see much more clearly.

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:08.578
25 out of 30 is the greatest
portion of the group.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.328
25 is more than the 10 or the 21.

00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:15.538
So we can list these now
from least to greatest.

00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:18.870
The least, the smallest, is 10/30,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.011
which again, remember, is equal to 1/3.

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.644
So we can put 1/3 is least,

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:28.076
and we cross that off.

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:31.243
Next, it's either 21 out of 30, or 25.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:36.309
21 is less, and that represented 7/10,

00:05:37.306 --> 00:05:40.030
so we can say 7/10,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.234
'cause 21/30 equals 7/10,

00:05:43.234 --> 00:05:46.764
and finally that leaves us with 25/30,

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:49.931
which is equivalent to 5/6.

00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:53.120
So from least to greatest,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.801
our fractions are 1/3, 7/10,

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.396
and then 5/6.
