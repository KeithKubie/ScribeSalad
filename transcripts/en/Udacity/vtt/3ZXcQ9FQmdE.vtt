Now, I don't know about you, but I think this manual bug hunting is a little bit

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.892
tedious, so why don't we introduce you to some tools that will make our

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:14.786
lives a little bit easier. All the major browsers have developer tools

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:19.659
built into them that can help you with just the kind of problems that we are looking at,

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:24.070
and then some. Now if you're watching this in Google Chrome, you can open

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:28.405
the developer tools by moving over here, into Tools and

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:32.705
clicking on Developer Tools. Now you can see that there's a handy little shortcut here. Depending on

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:37.125
what platform you're on, that shortcut might be different. On Mac, it's Command

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:42.065
Option I. And you can see that it opens up this console here and if we were to

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:47.040
load our file with bugs into it, then you can see

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:52.045
that it starts catching syntax errors. Now, it only goes so far, and then it just crashes,

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:56.460
but you can see that it points us to the first syntax error here and then we can fix them as

00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:01.085
necessary. If we kept going with this by fixing this, let's say and then

00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:06.095
reloaded the page, you would see that it would get to the next error,

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:11.437
which is right in this for loop. Now, you notice that it skipped right over this error here:

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.770
didn't even catch it because the way Javascript handles semicolons.
