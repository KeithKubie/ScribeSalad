Posey mikhastam on Cicero's hey I as as
as I was introduced I work at NASA we

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
as I was introduced I work at NASA we
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.900
as I was introduced I work at NASA we
have a lab just on the other side of

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
have a lab just on the other side of
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600
have a lab just on the other side of
campus and we work mainly in climate

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
campus and we work mainly in climate
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.030
campus and we work mainly in climate
modeling so trying to put together

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
modeling so trying to put together
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799
modeling so trying to put together
everything that we understand about all

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
everything that we understand about all
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.970
everything that we understand about all
the different processes that are going

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
the different processes that are going
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860
the different processes that are going
on in order to understand the emergent

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
on in order to understand the emergent
 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470
on in order to understand the emergent
behavior of the climate and then

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
behavior of the climate and then
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.560
behavior of the climate and then
predicts baps what's going to happen to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
predicts baps what's going to happen to
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.459
predicts baps what's going to happen to
it and I'm going to speak mainly about

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469
it and I'm going to speak mainly about
 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.560
it and I'm going to speak mainly about
the new developments in clown modeling

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
the new developments in clown modeling
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.529
the new developments in clown modeling
that I think make climate modeling much

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
that I think make climate modeling much
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.990
that I think make climate modeling much
more interesting for stakeholders like

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
more interesting for stakeholders like
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.750
more interesting for stakeholders like
yourself or for policymakers who have

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
yourself or for policymakers who have
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.910
yourself or for policymakers who have
very specific questions that you might

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920
very specific questions that you might
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770
very specific questions that you might
want to ask about the climate or a bad

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
want to ask about the climate or a bad
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.950
want to ask about the climate or a bad
policy or about vulnerabilities that up

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
policy or about vulnerabilities that up
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920
policy or about vulnerabilities that up
until now people weren't really able to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
until now people weren't really able to
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.270
until now people weren't really able to
help you give that workout that answer

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280
help you give that workout that answer
 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.990
help you give that workout that answer
so you can think of this as kind of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
so you can think of this as kind of
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149
so you can think of this as kind of
couples therapy for the marriage between

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
couples therapy for the marriage between
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340
couples therapy for the marriage between
science and policy and we we work very

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
science and policy and we we work very
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550
science and policy and we we work very
much at that interface right so trying

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
much at that interface right so trying
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.080
much at that interface right so trying
to oh you know what let me stand over

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
to oh you know what let me stand over
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.280
to oh you know what let me stand over
here that's right

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.310
we work in a field where there's a lot

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320
we work in a field where there's a lot
 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.530
we work in a field where there's a lot
of interest in that field outside of the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540
of interest in that field outside of the
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.990
of interest in that field outside of the
scientific community there would be a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
scientific community there would be a
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.610
scientific community there would be a
lot of interests in it I think just

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620
lot of interests in it I think just
 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.050
lot of interests in it I think just
generally because it's a fascinating

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060
generally because it's a fascinating
 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.420
generally because it's a fascinating
subject but it's become much more

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430
subject but it's become much more
 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.390
subject but it's become much more
salient to policymakers to two

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400
salient to policymakers to two
 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.460
salient to policymakers to two
stakeholders and and so we find

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470
stakeholders and and so we find
 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.490
stakeholders and and so we find
ourselves thrust into a policy science

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500
ourselves thrust into a policy science
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.010
ourselves thrust into a policy science
Malay which which can be very awkward at

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020
Malay which which can be very awkward at
 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.190
Malay which which can be very awkward at
times and I think historically I think

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
times and I think historically I think
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.050
times and I think historically I think
it's safe to say that hasn't always been

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060
it's safe to say that hasn't always been
 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.330
it's safe to say that hasn't always been
handled very well and trying to come up

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340
handled very well and trying to come up
 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.420
handled very well and trying to come up
with new ways to improve that dialogue

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
with new ways to improve that dialogue
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.340
with new ways to improve that dialogue
that process is really what I'm going to

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350
that process is really what I'm going to
 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.250
that process is really what I'm going to
try and focus on here there's a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
try and focus on here there's a
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.100
try and focus on here there's a
fundamental disconnect basically

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
fundamental disconnect basically
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.740
fundamental disconnect basically
scientists speak in a very different

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
scientists speak in a very different
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.199
scientists speak in a very different
language than policymakers we're very

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209
language than policymakers we're very
 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.260
language than policymakers we're very
reductionist we're very okay let's break

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270
reductionist we're very okay let's break
 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.580
reductionist we're very okay let's break
it down to smaller and smaller

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
it down to smaller and smaller
 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.670
it down to smaller and smaller
components whereas the questions that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
components whereas the questions that
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.160
components whereas the questions that
are being asked of us are much more

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
are being asked of us are much more
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.020
are being asked of us are much more
holistic they're much larger scale

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030
holistic they're much larger scale
 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.470
holistic they're much larger scale
they're much more complex and we have

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480
they're much more complex and we have
 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.330
they're much more complex and we have
historically not answered those

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
historically not answered those
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.120
historically not answered those
questions in in that in that same thing

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
questions in in that in that same thing
 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.890
questions in in that in that same thing
we've we've responded to holistic

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900
we've we've responded to holistic
 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.600
we've we've responded to holistic
questions like what's going to happen

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610
questions like what's going to happen
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.690

about concentrations of carbon dioxide

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
about concentrations of carbon dioxide
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.530
about concentrations of carbon dioxide
or methane or aerosols and things like

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540
or methane or aerosols and things like
 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.229
or methane or aerosols and things like
that ah and so we have a fundamental

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239
that ah and so we have a fundamental
 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.960
that ah and so we have a fundamental
kind of disconnect that are more and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
kind of disconnect that are more and
 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.090
kind of disconnect that are more and
more people in the scientific end and I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100
more people in the scientific end and I
 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.229
more people in the scientific end and I
think more and more people and policy

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239
think more and more people and policy
 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.729
think more and more people and policy
and are realizing I can be bridged and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739
and are realizing I can be bridged and
 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.270
and are realizing I can be bridged and
I'll loop back at the end with some kind

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
I'll loop back at the end with some kind
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.220
I'll loop back at the end with some kind
of suggestions for how we can how we can

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230
of suggestions for how we can how we can
 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.050
of suggestions for how we can how we can
bridge that so what are the fundamental

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060
bridge that so what are the fundamental
 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.509
bridge that so what are the fundamental
issues okay so we're talking the same

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
issues okay so we're talking the same
 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.890
issues okay so we're talking the same
language you're talking about climate

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900
language you're talking about climate
 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.030
language you're talking about climate
we're talking about policy we're talking

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040
we're talking about policy we're talking
 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.310
we're talking about policy we're talking
about emissions but things are framed

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320
about emissions but things are framed
 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.199
about emissions but things are framed
very differently from the scientific n

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
very differently from the scientific n
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.789
very differently from the scientific n
as from the policymaker and all the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799
as from the policymaker and all the
 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.759
as from the policymaker and all the
stakeholder and we're very focused on

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769
stakeholder and we're very focused on
 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.620

constituents people spend their entire

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459
constituents people spend their entire
 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.520
constituents people spend their entire
lives trying to work out you know the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530
lives trying to work out you know the
 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.750
lives trying to work out you know the
the the properties and an impacts of a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
the the properties and an impacts of a
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.470
the the properties and an impacts of a
single molecule right I mean so there's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480
single molecule right I mean so there's
 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.700
single molecule right I mean so there's
a very reductionist

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710
a very reductionist
 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.970
a very reductionist
that's the way we make progress um but

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980
that's the way we make progress um but
 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.380
that's the way we make progress um but
but this is not necessarily the most

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390
but this is not necessarily the most
 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.120
but this is not necessarily the most
relevant thing for policy makers or

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130
relevant thing for policy makers or
 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.290
relevant thing for policy makers or
stakeholders you know you want to know

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300
stakeholders you know you want to know
 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.690
stakeholders you know you want to know
what is this action going to do what is

consequences of anything I do we're

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270
consequences of anything I do we're
 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.740
consequences of anything I do we're
often very single issue whereas you know

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
often very single issue whereas you know
 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.990
often very single issue whereas you know
policy makers have to multitask you know

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000
policy makers have to multitask you know

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989
being forced to sit in front of a TV
 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.930
being forced to sit in front of a TV
channel with 500 different channels and

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940
channel with 500 different channels and
 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.280
channel with 500 different channels and
somebody else is turning the channel

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290
somebody else is turning the channel
 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.850
somebody else is turning the channel
every five minutes right so we're that

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860
every five minutes right so we're that
 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.580
every five minutes right so we're that
doesn't that doesn't work for us so

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590
doesn't that doesn't work for us so
 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.530
doesn't that doesn't work for us so
obviously policymakers are interested in

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
obviously policymakers are interested in
 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.150
obviously policymakers are interested in
lots of other things not just climate in

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160
lots of other things not just climate in
 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.680
lots of other things not just climate in
air quality and pollution in public

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690

their people all of these things are

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750
their people all of these things are
 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.840
their people all of these things are
linked in the policymakers mind and

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850
linked in the policymakers mind and
 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.400
linked in the policymakers mind and
often in the scientists mind they're

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410
often in the scientists mind they're
 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.720
often in the scientists mind they're
completely set okay so we we set up a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730
completely set okay so we we set up a
 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.400
completely set okay so we we set up a
process along with governments but but

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410
process along with governments but but
 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.150
process along with governments but but
mainly that is run by scientists I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160
mainly that is run by scientists I
 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.100
mainly that is run by scientists I
called the IPCC that was supposed to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110
called the IPCC that was supposed to
 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.960
called the IPCC that was supposed to
deal with this right there was supposed

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970
deal with this right there was supposed
 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.900

to be the one stop shop that would allow

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910
to be the one stop shop that would allow
 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.360
to be the one stop shop that would allow
science to feed into an assessment

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370
science to feed into an assessment
 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.060

process which would then be used by the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070
process which would then be used by the
 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.880
process which would then be used by the
rest of the world but that but the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890
rest of the world but that but the
 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.580
rest of the world but that but the
problem is is not really with the IPCC

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590
problem is is not really with the IPCC
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.340

and it does a very good job at what it
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.410
and it does a very good job at what it
does but but it doesn't quite do the

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420
does but but it doesn't quite do the
 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.050
does but but it doesn't quite do the
right job that's actually required and

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060
right job that's actually required and
 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.900
right job that's actually required and
mainly nets because the IPCC is an

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910
mainly nets because the IPCC is an
 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.820
mainly nets because the IPCC is an
assessment of the science by the

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830
assessment of the science by the
 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.670
assessment of the science by the
scientists for the scientists right and

if you've ever read any of the chapters

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180
if you've ever read any of the chapters
 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.430
if you've ever read any of the chapters

so if you actually dive into the
chapters you will see that that they're

chapters you will see that that they're
 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.010
chapters you will see that that they're
not answering big questions they're

confusing the issue so this is this is a
 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.890
confusing the issue so this is this is a
picture that was in the summary for

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900
picture that was in the summary for
 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.230
picture that was in the summary for
policymakers i think it was figure 1 or

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240
policymakers i think it was figure 1 or
 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.629
policymakers i think it was figure 1 or
figure 2 and what it does is it breaks

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639
figure 2 and what it does is it breaks
 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.000
figure 2 and what it does is it breaks
down all the things that have really

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010

various things so the biggest thing of

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020
various things so the biggest thing of
 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.779
various things so the biggest thing of
course is that common dioxide has

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789
course is that common dioxide has
 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.719
course is that common dioxide has
increased by over 100 ppm methane has

emissions of reactive gases like knocks
and carbon monoxide we've increased

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900
and carbon monoxide we've increased
 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.840
and carbon monoxide we've increased
stars for water vapor we've increased

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850

have a cooling effect their blue all

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190
have a cooling effect their blue all
 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.340
have a cooling effect their blue all
these have a warming effect and if you

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350
these have a warming effect and if you
 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.719
these have a warming effect and if you
add up all of these things you get a

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729
add up all of these things you get a
 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.110
add up all of these things you get a
total net human activity which is very

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120
total net human activity which is very
 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.750
total net human activity which is very
large and very warming right so this is

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760
large and very warming right so this is
 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.000
large and very warming right so this is
basically you know why the planet has

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010
basically you know why the planet has
 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.180
basically you know why the planet has
been warming over the last hundred years

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190
been warming over the last hundred years
 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.650
been warming over the last hundred years
but this is very much a scientific point

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.660
but this is very much a scientific point
 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.960
but this is very much a scientific point
of view we've broken up all the things

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:49.970
of view we've broken up all the things
 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.480
of view we've broken up all the things
that we can measure and we've said okay

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.490
that we can measure and we've said okay
 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.640
that we can measure and we've said okay
well that's responsible for this amounts

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.650
well that's responsible for this amounts
 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.950
well that's responsible for this amounts
of radiative forcing this is responsible

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960
of radiative forcing this is responsible
 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.120
of radiative forcing this is responsible
for this amount and then we're just

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.130
for this amount and then we're just
 

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.370
for this amount and then we're just
going to add them all up none of the

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:00.380
going to add them all up none of the
 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.730
going to add them all up none of the
things on here give you any guidance as

things on here give you any guidance as
 

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.380
things on here give you any guidance as
to how you might deal with

to how you might deal with
 

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.960
to how you might deal with

so far um the key thing is that

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:40.670
so far um the key thing is that
 

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.710
so far um the key thing is that

they're linked differently in different
 

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.630
they're linked differently in different
regions so the linkage between emissions

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640
regions so the linkage between emissions

like that so we have to start taking
 

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.170
like that so we have to start taking
that into account um now I'm going to

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:17.180
that into account um now I'm going to
 

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.730

useful um and so i'll start off with
 

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.000
useful um and so i'll start off with
with some things that i think that they

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.010
with some things that i think that they
 

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.290
with some things that i think that they
are useful for and i'll come back to

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:29.300
are useful for and i'll come back to
 

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.940
are useful for and i'll come back to
other things that i don't think that

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:30.950

we make it bigger or make it smaller or

we include a process

so what can't models do okay so models

can't give you perfect long-term or

so if there's new physics if there's

so if there's new physics if there's
 

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:28.540

something new that is going to happen in

that the models will be able to tell you

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:50.870
example of when that did that that was
 

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.139
example of when that did that that was
exactly the case the polar ozone hole

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:53.149
exactly the case the polar ozone hole
 

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:55.900
exactly the case the polar ozone hole
over Antarctica and very recently over

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:55.910
over Antarctica and very recently over
 

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.809
over Antarctica and very recently over
the Arctic I was not predicted ahead of

00:15:58.809 --> 00:15:58.819
the Arctic I was not predicted ahead of
 

00:15:58.819 --> 00:16:02.860
the Arctic I was not predicted ahead of
time by anybody instead the the models

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:02.870
time by anybody instead the the models
 

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.239
time by anybody instead the the models
that were looking at ozone depletion

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:04.249
that were looking at ozone depletion
 

00:16:04.249 --> 00:16:07.559
that were looking at ozone depletion
back in the early 80s showed a pretty

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:07.569
back in the early 80s showed a pretty
 

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:10.660
back in the early 80s showed a pretty
steady decrease in in ozone to the

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:10.670
steady decrease in in ozone to the
 

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.249
steady decrease in in ozone to the
extent that people were already worried

00:16:12.249 --> 00:16:12.259
extent that people were already worried
 

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:14.319
extent that people were already worried
and they were already talking about the

00:16:14.319 --> 00:16:14.329
and they were already talking about the
 

00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:17.019
and they were already talking about the
Montreal Protocol but they didn't

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:17.029
Montreal Protocol but they didn't
 

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:19.840
Montreal Protocol but they didn't
include the chemistry that happens in

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:19.850
include the chemistry that happens in
 

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.549
include the chemistry that happens in
the polar vortex when it gets really

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:21.559
the polar vortex when it gets really
 

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.929
the polar vortex when it gets really
cold and you form these little particles

00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:22.939
cold and you form these little particles
 

00:16:22.939 --> 00:16:24.489
cold and you form these little particles
and there's a whole new set of chemistry

00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:24.499
and there's a whole new set of chemistry
 

00:16:24.499 --> 00:16:26.319
and there's a whole new set of chemistry
there occurs on these small particles

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:26.329
there occurs on these small particles
 

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:28.749
there occurs on these small particles
because they'd never been observed right

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759
because they'd never been observed right
 

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:32.860
because they'd never been observed right
and that set up the ozone hole and led

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:32.870
and that set up the ozone hole and led
 

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:39.100
and that set up the ozone hole and led
to a great realization that you know

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:39.110
to a great realization that you know
 

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.650
to a great realization that you know
models are not crystal balls they can

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:41.660
models are not crystal balls they can
 

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.299
models are not crystal balls they can
only tell you what you've put in and

00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:43.309
only tell you what you've put in and
 

00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:49.119
only tell you what you've put in and
what you've already seen so what we're

00:16:49.119 --> 00:16:49.129
what you've already seen so what we're
 

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:52.600
what you've already seen so what we're
trying to do it is something that is

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.610
trying to do it is something that is
 

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.669
trying to do it is something that is
actually very ambitious intellectually

00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:54.679
actually very ambitious intellectually
 

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.769
actually very ambitious intellectually
ambitious what we're trying to do is is

00:16:56.769 --> 00:16:56.779
ambitious what we're trying to do is is
 

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:59.460
ambitious what we're trying to do is is
just from a knowledge of all

00:16:59.460 --> 00:16:59.470
just from a knowledge of all
 

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.620
just from a knowledge of all
small scale processes that are going on

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:01.630
small scale processes that are going on
 

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.630
small scale processes that are going on
the chemistry that that's going on

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640
the chemistry that that's going on
 

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.060
the chemistry that that's going on
around us how clouds form how water

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.070
around us how clouds form how water
 

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.950
around us how clouds form how water
evaporates from the ocean how will the

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:07.960
evaporates from the ocean how will the
 

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.200
evaporates from the ocean how will the
winds push the ocean currents around how

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.210
winds push the ocean currents around how
 

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.930
winds push the ocean currents around how
soil moisture evaporates all of these

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:12.940
soil moisture evaporates all of these
 

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.550
soil moisture evaporates all of these
things we can go and measure them we can

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:14.560
things we can go and measure them we can
 

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.290
things we can go and measure them we can
we can kind of quantify them and then

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:16.300
we can kind of quantify them and then
 

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.580
we can kind of quantify them and then
we're going to put them all together and

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:17.590
we're going to put them all together and
 

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:20.490
we're going to put them all together and
we're trying to predict how the whole

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.500
we're trying to predict how the whole
 

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.710
we're trying to predict how the whole
system evolves just some just from

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720
system evolves just some just from
 

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.470
system evolves just some just from
knowledge of the smallest scales and

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480
knowledge of the smallest scales and
 

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.240
knowledge of the smallest scales and
it's not obvious that that is possible

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:27.250
it's not obvious that that is possible
 

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.170
it's not obvious that that is possible
but it does turn out to be reasonably

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:31.180
but it does turn out to be reasonably
 

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.090
but it does turn out to be reasonably
doable and so we're trying to predict

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.100
doable and so we're trying to predict
 

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.010
doable and so we're trying to predict
you know the climate ology why do we

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:35.020
you know the climate ology why do we
 

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.540
you know the climate ology why do we
have the seasonal cycle that we do what

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:36.550
have the seasonal cycle that we do what
 

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.520
have the seasonal cycle that we do what
what what controls the magnitude of

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.530
what what controls the magnitude of
 

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.500
what what controls the magnitude of
those variations we're trying to predict

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:40.510
those variations we're trying to predict
 

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.480
those variations we're trying to predict
all of those things just from looking at

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:42.490
all of those things just from looking at
 

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.100
all of those things just from looking at
all those different processes and then

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.110
all those different processes and then
 

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.030
all those different processes and then
we're trying to understand the

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.040
we're trying to understand the
 

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.000
we're trying to understand the
variability of that system right again

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.010
variability of that system right again
 

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.460
variability of that system right again
that variability is intrinsic to the

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.470
that variability is intrinsic to the
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.320
that variability is intrinsic to the
system it's an emergent property of the

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.330
system it's an emergent property of the
 

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.060
system it's an emergent property of the
system but it isn't something that's a

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.070
system but it isn't something that's a
 

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.790
system but it isn't something that's a
priority predictable just from you know

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:56.800
priority predictable just from you know
 

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.560
priority predictable just from you know
knowing that water evaporates from the

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:58.570
knowing that water evaporates from the
 

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.630
knowing that water evaporates from the
ocean that doesn't tell you what the

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640
ocean that doesn't tell you what the
 

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.730
ocean that doesn't tell you what the
magnitude of different storm systems is

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:02.740
magnitude of different storm systems is
 

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.200
magnitude of different storm systems is
going to be in the northern latitudes

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.210
going to be in the northern latitudes
 

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.810
going to be in the northern latitudes
for instance and if that was just all

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:06.820
for instance and if that was just all
 

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.340
for instance and if that was just all
that we were doing I think that would be

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:08.350
that we were doing I think that would be
 

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.370
that we were doing I think that would be
a very interesting intellectual exercise

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380
a very interesting intellectual exercise
 

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.480
a very interesting intellectual exercise
we'd have lots of people interested in

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.490
we'd have lots of people interested in
 

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.880
we'd have lots of people interested in
it because it's so complex but that's

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:14.890
it because it's so complex but that's
 

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.200
it because it's so complex but that's
not really why we're being funded we're

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.210
not really why we're being funded we're
 

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.530
not really why we're being funded we're
being funded because we humans are

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:19.540
being funded because we humans are
 

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.510
being funded because we humans are

we've matured as a science as a few

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.250
we've matured as a science as a few

bored to the point where we've got a
 

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.420
bored to the point where we've got a
pretty good idea about what these things

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:16.430
pretty good idea about what these things
 

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.230
pretty good idea about what these things
are doing and then we'd ask questions

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240
are doing and then we'd ask questions
 

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.000
are doing and then we'd ask questions
well you know what if we change the the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.010
well you know what if we change the the

the last five or so years is that we've

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:40.940
the last five or so years is that we've
 

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.690
the last five or so years is that we've
added funnel more complexity to this

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:43.700
added funnel more complexity to this
 

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.990
added funnel more complexity to this
we've added cycles that control methane

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000
we've added cycles that control methane
 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.180
we've added cycles that control methane
and the carbon cycle and aerosols and

way than we were doing before and this

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:00.920
way than we were doing before and this
 

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.910
way than we were doing before and this
has made the models far more complete

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:03.920
has made the models far more complete
 

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.850
has made the models far more complete
and in it and it's expanded enormously

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:06.860
and in it and it's expanded enormously

the main main air pollutant that people
 

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.000
the main main air pollutant that people
worry about and that's driven this

ozone that's available and so we've got

00:20:59.740 --> 00:20:59.750
ozone that's available and so we've got
 

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.230

don't actually emit ozone it's just

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:10.670
don't actually emit ozone it's just
 

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.460
don't actually emit ozone it's just
something that emerges in the atmosphere

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.470
something that emerges in the atmosphere
 

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.800
something that emerges in the atmosphere
it's also that that's both the

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:14.810
it's also that that's both the
 

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.130
it's also that that's both the
greenhouse gas and a pollutant and that

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:18.140
greenhouse gas and a pollutant and that
 

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.530

flipping these things around I'm not
quite sure why but anyway this is this

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679
quite sure why but anyway this is this

having all right let's ask the question

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:22.820
having all right let's ask the question
 

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.759
having all right let's ask the question
what are we putting into the atmosphere

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:24.769
what are we putting into the atmosphere
 

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:27.759
what are we putting into the atmosphere
and what impact is that having and what

00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:27.769
and what impact is that having and what
 

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:31.330
and what impact is that having and what
you see is that there are big

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:31.340
you see is that there are big
 

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.089
you see is that there are big
differences so remember that ozone is

00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:34.099
differences so remember that ozone is
 

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:36.430
differences so remember that ozone is
not directly emitted sulfate is not

emitted stratospheric water is not

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:40.129
emitted stratospheric water is not
 

00:22:40.129 --> 00:22:43.509
emitted stratospheric water is not
directly emitted instead we're emitting

00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:43.519
directly emitted instead we're emitting
 

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:46.089
directly emitted instead we're emitting
carbon dioxide okay calm dog side is

00:22:46.089 --> 00:22:46.099

pretty much are inert chemically so what

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:49.369
pretty much are inert chemically so what
 

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:51.609
pretty much are inert chemically so what
you put up is what that ends up staying

00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:51.619
you put up is what that ends up staying
 

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:54.190
you put up is what that ends up staying
there but methane is very reactive and

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200
there but methane is very reactive and
 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.529
there but methane is very reactive and
so when you put methane into the

00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:56.539
so when you put methane into the
 

00:22:56.539 --> 00:22:58.659
so when you put methane into the
atmosphere you end up with more methane

00:22:58.659 --> 00:22:58.669
atmosphere you end up with more methane
 

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:00.339
atmosphere you end up with more methane
in the atmosphere but you also end up

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:00.349
in the atmosphere but you also end up
 

00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:02.320
in the atmosphere but you also end up
with more ozone you also end up with

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.330
with more ozone you also end up with
 

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.909
with more ozone you also end up with
more stratospheric water vapor and you

00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919
more stratospheric water vapor and you
 

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.589
more stratospheric water vapor and you
also end up a little with a little less

00:23:05.589 --> 00:23:05.599
also end up a little with a little less
 

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:07.779
also end up a little with a little less
sulfate and a little bit more on nitrate

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:07.789
sulfate and a little bit more on nitrate
 

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:10.570
sulfate and a little bit more on nitrate
so the net effect of methane if you

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.580
so the net effect of methane if you
 

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.399
so the net effect of methane if you
think about methane being emitted as

00:23:12.399 --> 00:23:12.409
think about methane being emitted as
 

00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:14.139
think about methane being emitted as
opposed to methane being in the

00:23:14.139 --> 00:23:14.149
opposed to methane being in the
 

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:16.450
opposed to methane being in the
atmosphere already it kind of doubles

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:16.460
atmosphere already it kind of doubles
 

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.249
atmosphere already it kind of doubles
the impact of methane in any of these

00:23:18.249 --> 00:23:18.259
the impact of methane in any of these
 

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:20.820
the impact of methane in any of these
budgets so this gives you a much better

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:20.830
budgets so this gives you a much better
 

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.759
budgets so this gives you a much better
grasp of what it is that one should be

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:24.769
grasp of what it is that one should be
 

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:27.580
grasp of what it is that one should be
doing in order to reduce the abundances

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:27.590
doing in order to reduce the abundances
 

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:32.489
doing in order to reduce the abundances
of important species in the atmosphere

00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:32.499
 

00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:34.960
emissions come from many different

emissions come from many different
 

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.520
emissions come from many different
places and different emissions

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:39.530
places and different emissions
 

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.700

different industries have different
 

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.930
different industries have different
fingerprints and emissions so for

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:46.940
fingerprints and emissions so for
 

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.920

instance biofuels particularly in Asia

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:49.930
instance biofuels particularly in Asia
 

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.390
instance biofuels particularly in Asia
produce a lot of carbon monoxide a

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400
produce a lot of carbon monoxide a
 

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.610
produce a lot of carbon monoxide a
little bit of NOx and a fair bit of

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:54.620
little bit of NOx and a fair bit of
 

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.850

volatile organics arm but don't produce

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:57.860
volatile organics arm but don't produce
 

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.900
volatile organics arm but don't produce
very much sulfate but industry and power

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:00.910
very much sulfate but industry and power
 

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.400
very much sulfate but industry and power
produce a lot more sulfate particularly

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:03.410
produce a lot more sulfate particularly
 

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.860
produce a lot more sulfate particularly
in Asia but don't produce very much in

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:05.870
in Asia but don't produce very much in
 

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.350
in Asia but don't produce very much in
the way of carbon monoxide and VOCs

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360
the way of carbon monoxide and VOCs
 

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.880
the way of carbon monoxide and VOCs
because the combustion that goes on in a

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:09.890
because the combustion that goes on in a
 

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.560
because the combustion that goes on in a
power station is much more efficient

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:11.570
power station is much more efficient
 

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.180
power station is much more efficient
than the combustion that goes on in the

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:13.190
than the combustion that goes on in the
 

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.950
than the combustion that goes on in the
house or in a small industrial

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960
house or in a small industrial
 

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.040

environment so depending on what it is

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.050
environment so depending on what it is
 

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.570
environment so depending on what it is
that you're doing and where it is you're

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:19.580
that you're doing and where it is you're
 

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.160
that you're doing and where it is you're
doing it you have a different

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.170
doing it you have a different
 

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.080
doing it you have a different
fingerprint of emissions and so

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.090
fingerprint of emissions and so
 

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.800
fingerprint of emissions and so
therefore you're going to have a

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:23.810
therefore you're going to have a
 

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.500
therefore you're going to have a
different impact on air pollution

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:26.510
different impact on air pollution
 

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.330

climate and then the net effects of all

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:28.340
climate and then the net effects of all
 

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.550
climate and then the net effects of all
of those things so I'll give you a

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:30.560
of those things so I'll give you a
 

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.810
of those things so I'll give you a
couple of examples some transportation

black carbon which is an aerosol which
 

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.200
black carbon which is an aerosol which
is absorbing so that's a warming effect

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.210
is absorbing so that's a warming effect
 

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.540
is absorbing so that's a warming effect
but is also particulate matter so that's

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:52.550
but is also particulate matter so that's
 

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.860

they're domestically controlled so you

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960
they're domestically controlled so you
 

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.890
they're domestically controlled so you
know it's a very kind of Tidy system if

take the on road transportation sector
 

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.990
take the on road transportation sector
so this is the net forcings from on road

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000
so this is the net forcings from on road
 

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.110
so this is the net forcings from on road
transportation so this is positive

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120
transportation so this is positive

okay well what about power generation
now this is on a 20 year horizon so if

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:54.590
now this is on a 20 year horizon so if
 

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.549
now this is on a 20 year horizon so if
you if you took a longer horizon then

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:57.559
you if you took a longer horizon then
 

00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:59.260

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:08.090
biggest source of carbon dioxide is is
industry and power and they produce very

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100
industry and power and they produce very
 

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.000
industry and power and they produce very
different short-lived species impacts so

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.010
different short-lived species impacts so
 

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.560
different short-lived species impacts so
the short list species of the aerosols

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:12.570
the short list species of the aerosols
 

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.170
the short list species of the aerosols
ozone black carbon and they're like and

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.180
ozone black carbon and they're like and
 

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.210
ozone black carbon and they're like and
so when you put these things together

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220
so when you put these things together
 

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.080
so when you put these things together
and you ask yourself okay well you know

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.090
and you ask yourself okay well you know
 

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.340
and you ask yourself okay well you know
should you have tackle the things with

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:22.350
should you have tackle the things with
 

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.870
should you have tackle the things with
the biggest carbon dioxide footprint or

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880
the biggest carbon dioxide footprint or
 

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.400
the biggest carbon dioxide footprint or
should you tackle the things which have

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:25.410
should you tackle the things which have
 

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.590
should you tackle the things which have
the biggest net footprint okay the

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600
the biggest net footprint okay the
 

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.770
the biggest net footprint okay the
answer is very different and it's

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:30.780
answer is very different and it's
 

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.150
answer is very different and it's
different depending on where you are the

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.160
different depending on where you are the
 

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.900
different depending on where you are the
other three here based on Asian patterns

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:35.910
other three here based on Asian patterns
 

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.770
other three here based on Asian patterns
of behavior so domestic burning agent

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:39.780
of behavior so domestic burning agent
 

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.810
of behavior so domestic burning agent
transport and Asian industry and what

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820
transport and Asian industry and what
 

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.160
transport and Asian industry and what
you'll notice is that Asian industry

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:43.170
you'll notice is that Asian industry
 

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.950
you'll notice is that Asian industry
produces a lot more sulfate because it's

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960
produces a lot more sulfate because it's
 

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.170
produces a lot more sulfate because it's
much dirtier and so if you look at the

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:48.180
much dirtier and so if you look at the
 

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.450
much dirtier and so if you look at the
the net impacts hear you say okay well

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460
the net impacts hear you say okay well
 

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.880
the net impacts hear you say okay well
if you just looked at the carbon dioxide

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:52.890
if you just looked at the carbon dioxide
 

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.470
if you just looked at the carbon dioxide
you'd have said industry and power with

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480
you'd have said industry and power with
 

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.790
you'd have said industry and power with
the two big things that you had to

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:55.800
the two big things that you had to
 

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.880
the two big things that you had to
tackle if you actually look at the net

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:58.890
tackle if you actually look at the net
 

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.040
tackle if you actually look at the net
impact what you find is the surface

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.050
impact what you find is the surface
 

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.590
impact what you find is the surface
transportation in north america and the

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600
transportation in north america and the
 

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.240
transportation in north america and the
domestic burning of biomass or fossil

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:08.250

problem right so this would this would

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:14.190
problem right so this would this would
 

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.520
problem right so this would this would
give you a different perspective on the

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:16.530
give you a different perspective on the
 

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.710
give you a different perspective on the
on which policies you would want to be

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720
on which policies you would want to be
 

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:24.309
on which policies you would want to be
tackling first

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:24.319
 

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:32.059
the intensity of right so so totally

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:32.069
the intensity of right so so totally
 

00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:33.889
the intensity of right so so totally
tell me so so this the thirty percent

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899
tell me so so this the thirty percent
 

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:35.569
tell me so so this the thirty percent
reduction that was just like okay well

00:32:35.569 --> 00:32:35.579
reduction that was just like okay well
 

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.859
reduction that was just like okay well
what should what should we use because

00:32:36.859 --> 00:32:36.869
what should what should we use because
 

00:32:36.869 --> 00:32:39.109
what should what should we use because
we do this right so both I'll move to

00:32:39.109 --> 00:32:39.119
we do this right so both I'll move to
 

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:41.809
we do this right so both I'll move to
next what's feasible and and what what

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:41.819
next what's feasible and and what what
 

00:32:41.819 --> 00:32:43.849
next what's feasible and and what what
people have actually that the technology

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:43.859
people have actually that the technology
 

00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:45.169
people have actually that the technology
exists and it's been probably costs

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179
exists and it's been probably costs
 

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:49.039
exists and it's been probably costs
didn't everything the European

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:49.049
didn't everything the European
 

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:50.269
didn't everything the European
contribution looks very much like the

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279
contribution looks very much like the
 

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:53.719
contribution looks very much like the
North American contribution it's the the

00:32:53.719 --> 00:32:53.729
North American contribution it's the the
 

00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:56.539
North American contribution it's the the
mix of sources and emission profiles for

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:56.549
mix of sources and emission profiles for
 

00:32:56.549 --> 00:33:01.809
mix of sources and emission profiles for
different activities is quite similar

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:01.819
 

00:33:01.819 --> 00:33:04.879
right so so it's the question is whether

00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:04.889
right so so it's the question is whether
 

00:33:04.889 --> 00:33:06.979
right so so it's the question is whether
you can have a feasible reduction in any

00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:06.989
you can have a feasible reduction in any
 

00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:10.430
you can have a feasible reduction in any
of these things okay so I said that

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440
of these things okay so I said that
 

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.649
of these things okay so I said that
already so I'm just going to skip that

00:33:11.649 --> 00:33:11.659
already so I'm just going to skip that
 

00:33:11.659 --> 00:33:16.309
already so I'm just going to skip that
okay so very recently there was a report

00:33:16.309 --> 00:33:16.319
okay so very recently there was a report
 

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:19.339
okay so very recently there was a report
that was there was commissioned by new

00:33:19.339 --> 00:33:19.349
that was there was commissioned by new
 

00:33:19.349 --> 00:33:24.379
that was there was commissioned by new
net to look at feasible reductions in

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:24.389
net to look at feasible reductions in
 

00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:29.029
net to look at feasible reductions in
black carbon and ozone via emission

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039
black carbon and ozone via emission
 

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.999
black carbon and ozone via emission
emission controls on particulates on

00:33:31.999 --> 00:33:32.009
emission controls on particulates on
 

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:34.759
emission controls on particulates on
methane on carbon monoxide on volatile

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:34.769
methane on carbon monoxide on volatile
 

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:38.389
methane on carbon monoxide on volatile
organics where they did exactly what

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399
organics where they did exactly what
 

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.039
organics where they did exactly what
you're saying what is actually feasible

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:40.049
you're saying what is actually feasible
 

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:43.279
you're saying what is actually feasible
in what location using what technology

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:43.289
in what location using what technology
 

00:33:43.289 --> 00:33:44.599
in what location using what technology
and so what they did was they took

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:44.609
and so what they did was they took
 

00:33:44.609 --> 00:33:46.699
and so what they did was they took
existing technologies that have been

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:46.709
existing technologies that have been
 

00:33:46.709 --> 00:33:50.299
existing technologies that have been
deployed already in various places and

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:50.309
deployed already in various places and
 

00:33:50.309 --> 00:33:51.859
deployed already in various places and
said well what would happen if we

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:51.869
said well what would happen if we
 

00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:54.739
said well what would happen if we
deployed these things more widely and

00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:54.749
deployed these things more widely and
 

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:57.739
deployed these things more widely and
they had three groups of measures are

00:33:57.739 --> 00:33:57.749
they had three groups of measures are
 

00:33:57.749 --> 00:34:01.839
they had three groups of measures are
one was just just controls on methane

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:01.849
one was just just controls on methane
 

00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:04.789
one was just just controls on methane
that would be this this first column in

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799
that would be this this first column in
 

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:07.069
that would be this this first column in
the different pictures the second group

00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:07.079
the different pictures the second group
 

00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:08.779
the different pictures the second group
of measures is the controls on methane

00:34:08.779 --> 00:34:08.789
of measures is the controls on methane
 

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:10.940
of measures is the controls on methane
and then controls on black carbon so

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:10.950
and then controls on black carbon so
 

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.629
and then controls on black carbon so
this is like certain and an organic

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639
this is like certain and an organic
 

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.039
this is like certain and an organic
carbon and then if you had the the third

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:19.049
carbon and then if you had the the third
 

00:34:19.049 --> 00:34:21.139
carbon and then if you had the the third
scenario was if you control methane and

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:21.149
scenario was if you control methane and
 

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:22.369
scenario was if you control methane and
then you used all of the black carbon

00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379
then you used all of the black carbon
 

00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:24.980
then you used all of the black carbon
reduction technologies that currently

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:24.990
reduction technologies that currently
 

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.919
reduction technologies that currently
exist and what they try to do is they

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:27.929
exist and what they try to do is they
 

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:30.769
exist and what they try to do is they
tried to go all the way down so you can

00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:30.779
tried to go all the way down so you can
 

00:34:30.779 --> 00:34:32.089
tried to go all the way down so you can
say okay well what impact of these

00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099
say okay well what impact of these
 

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:34.159
say okay well what impact of these
things going to have on climate right so

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:34.169
things going to have on climate right so
 

00:34:34.169 --> 00:34:35.869
things going to have on climate right so
we can calculate the climate forcing

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879
we can calculate the climate forcing
 

00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:37.129
we can calculate the climate forcing
from that we can calculate the

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139
from that we can calculate the
 

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:37.570
from that we can calculate the
temperature

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:37.580
temperature
 

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.460
temperature
changes rainfall changes and things like

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:39.470
changes rainfall changes and things like
 

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.800
changes rainfall changes and things like
that and you'll see that the more stuff

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:41.810
that and you'll see that the more stuff
 

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.570
that and you'll see that the more stuff
you do the bigger impact it had on

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:43.580
you do the bigger impact it had on
 

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.540
you do the bigger impact it had on
climate okay well that's not surprising

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:45.550
climate okay well that's not surprising
 

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.630
climate okay well that's not surprising
um but remember that these things also

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:49.640
um but remember that these things also
 

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.720
um but remember that these things also
affect ozone ozone is one of the key

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:54.730
affect ozone ozone is one of the key
 

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.430
affect ozone ozone is one of the key
problematic evolution species for food

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440
problematic evolution species for food
 

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.030
problematic evolution species for food
and fur and for crop yield and so if you

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040
and fur and for crop yield and so if you
 

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.340
and fur and for crop yield and so if you
are you could this is the annually

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:03.350
are you could this is the annually
 

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.440
are you could this is the annually
avoided crop yield losses in millions of

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:05.450
avoided crop yield losses in millions of
 

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.720
avoided crop yield losses in millions of
tons associated with these measures

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:07.730
tons associated with these measures
 

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.240
tons associated with these measures
which are changing ozone as well as

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.250
which are changing ozone as well as
 

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.100
which are changing ozone as well as
changing was as well as reducing climate

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.110
changing was as well as reducing climate
 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.990
changing was as well as reducing climate
so you can see you can start to get

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000
so you can see you can start to get
 

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.200
so you can see you can start to get
really very large numbers in here so

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:17.210
really very large numbers in here so
 

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.630
really very large numbers in here so
this is you know 50 to 100 million tons

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640
this is you know 50 to 100 million tons
 

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.690
this is you know 50 to 100 million tons
of crop yield losses now what does that

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:22.700
of crop yield losses now what does that
 

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.740
of crop yield losses now what does that
cost right what's what's the what's the

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:25.750
cost right what's what's the what's the
 

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.940
cost right what's what's the what's the
what you know how'd it how does that

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:27.950
what you know how'd it how does that
 

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.700
what you know how'd it how does that
translate into into real dollars well

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:30.710
translate into into real dollars well
 

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.020
translate into into real dollars well
that's a little bit hard but we can get

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.030
that's a little bit hard but we can get
 

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.840
that's a little bit hard but we can get
to that 20 we can also look at human

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:34.850
to that 20 we can also look at human
 

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.830
to that 20 we can also look at human
health impacts ozone is is toxic

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:37.840
health impacts ozone is is toxic
 

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.110
health impacts ozone is is toxic
actually quite low concentrations and is

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:41.120
actually quite low concentrations and is
 

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.380
actually quite low concentrations and is
very clearly affected affects human

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:44.390
very clearly affected affects human
 

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.110
very clearly affected affects human
health and so as you start decreasing

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:47.120
health and so as you start decreasing
 

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.640
health and so as you start decreasing
the amount of ozone decreasing the

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:48.650
the amount of ozone decreasing the
 

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.040
the amount of ozone decreasing the
amount of black carbon you get you end

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.050
amount of black carbon you get you end
 

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.880
amount of black carbon you get you end
up with estimates of annually avoided

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:54.890
up with estimates of annually avoided
 

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.740
up with estimates of annually avoided
premature deaths in the millions of

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:56.750
premature deaths in the millions of
 

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.050
premature deaths in the millions of
lives okay and then you can say okay

00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.060
lives okay and then you can say okay
 

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.570

well just these little ones these little

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:01.580
well just these little ones these little
 

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.910
well just these little ones these little
things that we can actually count what

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920
things that we can actually count what
 

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.190
things that we can actually count what
would be the benefit of that Bobby the

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200
would be the benefit of that Bobby the
 

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.140
would be the benefit of that Bobby the
the cost savings in that and you end up

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:08.150
the cost savings in that and you end up
 

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:11.890
the cost savings in that and you end up
very very easily with numbers in the two

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:11.900
very very easily with numbers in the two
 

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.920
very very easily with numbers in the two
to five trillion dollar range right and

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:14.930
to five trillion dollar range right and
 

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.350
to five trillion dollar range right and
this is far more than any of the

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:17.360
this is far more than any of the
 

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.770
this is far more than any of the
abatement mechanisms would actually cost

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:19.780
abatement mechanisms would actually cost
 

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.470
abatement mechanisms would actually cost
so unep is the united nations

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480
so unep is the united nations
 

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.950
so unep is the united nations
environmental program so if you I gave

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960
environmental program so if you I gave
 

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.840

this as one of the the links to read and
and I really recommend it because it's

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:31.940
and I really recommend it because it's
 

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.430
and I really recommend it because it's
um it's an assessment that is far more

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440
um it's an assessment that is far more
 

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.800
um it's an assessment that is far more
tied towards policy makers and

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:38.810
tied towards policy makers and
 

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.020
tied towards policy makers and
stakeholders that any previous climate

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.030

assessment has been because they did

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.310
assessment has been because they did
 

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.730
assessment has been because they did
they answered the questions that real

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:45.740
they answered the questions that real
 

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.950
they answered the questions that real
policymakers are answering as opposed to

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960
policymakers are answering as opposed to
 

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.510
policymakers are answering as opposed to
answering the questions that scientists

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520
answering the questions that scientists
 

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.590
answering the questions that scientists
think policy makers are answering

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:52.600
think policy makers are answering
 

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:59.980

so um okay so how do we go forward with

00:36:59.980 --> 00:36:59.990
so um okay so how do we go forward with
 

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.020
so um okay so how do we go forward with
this kind of thing I think that the

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:02.030
this kind of thing I think that the
 

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:03.540
this kind of thing I think that the
biggest thing that we've learnt in

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:03.550
biggest thing that we've learnt in
 

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.720
biggest thing that we've learnt in
producing these assessments and in

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:06.730
producing these assessments and in
 

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.580
producing these assessments and in
demonstrating to people what these

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:09.590
demonstrating to people what these
 

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.190
demonstrating to people what these
models can do is that we really need to

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200
models can do is that we really need to
 

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.990
models can do is that we really need to
spend a lot of time listening to what

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000
spend a lot of time listening to what
 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.360
spend a lot of time listening to what
the other people are asking and and

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:16.370
the other people are asking and and
 

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.100
the other people are asking and and
thinking about what it is they're really

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.110
thinking about what it is they're really
 

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.420
thinking about what it is they're really
asking because often the questions a

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:21.430
asking because often the questions a
 

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.300
asking because often the questions a
malformed and we kind of interpret them

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:25.310
malformed and we kind of interpret them
 

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.830
malformed and we kind of interpret them
in our own way and we answer the

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:26.840
in our own way and we answer the
 

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.850
in our own way and we answer the
questions that we thought you should

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:27.860
questions that we thought you should
 

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.160
questions that we thought you should
have asked okay but that's we need to

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.170
have asked okay but that's we need to
 

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.150
have asked okay but that's we need to
spend more time listening there's no

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160
spend more time listening there's no
 

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160

but but as I said at the beginning you
know IPCC is run by the scientists for

policymakers you know we just need to
 

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.700
policymakers you know we just need to
talk and and that goes to stakeholders

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:45.710
talk and and that goes to stakeholders
