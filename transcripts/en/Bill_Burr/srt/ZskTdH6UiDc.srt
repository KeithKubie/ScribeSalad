1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,493
Okay.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,750
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:02,751 --> 00:00:07,751
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,920
January 18th, 2016.
How's it going out? Uh,

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:16,730
I am recording this
Sunday afternoon and uh,

6
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:21,410
in Vancouver, uh, Canada
doing two shows here tonight.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,490
It's halftime. Actually third quarter
just started off the Bronco Steelers.

8
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,850
I missed a Seattle and a Carolina.

9
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:32,270
I know that must've been a great
fucking game. It kills me. You know,

10
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:35,120
you never know when you book the fucking
gigs that have game like that is going

11
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:38,750
to be on. But uh, I
imagined that that was, uh,

12
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:42,170
as good as the score looked. And of
course I'm up here in Canada and uh,

13
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,760
I don't know. They don't have,

14
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,580
they just went to boomer and all those
guys at halftime time and all they did

15
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:49,620
was interview Cam Newton.
They asked him one question,

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,360
you know how he didn't answer,
you know, he just talked,

17
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:55,940
didn't give an answer about anything.
They like, what do they get? Did the a,

18
00:00:55,941 --> 00:01:00,120
the second half to a, you know, uh,
blah, blah, blah, blah. And he just goes,

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,810
yeah, well, you know,

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,580
our offense and our defense and of
course the special teams, you know,

21
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:06,240
everybody's got a job to do and a,
they get out there and they, uh,

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,241
try to get done enough.

23
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,970
Fortunately today we were able to get
out there and execute some of the things

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,010
we'll be working with all
this weekend. Uh, you know,

25
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:14,410
next week we got another person
that we're going to be playing.

26
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,840
I should set a team, not a person to
be on the team. We're going to play.

27
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,370
I know. We just hope that a, you know,

28
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,230
we're just gonna try to keep
it going because uh, you know,

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,300
we're all trying to win
a championship here.

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,280
Yeah.

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,620
And by the end you're just like, I did,
what the fuck did I even ask you? Um,

32
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,810
I wonder if, you know, cause athletes,

33
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,450
anything they fucking say they going to
take it out of context. So they just,

34
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,450
they get trained to just answer and not
say anything. Just like a politician.

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,810
I want. If you could fucking
turn that off. You know,

36
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,980
if you stay in the league long enough,
if you drive your wife nuts, you know,

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,050
Holly, do you know where my shows
are? Well, you know, you're to,

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,150
you own a lot of stuff and sometimes
that stuff gets misplaced at a,

39
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:57,030
you can do is just try to fire on all
cylinders and try to find the things that

40
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,560
you can have and a, if you can find them,
you can find them. And if you can't a,

41
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,520
then you've got to move onto the next
thing. But, uh, you know, it was always,

42
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,070
I'm always looking
towards the next weekend.

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,380
Another thing that's going
to be lost and lost. So I,

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,090
we're definitely going to do everything
we can to find it. Uh, the offense,

45
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:13,150
defense and special
teams, no, not healthy.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,450
Um, anyways. Uh, yeah. So
I'm up here in Vancouver.

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,440
God Damn it. It's fucking beautiful
up here. Fucking gorgeous man.

48
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:26,020
Especially when you live in,
you know where the hell I live,

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,100
which was not designed to have really
anybody living there other than I guess

50
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,820
maybe some indigenous people
sending smoke signals, you know,

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,400
probably sending smoke
signals that, you know,

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,590
can you find any food cause we can't.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,270
I'm sick of eating snake and do you
want to get the fuck Outta here?

54
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:46,060
How would the fuck you do that
with smoke signals? It must,

55
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,890
must've been pretty
God damn simple. Right?

56
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,940
The smoke signals if they even did it
or is that just another Hollywood thing

57
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,820
that they threw a blunt? I mean,
how do you even fucking do that?

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,550
I guess she had to go, obviously
you got to put the fire out, right?

59
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,530
Oh, what do I, how the fuck would
you do that? You know? All right,

60
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:07,470
one big puff of fuck. It's, you
gotta know what kind of wood to burn.

61
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,820
What a pain in the ass.

62
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,420
Jesus Christ. I'm going to get lost in.

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,220
Remember getting lost at the
mall before a fucking cell phone.

64
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:19,970
That was unbelievable. Forget about back
then. If you get lost, you are fucked.

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,020
Okay.

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,150
Hey, anybody see a, what the
fuck was that guy's name?

67
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,910
Okay.

68
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,650
Oh, fucking red face. Where did he go?
Done. I mean, how long do you look?

69
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,790
You can't really yell. You're
going to attract wild animals.

70
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,710
Cool.

71
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,220
Just walking around the woods. Hey Eddy,

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,590
eddy the fuck are you.
This isn't funny man. Um,

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,960
anyways, but you come up here
after leaving the desert. Um,

74
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,200
what am I see at the say the desert?
I always think of a that awesome.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,940
Great Greg Giraldo. Rest his soul joke
where he did that whole thing about, uh,

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,920
how eloquent the words, that
words the notes were that, uh,

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,620
soldiers wrote during
the civil war, you know,

78
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,300
versus some of the letters from
people coming back from re Iraq.

79
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,810
Uh, what am I, I came
about with fucking wet.

80
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,790
It's really hard to be out here with the
ball sticking g like out here in the,

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,560
in the desert. You,

82
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,110
I remember the difference between
desert and desert to us is for dessert.

83
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,340
More calories. Right? There
you go. That's how I do it.

84
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,790
And don't even ask me to spell restaurant
cause I won't even fucking remember.

85
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,260
So anyways, I'm up here in Vancouver,
so we go to fucking land, um, and just,

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,340
Oh my God, all the lush greenery,
all the lakes, although water,

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,060
everything we don't have
down in La, beautiful houses,

88
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:52,020
I guess it's expensive as shit up
here. And they was saying how, um,

89
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,940
a lot of Asian people,

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,630
um,

91
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,240
you know, not indigenous
foreigners, you know,

92
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,650
they got to get rid of
their fucking money.

93
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:02,110
They get to wash their money or I don't
what the fuck it is that government's

94
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,520
going to take it all. So they, uh,

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,920
use this place up here like a Swiss
bank and they buy like super expensive

96
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:10,210
places for cash,

97
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,813
um,

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,860
which drives the housing market
up. It's fucking nuts, man.

99
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,960
Anytime you go to another country,

100
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,120
you just hear the shit that they
fucking dealing with. I just, you know,

101
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,260
you always think like you'd come up here,

102
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,990
Canada is going to have no
fucking problems. You know,

103
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:27,230
you watch one Michael Moore documentary
that just gives you a complete,

104
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:31,160
like misinterpretation of what
the fuck is going on up here.

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,930
So they, I guess they had
to make some sort of law.

106
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,393
Um,

107
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,580
that you couldn't do something like that.

108
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,740
I can't make him what the fucking
person told him when all the weed,

109
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,270
while the way to the
fucking supreme court,

110
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,660
there was like a group of people from
Asia that was so rich that they actually

111
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:51,661
sued an entire country for not letting
them either come into the country or,

112
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,780
uh,

113
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,930
by a bunch of shit over here that drove
the housing market stuff up or something

114
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,600
that, or by their citizenship.
I can't even fucking remember.

115
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,040
But that's the charm of this podcast.
You know, I get a little information,

116
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,460
I barely remember half of it and I
just fucking run with it. That's all.

117
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,080
Um, so anyways, um,

118
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,610
so it went all the way to the Supreme
Court and then they were just finally

119
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,690
like, ah, yeah,

120
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,630
you kind of have to be from this
country for us to give a fuck about you,

121
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,090
you know, to like win a
lawsuit. So, uh, see you later.

122
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,660
And that's, it ended, I guess the
lawyer for them knew the whole way,

123
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,760
going all the way up that it
wasn't going to happen. You know,

124
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,440
they weren't going to win it
and he just took their money.

125
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,170
He probably had to sit
there and work on his, uh,

126
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm disappointed we lost
two phase, you know,

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,490
as he took all their
fucking money. But anyways,

128
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,410
so let's talk about NFL football. What

129
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,120
[inaudible] um, the fucking patriots.

130
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,120
They one, God dammit. Thank
Christ they won. They Christ,

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,180
they one in Seattle, Los
Thank Christ. You know,

132
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,060
if we're going to keep advancing, I just
didn't want Seattle to get the revenge.

133
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,800
You can't remember forever
if I've already said this,

134
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,490
I just didn't want to see Seattle get
the revenge on a banged up Patriot team.

135
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,920
If we come in healthy and they kick
our ass good on them. But uh, you know,

136
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,930
congratulations to the
Carolina Panthers. Uh,

137
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,020
they gotta be the favorites at this
point. Come on. They 16 and fucking one.

138
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,920
Right. Got that young defense
than at scared of Shit.

139
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,840
They just beat Seattle.
Right. Who knows? But, um,

140
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,600
I don't know shit about football.
I've, I've just been so fucking busy,

141
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,010
so I'm still going to talk about it.

142
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,760
You guys can keep trashing me that I
don't know. Shit, I don't give a fuck. Um,

143
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,561
and by the way,

144
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:44,270
this is why I never record on a day that
I flew cause my brain is even more all

145
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,650
over the place than it usually is,

146
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,430
especially when I got a fucking TV
going on in the background. But uh,

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,050
you know, I got, I got a busy
fucking datum. I fly back tomorrow,

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,830
get a busy fucking day. So I apologize
if this is all over the place,

149
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,280
even more than usual. I as
a first down for this damn

150
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,790
fucking 25. Oh, somebody else up here.

151
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,380
It gives a shit about NFL football.
I know they have CFL ends in like,

152
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,260
is it the end of November?
They have the Grey Cup,

153
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,370
which is their super bowl or
is it a December? I don't know.

154
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,510
The people even give a shit.

155
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:23,060
You ever see the fucking stadiums
for their football teams up here?

156
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,450
It's like you sit in the
stands, you can see your car,

157
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,660
you know one of those deals
where there's like a fucking,

158
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,500
you watch them kick a field
goal and you're looking at
traffic driving by on the

159
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,334
street.

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Like those old school football stadiums
from like the 60s and seventies you

161
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:43,310
know, where they would have like
the horseshoe shaped stadium,

162
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,480
which was I think what happened with what
with football stadiums was when there

163
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,660
wasn't that many people in the
or, and also the leaks were small.

164
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,580
They just had people sitting
on both sides, right?

165
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,620
You had the home side and the
visitors side and that was it.

166
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,500
And then as there's more and more
people population got bigger,

167
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,800
the leagues got bigger than they built
end zone seats that connected both sides.

168
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:11,130
I think they just did it on one side
first. Then you had the horseshoe, right?

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,480
Like the fucking a Broncos
plated, the Buckeyes,

170
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,830
a Buckeye still call it the horse.

171
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,200
They still call it a horseshoe even
though they fucking closed in it.

172
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,060
And then eventually there was people,

173
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,810
people did so much fucking that
they had the clothes, you know.

174
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:29,811
And there's so much ESPN
that got everybody fucking
interested in it that isn't

175
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:34,470
even interested in it. Then
all of a sudden Beyonce
singing at fucking halftime,

176
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,550
you know? And there's a bunch of people
in the crowd that are excited by it.

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,250
Yeah. Um,

178
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,180
a fucking old ass Rod Stewart.
Who the fuck they dragon out?

179
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,420
They always usually go with somebody
young or they just fucking drag somebody

180
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:54,100
who out, who's on their last fucking legs,
like their last big payday, you know,

181
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,840
they just fucking wheel them out
there. They going to do this year?

182
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,550
Huh? Night Ranger. Do you think going
to be like night ranger? A Drake?

183
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,960
That's what I'm guessing. I'll wait.
I think it is Beyonce. You know?

184
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,200
I know because Nia wanted to go to the
Superbowl because Beyonce was there.

185
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,670
I'm like, why don't you
go see her in concert?

186
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,900
You're going to make us go to the fucking
super bowl and then we get to watch

187
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,910
your lip sync. One fucking song. How the
fuck did Sean Penn interview that drug,

188
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:27,060
Lord, how do you do something like that?

189
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,120
And the government isn't like, Hey, you
know, we're trying to find that guy.

190
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,420
You know when you're just sitting
there palling around with them.

191
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,260
Probably bought them like fast
times at Ridgemont high DVDs. Right.

192
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:40,370
For his underground layer.

193
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,340
Yeah.

194
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,470
Dude, I love shod pen as an actor.

195
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,620
But how out of your fucking tree are you

196
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,420
that you're going to go and
interview that fucking guy?

197
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,383
Okay.

198
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,490
You know I did that.

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,830
I'm trying to think how many fucking
standup specials I would have to put out

200
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,010
before I could go. I would go fucking
interview somebody and like I the,

201
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,730
well I guess Isis is actually fight, but
we're fucking with them too. You know?

202
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,150
I would just think I'm going to
walk in there with my microphone.

203
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,060
They're all going to laugh at me. Then
they're going to saw my fucking head off.

204
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,010
Or were you gonna Worse? Tie me to a
chair. Fucking torture me to death.

205
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,240
That's insane. Hey, good on
him also. I don't understand.

206
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:31,900
Is it El Chapo? That's his name. He
sounds like such a gentleman. Huh?

207
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,540
El Is a good chap. El Chapo.

208
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,570
MMM. [inaudible]

209
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,210
I don't fucking get it, man.

210
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
What are you doing?

211
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,420
Why, why did he go down
there and interview that guy?

212
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,940
Okay.

213
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,590
And like how, how,

214
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,790
wow.

215
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,020
How well does Sean movies do that?

216
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,050
Drug dealers on the run. He's on
the run from our government, right?

217
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,850
Isn't this the guy who
escaped? I don't fucking know.

218
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:04,810
You know what's going on is my fucking
Internet won't let me sign on so I can't

219
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:09,700
fucking see anything. I can't see
the fucking highlights. Nothing.

220
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:10,090
You know,

221
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,270
while I'm up here is I fucking got one
God damn channel and a bunch of Tim

222
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,430
Horton fucking commercials,
which is at Dunkin donuts.

223
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,460
See if I can sign on here is an El Chapo.

224
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,220
The guy that liked that we would,

225
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,650
that keeps escaping from
jail. Set the Guy El Chapo.

226
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,460
Come on man. Come on. Ah,
this connection is untrusted.

227
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,850
Yeah. Jesus Christ.

228
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,280
It's probably some psycho from
Alberta trying to hack in here.

229
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,220
That seems like their Texas
to me, when you're up here,

230
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,890
it's all fucking oil man
and ranchers and shit. Um,

231
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,900
and then you've got Edmonton,
Edmonton. Seems like it's nice.

232
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,810
You know what I mean? Like that's
their like business hub. You know,

233
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,490
I'm just totally judging
these just by doing,

234
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,250
like driving through and doing a
little bit of standup out here.

235
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,200
Like when I did stand up in Calgary,
great people, but fucking animals,

236
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,600
Jesus fucking Christ.
They weren't animals.

237
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,140
I don't know if it's cause the place
that we performed at there was like no

238
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:11,260
carpeting or nothing. They were fucking,

239
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,780
I think it was Casa cause
it was bring your own beer.

240
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,750
Fucking animals.

241
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,420
I would never fuck with
anybody from Calgary.

242
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,890
Yeah.

243
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,880
I saw the way they behave when they were
in a good mood. Ex excited for a show.

244
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,160
Don't have a fuck with
anybody from Calgary.

245
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,030
What's Edmonton? It was
civilized. Calgary. Jesus Christ.

246
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,870
They had everything but a hookers
swinging from a swing. You know,

247
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:41,200
back in the old days with the salons
where they had the horse, you know,

248
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,180
way over dressed. Once again, it might
just be a fucking movie thing. So much.

249
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,640
So much of my history is
based on it. By the way,

250
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,810
I can't get on the fucking Internet,
but for some reason I could fucking, uh,

251
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,990
I could do it over the, uh,
I could do it on my phone.

252
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:01,900
Let me look up El Chapo here. I
said he sounds like such a chap.

253
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,980
I just think like that English
think, Eh. Well, Chapo,

254
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,440
he's a Mexican chap.

255
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,260
How Mexico secretly launched a
crackdown after Penn met El Chapo.

256
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,310
How El Chapo was finally captured
again. That was one day ago.

257
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,900
We'll el Chapo rat out rival
cartels. Corrupt officials.

258
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,720
It's gotta be a lot of stress.
Be In this El Chapo guy. Huh?

259
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,340
Joaquin Guzman.

260
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,020
Yeah.

261
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,631
You know, I got to say,

262
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:35,490
he looks like a Mexican Robert Blake like
during the Beretta years that when he

263
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:38,550
says a, yeah, that's me who's also on
the phone and then starts laughing.

264
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,300
How else this is when, you know,
you lived a fucking crazy life.

265
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,990
This is just the front page of this guys
for a, if you search this guy's name,

266
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,940
how El Chapo was finally captured again,
will el Chapo rally red? Those, uh,

267
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,140
El Chapo Guzman. Sean
Penn talks about them.

268
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:58,100
El Chapo had erectile dysfunction
surgery while on the run.

269
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,090
That's nice to know. We took a pit stop.
You know, guy takes care of himself.

270
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,340
How nervous was that doctor
working on that maniacs? Dick? Uh,

271
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,830
El Chapo speaks rolling stone.

272
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:13,460
Sean Penn has terrible regret
about meeting El Chapo. Well,

273
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:14,720
what did he think he was going to meet?

274
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,310
Okay,

275
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,430
he's going to get some fucking Sherry's
berries. The hunt for El Chapo,

276
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,430
Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. The
truth about the jailbreak,

277
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,350
there's nothing here about a, an older,

278
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:30,480
wiser El Chapo puts out a little singer

279
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,930
Songwriter Jesus fucking Christ. Dude,

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,290
you don't realize how fucking finished
we are. Just as, as, as, as, uh,

281
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,390
just as a race, as a race, as
humanity. So I'm trying to say,

282
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,080
just as people were fucking
done, you know, rolling stone.

283
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,670
Rolling stone this month has
Sean Penn talking to El Chapo,

284
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,330
the Leonardo DiCaprio's on the con cover,

285
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,970
and they're billing Billingham where
he has a plan to save the planet.

286
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,020
Okay.

287
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,853
Why are we doing,

288
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,440
what the fuck is that government
not doing that a list fucking a

289
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,380
actress have to talk to drug
lords and try to save the planet.

290
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,920
I mean, there's gotta be how many leaks
are in the fucking dam at this point?

291
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,220
I don't know about you guys. That
does not make me feel comfortable.

292
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,250
You don't have any boomer Esiason to

293
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,980
figure out how to Co
fucking colonize Mars.

294
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,140
That's the next thing that they're gonna
have in the rolling. Rolling Stone.

295
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,850
You don't have a why? What the
fuck do I want to hear that?

296
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,233
Okay.

297
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,320
Can I hear a scientist?

298
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,953
You know,

299
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,770
how about I have a navy
seal interview. El Chapo.

300
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,063
Okay.

301
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,420
I don't know bill, how would you
shut the fuck up? All right, I will.

302
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,590
I don't know. I get unsettled.
I get unsettled him. I did.

303
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,820
I have problems with digestion. Um,

304
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,680
I can't even remember what the
fuck I was going to look up.

305
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,680
What was I initially looking
at before I got to El Chapo?

306
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,820
Jesus Christ. Some of
the stories on that guy.

307
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,320
Yeah.

308
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,441
You know,

309
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:15,740
it's right up there with that fucking Raj
Stewart rumor for way back in the day.

310
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,580
If I that one, I think it was, I can't
remember. I've still, whatever they're,

311
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,490
yeah, they found like a gallon
of [inaudible] in his stomach.

312
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:27,030
His stomach had to be
pumped, you know, a gallon.

313
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,880
You went to trader Joe's and butts them
up. Fucking all natural organic. Fuck,

314
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm sorry. Um, you got a gallon of
it, you know? No, you went to a,

315
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:46,060
was those foods, that place where you
buy everything in Bulk? Let's fuck it.

316
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:49,090
Whales. It, push it around those
pallet jacks by and cheerios.

317
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,270
Okay.

318
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,360
You got to get a membership to it
because with a C it's not [inaudible].

319
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,490
What's the, what's the name of that?
I never go to the fucking place.

320
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,290
Once I had to go in there
and get a membership,

321
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,830
they wanted all this fucking information.

322
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,193
Um,

323
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,710
oh Christ, what the fuck is
it called? That coat check.

324
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,790
I'm never going to remember
it. You know what I'm saying?

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,610
That just kills the jokes. But when you
can't remember the fucking references,

326
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:17,700
it just, it absolutely kills it. Costco.

327
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,370
Hey went to Costco.

328
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,900
He bought one of those big fucking a
gallons a fucking ges it on a dairy,

329
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,770
chugged it. Anyway, so there's, he
has something on El Chapo, El Chapo.

330
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:29,700
They said a,

331
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,920
okay.

332
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,710
I can't remember like just fucking killed
this person's whole family took their

333
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,720
kids and something. I
just, I don't believe it.

334
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,840
They took his kids and
then flew him to uh,

335
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,820
to Columbia and then threw him
off a bridge. It's like, really?

336
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:48,450
There's not any bridges in Mexico.
You never know what to believe.

337
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:52,830
But I gotta tell you when
you go south or the US,

338
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,130
you do not want to piss anybody
off as far as I can tell.

339
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,110
That's some next level shit.

340
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,160
And I could say that because I just
read papers from the United States.

341
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,890
They uh, that's just,
that's just next level.

342
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,630
Like you know,

343
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,840
you mad at somebody and then you know how
you get your revenge is just some next

344
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,760
, I read that a killing Pablo.

345
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:17,640
One time I had to put the
book down like three times.

346
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,620
Some of the shit they just
said that the guy did not,

347
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,210
I don't know if the
fucking guy did this shit,

348
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:25,620
but I'm a one time hearing that the guy
had a party night and everybody's out

349
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:30,420
there by the pool standing around, you
know, and a, what's his face there?

350
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,690
Pablo Escobar standing there. You know,

351
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,530
everybody's ignoring the weight that
he's putting on as he sits there and his

352
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,660
fucking Hager action slacks, you know,

353
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,560
seemed to like those is stretched and uh,

354
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,740
yeah,

355
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,550
you know, still tucked them in right
at the waist, you know what I mean?

356
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,980
Talk to him right in the waist.
Didn't push the pants down,

357
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,570
didn't do the fucking share it on,
tucked. He tucked it right in. And uh,

358
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,390
they said that he, he
allegedly filed one of his, uh,

359
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,790
one of the people didn't want to,
it's not as by one of the maids.

360
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,800
I don't know what allegedly was stealing.

361
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,470
So they tied this guy's legs together
and his arms behind the his back and they

362
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,150
threw him in the house pool and just
watched him drown as everyone was standing

363
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:14,310
there at the party. You know,

364
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,500
I'd say they must've been a lot of ice
shaken and drinks after that one. Like

365
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
so is this a Victorian house? Pablo?

366
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,090
Mr Escobar. Oh, I want
to go the pool. Um, yeah.

367
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,580
People get their faces ripped
off. Is it torturing to death?

368
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,280
They're like peeling their fucking
faces back. This is not funny.

369
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,070
This is not what this
podcast is about. Um,

370
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,790
why is this fucking Steeler
Denver Games so fucking boring?

371
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,810
Is it because I have the sound
down? I just don't give a fuck.

372
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,570
The AFC is just the
walking wounded, right?

373
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,810
This burger is a fucking man.

374
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:56,810
Look at a guy just getting bumped by
Lyme and he stays in there. That guy,

375
00:20:56,811 --> 00:21:01,130
he has like fucking, he stays
in the pocket like Steve Grogan.

376
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,950
Stuff used to stay in the pocket.
Did anybody remember that?

377
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,650
Any old pats fans out there?
You'd fucking sit there.

378
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,210
And this is back when you could literally,

379
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:10,220
you could hammer a fucking quarterback,

380
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,360
drive your helmet right under his chin
and then lift him off the ground and

381
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:17,090
pile, drive them into
the fucking astroturf,

382
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,290
which is like getting tackled in
a parking lot. That's been, uh,

383
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,170
painted green and Steve Drogan,
whenever he would go back for a pass,

384
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,400
it's back when he had that fucking
neck brace and he had such a long neck,

385
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,640
he could still see like six inches in
neck. Right. Even with the neck brace.

386
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,110
And there'd be some defensive lineman
just run in full speed right at him.

387
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:40,110
And he, he would just hang onto
it, hang onto and hang on to it,

388
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,610
and then he would throw the ball and
the camera would follow the football.

389
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:45,930
And right as he let it go,

390
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,310
you'd see just the beginning of that
fucking Lyman drilling them and he'd go

391
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:52,920
flying right out the right side
of your screen or left side,

392
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,030
depending on which way he was going
down the field to Stanley Morgan,

393
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,120
you know, Russ Francis, one
of those fucking guys, right?

394
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,610
Harold Jackson. Who else
did we have back then?

395
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:08,660
I can't even fucking remember.

396
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,250
Hasselbeck they had Hasselbeck
whose son was the one who said, uh,

397
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,110
we want the ball and we're going to
score don Hasselbeck I think was,

398
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,970
is dead. All right. Anyways, where
the, where the fuck am I? Um,

399
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,350
yeah. Rothberg is like that,

400
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:30,710
that guy stands in the pocket and takes
a fuck at it and speak in which to, uh,

401
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:34,220
I know there's a lot of Kansas City fans
would probably pissed off at the calls

402
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:37,850
Tom Brady got and the lack of
calls that Alex Smith got. Ed. Uh,

403
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm a patriots fan. Uh,
you're absolutely right,

404
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:44,840
but that is not Tom Brady's fault. Okay.

405
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,570
And I'm hoping most of you guys have kids.

406
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,460
The city can hear what I'm saying because
you're not as upset because you got to

407
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:54,710
see your baseball team when
the world series. Right?

408
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:55,970
So you got that going for you.

409
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:59,330
Half of you professional teams
won championships this year.

410
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:02,810
That's pretty fucking good. Right? Um,

411
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,280
Tom Brady earned those
costs. Okay. This is the,

412
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,910
if you want Alex Smith to get
those calls in the future,

413
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,680
in the future,

414
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,580
he has to make the NFL owners
a lot more money than he is.

415
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,260
And that's just a simple fact. And people
call it the Tom Brady rules. It isn't,

416
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:25,820
it's the superstar rules. You know,
Jordan gets away with the push.

417
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,460
Right? What was the last
time we, Colby Bryant.

418
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:30,470
What does Colby Bryan have
to do to get, you know, well,

419
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,400
he's not healthy anymore,

420
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:36,350
but back in the day you could be standing
in the lane before the fucking game

421
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:41,120
starts and if he runs it to you that
they're going to call it on you,

422
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,680
he'd literally have to,

423
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:46,910
to eat after fucking tie an ax to the
front of knee and fucking jump into your,

424
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:50,720
cut your head off before, you know,
if there was a way to call offsetting,

425
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,210
they would have, it's just,
it's just how it works. But, um,

426
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,480
I have to say as much
as he earned the calls,

427
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:02,250
that one where he was getting sacked
and he switched it to his left hand and

428
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,340
throw it and they still gave him
the call was fucking ridiculous.

429
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,300
I even as a pager, it's fair. I was
at home going, oh, what the fuck?

430
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,970
Give me a break. But
you know, I'll take it.

431
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,650
Of course they'll take it the same
way you would have. Um, but, uh,

432
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,830
I don't care to see. It's a great team
and they have, you know, Alex Smith,

433
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,890
I think he's going to be a really
fucking great quarterback. Um,

434
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,210
but you gotta have it all man.

435
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,630
He gotta have the coach and the ownership
and all that bullshit and lucky enough

436
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,050
that we have that in, uh, in
New England. So there you go.

442
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:49,610
heir apparent to fucking Tom
Brady and Peyton manning.

446
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,290

451
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm on for fuck sakes.

452
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,440

Um,

585
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,410
here's a stat I had to look up
because Don Myra sent me a, uh,

586
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,550
a text. I tried to drop
names here. By the way,

587
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,440
I'm on his podcast this past week. Uh,

588
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,950
Don [inaudible] sent me a
text this morning. He goes,

589
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,970
how many quarterbacks have
you ever seen in the NFL?

590
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,400
Yeah.

591
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,530
Have a hail Mary pass, throw a
successful, hey ma, hail Mary.

592
00:33:28,531 --> 00:33:30,600
Pass once in their career.

593
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,160
Forget about twice in
the same season. And uh,

594
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,120
I had to go look it up. I was like,
I gotta I gotta find this out, man.

595
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:43,930
I gotta find out a, you know,
if anybody's ever done it,

596
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,880
cause I was like, there's
no way anybody's done it.

597
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,410
In my lifetime of watching the last 30
something years of watching football,

598
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:55,090
holy fuck. I've been watching
football for 38 years. Oh my God.

599
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:59,830
I'm old. I started watching
it religiously in about 1978.

600
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,320
Um, yeah, about that 78, 79.

601
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,690
Jesus fucking Christ. Um, put it this way.

602
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,430
The first Superbowl I watched was
super bowl 12, and they're at 50,

603
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,520
so there you go. Wow, this
is going to be my, uh,

604
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,120
well would that be my 50,
not 51st fucking idiot.

605
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,070
My 39th Superbowl 50 minus
12. Plus I watched 12, right?

606
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,700
Yeah. So that day. There you go. Yeah,

607
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,580
there's a lot of people right now
actually think I'm wrong, but it's true.

608
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,900
It's my 39th I'm going to be watching
anyways. Let's plow ahead here. Um,

609
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,880
so I looked it up. Successful
Hail Mary's. Okay. Um,

610
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:50,180
there's only one guy that I saw since
they started keeping the stat in 1975,

611
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:54,900
at least on Wikipedia. I didn't go to
the football reference.com which I love.

612
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,233
Um,

613
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,340
the one guy who's ever done done it
twice since they kept the stats in 1975,

614
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,833
Steve Bart Koski,

615
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,640
Steve Bar Koski and there's no way to
picture Steve Art Koski and not have the

616
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:15,280
song, this song go through your head

617
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,030
walking on air. I never
thought I could be so free.

618
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,490
He throwing the ball to Bailey.

619
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,830
Watch you Johnson and
to another guy. Yeah.

620
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:33,610
He looked like the greatest American hero.
He did it in 1978 against the saints.

621
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:38,300
And then he did it again in 1983
against the 40 niners in the, uh,

622
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,050
NFC west, which back
then was only four teams.

623
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,850
It was the Los Angeles Rams,
the New Orleans saints,

624
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,840
the Atlanta Falcons, and
the San Francisco 49ers.

625
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,280
The quarterbacks are Steve
Bart Koski, a 78 seat bar.

626
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,690
Koski Archie Manning,

627
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,850
and I think they had a quarterback
controversy. Pat Hayden,

628
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:06,940
Vince Ferragamo back and forth, uh,

629
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,480
four Vince cover gum. I tried to take the
money and went to the fucking CFL. Oh,

630
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:14,470
Jewish. Never saw him again. And uh,

631
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,700
it would be Steve de
or Jim Plunkett at 78.

632
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,940
I did this with fucking
Joe Bart. Nick, one time.

633
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:26,941
We tried to name all the
starting quarterbacks in the
NFL in 1978 we went around

634
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:32,410
the league. So I think it
was a FCEs was Burt Jones,

635
00:36:32,411 --> 00:36:34,420
Bob Greasy, Steve Grogan,

636
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:38,560
Richard Todd and Joe
Ferguson for the bills.

637
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,740
That was Terry Bradshaw.
Dan, pastor Rainey,

638
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,300
who the fuck was quarterback for the
browns? It was either Mike Phipps or,

639
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,650
uh, Brian's site.

640
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,270
And then the Bengals was Kenny
Anderson. Kenny The candle

641
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,210
as Colin's were sent.

642
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:04,820
They Call Him Kenny the candle
Coz one blow and he was out.

643
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,420
You ever see that one on NFL films?
And they cut the kitty and I said,

644
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:10,010
he's like, I'll fuck Colin's worth.

645
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,670
Um, and let's see, was Craig Morton?

646
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,660
I'll just do the AFC cause I know this
is fucking driving everybody nuts but,

647
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,130
or this is my f I have to do it
now. Cause now it's in my head.

648
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:27,320
Craig Morton was at the orange
crush Broncos. Ken Stabler,

649
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,380
Kenny Snake Stabler for the,
uh, the Raiders. Dan Fouts,

650
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,580
the Great Dan Fouts air
Corey l with the address.

651
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,010
Jim Zorn was Seattle and then a fuck.

652
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,440
There's always one that gets me.
Who the fuck was with the chiefs?

653
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,670
It was before black ledge
was after Len Dawson.

654
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,330
Who the fuck was the quarterback?
There's a good one for you.

655
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,530
There's some poor bastard in
Kansas City right now screaming at

656
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,520
who the fuck was it? I even know, I
think like the Buccaneers had Gary hough.

657
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,950
Lynn Dickey was out in Greenbay.

658
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:15,000
Jim Hart was, how the fuck do I
remember those? I remember Kansas City,

659
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,820
Kansas City. I gotta look this up.
Kansas City chief quarterback. Hey,

660
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:20,900
it's going to get better guys.

661
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:25,901
I played drums this week out and I played
with the Colin Hay for men at work.

662
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,480
All right, I'm going to tell
her story in a second here.

663
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,190
Just fucking deal with this
here. Kansas City chiefs,

664
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,610
QB 1970 why do I care?

665
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,990
Why do I fucking care? Lists of
Kansas City chief quarterbacks.

666
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,480
This is fucking made for me.

667
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Who's the last person who fucking went
to this starting quarterback season to

668
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,943
season.

669
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,100
Okay.

670
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,130
Jesus. They've had some guys. Yeah.
Joe Montana. Warren Moon, rich Gannon.

671
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,140
All right, here we go. Here we
go. Back at it, out back in it up

672
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,830
1970 I'd never get this. Mike
Livingston and Tony Adams,

673
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,810
this is the one that
always fucking gets me.

674
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:15,490
Leonie Dawson left in 1975 and
then Mike Livingston took over.

675
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,490
You know there was a guy who played for
the Bengals that Bill Walsh was talking

676
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:27,940
about. He only played for one
season. He got fucking injured.

677
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,890
And Bill Walsh to this day still said
he's the greatest quarterback that he ever

678
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,920
coached, but he's probably still
trying to motivate or he was, anyways,

679
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,970
she passed away, probably still trying
to motivate fucking Montana or a young,

680
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,190
even after they retired,

681
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,620
get them to rake the leaves
better that day or some shit. Um,

682
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,530
I can't remember the guy's fucking name,
but that's one to look up. Uh, anyways,

683
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:53,251
so yeah, this,

684
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:58,090
this week I did a Greg
Baron show at Largo and uh,

685
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:01,320
I was one of those things too. It's
not quite like the goddamn comedy jam.

686
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:04,380
This was one where they
actually have people, uh,

687
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:09,000
for the most part it's musicians
coming out and telling funny stories.

688
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,920
And this is something that Greg
did a number of years ago and uh,

689
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:17,760
he's brought the show
back. And, um, so anyways,

690
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,990
let me, let me get the line up
here so I don't fuck this up.

691
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,880
I did take a picture of it. I'm so
fucking disorganized. I apologize. Um,

692
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,040
all right. So it was
calling, hey, Tom Morello,

693
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,300
myself and Chris Fairbank's and other
comedians, those two comedians. And then,

694
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,780
uh, two musicians. And I got to a,

695
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,630
okay,

696
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,750
I got to play a with the
band, told some stories,

697
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,600
and I got to play with the band.

698
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:49,070
And then afterwards I got to play
with Collin a and we played, uh,

699
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,810
who can it be now, which was,
uh, just beyond a fucking thrill.

700
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,520
And he was the nicest fucking guy,
so generous to let me play. Um,

701
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,440
and he had this really cool way that
he wanted to bring me out. He goes, uh,

702
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,890
he just went out there. He was telling
stories, he was fucking hilarious.

703
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:09,080
And then he just randomly goes, you know,

704
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,790
and I had the weirdest dream last
night. I was dreaming. I was, you know,

705
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:18,390
playing a show. And, uh,
I was playing, you know,

706
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:21,180
who could it be now? And the crowd
collapsed because it's such a huge hit.

707
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,080
And he goes, the weirdest thing, you
know, it built burrow was on drums, like,

708
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:29,580
you know, and I just waited a second.
Then I just walked out and sat down.

709
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:31,830
Everybody started laughing and
then he told this great story.

710
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:34,910
I'm not going to repeat the
story. Just I, it's his story.

711
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:38,090
So I'm sure if he wants to
tell it on a podcast, he can,

712
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,280
but he tells his fucking hilarious
story that ends with the word cunt.

713
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,220
And he told me after I say cunt,

714
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,160
basically you do the drum fill intro
and then we'll go into the song and uh,

715
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,670
let me play it anyway, you know,
went off, went off pretty good man.

716
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,390
And actually, uh, I don't
know. It's fucking unreal, man.

717
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:04,391
I played like 20 years by myself in a
rehearsal space until it finally dawned on

718
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,000
me that I'm supposed to be out
interacting with other fucking people.

719
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:11,900
So now that I've kind of opened
Pandora's box, I just, I told you,

720
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:15,770
I made this rule that I'm
not gonna ask to sit in,

721
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:19,460
but if somebody asked me to play,
I'm gonna fucking play. All right.

722
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,730
That includes if I can be a town
and if I'm drinking in a bar,

723
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,920
if I go out to a bar and
your local band is played,

724
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,080
if you come up to me and asked
me to sit in with your band,

725
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,290
I'm going to fucking do it. All
right. I know. And this is a warning.

726
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,300
It's a warning. I'm gonna do it and
I'm gonna fuck up. So, you know,

727
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,530
if you want a story, I'll fucking
do it. Cause it's fun as hell to me.

728
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,190
And it's weird. I don't feel
any pressure whatsoever because

729
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,520
I'm a comedian. Well, what's the pressure?

730
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:55,070
He's going to sit down and play drums.
He's going to stick. Of course he is.

731
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,640
Everybody already knows
it, so it's fine. Um,

732
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,800
plus everybody has looks at the singer
anyways, but it's a, it's a lot of fun.

733
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:08,540
And I've been, uh, getting
psycho back into lessons and, um,

734
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,610
I told you I've been taking, um,
I've been taking some lessons. Um,

735
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,310
you remember a long time ago when I
watched that Mars Volta Video and uh,

736
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,200
I was talking about their drummer,

737
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,390
who's Dave [inaudible] at the
time I was going, Holy Fuck,

738
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:26,960
look at this guy's fucking unbelievable,
blah, blah blah. Well, from doing that,

739
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:30,080
he must've heard the clip. He reached
out to me on Twitter and Lo and behold,

740
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,460
he lives in La.

741
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,200
And every once in a while I go by and
I take a lesson with the guy and uh,

742
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,140
he's a fucking unbelievable teacher and
he's been teaching me techniques. So my,

743
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:45,020
you know, I'm one of those guys, I
grabbed the drumsticks the same way.

744
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:48,830
Like a toddler would, would
just my fit meaty fucking fist,

745
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:53,831
just right over both of them and it was
causing my arms to be doing all the work

746
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,390
and my forum, if ain't
drummers are listening to this,

747
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:59,420
if you have like that fucking, you know,

748
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:02,300
that pain in your forums and
all that, you know, that's,

749
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:07,390
I was kind of going through that shit and
he is teaching me this technique where

750
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:12,170
you let the stick do the work and it's
holding it in this particular way that

751
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,430
does not seem fucking natural at all.

752
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,320
And uh, it has been a motherfucker
but you know, incrementally I've been,

753
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,880
it's gradually working its
way into my playing and uh,

754
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,600
it's been, it's totally been worth it.

755
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,660
And we've been going this jazz
book and I'm like most students,

756
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,330
like I work on something for three
seconds and then want to go onto the next

757
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,590
thing so I can have that
sense of accomplishment and
just get through a whole

758
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:48,480
fucking page and a, and I was moving
ahead and every time I'd go to the lesson,

759
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,120
I would still not have
the first thing down.

760
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,950
And I've been taking lessons, you know,
on and off since the summer. I mean,

761
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:59,340
I get busy and I can't go for like
a month or something, but, um,

762
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,900
I'm still on that first page and it
finally dawned on me in the past week to,

763
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,860
to be like, dude, just work on this one
fucking thing and fuck everything else.

764
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,960
And I just sorta sat down 15 minutes
a day just working on this thing.

765
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,700
Um, you know,

766
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,580
make it a little bit of an improvement
and then being fuck having to start over

767
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,440
and blah, blah, blah, blah
and all that shit. And um,

768
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,050
I actually had a great lesson this week
where I think he actually was saying

769
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:28,990
that I was just, I was
finally starting to improve,

770
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,490
which made my fucking
weak. So anyways, um,

771
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,500
I don't know what the fuck I'm going with
this. I'm rambling all over the place.

772
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,650
What are we up to here? 45
minutes. Jesus Christ. Bill,

773
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,190
can we fucking get on with
this here? Um, oh, by the way,

774
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:46,810
somebody told me to watch
a show, top boy, TLP,

775
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,690
boy on Netflix and a, I want a
Netflix for the life of, I can,

776
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,490
I can figure out how to search
when I'm on the Internet.

777
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:55,410
I can't fucking do it when
I'm on the TV. I don't,

778
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,170
how do you search when you're
on the TV, if anybody knows,

779
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:02,250
I would really appreciate it.
But anyways, I'm going to be, um,

780
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,820
I'm going to be, uh, playing
out again this week. Uh,

781
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:09,410
I'm doing that Bonzo bash thing.

782
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:13,370
I'm hosting the Bonzo bash co-hosting
and I don't even know who I'm hosting

783
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:13,581
with.

784
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:18,581
It's going to be an Anaheim this Friday
night and I'm a Brian tissues wonderful

785
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:25,160
event or all these drummers that I
grew up watching sit down and play led

786
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:25,881
Zeppelin songs,

787
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:29,240
which is going to be the shit I'm
going to get to host it and uh,

788
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,310
with somebody else, it's going
to be fucking awesome. So,

789
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:35,240
and I will be sitting in
for one song, once again,

790
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,330
risking total humiliation,
which, you know,

791
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:42,890
I'll probably make an ass of myself who
gives a fuck. Right. Um, but anyways,

792
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,020
uh, oh, I know what I
wanted to talk about.

793
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,420
Fuck. In the Arizona cardinals packers
game, I started to talk about it and uh,

794
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,770
you know, you would think last week
after watching that dude on the Bengals,

795
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,000
intercept the ball and then fucking
walk into the locker room like, well,

796
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:03,650
I guess that's that, right?

797
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,260
You'd think that these, these damn
kids today they'd learned something.

798
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,780
Patrick Peterson, who I
fucking love LSU Kid, right?

799
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,440
Incomplete fourth down.
That ought to fucking do it.

800
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,180
Two and a half minutes left.

801
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:23,760
This guy's walking down the sideline
waving to the crowd, doing editing.

802
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,890
Damn near blowing kisses to
the crowd. Like it's over.

803
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,400
What he's playing pack is in Aaron
fucking Roger's fucking hilarious.

804
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Two and a half minutes of football left
and he's walking around doing that and

805
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,194
what happened?

806
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,250
Two minutes and 25 football seconds
later he gets beat on a jump ball in the

807
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:49,540
fucking end zone on a hail Mary
to send it into overtime. Um,

808
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,250
fucking unbelievable. How many times
does somebody gonna fucking do that?

809
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,940
How many times are you going to run
down the field? You got the football,

810
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:03,060
you're not past the goal line.
You already start holding it out.

811
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,170
And Don baby slaps it out of your hand.
Are you fucking, you know, you have,

812
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,460
you spike it over the,
you know, over your back.

813
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:15,830
You know that one we had throw it
down over your shoulder and you,

814
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,430
you get big toes across the
end zone, but the ball is,

815
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,450
and how many fucking times you're
going to see people do that.

816
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:26,250
I just don't understand why. I know. Get
it. So anyways, let's plow ahead here.

817
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,530
Uh, all right, here's some of the
questions. Are the letters for this week.

818
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,950
All right. Pasta Bill. If you
want to get good at making pasta,

819
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:39,951
of course I do begin with a Janero
cantala those videos on food tube.

820
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,570
All right. I don't know if I
said, I'm probably just say right.

821
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:48,370
It's g e n a R R o.

822
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,700
And then the last name is C.
O. N. T. A. L. D. O. S. No, d.

823
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:56,430
O. Apostrophe s can tall dose. Uh,

824
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:01,350
the guy taught me so much I even
wished him a happy birthday. Uh,

825
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:06,270
also pay attention to sorts of flour
you're using cheers to you and your

826
00:49:06,271 --> 00:49:08,570
Mondays. Yeah. What's going
on? Some people use flowers,

827
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:12,300
some people use that semolina
some people use a mixture of both.

828
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,930
I tell you, I like doing it. I think
it goes back to when I was a kid,

829
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:19,020
I was one of those kids like playing
in mud puddles, you know what I mean?

830
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:23,310
So it was a, there's just
something about that.

831
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,650
I think that's why like, I like making
like, like pie crust and shit like that.

832
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:33,390
It's just a big gooey
fucking mess. It's fun. Um,

833
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,420
but I'll definitely, uh, I'll check
that out if I can get online here.

834
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,000
All right. Cooking Asian food.

835
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,590
Okay.

836
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:45,260
All right, Bill, how are you? You
freckled cont Jesus. Jesus. No,

837
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:49,070
happy new year. I'm huge
fan from Belgium here.

838
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,360
Nice Bedlam and Belgium. ACDC
flick of the switch elbow.

839
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,630
How many fucking balls are
you gonna drop on Peyton here?

840
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,280
This could be his last game ever.
What are you doing? Jesus Christ.

841
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:04,340
And when did shoulder pads
get so small? Let me see.

842
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:08,210
Shoulder pads on people and the
fucking, the shoulder pads was so big.

843
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,860
The shirt didn't even cover your belly.

844
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,250
You still run around with
half shirts on. By the way,

845
00:50:13,251 --> 00:50:16,400
can grump pull his pants up or
get a longer fucking jersey?

846
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,910
You started to look like
a waitress at Hooters.

847
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,870
Alright. A huge fan from Belgium here. Um,

848
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:31,490
I'm sure saying he showed his midriff.
There's probably the Ron Ron reference.

849
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:35,390
Who knows, you know the little
ass country that people know, uh,

850
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,170
about because of Austin Powers. Oh,

851
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:42,740
I thought I knew them from a, I
thought isn't, that's not Brussels.

852
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,570
The muscles from Brussels.
That was the guy who used to,

853
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,450
who's the guy used to do the
splits now fuck is the guy's name.

854
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,420
He wasn't, I must break you.

855
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:59,470
He wasn't Steven Seagal was the other
guy from blood splat gives a fuck.

856
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,820
Belgium. Yeah. Luxembourg
and Belgium. Right,

857
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,630
right there a tucked in there. Right.
They're a battle of the bulge right there.

858
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:12,130
And then France and Germany.

859
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:17,790
My nuts in between a Amsterdam in the
fucking Denmark there Copenhagen you get

860
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:22,750
tucked right there staring at the
fucking a bad teeth of that. The English,

861
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,160
aren't you looking across the
channel? Maybe not enough.

862
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,840
Maybe if I had a map I could find
it. Yeah. All right. Love Deaf.

863
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:34,960
This F is for family. Please come to
our f our freckle of a country. Uh,

864
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,460
dude, I'm definitely gonna go there.

865
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,930
I'm definitely going to go there
without a fucking doubt. I'm a,

866
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,330
and we're waiting to hear about the
second season for F is for family.

867
00:51:43,331 --> 00:51:47,350
The pitch went fucking great. Uh,
when out of there we were all excited.

868
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:51,850
I got a great feeling about it and I'm
gonna let you guys know as soon as I find

869
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:56,760
out. Um, okay. But I got a
good feeling about it. So,

870
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,590
uh, and I'm definitely
gonna do a European tour.

871
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,820
I did Australia and Asia last
year, so this time it's time.

872
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,570
We had the other way.

873
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,900
I'm going to do a Europe this time and I
want to hit all the countries I've been

874
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:08,380
to. I'd like to add a few more.

875
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,400
And I also want to do a little
bit of eastern Europe, but, uh,

876
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:15,060
if we do get a second season, I don't
know how many episodes that would be,

877
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,280
I'd think it'd be at least
10. And then, you know,

878
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:19,260
we gotta sit down and write them and, uh,

879
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,740
we want to make it as good as the first
season, you know, and even better,

880
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,110
which of course we do, it's
going to take a lot of time.

881
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:28,410
So I gotta kind of
figure out, you know, uh,

882
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,650
once they gave us the Yay or nay on
that. But like I said, I got a really,

883
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:34,260
really, really positive vibes,

884
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:38,880
a lot of laughs in the room and um,
which is always good. So anyways,

885
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,440
he said the guy says, anyway,

886
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:44,700
I've heard you talking about
cooking more Asian food. Oh wait,

887
00:52:44,701 --> 00:52:49,610
this is a different one. Um, oh,
it's the same guy. Sorry. And He,

888
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,620
this is the same guy from
Belgium because anyways,

889
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:55,040
I've heard you talking about wanting
to cook more Asian food on your podcast

890
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,610
since I love cooking as well.
Please allow me to recommend you.

891
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:02,420
Some Korean cuisine has a
lot of spicy food. Oh yeah.

892
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:05,450
Kimchi and all that stuff. Um,

893
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:06,950
okay.

894
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,440
Yeah, I've, I've been to those
Korean barbecue and all that stuff.

895
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,510
I love all of that stuff, but it's
just so different from the stuff here.

896
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:18,890
I'm really intimidated about cooking it,

897
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,320
uh, which is so stupid, you
know, if I'm, I'm afraid of it,

898
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:27,570
I should just just sit down and be like,
okay, let's start with something easy.

899
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,960
How do you make the sticky rice? You know,

900
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,900
if you could just make sticky rice
alone, that's the shit, right?

901
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,490
That's the best fucking rice there is.

902
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,680
I don't want to hear everybody
tell me it's not fucking healthy.

903
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:42,240
I don't give a fuck. You
know, it's fucking delicious.

904
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,900
Um, Korean cuisine has
a lot of spicy food,

905
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:50,901
which is great for losing weight since
you tend to be full more quickly and

906
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:56,250
drink more water, plus a lot of other
health benefits. If you are interested,

907
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:59,550
please check out. Uh, I can't,

908
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,440
it's m a n, G, C, h, I on Youtube. Oh,

909
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,250
I've got to do this. Uh, I guess
I go, I guess this is a lady, a,

910
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,500
she's a Korean housewife who
is funny as hell and learns,

911
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,930
uh, teaches you, you said learns
you how to cook. It's teaches,

912
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,610
teaches you how to cook great
traditional and overall easy recipes.

913
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,310
Now you've got to teach me some Belgian
words. I gave you one there. Huh?

914
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:30,300
A recommendations are a Belgium words.

915
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,910
Belgium. A Rep recommendations
are spicy pork stir fry.

916
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,600
Jane Sing Chicken. I
didn't want to say it's j.

917
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:45,350
A J a m e o n. G. Judge. Ami Young.

918
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,500
That sounds like an annoying
character in fucking star wars,

919
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,990
which is black bean sauce noodles.

920
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,060
Some other shit that I can't say Korean
barbecue, which I bet you've had before.

921
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:58,770
Yeah, I have. What is that?
The hacky American thing? Well,

922
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,200
I've had Korean food. I
went to Korea Barbecue.

923
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,760
I literally just said that
Japanese cuisine is mostly salty,

924
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:09,650
sweet and Umami. What does
Umami mean? Is that Oh,

925
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:14,330
Mommy Burger. Better that flavors.
Lots of vegetables. No butter.

926
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:18,560
Soy Sauce, which is amazing for you
and rich and enrich taste. Yeah.

927
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:20,720
I got to tell you mad people,
when I went over to Asia, man,

928
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:24,140
they will fucking in shape. People
are just in shape over there,

929
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,773
you know?

930
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,850
I bet if you fat in Asia, they've just
been looking at rich motherfucker.

931
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:35,400
He must be traveling. He's got enough
money to get to an apple piece.

932
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,270
I'm fucking, I uh, I'm too tired.

933
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,570
I didn't want to say Applebee's.
Applebee's is not a fattening places. It,

934
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,620
what's a good fat cheese? They'll
just wrap up the podcast. Okay.

935
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,630
If I'm going to be this off right now,

936
00:55:49,631 --> 00:55:53,110
what the fuck's going to happen when I
go to do my shows tonight? All right.

937
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:56,360
Now, Chinese food, I don't
know a lot about, uh,

938
00:55:56,410 --> 00:56:00,340
cool to know is that Chinese food in the
states and Europe is not actual Chinese

939
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:04,870
food. No, it isn't. That's
their surreptitious way of
trying to fucking kill us.

940
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,550
That's what they're trying to do.
They know we have the bomb, right?

941
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,750
They think that China is attacking
us on two levels right now,

942
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,530
giving us food that's going to give us
a heart attack and they're going to fuck

943
00:56:17,531 --> 00:56:19,090
with our economy somehow. Somehow.

944
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,720
We're tied in with them and they're
going to pull the fucking rug up anyways.

945
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,520
He said modified for our taste buds,

946
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:27,580
but I'm guessing they have amazing
stuff too. Yeah, I would think so.

947
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,563
I would think so.

948
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,603
Um,

949
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,820
no. Fuck. Am I getting
the hiccups here? Uh,

950
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,600
Thai in Vietnamese food is mostly
spring rolls. Jesus Christ, you go, oh,

951
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,680
we'll do the whole continent here.

952
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,653
Um,

953
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,860
let me get some water. Oh,
fuck. Completely. Mr. Glass.

954
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,600
Okay. Fucking bad angle here. Um, lastly,

955
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,870
okay. Know Thai, Vietnamese,
mostly spring rolls. Spicy Curry.

956
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,310
I love our guy from fucking Belgium is
telling me about Asian food or you at

957
00:56:58,311 --> 00:57:01,280
least Asian, lots of coriander,

958
00:57:01,281 --> 00:57:05,900
which I personally detest because
it tasted of dishwasher product,

959
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,690
dishwasher, product. Lastly, if
you really want to go hardcore,

960
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:12,170
try out North Korean food, it's
basically starving yourself.

961
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:17,171
You'll be able to see your ginger pube
ding down without a mirror again and no

962
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:19,730
time. Pretty Edgy, Huh? Yes.

963
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,400
You're making fun of the fact that they're
under a dictator that doesn't feed a

964
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:25,480
very edgy, very edgy. Uh,

965
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,250
hope this helped go fuck yourself.
Lots of love for Nia. You know, Cleo,

966
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:34,340
um, oh shit. I guess
I'll give that, you know,

967
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:36,620
I love how Asia stops with
people that we can, you know,

968
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:41,000
it doesn't go into India. That's also
Asia, right? Isn't the Middle East,

969
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:43,460
isn't that also Asia? Russia,

970
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,020
you know. Anyway, so like that
can fucking Forrest Gump. Alright.

971
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,660
Hey Billy Beane, uh, Ben,

972
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:56,050
a fan of the podcast for
a while now. Yada Yada.

973
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,760
I need some advice or just a fresh
perspective on what to do. I'm 23.

974
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,080
Uh, yeah, the primary life dropped out
of high school. Like a dip shit at 17.

975
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,170
Got My GED when I was 19.
I, you're back in the game.

976
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,090
You're back in the game and it decided
to start becoming a productive member of

977
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:17,680
society. Everything was
going good. Paycheck meant a,

978
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:21,910
the dating pool opened up, tried a
few jobs, et cetera. But now I'm 23.

979
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,720
I quit my job to go to, to
go to school for advertising.

980
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:28,120
Slash art at an artsy college.

981
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,970
Should probably mention the only
thing I'm truly good at is art.

982
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,950
Mainly pen and ink stuff. Well, dude,

983
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,670
that's a great thing and he can make
a ton of fucking money doing that.

984
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:41,710
It's just that schools generally
speaking are not geared towards that.

985
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,410
Um, so yeah,

986
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,890
you will fucking bored and then you
took shit that you weren't good at,

987
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,730
made you feel like an asshole. You fucking
dropout your party for a few years.

988
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:57,010
Right. Bagged a couple of who is
and now you're coming back, dude.

989
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:01,180
You fine. You're 23, dude, you're
fine. Uh, that was eight months ago.

990
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,940
I missed the sign. I
missed the sign up date.

991
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:08,380
It just lacked the general knowledge
slash support on going about it.

992
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:12,100
I spent six months grinding
the living shit out of drawing,

993
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:16,720
trying to achieve something I might be
able to take some pride in. Didn't work.

994
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,380
I was just going to say, you're being
too hard on yourself. Your next line is,

995
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:24,470
I'm hard on myself to the point where
I'm thinking I'll never be handed a metal

996
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:28,100
is the greatest that ever
fucking lives. So why bother?

997
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,020
Yeah.

998
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,090
Ah, Jesus Dude. Well listen,

999
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:36,120
Richard Pryor's the greatest of all time
and I'll never come close to that guy.

1000
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:40,200
That does not going to stop me. You
just try to see how close you can come.

1001
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,610
Some people you can't pass and
that's all right. You know,

1002
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,880
you just try to come as close to him.

1003
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:53,690
Try to just like try to go as high up
the all time ladder as you possibly can

1004
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,250
and who knows? If you
keep pushing yourself,

1005
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:57,920
okay,

1006
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,753
listen, you

1007
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,863
okay?

1008
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,770
You don't know what your limits are until
you keep fucking throwing yourself out

1009
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,590
there. Especially if you're hard on
yourself. You probably be in way.

1010
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,280
You're way better than you think you
are. You're going to be fine. All right,

1011
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,940
you're depressing me here anyways.

1012
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,320
I've since quit drawing and now do nothing
but troll around dating sites all day

1013
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,750
and hooking up with
semi-decent looking women,

1014
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,440
women as a way to stay positive
and cure boredom. I'm not lazy.

1015
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:27,740
I've done primarily a
manual labor jobs and no,

1016
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,350
I have the back for it, but Jesus Christ,

1017
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:34,100
I can't force myself to pull the trigger
on anything because I can't be the top

1018
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:38,600
of the crop or the very God damn
best. I want people fulfilled.

1019
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,450
I've been standing at a crossroad,

1020
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:43,820
my Dick and my head for nearly a year
and he sort of vice be fucking amazing.

1021
01:00:43,821 --> 01:00:46,430
Don't hold back. If you think I need to
be ripped a new one, I can handle it.

1022
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:48,440
Thanks. Go Fuck Yourself. Yeah Dude,

1023
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,730
you've got yourself into a completely
paralyzed state here because it's like you

1024
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,450
gotta you just bought a guitar and
because you're not Jimi Hendrix,

1025
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:00,590
within the first two weeks you're
going to fucking quit. All right.

1026
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:04,460
If Jimmy Hendricks did that, he
wouldn't be Jimmy Hendrix. All right?

1027
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,530
Okay.

1028
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,090
All right. Either look just if you,

1029
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,170
whatever you like to do in life, just go
out and do it all right. And enjoy it.

1030
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,330
And don't put that level
of pressure on yourself.

1031
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,550
Like what was your dad like?
The Great Santini is something,

1032
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:25,350
I'm trying to figure out why
you like this, but like, um,

1033
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:31,290
the reason why he can't pull the trigger
on anything else in life is because you

1034
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:32,380
actually have a strong cause.

1035
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,210
I think you have a strong sense on what
makes you happy and what you want to do.

1036
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:37,920
Alright.

1037
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,480
And you know that despite the fact that
you're being totally negative about your

1038
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:42,961
drawing,

1039
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:47,130
you know that that's what you want to
do and you have such a passion for it,

1040
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,200
that you're that hard on yourself.

1041
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:53,540
And then also it's preventing you from
getting a job at the fucking Costco or

1042
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,030
wherever the goddamn place you're
going to end up fucking working at. Um,

1043
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,620
I would, I don't know if I was
you, I would continue drawing.

1044
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,780
I get into computers and all that.

1045
01:02:03,781 --> 01:02:06,580
There's all kinds of stuff I've seen
people do drugs on computers and they

1046
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,110
turned that into building websites,
which helps to pay for their,

1047
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,790
their studio and the shit that
they really want to do this,

1048
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,730
there's tons of money to
make in the arts. Don't,

1049
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:19,710
don't let anybody ever fucking tell you
that there isn't just you just helping

1050
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:22,770
people make it in show business.

1051
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,200
Yeah.

1052
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,120
Alright. This p people who get head
shots give acting classes and all that,

1053
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:32,750
just doing that shit. People
make a small fucking fortune.

1054
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,600
So if you're actually a talented
artists, you can actually,

1055
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,040
you're going to be fine. Um,

1056
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:42,890
you just have to stop beating the shit
out of yourself. All right? So, uh,

1057
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,320
just pay attention to that voice in your
head and when it tells you you can't do

1058
01:02:45,321 --> 01:02:49,130
something, just tell it to
shut the fuck up basically.

1059
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,290
Even if you have to say
it out loud, you know,

1060
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:54,320
just make sure you're not looking at
somebody you care about as they're telling

1061
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:56,420
you a story. When you think of those
thoughts, just, you know, maybe,

1062
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:01,280
maybe say it in your brain
first. All right? Okay. Advice.

1063
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:06,140
No one to relate to cheeses. He's a
fucking gloomy this week. All right.

1064
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,410
Advice. No one to relate to
causing loading loneliness.

1065
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:11,263
Okay.

1066
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:16,050
All right. Hey, Billy, bets. Love the
podcasts. You stand up after a family.

1067
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,190
They all put a smile on my face.
Well, that's great. Okay. Um,

1068
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,630
I'm sensing that all of a sudden
now the smile is going to go away.

1069
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,120
I hope you read this because he had
it. Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

1070
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,320
My problem is I have no one to relate
to and I fear I might as well read this

1071
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:31,680
here. I hope you read this because
I've been doing everything positive,

1072
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:34,320
but I just can't seem to get
my life where I want it to be.

1073
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,130
It's a bit of a long road, so
please bear with me. Oh fuck this.

1074
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:42,710
It's a long email. Did you
know I can't read out loud.

1075
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:44,761
All right.

1076
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:47,970
My problem is I have no one to relate
to and I fear I might be caught.

1077
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:52,630
This might be causing
me to be lonely in life.

1078
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,360
I fear that if I continue the way
I'm going, I may never get over it.

1079
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,970
I'm in my last semester of college in
an engineering program and I've made

1080
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,550
almost no friends throughout
my entire stay at college.

1081
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:07,870
I am at the top of my classes and I'm
lining up jobs at big tech companies.

1082
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,500
Now you're probably managing some
point Dexter with the pocket or pocket

1083
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,700
protector and all that.
Actually I was, that's exactly,

1084
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:19,390
that was the picture you were painting,
sir. Uh, quite the opposite actually.

1085
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:23,050
I've been working out for a few years
now and I have one and I am one of the

1086
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:27,100
jacked people in my classes. All right,

1087
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:29,890
so now I'm picture is that
dude in American psycho,

1088
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:35,500
highly achieving, totally shredded,
cannot relate to human beings.

1089
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,170
Um, I dress well, eat healthy. Please
tell me you don't listen to Huey. Uh,

1090
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,150
Huey Lewis and the news. Um,

1091
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:44,740
yeah,

1092
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:48,620
and always make sure to keep myself clean.

1093
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:52,370
I feel like I might alienate my
classmates from interacting with me.

1094
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:55,580
They probably think I'm just a jock
in their class where it's quite the

1095
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:59,390
opposite. I'm into gaming,
chess and all of that. Dude,

1096
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,730
you're like a fucking
a renaissance man here.

1097
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,520
So I figure I might try to
interact with the opposite crowd,

1098
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:05,660
the Non Geeky people.

1099
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,710
I know a way to meet people is to
get out there and do something. I,

1100
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,680
I like doing, playing some sport
or joining a club or volunteering.

1101
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,110
The problem is with my
program and my work,

1102
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,940
I have little time to be doing much else.

1103
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:21,790
The free time I have is Friday or Saturday
nights that I spend by myself playing

1104
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:24,880
video games or playing guitar
because I have nothing else to do.

1105
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:29,400
While you could go out those nights,
all right. It wasn't always this way.

1106
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,130
This is like a movie.
When I was in high school,

1107
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:35,430
my life was completely the opposite.
I didn't work out, eat healthy,

1108
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,280
work hard or nothing. But I always
find ways to make new friends,

1109
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:41,820
make people laugh and start conversations.
Now that I'm doing everything right,

1110
01:05:41,821 --> 01:05:44,370
it seems my only problem is
social out. Jesus Christ. Dude.

1111
01:05:44,371 --> 01:05:46,260
So you know what you're
doing. You just too busy.

1112
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,470
I figured once I Graduate College,
things will only get worse.

1113
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,600
I lost all of my faith, my family,

1114
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:53,700
apart from my older brother
who was in another country.

1115
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:56,040
So once I graduate college,
I'll truly be alone.

1116
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,180
No one to grab a beer with no one to help
me move or anything to help me move or

1117
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:01,500
anything. Despite all this,

1118
01:06:01,501 --> 01:06:04,650
I try to be positive and thankful what
I have and what I have accomplished.

1119
01:06:04,651 --> 01:06:07,470
Sorry for the long email and go fuck
yourself. Yeah, Dude. You just look.

1120
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:10,530
You already know how to make friends. I
would. You need to make time to do it.

1121
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,530
I'm playing video games by
yourself is very antisocial.

1122
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,110
Uh, playing guitars.
Always. Cool. That's fun.

1123
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:20,700
Why don't you play guitar
with somebody else?

1124
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,720
Find somebody who plays drums and play
bass. Get together, do some covers.

1125
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:25,680
Okay.

1126
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:30,630
You know, jam, fuck around,
you know, drink some beers,

1127
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,560
invite some ladies over. And he did
every week he just adds some more shit.

1128
01:06:34,561 --> 01:06:38,590
Right. You know, start taking bets,

1129
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,010
open your own fucking a draft kinks,
you know, maybe start selling coke.

1130
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,400
Just keep expanding your
ring of a social interaction.

1131
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,040
I'm obviously fucking with
you, but no, I would, uh,

1132
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,470
there's a bunch of people
that are into video games.

1133
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,330
Why don't you find somebody
that you can play against?

1134
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,290
Can you do that anymore to kids do that?
Or do you have to go online to do it?

1135
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,593
You know,

1136
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,720
is that like Courtney now does two
people not sit next to each other with an

1137
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:10,440
Atari with the joystick and the one
red button is, are we past that?

1138
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,200
I don't fucking know, but it seems
like you know how to do that stuff.

1139
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:18,000
He just got busy and uh, with all your
achievements, you, you know, sometimes,

1140
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:21,990
you know, when you go after a
goal, some things suffer. Alright.

1141
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:25,020
I've talked about this numerous
times when I was on, um,

1142
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:30,210
you know, when I was 36 years old, I was,

1143
01:07:30,211 --> 01:07:33,720
I was fucking living alone in a studio
apartment that they call the one bedroom,

1144
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:36,270
sleeping on a futon. I remember
days just going by going,

1145
01:07:36,271 --> 01:07:37,260
what the fuck have I done?

1146
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,840
The only thing I've worked on
is trying to become a comedian.

1147
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,200
Everything else is at the
starting line. And uh,

1148
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,660
over the next 10 years I just
worked on some shit like that.

1149
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:49,260
So that's all you need to
do. All right. Jesus Christ.

1150
01:07:49,261 --> 01:07:54,180
I'm starting to feel like doctor Phil
here. Um, all right, what do we got here?

1151
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,590
Third and goal?

1152
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:59,940
Broncos have the ball with three minutes
left and I'm doing a fucking podcast.

1153
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:04,140
Touchdown Broncos. All right. All right.

1154
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:08,480
Broncos ne go celebrate and act like
a bunch of fucking idiots when Ben

1155
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,420
Roethlisberger has three minutes
left. This one is not over. All right,

1156
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,880
so what does this do?
This puts them up by five.

1157
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:18,710
Hey people in the crowd
holding up two fingers,

1158
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,470
like the crowd is going to look at them.
Oh yeah. Yeah. We should go for too.

1159
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:25,870
Should we, we shouldn't just be
up by six. Thank you. Thank you.

1160
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:30,800
You in the fucking a
mezzanine level. Ah, fuck.

1161
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,710
But we're going to have to go to
Denver. Is this going to be one more?

1162
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:40,230
One more Bray that, either way. This
is going to be great. Either this,

1163
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:44,590
you get to see Brady versus a
Peyton manning. One more time.

1164
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,570
I'm assuming he's retiring,
which is stupid. Or you get
to see another patriots,

1165
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:54,420
a Steelers match up with fucking Big Ben.

1166
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,900
Big Bad. Not Afraid of anything. Big
Bed. Both great teams. All right.

1167
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:01,370
That's the podcast for this week.

1168
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,650
I apologize that my head was
kind of all over the place.

1169
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:07,280
I don't know what flying and going
to the fucking airport does to me.

1170
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:09,843
Um,

1171
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,960
but uh, it makes me even more
fucking scatterbrain. So anyways,

1172
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:17,280
go fuck yourselves and I will talk
to you on Thursday. Okay. All right.
