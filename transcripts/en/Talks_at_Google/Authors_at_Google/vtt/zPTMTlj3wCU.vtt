00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.569
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: Thank you so much for being
here. And thank you so much for inviting me.

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:10.820
This is a great opportunity to talk about
'Dakota Or What's a Heaven for?' And this

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.970
book is literary historical fiction set in
late 19th century Dakota Territory.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.039
And several of the readers have observed,
incorrectly, that it is modeled on 19th century

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:36.430
fiction. Those sort of large, sprawling Victorian
fictions that have a wide tapestry in the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.230
background made up of different strata of
society.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.129
So here we have politicians and industrialists,
railroad executives, bonanza farmers, homesteaders.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.170
And that tapestry that is woven through the
background that has individual stories that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.559
we become interested in. And then there are
threads from each of those stories that work

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.280
their way into the center, the central narrative
rather, of the novel.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.220
And that is a story about a woman who marries
a man, Percy, in order to stay close to Percy's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.680
sister, Anna. And in the late 19th century,
in this part of the world, at this time, it's

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.060
the most she can imagine in terms of staying
close to this other woman.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.799
So I'm going to read a couple of different
sections. And iIn the midst of reading, while

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.610
I'm reading, talk a little bit about what
is going on for some of the characters and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.329
what is going on for me as a, as an author
thinking about these characters. And then

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:52.590
I hope to be able to talk about the book with
y'all. Any questions that come up. And so.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.619
"You will say that I'm just making this up
as if it were a small matter to invent truth.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.540
Accuse me rather of excess. For what can invention
add to fact in the land where trains leave

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.489
their rails to sail through the air, men are
born of frozen beasts and locusts feast on

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.220
human flesh."
So that's the first couple sentences of the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.209
book and with those first sentences is introduced
one of the central themes of the book and

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:32.720
that has to do with narrative in the sense
of who tells what stories to whom and what

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.790
stories do we tell ourselves to ourselves
in order to proclaim and endorse a particular

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.400
identity that we feel.
And do those stories have to be true in order

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.840
to be powerful? And so there's lots of different
ways that narrative works throughout this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.690
book. And as I read a little bit more from
the preamble, you will be able to sense how

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.911
stories are beginning to function in this
novel.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:09.010
Now the preamble itself is a 19th century
convention for novels. And it sort of works

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.110
as a port, an entry way that brings readers
into the book. And so it introduces you to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.510
some characters and some themes that are at
work.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.190
So about the flesh- eating locusts.
[man laughs]

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.110
[audience titters]
I have proof.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.060
Here is General Alfred Sully's report to the
Secretary of War in August of 1864 regarding

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.360
the carnivorous bugs.
"A soldier on his way here lay down to sleep

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.290
on the prairie in the middle of the day. The
troop had been marching all night. His comrades

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.269
noticed him covered with grasshoppers and
awakened him. His throat and wrists were bleeding

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.019
from the bites of the insects." But perhaps,
General Sully, seeking to fill the unearthly

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.159
void of this strange land with words, had
been provoked into exaggeration. For it was

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.500
he who referred to my home as 'Hell with the
fires out'.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:16.420
So I invent. I embellish. I exaggerate. It
is my heritage. In fact, it was a singularly

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.450
brilliant advertising campaign by a railroad
on the verge of bankruptcy that transformed

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.840
Sully's hell into the Nile of the North. Listen
and tell me if you can name this place.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.190
It is a land fair enough to tempt the angels
in their flight to wonder whether a new and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.560
better Eden has not been formed and roofed
with sapphire skies. That's right. Dakota

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.660
Territory. The angels, as is generally the
case, resisted the temptation to tarry. But

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.200
Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, Finns, Icelanders,
Germans, and Russians came in droves.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.460
There were Moravians and Mennonites and Methodists
and Lutherans and the occasional Jew and even

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.980
some Catholics. Slum dwellers pried themselves
loose from the muck and stink of Eastern cities.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.950
Jews left villages in Russia to sink cement
mikvaehs into the prairie.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.330
Newly freed black men set up tonsorial palaces
in prairie towns and learned to speak Norwegian

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.750
to their customers. Farmers, some of them
real Americans, pulled up stakes in Michigan

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.180
and Nebraska and Iowa to try their luck behind
a plow in the new Northwest.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.540
'Wrong side up,' the Indians said, shaking
their heads at the white men intent upon turning

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.120
under perfectly good prairie grass.
I could begin this story of an unlikely place

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.250
composed in equal parts of excess and lack.
Those opposites so fully integrated into the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.120
regional psyche as to be indistinguishable
anywhere. And too much would be left out.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.300
I sort of liked the part about how glaciers
once covered the Northern Plains. But a glacial

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.259
paced reader would surely tax your patience.
As for the millennia when Native Americans

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.520
and their ancestors spent a few months of
each year hunting here, that is not my story

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.470
to tell.
I will skip to the pre-territory trading and

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.210
trapping days and the stories of forts and
soldiers, of treaties made and broken, and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:28.810
of smallpox and Indian agents and graft and
despair and fury and get right to the real

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.810
excitement. Farming."
[audience chuckles]

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.850
So as the, as the preamble progresses, it
gives a little bit of history and very quickly,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.930
I'll run through that.
The Northern tier of the Dakotas was essentially

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.580
colonized by the Northern Pacific Railroad
that had a land grant to build a railroad

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.720
from Duluth to Puget Sound. And it went bankrupt
very quickly in Bismarck. Had no money but

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.410
it had lots of people with lots of stocks
and bonds.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.690
So what – an executive from the railroad
came up with this idea.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.710
[crowd noise in background]
"Look we've got these vast plains that we

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.490
need to populate if we are going to have any
market. And what we need is we need to get

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.590
somebody farming this land. So let's go to
all those people, generally wealthy industrialists

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.920
from the East, who have stocks that are increasingly
worthless. Let them trade those for all this

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.090
land under the condition that they put the
land into production.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:28.660
So what you ended up with would be some of
the directors from the railroad, wealthy industrialists

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.170
from the East who would have like huge, huge
parcels of land in the Dakotas. For maybe

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.950
as much as 25 cents per acre, they would end
up with 40 square miles of farming. Bring

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:46.100
in sort of a migrant force to farm the land
and then stay away. So they weren't really

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.500
part of the community but they had all this
land.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.860
Now interspersed amongst these what was known
as 'Railroad Land' would have been the government

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.930
land that was being sold, being parceled off
to – apportioned off, rather, to homesteaders.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.280
So all of a sudden, there's this huge conflict,
class conflict that gets set up right away.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.610
People who are absent with a lot of money
and a lot of land. People who are living on

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:21.400
the land and trying to make it without much
money. One hundred sixty acres would have

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:28.000
been just one quarter of a square mile.
So this gets back to that sense of narrative

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.280
because the Dakotas are not necessarily an
easy place to live. And bBut Dakotans love

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.490
to tell themselves the story about 'how hardy
we are. Nobody else could live here. We're

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.510
the only ones who couldan live here.'
And so there's this story sort of helps people

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:49.760
to live in that particular place. So I'm going
to pick up on the top of page four for those

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.320
of you who have a book there.
"The advertisements about the Dakotas had

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.240
told the truth about the fertile land of the
Red River Valley of the Dakota Territory.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.550
About the miracles of sunsets that set the
prairies ablaze with color. The blue skies

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.830
that clap the land with clarity. The peace
of space.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:14.260
But they hadn't mentioned the wind or the
dust or the hale or the tornadoes or the locusts.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.800
'A sea of grass' did not translate in the
immigration leaflets into 'no trees'. And

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.170
few could imagine the cramped isolation of
a 10 by 12 foot shanty on the Dakota prairie.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:32.990
Inside, no privacy. Outside, no neighbors.
The settlers discovered soon enough that there

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.270
was no market for their wheat nearby and,
unlike the bonanza farmers, they did not get

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.190
special transport rates from the railroad
or special storage rates for the elevators

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.380
that were owned by the railroad. They did
not receive rebates from the milling companiesy.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:52.100
They paid retail prices for their machinery.
Their interest rates from the banks in the

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:59.690
East were high. Twenty percent was not uncommon.
So they told themselves the story. They were

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:05.370
special because they could live in this place
of wind and dust and haille and tornadoes

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.090
and locusts despite the railroad, the milling
companies, the implement dealers and the bankers.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:18.060
The story gave them back their independence.
That narrative of independence remains as

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.820
powerful, as false, as necessary as ever in
the Dakotas.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.200
[crowd noise increases in the background]
It has become our fetish replacing the lost

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.400
object of desire, the impossible place that
never was. You have been told that there is

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.330
nothing there. I tell you there is too much.
Even when there is nothing, there is too much

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.010
of it.
And who am I? I'm an old politician pretty

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.960
close to honest and I know the stories of
this territory from before there was such

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.440
a thing.
I am the Land Commissioner for the Northern

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.730
Pacific Railroad in charge of the Land and
Immigration Department. Sometimes in my dreams

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.930
I wear a robe and flowing beard. And behind
me the multitudes flow towards this land of

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.370
milk and honey.
I am a Scot from Ontario and I have come to

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.670
this land to chew it up and make myself fat.
Someday I will be called 'The Boss of North

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:18.620
Dakota'.
I am just a girl from Norway. I am Frances

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:24.960
Louise Houghton Bingham, daughter-in-law of
John Bingham, wife of his son, Percy, friend

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.090
of Percy's sister, Anna. And I mean for this
to be my story. It too is a story of what

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.720
a woman's patience can endure as well as what
a woman's resolution can achieve. As to whether

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.150
that refers in this case to one woman or two,
you will have to make up your own mind.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:50.120
And so, reader, to Frances, alone in the bedroom
she shares with her husband in his father's

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:58.060
home in St. Paul, Minnesota. It is January
of 1874. There is a photograph in her hand."

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.880
So with that, you get the sort of the porch,
I said. The introduction into the central

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.630
story. And much of the story is going to follow
this character, Frances Houghton Bingham,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:15.920
who is not necessarily nice. She does things
she ought not to do.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.630
But I really hope as readers read her, that
they sort of end up liking her and thinking,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:27.279
'Yes. You tried that.'
Now one of the things that happens is that

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:33.010
John Bingham, her father-in-law, becomes a
bonanza farmer, moves to Dakota Territory.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:40.170
Her husband, who wants to be a journalist,
moves to Fargo and leaving the two women,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.550
the sister and sister-in-law, Frances, my
character, and the object of her affection,

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:51.460
Anna, behind.
And pretty soon, they decide that it's time

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:59.070
to bring the women out West to see the bonanza
farm. And the part I'm going to read from

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:05.250
now is the very first time that Anna and Frances
– I'm on page 131. It's in the chapter in

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:15.910
which the women go West. And this is as they
are going to the Dakotas for the very first

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.910
time on their own.
[pause]

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:26.180
"Fatigued by her mother's final illness, death,
and funeral, by the business of closing up

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.240
the Summit House, and packing for a two week
visit to Fargo, by the almost twenty hour

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:37.420
trip, Anna had finally given in to the locomotion's
lulling rock. The colorful bird that completes

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:42.870
the red and black silk trim of her small chip
hat cushions her head against the window as

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:49.660
if there its flight has tragically ended.
As Frances watches, Anna's lips part. But

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.550
immediately with the rigor of manners that
the barely asleep will maintain, she brings

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:01.240
them together again. Frances waits, pleasantly
aware of the pulse beating in her own throat,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.910
of the heat that flushes her skin. And then,
as she had hoped, Anna's lips part again,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.029
just enough to show the tips of her teeth.
A tiny thread of saliva appears as Anna's

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:19.550
jaw relaxes. Anna's tongue darts between her
lips before they close. Again, even now, as

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:25.839
Anna sleeps, rocked into somnolence by the
train's rhythm, she maintains the air of serenity

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.720
that she has cultivated in response to her
body's aches.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.890
The effort this composure has painted, has
painted a patina of maturity upon Anna's face

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.980
that heightens her beauty beyond the promise
of her early conventional prettiness. She

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.270
is a beautiful woman, suffering beautifully.
And Frances loves her for it.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:51.501
Odd, Frances thinks, relaxing into a more
leisurely study of Anna's figure, how the

00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:58.339
absence of the other Binghams, consistently
of John, frequently of Percy, and now permanently

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:04.690
of Anna's mother, Rhoda, has made it less
easy for her to openly observe her beloved.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:10.360
Whereas triangulated conversation allows for
the casual study of another, a tête à tête

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:15.700
calls for strict policing of the gaze, directed
toward the eyes, always, forbidden to drop

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:22.370
to the full lips, the swell of the breasts,
the curve of the hip, the ankle.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:28.029
So here, on the final stretch of the long
train ride on a warm August day, Frances takes

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:34.610
advantage of the opportunity to look, just
look, and dream.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.950
Rhoda Bingham's death has cemented the women's
relationship in a way that Frances could not

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.980
have anticipated."
So I am going to skip a few paragraphs because

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.250
[audience member coughs]
then Frances begins to think of something

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.160
in the past and I am going to keep on going
with the present here.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.710
"And still Frances thinks her focus for the
moment on Anna's hands primly folded on her

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:01.649
lap. She is not satisfied. She wants more
than the love and affection that Anna so willingly

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:08.830
offers her friend and sister-in-law. She desires
the unknown and that is hard to come by.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:15.230
'This', Frances thinks, silently addressing
her sleeping companion, 'is where we differ.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:24.020
You, Anna, are satisfied to be and I am desperate
to become. But become what?' Frances chuckles

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.940
to herself thinking, 'I am become Percy. That's
what. With my head in the clouds and my mind

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:36.010
filled with if, if, if. Well then, if what?'
Despite the very visceral pleasure Frances

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:41.120
takes in her appraisal of Anna, she is not
such an aberration of her sex that she believes

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.830
in her power to aeffect great change. She
is not a wealthy capitalist, a Frederick Billings

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.520
whose plan for reorganization, she has heard,
has saved a railroad intact.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.589
She is not a professional man, a J. B. Power,
say, whose vision has set in motion an advertising

00:16:57.589 --> 00:17:03.029
campaign of such sweep and breadth that it
promises to dot the wilderness of wildflowers

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:09.270
and grass with farm and hamlets.
She is not even an Alexander MacKenzie, described

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:15.439
to her by Percy as uneducated and illiterate
but unabashed ambition for he believes that

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:24.660
a man can begin with nothing and build a kingdom
out of nowhere. Percy says he has chosen Bismarck.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:31.670
No. Frances cannot build. She cannot bank.
She cannot broadcast, buy, or bully. Those

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.929
are things for a man to do. A woman's desires
must be subtle if she knows and it will cause

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:41.960
her naught but pain should her reach exceed
her grasp.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:49.380
Still, if she has been taught to want less,
it does not follow that she will want less

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:57.020
desperately. And so Frances waits."
So what happens, soon thereafter, is that

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:05.600
Frances herself is somewhat seduced but unexpectedly
by, not so much by another person but by this

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.650
place, this place that is Dakota. There is
all sorts of boosters at this time talking

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:16.620
about how glorious this place was.
And most of the language was fairly empty.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:22.540
It was just meant to get people into the Dakotas.
And then over and over again, in the, in the

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.240
diaries that I would read [clears throat].
Excuse me. Or the histories or reading letter

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.100
press books and archives, I would get this,
hear this tone from people who were essentially

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.920
being seduced by their own language. And sort
of falling in love with the place and with

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.650
the potential of the place. [takes sip of
water]

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:49.150
[pause]
So now Anna and Frances are dragging out to

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:56.600
see the land that is under cultivation. I'm
going to page ,– let's see, – 143. And

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.929
as they are driving towards this land that
is under cultivation, towards the bonanza

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:07.610
farm which isn't really a farm yet at this
point; – it's just people farming. There

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:14.771
isn't actually a homestead, yet.
They see something.

00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:17.160
[pause]
You have to imagine. There's something -- they're

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.510
driving in one direction in their buggy and
something appears from the left.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:25.070
"Anna and John Bingham too look toward the
approaching spectacle that had burst forth

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.890
from a stand of scrub trees that stood at
the edge of the sloughue they had been skirting

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:34.050
for the past half mile as they neared the
Cheyenne River. Seeing that the apparition

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:40.100
was itself on a dirt path precisely perpendicular
to their own, John Bingham pulled the bay

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.120
to a stop.
Silently the Binghams watched the cloud of

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.380
dust clarify into a team of four workhorses
pulling an empty farm wagon at a dead run,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.070
piloted, piloted by what proved to be a young
woman who drove the horses forward while standing

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.660
on the wagon seat, reins held tightly in her
left hand, whip cracking regularly from her

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.600
right.
Without so much as a glance at the tidy buggy

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.900
with its fancy bay crow stepping in agitation,
the wagon's driver hurtled the team forward

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:15.510
and past. Within moments, the spectacle had
diminished into a receding line of dust.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.020
When John Bingham allowed the bay to step
forward, Anna was released of speech but she

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:26.080
did not get beyond the obvious.
'That was a woman.' Anna's incredulity was

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.520
clearly mixed with horror. 'She wore no hat.'
Anna summed the impossibility of what she

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.320
had seen.
'Shame to see a team driven like that for

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.180
no good reason,' Bingham said. 'Most of the
settlers around here, immigrant or not, don't

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.790
really have the leisure for a fine distinction
between masculine and feminine duties.'"

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:51.250
Now as they are speaking, Frances is thinking
again. She's watching again, what she has

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.500
just seen.
"As John Bingham spoke, Frances let herself

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.290
see again the young woman and her team as
it flew past. The brownness of the girl's

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:03.670
face was unfortunate, to be sure, and the
thin ropes of muscle that stood out upon her

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.559
forearm as she grasped the handful of thick
reins had been unsightly.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:13.050
But the hair that had come loose and flowed
wildly behind her, the calico dress opened

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:18.380
at the throat, the sun and breeze, the skirt
pressing against her long legs that bent and

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.410
moved with the bouncing of the wagon upon
the rough track like agile springs. Why, it

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:31.330
had been a breathtaking display, as much for
its grace and force as in its inappropriateness.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.110
Frances shifted in her seat to rearrange the
coils of her bustle and relieve the press

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:42.260
of her corset into her side that, a moment
ago, she had not noticed. The pads, so recently

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.929
pinned into the sleeves of her dress, were
already moist. Again, she imagined the girl

00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:53.790
who had flown past.
'What,' she wondered, 'must that feel like?'

00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:00.000
And what was this place from which such impossibilities
could spring? Perhaps Anna's analogy of the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.470
empty frame, the unpainted canvas, was apt.
Perhaps here was a place in which Frances

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:15.260
could paint herself into a sensible world.
Perhaps here in this world of the known and

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.670
the necessary, of men involved in industry
and agriculture and railroads and politics,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:26.070
of settlers and storekeepers, Yankees and
immigrants, capitalists and laborers, there

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:31.950
would be space for a new life, heretofore
unknown.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:37.299
She could happily dot her canvas with these
horses, oxen, machinery, and men that she

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:41.760
could now see moving among the expanse of
gold they approached for they all struck her

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.670
as strangely beautiful in their purpose and
energy.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:50.600
She was about to ask her father-in-law to
stop the buggy so she could better study this

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:56.790
bustling tableau, a rectangle of labor surrounded
by an expanse of untrammeled prairie, when

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.660
he did just that.
Individually each team of harvesters followed

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:07.450
the trajectory of a straight line. In unison,
they formed a wedge of progress.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:16.059
'Yes, there', Frances thought. Not in the
center but well in the background. Perhaps

00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:19.241
in the vanishing point on the horizon toward
which the wedge's line directed her eye. There

00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:28.490
she could paint her life with Anna."
So there's a sense that Frances begins to

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.700
think [audience member sneezes], 'Okay. There's
this empty space. Here's this empty canvas.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:38.500
I'm going to imagine the unimaginable. I'm
going to try to make possible' what she conceived

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.840
to be as impossible.
And I don't, I will give you no spoilers but

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.700
I will say that, that again much of the narrative
of what was possible was deeply gendered and

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.309
some things were not going to be available
for women that were available for men.

00:23:54.309 --> 00:24:00.510
But also it was sort of a certain sign of
her own upper class background that she was

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.720
able to even imagine making the space for
herself.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.730
But I don't want to suggest that there were
not possibilities for women because absolutely

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:14.360
there were. For example, women could take
homesteads. Women could have a place of their

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.049
own.
Now I want to read one more short passage.

00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:22.251
And before I read that passage, I just need
to give you a little bit of background.

00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:27.280
So one of the other themes that's at work
in the novel has to do with transformation.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:34.059
We, of course, have the transformation of
this prairie into a place of agriculture.

00:24:34.059 --> 00:24:37.630
But there are also several characters who
represent this transformation.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:43.799
So, for example, there's a man who leaves
Russia as Yitzhak Shavinitz and he leaves

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:49.750
New York as Isaac Shavinitz and he steps off
the train in Fargo Dakota Territory as Jack

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.890
Shaw.
[audience chuckles]

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:56.240
And so part of what happens is that we look
at what are the gains and what are the losses.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.700
When you shear off a part of your identity
to take on a new identity, what happens?

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:08.429
There's a character named Little Carl who
is the farm cook who goes through a more dramatic

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:12.179
transformation. I can't say any more about
him because that certainly would be a spoiler.

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:19.090
And then there was another character, Kirsten
Knudson. Now Kirsten was meant to be a peripheral

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:26.679
character who sort of represented that transformation
from young immigrant girl to American woman.

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:35.210
And Kirsten just grew and grew and grew as
I wrote. Now partly it was because I gave

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.440
drinking caffeine about 10 years ago.
[audience laughs]

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.549
But I discovered with Kirsten, I needed to
drink caffeine to do her voice. And so maybe

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:45.990
I was just allowing myself more caffeine than
I was used to.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.840
[audience laughs]
Or maybe there's something about that caffeine

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.299
that made me write more. I don't know. But
her voice just grew and it became more and

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:57.480
more important to the center of the book.
And the book is written in third person but

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.960
Kirsten's voice was always in first person.
I always heard her speaking, 'I' this, 'I'

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.730
that. And I thought, 'Well, I'll just go with
the voice that I'm comfortable with and then,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.780
when it comes time to finish the book, I'll
transfer her into third person. How hard can

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.330
that be?'
Impossible. She was just, she was just the

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:23.549
person in this book who was going to be 'I',
first person, and not – and it took me,

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:29.559
it took me years to figure out why that made
sense. I think that authors don't always know

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:34.720
why they are doing what they are doing. [clears
throat] But it makes sense that Kirsten speaks

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.799
in the first person.
And so this is just a little bit from Kirsten's

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:44.800
voice. I'm on page 157 from the chapter in
which Kirsten begins to learn about love.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.451
And one of the things also about Kirsten is,
one of the joys writing her is that this book

00:26:49.451 --> 00:26:57.260
takes place over an eight or nine period of
years, of time. And if she's a young immigrant

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.929
girl becoming American, her language has to
constantly change. And so this was one of

00:27:01.929 --> 00:27:08.059
the challenges of writing the book, was to
make her sound like she had taken on more

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:17.000
language with each. with each year and she
loves language. So Kirsten Knudson.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.480
"Kirsten Knudson, Kirsten Knudson, Kirsten
Knudson. That is my name still. I hope it

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.480
always is to be."
'Mor' which is Norwegian for 'mother'.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.500
"Mor says it is different that I will feel
someday and all I can say is that I will have

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.880
to feel very different than I feel now if
I'm to feel different about that some day.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:38.820
And if I do feel different and that is as
Mrs. Harkness, my teacher, said last October

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.419
when I asked if the Sullivan boys would be
coming back to school to be neither encouraged

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:48.240
or anticipated.
I do not think I will feel like being Kirsten

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.700
Rolstrud. That is the name that is on the
paper that I am putting into the firebox of

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.120
the stove. When Mor comes through the door
with a load of kindling that my sisters, Haldis

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.429
and Gree and I are all the time to pick up
in the trees by the river. Now why do I have

00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:08.980
such a piece of paper?
Did I write it myself? Ja.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.680
Well then you would not ask such a thing to
look at the writing you did. Mrs. Harkness

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.330
says that for writing I have the finest something,
something -- it is a long word – of all

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.430
her students. Her students know more that
is although some will be but not me because

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:28.710
this year, Mrs. Harkness is to teach at her
home in Fargo. And that is too far for me

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.150
to go evveery day.
And of the school I've had enough, father

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:36.660
says, because I'm a girl and almost 15 years
old. Ole, he says that it is it is not a real

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:41.430
school anyway. And that there is a real school
in Fargo now with a real teacher, a Mrs. Giddings.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.539
And that Mrs. Harkness is – oh never mind
what Ole says. It is not always so nice and

00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:51.760
that is not the point.
The point is that the name 'Kirsten Rolstrud'

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.340
on the paper is like one of Mor's hens got
a pencil in its beak and then tried to stab

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.429
a bug with it and kept missing. And I am saying
right here and right now that every single

00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:06.760
one of Mor's hens is with more sense than
Halber Rolstrud who is the one to write that

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:11.750
name and then hand it to me when I am walking
out of the door after hearing Pere Rolstrud's

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:17.220
Sunday morning sermon.
And that is, as Mrs. Harkness would say, taking

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.120
the undue advantage. And that means I think
to do something that the done to would like

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.429
to undo."
[audience chuckles]

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:31.980
So that's Kirsten and she's a lot of fun to
work with and again, she ends up being one

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:38.630
of the just and fairly large figure in the
book when she was just supposed to be this

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.530
girl off to the side.
[man chuckles]

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.180
So that's the reading and I would love to
answer any questions that you guys have or

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.490
to talk about this book.
Anything?

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:55.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah. Where did
sort of , -- clearly landscape and geography

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:59.910
is really rooted here. Is that where the story
started for you? Was it with the land or was

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.250
it with the characters?
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: That's a great question.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:07.360
I think that if you are a Dakotan and you
are writing, it's a given that you have to

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.660
write about land.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Uh huh.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.130
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: That it is so much a part
of our psyche and they know there are lots

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.860
of sociologists, psychologists who sort of
argue against this notion of a regional psyche.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.830
But I think absolutely there are different
regional identities.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.210
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: We are formed by a space

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:29.580
as much as by people. And there is something
about that space and again, most of this book

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:35.130
is set in the Eastern part of the Dakotas
which is very flat. It's as flat as this table

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.710
top. And then the further west you get, you
get into the rolling hills. And then you get

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:46.320
into the Badlands.
But sSo there is within those of us who are

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.991
from that place, there is a sense of needing
to be, have an openness around us. And for

00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:59.730
example, often you will notice how people
have different air, spaces around them when

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:04.740
they talk. And a Dakotan will always have
about an arm's length

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.110
.And if somebody moves into that emotional
space, he'll just keep moving, just keep moving

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:17.090
back into the corner. So there's this emotional
space that reflects the physical space. But

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:22.470
there are all, the characters were also pretty
crucial to me as I began. And the story has

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:28.340
this long evolution and the evolution of some
of the characters started before I realized

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.630
I was working on this novel.
So right after I finished my first novel,

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:39.970
'Mavis', my partner and I were on vacation
on Pawley Island and we were like good tourists.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:45.090
We were in one of these tourists shops flipping
through postcards and all these vintage postcards

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.260
that have a funny line at the bottom.
And there was one postcard and there were

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:55.730
15 young women on it. And one of the women
just caught my attention. She just didn't

00:31:55.730 --> 00:32:04.049
look like any of the rest of them. She just
looked so smart. It was just one of those

00:32:04.049 --> 00:32:06.580
where the eyes come out of the photograph.
So I sat down that week and wrote a short

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.299
story. I don't write short stories but it
seemed like a good thing to do. And it is

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:20.520
published in the most obscure journal in the
world. I mean you would have to look very

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.260
hard to find this journal in England and I
don't recommend that you do.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.670
Anyway, so then I put that story aside and
I thought, 'Well, I am going to write a story

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.370
about Dakota territory' 'cause I thought the
history's interesting. And I started working

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.340
on that. This is 10 years ago or over 10 years
ago.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:37.670
Then another story intervened, one that became
emotionally more important to me. So I put

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.860
the notion of writing a story about Dakota
territory away and worked on this other book.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.480
It wasn't until 2001 that I thought, 'Okay
I'm ready to go back to a story about Dakota

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.309
territory, homesteading, bonanza farming,
all that.' But there was that character from

00:32:54.309 --> 00:33:01.710
almost forgotten short story waiting for me
in a sense. And so I brought her back into

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:06.549
the story. And it had nothing to do with that
short story I had written. It was just that

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:13.200
character who was ready to be developed.
And so in that sense, it began with that character.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:18.170
And then it also began also with this other
character, Anna. And I had, I had the ending.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.990
I rarely have the ending to a book in mind
when I write but I had this perfect ending.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:28.562
I even had the line. I could hardly wait to
get there

00:33:28.562 --> 00:33:29.562
[audience laughs]
because I had the line.. And then Anna refused

00:33:29.562 --> 00:33:35.360
to do what I wanted her to do. It just historically
was not honest. She just could not act the

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:43.140
way I wanted her to act. She was not going
to give either me or Frances what we wanted.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:47.400
And I just think that this is part of writing
honest historical fiction. You realize at

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:52.180
some point that you may have an idea where
you think your story's going to go and then

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.809
you just realize to be honest, your character's
not going to do that. Your character's not

00:33:56.809 --> 00:33:59.220
going to think that. Your character's not
going to go there.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:05.140
And so I ended up rethinking the novel and
fortunately other characters stepped up to

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.494
the plate and helped me come to a resolution.
So there's this kind of a combination of land

00:34:08.494 --> 00:34:13.019
and characters working at the same time.
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: It seems like

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:21.079
when you're doing historical fiction, you
have to do a lot of research to make sure

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.079
that you're not just fantasizing.
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: Making stuff up.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.079
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Like you said,

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:24.079
you had the perfect ending but you knew your
character wouldn't do that. So how did you

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:28.241
go about the research process?
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: Lots of fun ways and lots

00:34:28.241 --> 00:34:32.769
of sort of rigorous ways. The fun way is that
for a couple of years while I was writing,

00:34:32.769 --> 00:34:38.210
two straight years, I didn't allow myself
to read any fiction for fun outside the 19th

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:43.760
century. And that was basically to allow a
certain cadence to come into my writing so

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:50.450
I could hear voices. And then just a lot of
archival research so the Institute for Research..

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:54.929
[pause].
Is that right? Nope. The Institute for Regional

00:34:54.929 --> 00:35:00.519
Studies that published this book at North
Dakota State University has terrific archives

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:06.450
and I spent a couple of summers in those archives
reading letter press books of executives.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:12.749
They would write their letters and they'd
be on sort of a carbon copy and they'd be

00:35:12.749 --> 00:35:15.509
in big books. So I could read year after year
of their books.

00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:20.279
And that allowed me to understand what was
happening with the railroad, what was happening

00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:25.250
with politics, what was happening with the
homesteaders, the bonanza farmers. And then

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:32.099
just going, spending a lot of time reading
history books, reading memoirs, diaries. But

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:38.400
the fun about being a novelist. I was going
to say, 'The fun of being a novelist as opposed

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.700
to being a professor; but of course being
a professor is a lot of fun too.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:45.549
But the fun of being a novelist as opposed
to a rigorous historian is that you get to

00:35:45.549 --> 00:35:53.450
allow for a lot of space of serendipity. So
if I am, was looking on microfilm at a particular

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:59.410
Dakota Territory newspaper for something that
might have been happening in the legislature

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:06.029
at that particular time, and over on this
side I see a, something like a classified

00:36:06.029 --> 00:36:12.469
that says, 'Mrs. So-and-So has left my bed
and board and I am refusing to pay her bills.

00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:15.400
Mr. So-and-So.'
And all of a sudden, you think, 'Who puts

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.029
this in a newspaper in the first place?'
[audience laughs]

00:36:18.029 --> 00:36:23.680
And secondly what's the story behind this?
So all of a sudden, I may be paying attention

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.440
to what's going on over here but I'm copying
this down and thinking, 'Is there a place

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:35.849
where this will work in my novel?' And often
answers to plot problems, I found seren-,

00:36:35.849 --> 00:36:42.329
serendip-, serendipitously through just flipping
through journals or newspapers or things like

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:47.010
that. And as a scholar, I enjoyed that sort
of research and so it all came, -- everything

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.180
kind of fit together. Good question.
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: How do you go

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:53.789
about getting your book published? Like did
you say that the North Dakota,..

00:36:53.789 --> 00:37:02.050
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: The North Dakota State
University Institute for Regional Studies.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.289
[audience laughs]
Thank you. I got it.

00:37:03.289 --> 00:37:08.060
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So did they give
you a grant to start this or did you finish

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.989
the book and go to them? Or how,..
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: It actually backs up a

00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:16.380
little bit because my first novel had been
published by a mainstream New York press.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:22.089
My hope of course was to go back to them because
that's where most of the marketing will be

00:37:22.089 --> 00:37:27.039
available. And, but my agent went, my agent
was the -- first you have to have an agent.

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:29.869
You have to have a literary agent
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: Right.

00:37:29.869 --> 00:37:34.109
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: in New York. And for this
type of book, but my agent wasn't able to

00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:38.530
sell it to one of the New York houses. And
I kept getting this thing over and over again,

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:42.109
which was: 'Love the story. Great writing.
Great characters. We've never read this story

00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:46.319
before but we don't know how we would market
it to a wide audience.'

00:37:46.319 --> 00:37:51.210
Because they, they have jobs to keep and they
have, -- it all has a lot to do with selling

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:57.690
books which in some ways that's too bad because
there are a lot of really great books that

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.549
aren't making it into that best seller range.
Anyway so then I said to my agent, 'Let's

00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:09.789
try University Presses because there is a,
it is [pause] honest historical fiction and

00:38:09.789 --> 00:38:14.420
it is literary historical fiction. So I think
the University Presses would work.'

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.280
I actually went to undergraduate school in
North Dakota State University. So my agent

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.869
was able to talk to the people back there
and I was able to talk to them and they were

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:29.650
thrilled. They have actually been thrilled
to publish this book and have done just a

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:33.759
gorgeous job with it. And there's actually
something kind of positive about not having

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:38.660
a mainstream New York house which I would
have not have complained about.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:46.630
Don't get me wrong. But with, -- if a book
is published, say by Random House or Knopf

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:53.000
for something big and splashy, it doesn't
have much time to make it on the bookshelf.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.500
And we all know the bookshelves are sort of
disappearing. And so you, -- the, -- there's

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:05.079
a sense that you make it right away or you
don't. But the joy of having a University

00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:09.489
Press to do this is that they're in it for
the long haul. And so there can be this sort

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:12.599
of grass roots understanding that there is
a good book out there and word of mouth still

00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:16.359
does sell books and still does get enthusiasm
going.

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:25.599
But also I'm lucky in that I have an e-publisher
and so people who do not have access to -- it's

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:33.752
available on Amazon dot com too. But who don't
want to buy a hardback can get it on any e-reader

00:39:33.752 --> 00:39:35.779
which is a useful thing these days when book
stores are sort of disappearing.

00:39:35.779 --> 00:39:36.779
[pause]
Anything else?

00:39:36.779 --> 00:39:39.579
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: So who do you
feel like were your biggest mentors or are

00:39:39.579 --> 00:39:46.809
your mentors in the industry?
&gt;&gt;Brenda Marshall: I don't know that I actually

00:39:46.809 --> 00:39:53.969
have mentors in the industry. I have people
who have been very, very good to me and helpful.

00:39:53.969 --> 00:40:02.700
I am one of these writers who does not really
like to share work while I'm writing. I want

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:09.489
to be as done as I can get before I actually
show somebody. And then a process of revision

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:14.119
always happens. The agent says, 'Well'.
My agent, when she first read my book which

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:18.170
is 200 pages longer, she said, 'You have two
wonderful books here. You have a history book

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.900
and a novel. [audience laughs] Which one would
you like to publish?'

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.819
So then it comes back to me and I have to
get rid of 200 pages which was probably a

00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:34.059
good thing to do. Broke my heart but I did
it. And again it was a good thing to do. So

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:39.369
then there's that sort of revising going on
and editors will ask for revisings.

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:46.469
But for the most part, I want to -- it's not
so much that I only trust myself. It's that

00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:51.810
I don't trust that I won't take advice that
isn't good. I really trust readers when they

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.039
talk to me and they say, 'Well this didn't
work. This didn't work. This could have been

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:56.039
better.'
And I think, 'Okay. I have to change this.

00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:57.900
I have to change that. I have to make this
better.''

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.430
And then a part of me thinks, 'Is that true
to the book itself, to the heart of the book

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.210
itself?'
And so that's why I work mostly on my own.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:15.319
But there are people saying, people at the
University of Michigan. Peter Ho Davies has

00:41:15.319 --> 00:41:22.479
been, was good enough to write this lovely
blurb on the background, on the back, comparing

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:25.229
my book to George Eliot's 'Middlemarch'. Not.
[audience laughter]

00:41:25.229 --> 00:41:34.329
I just want to say that that is, that is the
most wonderful thing that anybody could say.

00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:38.460
I know who George Eliot is. I know. I know
how far to take that comparison. But what

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:45.079
he's talking, what he is saying is that there's
this big panoramic background and , or also

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:49.890
comparing it to Sarah Waters' fiction which
if you are readers of Sarah Waters, she writes

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:55.661
really terrific historical fiction.
Charlie Baxter used to teach here at the University

00:41:55.661 --> 00:42:00.219
of Michigan. He's now at the University of
Minnesota. And his book, 'Feast of Love',

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:06.400
was a National Book Award finalist. And he
has been a good help to me throughout too.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.089
In terms of actually -- those are the people
who help you once you've written the book

00:42:10.089 --> 00:42:18.550
and are saying, 'Okay. I want to help this
see a public.' In terms of writers that have

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:24.900
been meaningful to me, I think I am more inclined
to talk about books that have been meaningful

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:30.029
as opposed to writers 'cause I often don't
follow one writer's work down the line.

00:42:30.029 --> 00:42:37.710
I'll think after awhile and Salman Rushdie
is a terrific author whose first four books

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.849
I just could not read fast enough. And I don't
know if I'll read any more of his books. You

00:42:41.849 --> 00:42:45.109
know you get to a point where you don't know
if you'll read any more.

00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:50.849
'The Great Gatsby'. Jay Gatsby who was originally
James Gadson, -- I don't know if any of you

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:54.819
remember that, -- from North Dakota. That's
part of his, that's part of his story and

00:42:54.819 --> 00:42:59.229
part of that drive. That belief that you can
do anything if just you work hard enough even

00:42:59.229 --> 00:43:02.049
if what you want might not be such a good
thing. Or your drive.

00:43:02.049 --> 00:43:05.799
The way you get what you want might not be
so good but that sense of 'ok, iIf I just

00:43:05.799 --> 00:43:11.559
follow the rules, if I just fill in these
squares, I can succeed.' And that's a very

00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:17.130
Midwestern, very North Dakota way of thinking.
So that book has been crucial to me.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:21.390
'Middlemarch' again has been crucial just
in terms of watching

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:29.220
[pause]
George Eliot's intelligence work at work in

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:38.180
a novel. Just that, the bravery of watching
that much intelligence in the midst of a really

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:45.769
compelling story and of being able to devise
a world that was so huge, all at once. That

00:43:45.769 --> 00:43:50.660
was, that was, that was pretty meaningful
to me. She's somebody's books I read over

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:56.440
and over and over again.
If anybody here has never read anything by

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.569
Marilyn Robinson, 'Housekeeping' is my favorite.
But she has others. That's a book, those are

00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:07.960
books to run out and get. And again, she has
been an influence I would say in the sense

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:15.180
again of what quiet intelligence can do and
how much you can just fall in love with certain

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.339
characters. It is just her –' Housekeeping
' is just a small book but it is, it is, it

00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:23.420
is so beautifully written.
I mean, I'm dobeing this advertisement for

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.420
'Housekeeping'.
[audience laughter[

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.700
It is so beautifully written that it almost
scans like poetry and yet it is smart and

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:36.400
it is funny and it is just, -- it is just
the book I think everybody ought to be reading.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.769
[pause]
Anything else?

00:44:37.769 --> 00:44:40.049
[pause]
All right. Thank you.

00:44:40.049 --> 00:44:45.289
Male Audience Member #2: Thank you so much.
This has been great.

00:44:45.289 --> 00:44:45.799
