00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.310
LESTER CHEN: Thanks
so much, Emily.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.160
So I will assure you all a
disclaimer that our slides

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.910
won't be as graph-heavy as
Andreas', and we won't be

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.060
talking about stage rollouts
and whatnot kind of like Emily,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.570
but--

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.440
TIMOTHY EVANS: Over the head.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.565
LESTER CHEN: Over the head.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.860
But we're here talking
about content, and content

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.360
as it relates to YouTube.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
And I'm on the YouTube end,
and who better to bring

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.910
than a YouTuber himself?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.281
You're all the way from Boston.

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.280
And we're be talking about
mobile gaming content

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.590
and the rise of
how users have been

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.420
consuming content on YouTube
around this category.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.810
So I'll do some slides.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.720
Let's see about where
mobile gaming has come from.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.380
So obviously a huge evolution
from linear puzzle games

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.040
like a Tetris to all of a
sudden, a worldwide interactive

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.471
[? PVP ?] game such
as Clash Royale.

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:52.720
And when talking about these
kind of games and the way

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.000
that content is
consumed, they obviously

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.760
have very different
characteristics.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.650
Replayability,
iterative game modes,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.380
which gives folks
like Tim a lot more

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.750
content to make
once a game is both

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.200
launched and has DLC
coming out regularly.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
So mobile gaming on YouTube
has really seen a huge increase

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.530
in the past two
years, as far as hours

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.550
watched is a main metric
that we use at YouTube.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.150
Not so much views anymore,
more just total empirical hours

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.290
or time watched has just
completely blown up.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.270
And I think games like
the Supercell games,

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.420
Clash of Clans, Clash Royale,
games like Pokemon Go,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.400
which saw a huge
spike last year,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.640
and other games like Puzzles
and Dragons or Lineage or Angry

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.750
Birds have really led to this
sudden increase on both content

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.900
produced and content consumed.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.220
So this is just a brief timeline
of how watch time on YouTube

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.540
has been really expanding
since all the way in 2015.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.539
So as you can see, the
launch of Clash Royale

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.830
led to a little bit of a spike.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.610
And then last year Pokemon
was a phenomenal event

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.690
that we've been tracking,
which led to a sudden peak.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.914
The slope is still
very much steady,

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:08.830
and we see a steady
increase in the way people

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.270
are consuming games.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.160
And it's really encouraging
to see creators also adopt

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.900
mobile-first
strategies in the way

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.840
that their channel
DNA is composed.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.120
So, Ash, to you.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.040
So I was kind of
doing some digging.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.810
TIMOTHY EVANS: Uh-oh.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.830
LESTER CHEN: And I think
September 2, almost three

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.520
years ago, was the first time
that you really took a stab

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.170
at uploading YouTube content.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.095
Can you tell me a
little bit about what

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:39.220
was going through your head
when you were thinking,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.009
what is the first video before
hitting the Publish button?

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.050
TIMOTHY EVANS: Sure, yes.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.190
So I had absolutely
no experience

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.440
in a, mobile gaming, or
b, in YouTube, certainly.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.080
So I lacked the
technical expertise along

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.180
with just the
networking that you

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.010
would think one
should have if they

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.684
want to endeavor to establish
a really good YouTube channel.

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:03.100
So I didn't have any of that,
and I had really bad quality

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.880
to boot.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.750
And I just uploaded a
few videos just for my--

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.950
it was for Clash of
Clans at the time,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.090
and it was just for my guild,
my clan inside the game just

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.005
to cover special events
that we were hosting.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.380
And now three years later,
I'm here on the stage with you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.830
somehow.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.663
I don't know how the
heck it happened, but--

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:21.550
LESTER CHEN: So
obviously, like you said,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.680
your content started off--

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.810
I'll be a dick here
and say it was rough.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.690
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah,
to say the least.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.940
LESTER CHEN: I was watching
it, and it was pretty bad.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.335
And now--

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:35.710
TIMOTHY EVANS:
What a great host.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.300
LESTER CHEN: Now, you have
a very beautiful intro.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.150
And clearly, I
think directionally,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.290
things have changed.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.410
But can you tell me what
has necessarily changed,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.355
both within the game?

00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.300
What's giving you
more encouragement

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.304
to continue uploading?

00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:52.470
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah, so I
think you were being kind.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.720
It was absolutely awful.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.910
You can see I didn't even
utilize the full landscape

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.720
mode.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.220
But I think that when
I started, I just

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.780
wanted to do it purely
as a small little hobby.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.250
I didn't even think it was
possible for someone like me.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.170
When I started my YouTube
channel, I was 32.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.490
I was playing with
16-year-olds-- kind of creepy,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.110
I know.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.370
But I didn't think that I had
that infectious personality

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.860
that could certainly
take off, so I just had--

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.570
I set really, really
minimal goals for myself,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.130
just learning one
new thing a week

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.020
and trying to apply
it to my channel,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.964
as I like to tackle
bigger things in life.

00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:32.380
No matter what
you're doing is try

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.040
to continue to get better at it.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.570
So that led to not even
close to where I see myself

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.950
right now as the final product.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.050
So I'm still kind of
continuing on those trends,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.647
but, yeah, just one
thing at a time.

00:04:45.647 --> 00:04:47.230
LESTER CHEN: And
you're up to-- what--

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.260
like 500,000 subscribers?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.593
TIMOTHY EVANS: We're closing in.

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:50.911
We're closing in, but yeah.

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:51.410
Yeah.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.990
So certainly not the
biggest in the ecosystem,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.720
but just to inject a
little bit of pride,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.360
I've managed to do
it sticking to myself

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.830
and not being
someone who I'm not,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.040
and covering more
strategic elements of games

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.962
rather than being
a big personality.

00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:12.930
LESTER CHEN: So in your opinion,
there's obviously tons of--

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.170
it's very subjective.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.260
Really, what makes good content,
and what did you find really?

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.150
Did you stick to--
and I guess is

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.620
this the game subject matter?

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.410
Was this a certain format?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.590
What do you really define
as good content and content

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.600
that your audience
really not only watched

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.625
for the first time,
but continued watching?

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.250
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah,
so it's definitely

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.034
different for every individual,
and every content creator,

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.700
and every developer
what kind of content

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.560
you're looking for your game.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.390
But for me, I've
always just strived

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.430
to make content that
I would want to watch.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.872
Really basic and
cliche, but I just

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:47.080
think it takes a lot of grit
when you're starting out

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.330
in YouTube just as you're
starting out as a game

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.359
developer where you're
not going to experience--

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.400
as much as people like to
believe their channel's

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.170
going to blow up one
day and they're just

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.880
going to be a millionaire, it
just doesn't work like that.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.940
You have to get through
that first year,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.720
or even more sometimes, of
seeing stagnant, if any,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.630
growth.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.050
So what I think makes
good content is being

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.710
true to yourself,
and, at the same time,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.850
not being afraid to be
transparent, and also

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.540
be honest.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.365
So I've always built
my channel around--

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:20.740
even if I have
good relationships

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.270
with all the developers
that I work with,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.640
I think that I'm honest.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.100
And I really love opinion
pieces, if you will.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.970
So I just think making your
content worth watching,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.960
no matter what that
vehicle is to get it there,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.820
is really important.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.130
How do you differentiate
yourself from everybody

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.610
out there making content
on the same games?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.340
So I think being a little bit
m but staying true to yourself,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.592
working within your
personality, to make content.

00:06:48.592 --> 00:06:50.050
LESTER CHEN:
Something I've noticed

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.990
is some of these
top grossing games

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.950
oftentimes don't have any
or very low viewership

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.970
on the YouTube platform.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.940
Do you have any kind of
intuition or hypothesis

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.600
around that?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.380
Games that a ton of people
play, and spend, and clearly

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.990
come back after the first
try, but they really

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.880
aren't watching any
kind of content.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.670
What are some things you
really think lead to that

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.545
or some of the problems there?

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:17.320
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah, so the
developers that I work with

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.940
have really valued community
almost to its detriment

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.580
at some times, but it
pays off in the long term.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.490
Some developers are
lucky enough to have

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.640
billions of marketing
dollars, if not hundreds

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.080
of millions or millions.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.169
And those type of
games, in my opinion,

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.710
no matter what they
do, they're going

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.570
to succeed because they're
throwing so much money.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.400
Like Mobile Strike--
no offense if Mobile

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.750
Strike's developer's here--

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.947
but if you throw
millions and millions

00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:44.530
and millions of
dollars into the game,

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.238
of course you're going
to generate users,

00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:49.510
thus rank high on
the app store, thus

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.710
continue to get that momentum.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.510
But I think that what a
lot of developers miss

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.930
is how to use content
creators strategically

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.819
to grow that ecosystem
around their game.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:04.110
And I think they do it in
the wrong way a lot of times.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.530
I'm sure we'll talk
more about in a bit.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.530
LESTER CHEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.730
Well, you talked briefly
on the detriment sometimes

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.570
of growing community.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.600
I have to guess negative
feedback and kids

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.060
on Facebook saying, yeah.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.850
TIMOTHY EVANS: Which can
be good though, yeah.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.630
Yeah, so the games
I cover, I mean,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.421
they can't put out a
tweet about their game

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:20.500
without getting the top
tweets, your game sucks.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.470
It's dying, whatever.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.470
But that's a good thing
because people are still

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.460
passionate about it.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.110
It's better than sending
out a tweet about your game

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.568
and getting absolutely
no response.

00:08:27.568 --> 00:08:28.780
LESTER CHEN: Right.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.420
So I want to touch on the
nuances right of capturing

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.559
mobile content.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.839
I come from the
PC console world,

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.880
so I think the path was
a little bit clearer when

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.549
certain hardware like
capture cards were released,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.750
and encoding
software, and the way

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.900
to just to record both like
VOD content and live streams,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.350
it was a lot more
commonly known.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.359
But when it comes to mobile
content and how you capture it,

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.150
can you talk a little
bit about your set-up

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.316
and maybe some of the nuances
of how you can capture

00:08:54.316 --> 00:08:57.340
from a device or from
your tablet or phone,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.147
and how you actually
eventually get

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.480
the video content that you're
recording to your computer

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.260
and up on YouTube?

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.093
TIMOTHY EVANS: Sure.

00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:06.760
I think this is a hurdle that's
becoming easier and easier

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.310
to clear with technology
moving in the direction

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.200
where you can easily
record your device.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.870
However, I think it's really
paramount for developers

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:19.090
to work with content creators to
help increase their production

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.780
value.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.360
And you can record right
from your screen now

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.970
with a lot of different apps,
a lot of mirror-type apps.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.630
Me, personally, I use a
hardware called Delgado,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.227
where you can just use a
lightning cable or HDMI cable

00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:32.560
and just hook right up directly.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.440
So there's a lot of ways to
do it, even with emulators.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.980
But it's up to basically try
to find the highest quality

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.200
way that you can possibly
a, understand, and b,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.784
afford to use.

00:09:41.784 --> 00:09:44.366
LESTER CHEN: Well, I think it's
ironic because a lot of people

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:46.790
are consuming the mobile
game content on their phones.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.220
But the broadcasters,
you're still

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.839
pretty much wired to a very
static kind of set-up, right?

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:53.005
TIMOTHY EVANS: Indeed, yeah.

00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:56.080
LESTER CHEN: Until Wi-Fi
capabilities and some things

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.870
might be able to shift, or
storage space even on a phone,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.627
you're still kind of locked
to a very static set-up.

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:03.460
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.170
Yeah, it's true.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.690
And I think that
hopefully, we'll kind of

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.856
move in the right direction.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.100
But yeah, that's kind of
where it is right now.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.420
LESTER CHEN: So let's
talk about ways developers

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.090
have embraced YouTubers,
like going left to right.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.670
Someone like the largest
YouTube creator PewDiePie

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.850
had worked with a developer
in order to make his own game.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.830
I think Supercell does quite
a good job using their talent

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.870
as beacons to both announce game
mode launches, or new cards,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.150
or anything else
going on, and then

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.000
Best Fiend's model, where
YouTubers and influencers are

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.220
actually built into the games.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.450
In your experience,
what have you seen,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.400
or what are your best
practices or ways

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.970
that developers have
used both you and some

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.420
of the community in the space?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.715
And what is good,
and what is bad?

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:54.680
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah, so I
started out back in 2015

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.220
when I got into the
NDA club for Supercell.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.860
And at that time, there
was only 11 people.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.050
I was the 11th.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.560
We're in a small
little Skype group

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.906
with not a lot of organization.

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:06.530
I mean, they did a
good job, obviously.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.613
They were one of the first
major mobile developers

00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:10.340
to embrace YouTubers.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.310
But at that point, now in
just three short years,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.850
we've grown to over 200
people, content creators,

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.760
and it's run in a lot
of different ways.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.190
But with the big
companies that already

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.830
have that ecosystem of content
creators, it's really easy.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.736
So we have those relationships.

00:11:27.736 --> 00:11:29.360
They say, hey, a new
game's coming out,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.276
and boom, we're there.

00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:31.370
That's it.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.860
But two pillars of
Supercell has always

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.170
been even before they blew up
with Hay Day and Clash of Clans

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.060
in 2014 and '15, they've
never paid anybody

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.120
to cover their games,
a, and they've never

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:49.230
given in-game resources, which
are two really strong values

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.730
to have.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.680
And I think that it's
really easy to say that

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.610
and really hard to execute on a
community or a content creator

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.487
strategy without using
those two resources.

00:11:57.487 --> 00:11:59.570
But they've always had
that mentality that we just

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.236
want people to
organically play our game

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:04.530
or cover our game without having
to give them stuff to do it.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.220
So instead of
that, they've tried

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.060
to create ways to grow
influencers' channels who they

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.670
work with as the
carrot, and then they'll

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.290
want to cover the game because
they'll get so many views.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.350
So I think that the
best ways to try

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.920
to build your own community
of content creators

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.850
if you're a developer,
in my opinion,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.820
just from seeing so
many companies pay

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.230
so much money to my
colleagues and me, the offers

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:36.540
that we get for one video can
triple our monthly YouTube

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.350
income.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.350
So I don't think that that's
money necessarily well spent,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.170
although it might acquire
more users as advertising

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.460
on Facebook, say.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.250
But I do think that's the
best strategy in my opinion--

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.890
and I've consulted with other
developers who've done this--

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:55.740
is to pick small to mid-tier
YouTubers who you're

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.207
a real big fan of
their production,

00:12:58.207 --> 00:12:59.790
you feel like they
jive well with what

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.460
you're trying to
portray to the public,

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.210
and try to help them grow.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.810
And the biggest
incentive for me,

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.520
especially when I was
a smaller YouTuber,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.810
is to share their content
in game, especially

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.310
revolving around updates.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.290
Because what that does
is it sends your traffic

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.470
from the game to the content
creator's YouTube channel,

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.930
and that incentivizes
us to continue

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.160
to cover the game beyond just
that one sponsored video.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760
So I think that moving a
step further than that,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.750
having live events.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.880
I've gone to travel the
world, been lucky enough.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.500
And like I said, it's surreal
to me because I'm a 35-year-old.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.690
I was a mail carrier
for 13 years,

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.430
and just not much
going on in terms of--

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.245
LESTER CHEN: Don't
discredit mail carriers.

00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:47.578
TIMOTHY EVANS: You already
dissed my production quality.

00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:50.010
I might as well just drive
myself into the ground.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.060
But seriously, ultimately,
it's just the fact

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.190
that there's a big
thirst, I think,

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.570
for content creators
and community.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.540
And I think that neither
the content creators,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.270
nor the third parties who work
with the developers and content

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.070
creators, or the
developers really

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.636
utilize it in a great way.

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:08.010
LESTER CHEN: Would
you say, then,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.780
that the community
at some point takes

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.880
on a little bit of
a life of its own

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.010
and transcends maybe
even the updates,

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:19.530
or keeps the valleys alive while
peek updates are in the works?

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.600
TIMOTHY EVANS: Absolutely,
yeah, for sure.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.460
And I worked with a
smaller developer,

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.060
and we recruited
just two YouTubers,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.000
one with 4,000 subscribers and
one with 9,000 subscribers.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.720
And we put them into
their game, just like I

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.972
talked to you about earlier.

00:14:34.972 --> 00:14:36.930
And now, they're organically
covering the game.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.346
And that's the
best case scenario,

00:14:38.346 --> 00:14:39.870
because then you
can grow together,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.036
and then your players know
where to find information

00:14:42.036 --> 00:14:43.890
about updates, about
whatever content

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.842
that you want to
highlight, and it's

00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:47.550
a symbiotic relationship
rather than just

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.900
a transactional relationship.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.560
LESTER CHEN: Sure.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.660
So, yeah, we were joking
about this before.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.160
Again, I--

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.570
TIMOTHY EVANS: Another
flattering pic.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.620
LESTER CHEN: Could have picked
a better picture on this one.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.078
But I think it's
really interesting

00:14:58.078 --> 00:15:01.510
when talking about the
day in the life of someone

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.750
who does this as your career.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.790
Like you said, you
were delivering

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.760
mail for almost over a decade,
and then you just recently

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.890
within the past six months--

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.730
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah, like
eight months or so, yeah.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.640
LESTER CHEN: --eighth
months, transitioned

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.370
to doing content
creation full-time.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.352
What does a day in the
life of you look like?

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.060
What is a good day,
and what's a bad day?

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.760
And how can developers, and how
can the game publishers help

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.650
with making your days better?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.570
TIMOTHY EVANS: That's
a big question, Lester.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.530
I think that my life
is certainly not

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.720
anything that exciting.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.950
I go to an office.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.870
I rent an office space, and I
just work on my video early,

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.090
and get that all set.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.079
And then, of course,
leaving a government job,

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.620
albeit not the best
one in the world,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.810
but just a steady government
job for something as insecure,

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.340
or at least it
feels so insecure,

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.600
as a YouTube channel
is a big step.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.470
So what I've done
is basically put

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.970
as many eggs in different
baskets as I possibly could.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.110
So I do consulting,
and I work for a couple

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.730
of startup companies.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.430
Also, I'm a community manager
for a game coming out soon.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.430
So I think that what
I've tried to do

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.570
is just provide that conduit
from the influencers,

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.420
the developers.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.920
And I just spend most of my
time just networking, really.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.060
So as far as what a developer
can do for somebody like me is

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:31.057
I just think that we need to
have a healthier relationship,

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.390
developers and content creators,
because I think that we

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.710
both have a lot to offer.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.430
But for some reason, like
I said before, there's just

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.477
that missing link somewhere.

00:16:40.477 --> 00:16:42.560
Right now, I don't think
the current system really

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.642
works for anybody.

00:16:43.642 --> 00:16:44.600
LESTER CHEN: Be honest.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.240
How long do you spend responding
to comments on your YouTube

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.446
channel?

00:16:48.446 --> 00:16:49.820
TIMOTHY EVANS: An
hour, actually.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.070
I spend an hour a
day, which is probably

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.920
59 minutes more than
anybody else does

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.560
because it takes a lot of time.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.600
This is apropos of
nothing, I guess,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.099
but I find that to get
good YouTube engagement,

00:17:03.099 --> 00:17:04.640
if you train your
viewers that you're

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.980
going to respond in the first
half an hour, hour, hour

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.839
and a half, however
long that is,

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.130
it creates a real huge spike in
community around your channel.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.345
So I think that that's
really key to my growth

00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:18.841
strategy in YouTube.

00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:22.079
LESTER CHEN: So we've touched
on this in many different ways.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.119
But when I was looking
at the landscape of some

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.750
of these games that even the
past two years have exploded,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.790
and I look at the volume
of games, and then

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.666
I also look at the volume
of YouTube channels

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:32.623
that have sprouted up--

00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:34.680
I think I was pulling
some stats before this.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.440
I think currently, there's
around 39 or 40 YouTube

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.200
channels this year that
breached the 1 million

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.470
subscriber mark, so huge
kind of new audience,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.340
where mobile-first or mobile
gaming creators are also

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.980
attracting a mobile
viewing-first audience.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.790
Is there like a prescriptive
recipe for success?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.590
I think you maybe
touched on it when

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.631
talking about going for
the middle-tier channels.

00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:04.650
But do you see any kind of
pattern that tends to work more

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.690
frequently than ones that don't?

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.620
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.745
Like you said, I touched
on like some of the things

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:13.050
that I feel passionately about.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.650
I do feel like just
paying for videos is just

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.330
not a good strategy.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.850
I mean, Pokemon Go,
Vainglory, Supercell Games,

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.765
a small minority of
companies who don't do that.

00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.140
I'm sure there's
a lot of others.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.450
But I just don't think
it's a great strategy.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.940
I think that having live
events and developing community

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.480
like that, and maybe paying for
somebody to make an appearance

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.830
is OK.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.080
And then there's other
ways to do things as well.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.642
Like, if you reach out
to a content creator,

00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:44.100
they might not even
know your game.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.360
So how are you going to
get them to the point

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.693
where you want to show off
your game without giving them

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:49.410
at least in-game resources?

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.340
But some strategies that some
companies that I've worked with

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.950
have used is just giving
them stock footage,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.750
and then allowing
them to maybe play

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.300
the game on an account
that's progressed

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.720
a little bit further, but not
giving them that as a resource.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.852
Because I think valuing your
own game's in-game economy

00:19:06.852 --> 00:19:09.060
to the fact that you just
won't give it out to people

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.950
that promote you is important.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.200
But, of course, that's
probably an unpopular opinion

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.900
because it's what
everybody does right now.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.830
That's what all my
emails are filled with.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.810
So I do think that
the missing link here

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.630
is that you want people to
cover your game organically,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.820
but they won't do that
unless they get the views.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.970
So how do you--

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.370
LESTER CHEN: Reconcile that.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.592
TIMOTHY EVANS: --remedy that?

00:19:30.592 --> 00:19:32.550
LESTER CHEN: It's an
interesting kind of thing.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.020
Because I noticed especially,
too, the amount of news

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.110
generated I think between
the large updates on games

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.020
is often like, what do you
do when there's not enough

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.970
content to be created around?

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.827
I think they touched
on it before.

00:19:47.827 --> 00:19:49.410
It's like you want
to launch your game

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.890
with a lot of content.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.160
But then when you also think
about the long-term cycle

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.070
of the game, what happens to you
as a creator when there isn't--

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.450
like, how long would
you say that threshold

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.040
is before you start
being like, man, I've

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.720
got to move on to a new
game, or there's not

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.010
enough content to be made here?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:02.160
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.070
It's tough from our perspective
just as a developer perspective

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.090
is just that you can
only do a video daily.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.040
I have almost 1,300 videos.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.500
But you can only do videos
daily on the game doing

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.810
the same thing for so
long unless you really

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.660
have a unique set of
something that you're

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.010
bringing to the table.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.135
So I have my own kind of
flavor, but you're right.

00:20:23.135 --> 00:20:24.760
We're always looking
for that next game

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.040
that's going to take off.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.740
And the problem is that
boxes out all the small games

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.170
that are worth looking into.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.661
So I don't know the perfect
solution other than--

00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:35.410
LESTER CHEN: It's
almost like flip-flopped

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.784
where you said maybe some of
the developers or publishers

00:20:37.784 --> 00:20:39.715
should look at the
middle-tier creators.

00:20:39.715 --> 00:20:40.350
TIMOTHY EVANS: I think so.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.250
LESTER CHEN: It's
almost like you

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.100
might be able to find a niche
by looking at some of the--

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.590
TIMOTHY EVANS: I think so.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.660
I think that if I was
going to develop a game

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.410
and I want to create a great
strategy for getting content

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.260
creators on board, I
would try to reach out

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.240
to someone who has a
little bit of influence

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.000
inside the ecosystem, and
then have them almost recruit

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
other content creators who
are smaller to bring on board.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.500
That's my favorite strategy
of growing a community.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.947
Or even taking
someone who's maybe

00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:07.530
an influencer in
your game-- maybe you

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.600
don't have content creators
who cover your game,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.330
but you have forums
of passionate players.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.260
Maybe just mentoring and paying,
hey, we'll buy you whatever,

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.920
a PC if it takes it.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.545
We'll buy you an Elgato
to a smaller scale,

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.170
and we'll share your
content, and we'll

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.640
help you grow together.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.010
I think that's a
great strategy to use.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.280
And it doesn't pay those
immediate dividends

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.680
like a paid promotion does--

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.470
and maybe there is a time and
a place for a paid promotion.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.160
But I just don't think it's
a good community-building

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.676
strategy, just Instant
downloads, you know?

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.430
LESTER CHEN: So moving on,
I think a big question--

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.090
this is a loaded slide--
but what is in your eyes

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.410
the future of mobile gaming?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.570
When I look at each
of these, I think

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.970
of a new super-massive game
IP that could horizon and have

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.260
huge implications in the West.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.744
I think Supercell, obviously,
has Brawl Stars coming out.

00:22:01.744 --> 00:22:04.410
That could be interesting as far
as the size of the company it's

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.556
coming from.

00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:09.140
Again, there's an
e-sports aspect

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.820
to consider as far as
extending a mobile game's

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.100
IP with something like
the Crown Championship.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.980
And then lastly, just talking
with devices and hardware.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:23.430
Like, phones that have
better built-in both cameras,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.975
and hardware, and
usability, and screen size,

00:22:25.975 --> 00:22:26.850
and all these things.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.910
And you can jump into
any one of these.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.077
Where do you really see
some of these futures going?

00:22:32.077 --> 00:22:32.910
TIMOTHY EVANS: Geez.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.740
Like you said, it is
a big, big question.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.290
But me personally, I think
that a lot of the global market

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.020
has been devalued based
on the advertising dollars

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.980
or of various other factors.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.260
But I think that might be
a mistake, just from a--

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.870
I've never seen a more
passionate base of players

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.330
than I've seen in, say,
Brazil, the Portuguese,

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.450
Spanish-speaking
communities, or India.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.960
I think that that's an untapped
audience, to some extent.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.920
And even in countries
less fortunate,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.020
everybody still has a mobile
device, or a lot of people do.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.190
So I think that there's
millions of players who can be--

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.890
basically, there's
a big appetite

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.870
for these games
in those markets,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.370
but people just
don't market to them

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.469
because that's not what
advertisers want, oftentimes.

00:23:20.469 --> 00:23:22.260
So I think that the
future of mobile gaming

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.300
is definitely global.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.720
And I think that capturing
that global market

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.320
should be a priority,
at least in my mind.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.060
I can tell you that covering
Clash Royale and Supercell

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.560
games as I do, there's
no more rabid fan base,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.640
there's no more faster
growing fan base

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.850
than those Spanish-speaking
and Portuguese-speaking

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.230
communities, even Germany
to a lesser extent,

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.110
and India, Malaysia,
Philippines.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.280
These are all markets
that the appetite is

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.810
so huge for these mobile games.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:56.550
So I think that
just capitalizing

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.340
on the global scale and
not devaluing it too much

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.160
just because of advertising.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.320
And the bottom line, I think
that that could be a mistake.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.120
I think that the
future is global.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.622
These games all have
such huge potential.

00:24:11.622 --> 00:24:13.080
Arena of Valor with
Strike of Kings

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.810
in China, which is the number
one game last two years,

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.160
incredible.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.102
The government
instituted laws where

00:24:20.102 --> 00:24:21.810
it's limiting the
amount of play that you

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.079
could have on a mobile
game, which is crazy.

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:25.870
So that's been rebranded
to Arena of Valor,

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.320
and it's launching in November.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.070
CCGS, which is the Clash
Royale Global Championship,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.220
proves that mobile
can be an e-sport.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.290
And we'll see just how
far they can take that,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.210
but it is a $1 million
contest in London next month.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.410
So it's playing a mobile
game, which is something

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.410
we've never seen before.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:46.690
LESTER CHEN: Yeah.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.565
I know we were discussing
this at lunch, kind

00:24:48.565 --> 00:24:52.200
of like a revenue-first
model between developers

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.620
having a lot of hooks in
order to incentivize purchase

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.350
and whatnot, and how that also
fits in the same conversation

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.694
of fair competitive
play, like making sure

00:25:00.694 --> 00:25:02.610
that there's an equal
playing field, that it's

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:09.200
embracing the every man or
woman to play competitively.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.950
Do you have any opinions
about that or how

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.920
you see the balance between
revenue-driving games

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.420
versus purely competitive games?

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.600
Because I think it's
hard to really breach

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.955
the gap of e-sports without
really addressing that.

00:25:20.955 --> 00:25:23.477
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah.

00:25:23.477 --> 00:25:25.560
People way smarter than
me have spent so much time

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.440
thinking about this.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.720
And I think that, at least
from Supercell's vantage point,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.050
again, who I work with closely,
and Tencent as well, it's

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.850
making sure that you value
the casual gamer as paramount

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.220
to your success, and
at the same time,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.510
building that infrastructure
for competitive gaming

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.450
as an afterthought
at this point.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.270
I wish it was more than that,
but that's just what I've seen.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.852
And maybe Vainglory
being the one exception

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.560
right now in mobile
gaming, which they're

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.460
really full-throttle onto
the competitive scene,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.200
not so much on the casual scene.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.080
But then I think that
ultimately, there's

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.000
a reason they're not
quite as successful

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.290
as the other big games because
they've honed in so closely

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:10.810
on those.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.120
LESTER CHEN: Sure.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.430
So this is kind of
geared towards you

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.060
just because the
start of your channel

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.020
has been on Clash of Clans.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.460
You've evolved in the past few
years towards Clash Royale.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.830
And you can take it
a few different ways,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.800
like, as far as community
building, not just

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.900
gameplay mechanics,
releases, or anything else

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.990
like that, who do you really
think as far as philosophy goes

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.817
can really step up to the plate?

00:26:35.817 --> 00:26:36.650
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.270
So without naming any
certain developers,

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.920
I think that creating
that community

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.670
is definitely so, so important.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:47.760
I think that like we've talked
about for this whole discussion

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.530
is to not at least try to
get content creators on board

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.630
with your game.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.170
They'll patch up
some of those holes

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.760
that we talked about
between updates,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.490
between major features that
are being added to the game.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.800
They'll help you, and
they'll create a community

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.940
around your game.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.023
And having people talk
about your game is awesome.

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:08.160
So I think that the
next company that can--

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.610
it's a multi-pronged,
I guess, answer,

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.360
but developing community,
working with content creators,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.510
and making an awesome game.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.718
I mean, obviously, the game
has to be good for people

00:27:18.718 --> 00:27:20.340
to ultimately want to play it.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.555
And I think everybody as a
content creator, everybody's

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:27.180
always on the lookout for who's
going to be the next Supercell,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.230
or who's going to be the
next big developer to give us

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.310
viability because we're
looking for long-term viability

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.370
as a content creator just
as developers are, too.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.137
So what is the life
of a game right now?

00:27:40.137 --> 00:27:42.720
It's something that no one even
knows exactly the answer, what

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.034
is the life of a mobile game?

00:27:44.034 --> 00:27:46.200
Clash of Clans has been
going strong for five years,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.180
but is that an aberration,
or is that the norm?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.720
It's difficult. And I know I've
really dodged the question,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.280
but I don't know who's going
to be the next Supercell.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.977
I think that, hopefully,
given platforms like YouTube,

00:28:00.977 --> 00:28:02.560
given platforms like
Twitch, and stuff

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.360
like that, that developers
can somehow work better

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.860
with content creators
moving forward

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.504
to make multiple Supercells
instead of just one or two.

00:28:12.504 --> 00:28:14.920
Who do you think's going to
be the next Supercell, Lester?

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.430
LESTER CHEN: That's
what I'm asking.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.960
I'm like, don't
turn it back on me.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.740
Yeah, well, I
appreciate that thought.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.200
And I think from a content
creation standpoint,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.830
it clearly relies
on replayability,

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:35.620
the ability to seed content so
that there's always freshness.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.380
And I think it's a lot
about developing things

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.450
outside of just like the
standard out of the box

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.580
gameplay.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.580
How can you evolve that?

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.850
What are some institutionalized
ways of thinking of game modes

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.740
that can be completely reversed?

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.225
I think different modes,
and using derivative IP,

00:28:50.225 --> 00:28:51.850
and figuring out
different ways to play

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:56.470
with that, I've noticed, give
content creators a lot more

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.160
to bite on.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.180
And also modes which lead
towards unreachable goals

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.560
or really hard goals.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.140
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yes,
that's a good one.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.550
That's a good one.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.341
LESTER CHEN: Right?

00:29:04.341 --> 00:29:06.730
I think that no one
thought that anyone

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.880
would get to X top leader board,
or X wins, or to some status.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.320
And I think building in
mechanics which the person will

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.679
play every single day and
also record every single day,

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:19.720
because I think you want
to get an audience who's

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.210
inherited in your journey
of doing something.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.850
And I think that with you
YouTube creators or even

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.960
streamers, having a goal is--
like you coming full circle,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.900
that was like, what do you want
to do at the end of the series?

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.750
Are you doing a series
on competitive play?

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.760
Are you doing a series on tips?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.401
Are you doing a series
on anything else?

00:29:39.401 --> 00:29:40.150
What is the start?

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.066
And what's the finish?

00:29:41.066 --> 00:29:42.970
I think for developers
I've personally

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.120
noticed that setting these
goals, like unreachable goals

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.579
also within games help for that.

00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:49.120
TIMOTHY EVANS: Yeah,
I think that you

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.170
hit the nail on the head.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.140
Coming from a bit of an
MMO PC background side,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.540
I love the grind.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.820
And even if people say
they don't love the grind,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.300
I think that deep down, they do.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.050
It makes the game
sticky, and it makes you

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.410
want to stay around to compete.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.340
LESTER CHEN: Yeah.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.330
Well, I think we're
out of time here.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.460
I'm going to kick it
over to Dan Atkins.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.440
He's over at the
Daydream team, so he'll

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.541
talk a little bit about building
VR experiences within apps

00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:15.040
and games.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.731
TIMOTHY EVANS: Cool.

00:30:16.731 --> 00:30:17.355
Thanks, Lester.

00:30:17.355 --> 00:30:18.310
LESTER CHEN: Thanks, Ash.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.610
TIMOTHY EVANS: OK.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.210
Thanks, man.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.060
[APPLAUSE]
