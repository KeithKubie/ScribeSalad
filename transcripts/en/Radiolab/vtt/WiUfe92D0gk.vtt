00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.080
You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.680
from w n y.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.620
S. E. N. G. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.090
This is radiolab, the podcast and uh, we've just finished are in the dark tour,

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.660
which is the thing we've been, you know, yammering on about for the last year.

6
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:24.950
Yeah. And we want it to play for you in this podcast.

7
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.350
One of our favorite stories from that show.

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.250
Now this was designed for the eye as well as the ear,

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.240
this particular performance. So you will not see the Pilobolus dance theater,

10
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:39.600
which means you will not see, oh man.

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.930
Pretty amazing stuff happening on that stage. Yeah.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.280
Strangely beautiful shadow plays on huge white canvas.

13
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:47.870
I mean gigantic state.

14
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:51.080
You could go to the website and you can see pictures@radiolab.org yeah,

15
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.560
these guys are really, they're magicians. They do. Yeah, they really are.

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.150
We should also note that this story was scored live by the amazing Talwin with

17
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.380
Jason. Slow to on the drums.

18
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:05.381
Jamie Ryota on the base and it was recorded massively at UCLA is Royce Hall by

19
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.380
Reverend John Delore. So here it is. So for our final segment,

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.780
we were thinking through this show,

21
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.930
we thought you knew who would have a really interesting perspective on darkness.

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
I'm going to be somebody who works in, in a, in a rich dark environment.

23
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.030
Astronauts for example. Yeah. So we called up, uh, NASA,

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.320
we talked to an astronaut.

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
We connected our little studio in New York to their studio DC to talk to an

26
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.380
astronaut. But he was a little late. And here's the funny thing,

27
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.580
when you are on hold with NASA, this is literally what you hear.

28
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.960
<v 1>[inaudible] sends a blast off feel to yeah.</v>

29
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.370
[inaudible] this is amazing.

30
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.030
<v 0>This by the way, is literally the case.</v>

31
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.960
You dial one 800 Nash or whatever and they, this is like go to the moon music.

32
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.430
<v 1>Okay. Hello?</v>

33
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.830
<v 0>Hello? Hello?</v>

34
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.860
I hear someone breathing mean humor. Yeah, it's probably I'm breathing.

35
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.320
That's the interesting way to meet. So this is our guy. Uh,

36
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.760
Dave Wolf is his name. He's a NASA astronaut.

37
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.710
Have been since 1990 over 20 years. He wasn't really sure why we had called him.

38
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.980
What, what's our topic here? So we explained to him that, you know,

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.770
we're doing this show called in the dark. Uh,

40
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.790
we're going to do it on stage in front of some very nice folks. Uh,

41
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.790
do you have any stories that relate in right off the bat? He says,

42
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.510
you've triggered an interesting darkness story. I have. Well,

43
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.050
that's why we calling you up. Yeah. Okay. You're,

44
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.310
you're taping and you're ready. Yep.

45
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.370
Darkness is an interesting theme in space because there's nowhere where the

46
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.930
contrast between light and dark is any more extreme.

47
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.890
Dave has done dozens of spacewalks and he says there have been times when he's

48
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.450
just sort of out there floating in space next to the craft and maybe the a,

49
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.830
the ship tilts a little bit and the wing blocks light that's coming from the sun

50
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:10.540
or the moon and it creates a shadow and he says the darkness of that shadow is

51
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.950
black or that any black you thought it could be out there in space,

52
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.780
the shadow has no light in it. There's not reflected light from dust in the air.

53
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.290
The earth around you are clouds. It's just pure,

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.850
absolute dark.

55
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.860
And you can reach into a shadow, so deep,

56
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.180
so black that your arm can appear to disappear.

57
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.470
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.390
<v 0>wow. Right in front of your face.</v>

59
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.060
Your head is in the bright light and your arm is in his depths of darkness and

60
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.300
she's gone. Like it's been cut off. Yeah.

61
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.833
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

62
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.640
<v 0>but I do want to tell you a, um,</v>

63
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.760
an experience I had in my first space walk late 97 I had this experience.

64
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.940
Okay. It was from a Russian spacecraft.

65
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.800
You might remember the mirror. Yeah, sure. Space. Craft.

66
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.640
So Dave is up there.

67
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:11.710
He was with two Russian cosmonauts and he and Anatoly Solovyev,

68
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.030
they were suited up and getting ready to make their first walk into space or his

69
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:17.600
first walk.

70
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.070
And we did all the preparations to get the suits ready and we're in the air lock

71
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.893
and

72
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.140
<v 2>door open and they floated out, we</v>

73
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.540
<v 0>clip dark tethers on outside.</v>

74
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.790
He and Anatoly gently float to the work site and it was dark out and dark up in

75
00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:45.590
space means you're on the night side of the earth in the shadow of the earth.

76
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.440
And her were no external lights on this spacecraft.

77
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.980
This was really, really dark and we were over the ocean and at night.

78
00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:57.260
That basically means you don't see the earth

79
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.410
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

80
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.850
<v 0>You don't see it at all. Not at all. When it's a a moonless night,</v>

81
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.160
you don't see the earth. In fact,

82
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:12.420
all it might look like to you is the absence of stars.

83
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.183
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

84
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 2>Now, I want you to imagine this with me.</v>

85
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.960
He's up there in this darkness in the earth with all of us on it, somewhere far,

86
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.230
far below him. You can't see it and all the while,

87
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.270
and this is really important for what happens next.

88
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:30.310
He is shooting through space.

89
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:34.480
He's rocketing across the dark shadow of the earth at five miles a second.

90
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.710
That is 16 times the speed that we're all moving right now because we are on the

91
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.710
earth. But he says at that moment he didn't feel any of that.

92
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:46.600
It just felt like he was suspended in this cocoon of black floating gently.

93
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.140
He thought, all right, no problem. This is kind of peaceful.

94
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.330
<v 0>It was just me and the spacecraft and blackness</v>

95
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.610
and suddenly

96
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.033
<v 1>this one</v>

97
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.730
<v 2>blazing blight blasts and from below, what was it?</v>

98
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.830
It was the sunrise, you know,

99
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.860
because he and the ship are moving so quickly at the sunrise,

100
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:18.260
which normally happens here on earth very, very slowly,

101
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.480
calmly at that speed up there,

102
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.900
the sun comes screaming from the eastern edge of the earth straight across the

103
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:28.700
earth, lights up, everything is seconds and the earth lights up below me.

104
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420
Suddenly I can look down 200 miles and see that we're moving at five miles per

105
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:40.110
second. Oceans whooshing clouds, deserts, Roche. He's like, man,

106
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.160
I clutched onto these handrails like there's no tomorrow white knuckled in my

107
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.011
space,

108
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:51.011
suit gloves because I suddenly had this enormous sense of height and speed.

109
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.181
He says,

110
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.570
it was sorta like if you're standing comfortably on the ground and then some,

111
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.660
someone just flips on the lights suddenly and you realize,

112
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.560
actually I'm not on the ground. I am on a 400,000 foot ladder.

113
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.910
Crazy. You're still in that sunrise moment.

114
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.940
The temperature all also increases by upwards of 400 degrees in the moment.

115
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.600
In the moment. Really this is the most extreme thing I've ever heard.

116
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.080
Are you air conditioned or, or whatever you, you are.

117
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.620
We are totally dependent on that space suit.

118
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.910
<v 1>But the colors,</v>

119
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.230
<v 2>what you're seeing on that earth is so spectacular.</v>

120
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.560
The Greens and Blues and the delicate pastel light colors and the contrast and

121
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:44.380
the brights are just, uh, are present in a,

122
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.020
in anything I've ever seen other than up in space.

123
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.480
Dave and his Russian buddy and a totally,

124
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.810
they're out there for hours doing repairs on the ships. So they are

125
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.000
<v 3>cause of their speed.</v>

126
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.060
They're going in and out and in and out of these days and nights.

127
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.840
<v 2>So it's 90 minutes of a light, dark cycle.</v>

128
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.440
So you have 16 nights in 16 days for every Earth Day,

129
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 3>which means as they're working,</v>

130
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.830
this change is happening over and over and over every 45 minutes they go from

131
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:13.664
blazing light,

132
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.780
<v 1>two</v>

133
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.090
<v 3>quiet, dark blazing, light,</v>

134
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.623
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

135
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.090
<v 2>darkness. You can get lost.</v>

136
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:32.100
You get stories of people doing space walks that lose their orientation or feel

137
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:34.210
like they're falling.

138
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.830
<v 3>So he says the only thing to do in that circumstance is just to focus on your</v>

139
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:42.510
job. Look straight ahead. Only at this group. Only

140
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.110
<v 2>that this group don't look down and just kind of, Eh, it's,</v>

141
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.730
it's real in this business.

142
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.563
<v 3>Okay.</v>

143
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 1>So we would in perfectly happy to</v>

144
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.850
<v 0>end the story right here cause Dave and Anatoly finished their repairs.</v>

145
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.160
Job Well done. They get ready to come back into the spacecraft.

146
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.270
But we cannot not tell you what happens next. This,

147
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.910
this first with a very different kind of darkness. Yeah.

148
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.480
So the two of them pull themselves by their tethers to come back into the air

149
00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:17.910
lock to go back in. But when it was time to come back in,

150
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.420
they couldn't get back in. You were locked out of your spaceship,

151
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.320
you could call it locked out. We were trapped outside. Yes.

152
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.950
Essentially their air lock was busted that they couldn't repressurize it.

153
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.830
And if he can't get it at the right pressure, you can't reenter them. No.

154
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.920
And we worked on it for four or five hours and ran out our resources and ran out

155
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:41.670
of oxygen or what, we have plenty of oxygen.

156
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:46.671
It turns out that what you run out of first is your carbon dioxide scrubbing a

157
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.180
unit that takes the co two out of your suit.

158
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.510
And now the problem with this one is usually in a space accident you figure it

159
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.590
only hurt for a moment,

160
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.780
but when you die of CO2 intoxication,

161
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.950
that drags out. That's not had that. So I have some miserable way to go.

162
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.710
What does, what does he mean? Did you ever play that up?

163
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.660
What happens is first you get a headache

164
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.280
<v 2>and then your muscles start to twitch.</v>

165
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.770
Eventually your heartbeat starts to accelerate faster, faster, faster.

166
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:25.160
You go into convulsions and then you die.

167
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.320
<v 0>Luckily the life support system has an extra cartridge that gave us an extra six</v>

168
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:40.740
or so hours. We used all that and uh,

169
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.020
trying to fix the hatch and we couldn't get it to hold air and,

170
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.810
uh, we were done. Did you know you are done? I mean you, yeah, yeah,

171
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:55.370
pretty much. And Annie had done like in over,

172
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.470
yeah. Yeah. No more ideas

173
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.740
done like in dead.

174
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.670
<v 2>So they decided, okay, we've got to do something. Last ditch maneuver.</v>

175
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:12.300
If we can't get our usual airlock to work, maybe we can make a new one.

176
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.430
Because see on the Mir space station,

177
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:18.870
it's this big cylinder with these rectangular modules that jut out and one of

178
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:21.570
those modules is the airlock. But there are these adjacent ones,

179
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.240
which are normally just living quarters. They thought,

180
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:27.450
well if we can't get our usual airlock to pressurize the right, you know,

181
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.400
pressure, maybe we can go to the next one over and try and pressurize it.

182
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.370
<v 0>Essentially treating that next module and as a air lock.</v>

183
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.320
And we open the hatch into that next module.

184
00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.420
And in order to though to go into it,

185
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.250
we had to disconnect our umbilicals cause you can't close the hatch over your

186
00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:49.170
umbilical. Right.

187
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.720
I mean umbilical was providing our cooling to our suits.

188
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.260
So as soon as we disconnected, well that gives you maybe five,

189
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:02.680
eight minutes at Max before you, before you what?

190
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.460
I don't even want talk about it. It's so bad. Did you, did you look down that?

191
00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.460
Yeah. Look this one up too.

192
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.850
Essentially what happens is you boil inside your space, you in a very ugly way.

193
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.530
So Dave and I totally think, okay,

194
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.760
we've got to get through this tiny hatch and into this room and they've got to

195
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.600
do it fast. But they also know if you struggle hard and go too fast,

196
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.010
you'll never get much time at all in that suit before that heat builds up on

197
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:37.110
you. So he thinks, okay, hurry, hurry. But slowly Stallone,

198
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.400
what I did not anticipate was as soon as we disconnected our umbilicals that

199
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:47.830
Pfizer would fog up and you'd now be having to feel your way of lined.

200
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.933
Yeah,

201
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.770
you could spit and kind of get a little area through the fog.

202
00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.040
So I'm in the air lock trying to make my way into the next section and I was

203
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:05.581
crawling along the wall moving into the next section and I spit on my visor,

204
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:10.600
you know, to make a little hole to look through and get a hit.

205
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.460
And it was an area I had been sleeping in some weeks before.

206
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:21.030
And I had left picture of my family taped with Scotch tape on the wall and I

207
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:26.950
spit out an adviser and I, my helmet light went there.

208
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.260
And there was this picture of my family

209
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.530
right here in this moment as I was scooting across the wall and in what was

210
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.870
likely my last minutes.

211
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.980
So this is how it's gonna end. So this is it.

212
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.550
And then look, it's so strange. There they are.

213
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.500
But I look back at that and I, her now of course,

214
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.880
Dave and his partner made it back into the space station. Barely.

215
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.560
But it didn't strike me really till months later on the earth.

216
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.570
Uh, how, how, how close Saturday Ben. And uh,

217
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.620
what a strange situation this Russian guy must be your best friend.

218
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.190
Like,

219
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:32.190
like he could probably get call each other and say it 20 years later you go,

220
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.591
well,

221
00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:38.480
not many people been through anything like that together and are there to talk

222
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:41.840
about it. And you just reminded me of something.

223
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.380
So we're going to leave you with one last story from Dave.

224
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.630
He was kind of a story machine. This is from that same stay in space,

225
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:52.130
involves same friend and a totally,

226
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.500
<v 2>they were out there doing some work on the ship, you know,</v>

227
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:55.400
floating in space again.

228
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.720
And then mission control radios in tells them to pause for a while.

229
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.750
<v 0>We had a period where we had to wait through the night to go on with our work.</v>

230
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:07.400
So he says, Look, David at [inaudible] on Russian,

231
00:15:07.401 --> 00:15:12.320
of course I wanted to show you something and we cooked our tethers on,

232
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.780
pushed ourselves about six feet away.

233
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.970
We're weighed about six feet a tether so that our eyes couldn't see anything but

234
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:23.200
out in space. And I, I,

235
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.150
I turned my air conditioner down a little, you know,

236
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:31.151
so it was kind of warm and I was floating in this spacesuit just looking out in

237
00:15:31.951 --> 00:15:35.270
the dark, the blackness of space and

238
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.843
<v 1>yeah,</v>

239
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.400
<v 2>I felt like I didn't have a space suit on. It was so comfortable.</v>

240
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.310
The air temperature was just right.

241
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.380
I felt like I was just out any universe

242
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.460
in the stars.

243
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:57.080
I couldn't see anything but stars all around me and I couldn't feel anything

244
00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.360
outside of spacecraft going five miles per second out in the universe.

245
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.280
Was that what he wanted to show you? Yeah, I think so.

246
00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:13.110
This is his rocking chair on the front porch thing that were hammock almost.

247
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.380
He didn't want to talk. He said, let's just be quiet.

248
00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:21.300
Turn your helmet light off so you don't get any reflected light. Yes.

249
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.650
Uh, uh, relax. Russ slobber violet

250
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.870
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] you relax. Relax.</v>

251
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.623
[inaudible] [inaudible]

252
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:01.930
[inaudible] [inaudible]

253
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.000
<v 2>now had you been there in the theater?</v>

254
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.710
This is the moment where we gave everybody a little pinpoint of light.

255
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.440
A little hand carried star.

256
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:17.100
They could put over their heads and wave together like 2000 tiny little lights

257
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.480
from the seats. Okay. Can it be of stars? We saw this happen again and again,

258
00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:25.420
like 18 times. I think we performed this every time.

259
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:28.660
It was just like breathtaking. Yeah.

260
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:50.763
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

261
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.760
<v 2>this whole show came together.</v>

262
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.380
Thanks to so many people onstage and off and we want to make a couple of thank

263
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.840
yous before we go. Very, very special things to make bowls.

264
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.240
Who found our astronauts. He found Dave wealth. Yeah.

265
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.720
Also to Pilobolus the dance company and to the Palabra law. Yes.

266
