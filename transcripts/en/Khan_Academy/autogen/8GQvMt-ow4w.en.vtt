00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.695
 When we observe what we call fire, 

00:00:02.695 --> 00:00:04.707
 we have a burning reaction, 

00:00:04.707 --> 00:00:08.500
 and when we see these flames, what we actually see, 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.560
 are the three types of heat transfer. 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.120
 We observe conducting, 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.240
 convection 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 and heat radiation simultaneously. 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.400
 Let me write thermal radiation ... 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.218
 I can also say "heat" 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.340
 "thermal" convection and "thermal" radiation - 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.500
 the word "thermal" simply refers to things that have to do with temperature. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.118
 What is conducting? 

00:00:46.118 --> 00:00:49.733
 What we have here in the fuel for our fire, 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.320
 for the fuel for our fire we have a classic burning reaction 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.840
 and I encourage you to watch the video on this in the chemistry playlist 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 or the chemistry section if you are interested. 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.000
 But you take carbon molecules and their bonds, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.880
 and then in the presence of oxygen and heat 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.720
 you have a burning reaction, 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.460
 which produces carbon dioxide and produces water 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.560
 and even more energy than you put into the reaction, 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.260
 so it produces a lot of energy. 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.620
 And this energy will excite the molecules that are around it, 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.480
 so you have these molecules, 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.920
 which ultimately receive a lot of kinetic energy. 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.103
 And remember that the temperature is proportional 

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:32.094
 of the average kinetic energy. 

00:01:32.094 --> 00:01:34.532
 And those who were just burning, 

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:36.767
 or molecules just downstream of the reaction, 

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.636
 or perhaps those who were part of the reaction, 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.420
 will have very high average kinetic energy, 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.160
 because this burning reaction released all this energy. 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.054
 And then they will hit other molecules, 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 who may not have such high kinetic energy, 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 but then they will transfer that kinetic energy 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.180
 through these collisions. 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.280
 And we have a whole video about the thermal performance, 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.559
 but that's what's happening. 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.020
 Things with high kinetic energy 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.951
 are thrown into things with lower kinetic energy 

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.025
 and transfer some of that kinetic energy 

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.872
 and transfer part of this impulse. 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 This is definitely the case when we look at such a fire, 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.040
 neighboring molecules are pushed into other molecules 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.980
 and transfer energy. 

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:19.617
 Conviction - it revolves around the idea, 

00:02:19.617 --> 00:02:22.075
 that the hot air is less dense. 

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.305
 If we have a lot of air particles here, 

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:28.333
 let's say this is the cool air here 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.160
 and it is logical that the cool air will be denser than the warm air. 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.400
 Because of the hot air, these particles have much higher kinetic energy 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.580
 and they shall strike one another, and shall push one another 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.540
 far farther and far away from each other, 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.234
 due to this high average kinetic energy. 

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:53.952
 However, since the hot area is less dense, 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.240
 this area here is less dense than the white area, 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.692
 these may be the same molecule, 

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:03.136
 I just made them in different colors to show 

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:05.147
 less dense area and dense area, 

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.950
 it will rise upwards. 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.760
 Or you can even think of it as a dense area ... 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.090
 The dense area will fall around it 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.060
 or will try to pass under it, 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 because it is thicker, 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.000
 and the less dense area will climb up. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.436
 And having done this, 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.240
 the hottest molecules will move up, 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.973
 and the colder molecules can go down 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.100
 to the heat source, 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.940
 the energy source, 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.577
 to be warmed up. 

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.783
 The hot air goes up - 

00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:43.820
 let me record this - the hot air goes up. 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.920
 When we think about it, 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.148
 he makes room for the cold air to come down, 

00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:48.505
 and then again to be warmed up. 

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:50.334
 And this happens with this fire here. 

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.488
 You see the burning reaction, 

00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:54.722
 the combustion reaction is here is here - 

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:56.104
 let me choose another color - 

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.298
 the combustion reaction is carried out in the fuel, 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.260
 this super hot air will rise upwards. 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.800
 That's why it looks like the flames 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.820
 move up, blaze up. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.060
 You will also see - and we will talk about it in thermal radiation - 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.080
 that they also change their color as they move up. 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.860
 But the whole idea of ​​the upward flame 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.274
 and hot air - 

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.326
 if you put your hand here, it will be much hotter here, 

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:24.263
 than if you put your hand, let's say here, 

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.048
 although in theory it is closer to the flame, 

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:30.075
 than that here above, and that's because the hot air 

00:04:30.075 --> 00:04:33.101
 rises up and makes room for the cold air, 

00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:35.500
 or I have to say "the colder" air, 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.700
 to go down and again to be warmed up, 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.760
 and then he will rise again. 

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.860
 This convection, this idea, 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.220
 that the hot air rises or the cold air falls, 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.100
 this is another type of heat transfer. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.255
 The last species we observe, 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.220
 when we look at the fire, is heat radiation. 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.193
 And this is based on the idea, 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.560
 if you have accelerating charged particles, 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.620
 they will release electromagnetic radiation. 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.740
 And you can say, "Wait, charged particles, 

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.899
 where are they speeding up here? " 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.300
 Well, we have these molecules that are constantly accelerating, 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.960
 until they hit each other. 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.980
 One that will transfer kinetic energy from - 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.660
 let's say this one is crushing into this one, 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.540
 it will accelerate this in a different direction. 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.480
 And even this one can go in another direction, 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760
 and acceleration is a change in speed, 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.560
 so it can be in velocity 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.780
 or in the direction of speed. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.000
 As they collide, you have all these accelerators 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.740
 loaded particles - let me write this - 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:40.160
 you have an acceleration of charged particles, 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:48.360
 and then releases electromagnetic radiation. 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.100
 I know what you think, "Wait a minute, Sal. 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.560
 I understand that we have these molecules that are accelerating, 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.400
 but where do these jobs come from with charged particles? " 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.300
 Well, we must remember that these molecules 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.540
 are made up of atoms, and the atoms are made up of charged particles, 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.439
 are made of protons and electrons. 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:08.922
 And while you accelerate these particles 

00:06:08.922 --> 00:06:10.340
 and the more you speed them up, 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.680
 the more radiation you will release. 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.320
 You can say, "Okay, you say I watch this in the fire. 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.360
 Where do I watch radiation? " 

00:06:18.372 --> 00:06:20.648
 Well, the very fact that you can see the fire, 

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:22.639
 the light emanating from the fire, 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.560
 this is electromagnetic radiation. 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.380
 This is electromagnetic radiation from wavelengths, 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.980
 which for your eye are visible light, 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.910
 or which the eye receives for light. 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.780
 Even the particles here above, 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.660
 which are still quite hot, 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.740
 they also emit electromagnetic radiation, 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.480
 because they hit one another 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.572
 and their electrons and protons 

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:49.031
 are accelerated in different directions. 

00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:51.611
 They also release electromagnetic radiation, 

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.602
 but it has a slower wavelength, 

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.056
 than your eye can perceive as light. 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.460
 If you have an infrared camera you will see that the flames are much higher. 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.100
 You will see them here. 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.980
 If you look at the flame closely 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.240
 here below you will see exactly where the burning reaction happens, 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.280
 that the flame looks blue. 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.280
 And this is because the blue light is a light with higher energy 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.760
 and this is because below the particles are accelerated more, 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.720
 and then passes from blue to white to yellow, 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.500
 to orange, to red, 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.717
 and then disappears, at least for your eyes. 

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.094
 But everything that has some temperature, 

00:07:34.094 --> 00:07:36.715
 releases electromagnetic radiation. 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.220
 And you say to yourself, "That's good, I understand it, 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.500
 but how is this a type of energy transfer? " 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.180
 If you sit by some fire you will feel the heat. 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.380
 In fact, even if the air between you and the flame is cold, 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.100
 you still feel warm. 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.180
 If this is a flame here 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.580
 and, say, you have cold air - 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.111
 let's say you're near campfire - 

00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:04.996
 this air here is 30 degrees. 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.980
 If you stay here, you will still feel the heat, 

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.300
 you will feel warmer. 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.360
 This is because this electromagnetic radiation 

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.700
 is emitted from the air particles, 

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.168
 which we perceive as a flame, 

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:24.160
 and then it can excite the particles on your skin. 

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.999
 It will transfer energy to your skin 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.640
 and you will feel warm. 

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.360
 I remember once, this is a strange story, 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.760
 I was on the highway and had a flaming car. 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.460
 We were driving in the leftmost band because the car was burning, 

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.054
 we were three stripes away from it 

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.517
 and it explodes. 

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:45.163
 I do not think there was anyone in it, 

00:08:45.163 --> 00:08:46.280
 I hope there was not, 

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.980
 but I remember that just when it exploded, 

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.720
 we felt intense immediate heat 

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.517
 through the window of the car 

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.420
 and that was electromagnetic radiation. 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.860
 It was thermal radiation released from these accelerated particles 

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.335
 in the air around this explosion, 

00:09:01.335 --> 00:09:04.118
 which we perceive as an explosion or fire, 

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.500
 but it warmed up particles on my skin.
