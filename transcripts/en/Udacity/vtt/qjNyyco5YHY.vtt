00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.830
Just one copy of the C allele at position 1,075, the CYP2C9

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.570
gene reduces the rate of Warfarin metabolism by 40%. The A allele

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.375
characterizes typical Warfarin metabolism, where

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:21.490
CYP2C9 can bind Warfarin and break it down into it's metabolites, but

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.340
the C allele runs in about 40% reduced activity.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490
I want you to see if you can classify this C

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.830
allele as dominant or recessive and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.918
as a loss-of-function or gain-of-function allele.
