00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.423
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.423 --> 00:00:04.107
is see how we can approximate limits

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:06.934
graphically and using tables.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.772
In the future, we're also going to be able

00:00:08.772 --> 00:00:10.528
to learn techniques where
we're going to be able

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.783
to directly figure out
exactly what this limit is.

00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.111
But for now, let's think
about how to approximate it,

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:17.741
and I'll build our intuition

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:20.138
for even what a limit actually is.

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:23.116
So we want to know the
limit as x approaches two

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:27.283
of x to the third minus 2x
squared over 3x minus six.

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:30.338
Now, the first thing you
might wanna check out

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:32.955
is, well, what is this expression

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.970
equal to when x is exactly equal to two?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.414
And we could do that by
substituting x with two,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:42.566
so it'll be two to the
third power minus two

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.649
times two squared over
three times two minus six.

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:51.420
Well, this numerator over here,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.108
this is eight minus two
times four minus eight,

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:56.654
so that's going to be equal to zero,

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.429
and then the denominator
over here is six minus six.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:00.758
Well, that's a zero,

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:04.520
and we end up in the indeterminate
form right over here.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.687
So this expression is not
defined for x equals two,

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:13.391
but we can think about what
does the expression approach

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.308
as x approaches two.

00:01:16.732 --> 00:01:19.536
And first, let's think about it visually.

00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:24.163
So, if we were to graph it,
and I graph this on the site

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:27.999
Desmos, which has a nice
graphing calculator,

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.222
you see the curve, y equals
this expression right over here.

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:36.037
So this is the curve of y is equal...

00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:38.451
Let me do that in a darker color.

00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:42.603
This is equal to y is
equal to x to the third

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.520
minus 2x squared over 3x minus six.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.788
And you can see, at least everywhere

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:51.169
where I've shown it here,
and it's actually true,

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:54.908
it's defined everywhere except
for when x is equal to two,

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:57.833
and that's why we have
this little gap over here,

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.597
showing that it is not defined.

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:01.946
And so what I wanna do
is I wanna approximate,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.579
well, as x gets closer and closer to two,

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.749
either from lower values of two

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.916
or from larger values of two,
what is the value of this

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:15.824
expression or the value of
this function approaching?

00:02:15.824 --> 00:02:17.525
And at this level of zoom,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:21.692
it looks like it's approaching
this value right over here,

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:23.937
so as x gets closer and closer to two,

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:26.254
it looks like our function
is getting closer and closer

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:27.684
to that value there,

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.379
regardless of which direction
we are approaching from,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.351
and so just approximating
it visually right over here,

00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.184
let's see.

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:36.313
This is zero, this is two.

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:38.811
This is one, right over here.

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:41.078
This would be 1.5.

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.289
At this level of zoom,

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
it looks like it's about 1.3 or 1.4,

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:47.850
so 1.3 or 1.4.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.445
Let's zoom in a little bit more,

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:54.333
and if you have access
to a graphing calculator

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.088
or you go to a website like
Desmos or Wolfram Alpha,

00:02:57.088 --> 00:03:00.233
you can zoom in further
and further on this graph,

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:02.070
so I encourage you to
try that out yourself

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.262
or do it with other graphs.

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:06.512
So let's zoom in even more.

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:12.501
So once again, we're not
defined at x equals two,

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.065
but here we get a slightly better read.

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:17.663
Let's see, this is one, this is two.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.378
The value that we are approaching

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:22.006
as x gets closer and closer to two,

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.460
we're getting, our value is
getting closer and closer

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.813
to that right over there,

00:03:26.813 --> 00:03:30.498
and if we look at what y value that is,

00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:32.324
let's see, if this is...

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.757
This is split into one,
two, three, four, five.

00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:37.176
So this is 1.2 right over here.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:40.299
This is 1.4 right over here.

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.087
So it looks like it's between...

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:43.981
So this would be 1.3 right over there.

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.232
So it's a little bit more than 1.3.

00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:49.399
So a little more than 1.3.

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:52.468
So, approximately, 1.3...

00:03:54.522 --> 00:03:56.626
Now, I do that in a lighter color.

00:03:56.626 --> 00:04:00.793
So it's approximately 1.3
something, it looks like.

00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:04.636
Let's zoom in even more

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:08.059
to see if we can get an
even better approximation.

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.049
So now, once again, we're
approaching that same value.

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.994
We're not defined at x equals two,

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:17.161
but as we're approaching
x equals two, let's see.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.650
Let me get a darker color.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.567
So, it would be right around there,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.435
and this is, let's see, this is one, 1.1,

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.752
1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5.

00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:31.626
So once again, it looks
like it's about one point...

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:34.260
If I were to just base it off of this,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.510
it looks like it's about 1.333 or 1.34,

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:42.829
so I'd say approximately 1.33.

00:04:44.687 --> 00:04:46.604
So, approximately 1.33.

00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:49.691
If I were, it looks like it might be

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.199
approaching 1 1/3, but
we don't know for sure.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.630
Remember, when you're
trying to figure out a limit

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.201
from a graph the best
you can really do here

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:59.116
is just approximate, try to eyeball, well,

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.637
the closer x gets to two,
it looks like this function

00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:05.295
is approaching this value right over here.

00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:08.928
Now, another technique which
tends to be a little bit more

00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:13.095
precise is to try to approximate
this limit numerically.

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:15.770
So let's do that.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.020
So let me get rid of these graphs here.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.972
We already got a sense of

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.977
what the graphs can do for us.

00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:27.274
They got us to about 1.33,

00:05:27.274 --> 00:05:30.544
but now, let's try to do it numerically.

00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:33.235
So, I'm going to set up a table here,

00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:36.714
and I encourage you to do the same.

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:38.316
So, on this column, I'll have my x,

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:39.481
and on this column, I'm going to say,

00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:43.528
well, what is the expression
x minus 2x squared

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:45.695
over 3x minute six equals?

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.111
And we know that when x
is exactly equal to two,

00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.346
that this thing right
over here isn't defined,

00:05:51.346 --> 00:05:53.679
but let's see what happens
as we approach two.

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:56.571
So let's see what happens
when we're at 1.9,

00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:57.404
or 1.99...

00:06:00.722 --> 00:06:01.972
I'll do 1.99...

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.977
I'll do 1.999.

00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:06.631
And we could also see
from the other direction.

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:10.798
We could say, well, what happens
when we approach at 2.001,

00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:15.743
and see if we are getting...

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:18.073
If this, if both of
these values seem to be

00:06:18.073 --> 00:06:21.010
approaching something, and
so this is approaching it

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.260
from lower values of x
and then we could say

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.906
this was approaching it
from higher values of x.

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:30.297
We could say 2.1, right over here.

00:06:30.297 --> 00:06:32.554
So let me get a calculator
out and evaluate these,

00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:35.391
and I encourage you to do the
same, get a calculator out,

00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.277
and see if you can evaluate these things.

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.498
All right, so let's see.

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:42.120
If we can evaluate it when x equals 1.9,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.370
it's going to be 1.9 to the third power

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:49.166
minus two times...

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.413
Two times 1.9 squared.

00:06:57.068 --> 00:07:00.901
1.9 squared is equal to,
so we get that value,

00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:08.427
and then we're going to
divide by, divide by,

00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:13.844
we get, we're gonna divide
by three times 1.9 minus six,

00:07:18.227 --> 00:07:20.136
and that's going to be equal to,

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:23.173
looks like it's about
1.203, so I'll just write

00:07:23.173 --> 00:07:24.840
approximately 1.203.

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:33.302
Now, let's try it with a
much closer value of x.

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:34.253
So that was just 1.9.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.086
Now let's go to 1.999.

00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.754
So once again, we're gonna have 1.999

00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:46.431
to the third power, and
then minus two times,

00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:51.489
open parentheses, 1.999 squared,

00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.782
close the parentheses,

00:07:56.782 --> 00:07:59.424
is equal to, so that's my numerator,

00:07:59.424 --> 00:08:03.412
and then my denominator, so divided by,

00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:07.118
divided by, and now, open parentheses,

00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:09.451
three times 1.999 minus six,

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:17.362
close my parentheses, is equal to 1.332.

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:19.545
So this is interesting.

00:08:19.545 --> 00:08:21.462
So approximately 1.332.

00:08:23.488 --> 00:08:26.031
So numerically, I seem to be approaching

00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:28.135
that same value or
close to that same value

00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:30.087
that I was approaching graphically,

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:34.254
and we can also do it from
values of x greater than two.

00:08:35.207 --> 00:08:38.019
Let me get my calculator
back, and I'll do some of it,

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:40.885
and I encourage you to
finish this up on your own,

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:43.642
and you could even try 1.999999

00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:46.045
to see what it actually is approaching.

00:08:46.045 --> 00:08:49.500
So, for example, if I wanted to try 2.1,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.833
so that would be 2.1 to the third power,

00:08:54.712 --> 00:08:57.545
minus two times, open parentheses,

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:03.496
2.1 squared, and then close
parentheses is equal to,

00:09:06.172 --> 00:09:08.988
that's my numerator, divided by,

00:09:08.988 --> 00:09:11.738
open parentheses, three times 2.1

00:09:13.795 --> 00:09:16.618
minus 6, close parentheses.

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:20.320
That's my denominator, and I get 1.47,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.153
so approximately 1.47.

00:09:23.516 --> 00:09:25.522
So now you can think I'm
getting closer and closer to two

00:09:25.522 --> 00:09:27.033
from values larger than two.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:30.001
Let's see if we seem to be
approaching the same value.

00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:33.104
So now let's get even closer to two, 2.01.

00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:35.367
And I'll do this one, and
then I'll leave it up to you

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.378
to see if you can get even more precise.

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:39.622
So, two point...

00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:41.031
Actually, let's get super precise.

00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:42.031
Let's, well,

00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:45.142
let's do three zeroes here.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.535
2.0001 to the third power

00:09:51.773 --> 00:09:53.106
minus two times,

00:09:55.473 --> 00:09:57.556
open parentheses, 2.0001.

00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:01.227
So we're getting really close.

00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:03.477
Squared, close parentheses,

00:10:06.085 --> 00:10:09.636
is equal to, so that's my numerator,

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:12.053
divided by, open parentheses,

00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:14.721
three times 2.0001,

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:22.136
minus six, this is my denominator.

00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:24.694
Is equal to, and notice, we're
getting closer and closer

00:10:24.694 --> 00:10:28.041
and closer to 1 1/3, 1.333...

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:29.596
Now, five.

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.429
So, we'll say approximately 1.333,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.078
and this is now for,

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:37.411
this is actually for 2.0001.

00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:44.268
So it does indeed look like
we are approaching 1.333333,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.631
or close to, it looks like
we are approaching 1 1/3.

00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:52.598
But once again, these
are just approximations,

00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:55.386
both through the table or graphically.

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:57.840
If you wanna find the
exact value of the limit,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.962
there are other techniques.

00:10:58.962 --> 00:11:02.926
We're going to explore those
techniques in future videos.
