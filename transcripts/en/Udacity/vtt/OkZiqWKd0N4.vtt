00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through it together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The JavaScript equivalent of def is function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We write out the keyword function.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Then we pick a name for our function.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I asked you to call it uptoten.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We mention all of its arguments,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then we use an opening curly brace instead of colon.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The word if remains unchanged. Less than is unchanged.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But again, instead of a colon we're going to use an opening curly brace.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here is our answer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If x is less than 10, we return x. Otherwise, we return 10.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Again, the big differences are these curly braces, which must be balanced.

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
They have to match up, but we already know how to do that instead of colons and indenting.
