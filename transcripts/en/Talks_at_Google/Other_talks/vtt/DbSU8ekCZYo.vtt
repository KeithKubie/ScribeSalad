JOSEPHINE DORADO: Hi everyone.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.300
My name is Josephine Dorado.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.040
I am the president of the
Fulbright Association's greater

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.010
New York chapter
here in New York.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.800
And I'm happy to introduce our
panelists; Jennifer Wright,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.350
the CEO of The Field, an artist
service organization, and Earl

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.290
Douglas, the executive director
of New York's chapter of Black

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.260
Rock Coalition, and Jeremy Xido,
the director of Death Metal

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.970
Angola, which we've
just finished seeing.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.570
So I'll let you guys go
ahead introduce yourself

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330
and a bit about
your organization.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.055
Jennifer, if you could start?

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:31.610
JENNIFER WRIGHT: Sure, so
I'm the executive director

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.610
of The Field, which is an
arts service organization here

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.290
in New York.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.560
And we work nationally
with about 1,400 artists

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.380
and companies a year
helping build their capacity

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.760
to make their art and
grow their careers.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.830
We have 11 national and
international sites.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.500
And actually Jeremy is part of
The Field for many years now.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.216
JOSEPHINE DORADO: Yea, Field!

00:00:57.216 --> 00:00:59.090
EARL DOUGLAS: Again, my
name is Earl Douglas.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.350
I'm the executive
director for the New York

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.970
chapter of the Black
Rock Coalition.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.685
We've been around since 1985.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:10.460
It was co-founded by
a group of artists,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.360
namely Vernon Reid,
guitarist of Living Colour,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.710
Greg Tate, writer, journalist,
musician, Kona Mason,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740
she was an artist
representative.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.730
And it was started as an
organization to really support

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.177
and advocate
musicians of color who

00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:34.460
we're going outside of the box.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.340
At that particular time, it
was you had to do R and B,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.390
you had to do hip hop.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.860
Anything in between
was verboten.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.310
And we had a small army of
artists who were not doing that

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.640
and wanted to freely
express themselves

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.150
and wanted to go through
all the avenues afforded

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.860
to pretty much everyone
else the same way.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.550
So they started to
the organization

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.950
as a partial advocacy group,
and it's evolved over the years

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.160
now that you can pretty
much make your own record.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.020
You can go independent now.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.080
So we really support
independent artists.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.780
But the focus is still
supporting artists of color

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.600
who just want to openly express
themselves freely and openly

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.570
and without any
restrictions upon them.

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:27.190
JEREMY XIDO: And
I'm Jeremy Xido.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.930
I'm the director of
Death Metal Angola.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.860
My background however is
as a dancer and performer.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.820
And I'm the co-director
of a performance and film

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.900
company called Cabula6, which
is based in part in New York

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.950
and part in Vienna.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.140
And we do live performance
site-specific work, dance work,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.412
and film work.

00:02:56.412 --> 00:02:58.210
JOSEPHINE DORADO:
Thanks, so I also

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.330
want to add too that the New
York chapter of the Fulbright

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.100
has just this year launched
a new program called

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.730
the Fulbright alumnus in
residence program, which

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.854
incubates alumnus projects
that have to do with embodying

00:03:09.854 --> 00:03:11.270
the mission of the
Fulbright which

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.970
is towards international
peace and understanding.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.720
And we're happy to also announce
that Jeremy Xido is actually

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.780
our inaugural Fulbright
alumnus in residence.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.362
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:22.320
JEREMY XIDO: Thank you.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.145
It's awesome.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.050
JOSEPHINE DORADO: So one
of the prevailing themes

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.540
of Death Metal Angola is very
much this idea of resilience,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.000
of about communities facing
great adversity, whether that's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.830
adversity through economic or
socioeconomic circumstances,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.130
or natural disasters.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.880
So within this sort of
prevailing theme of resilience,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.010
what sort of role do you feel
like artists fulfill or can

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.975
leverage towards building
community recovery

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:51.650
and resilience?

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.640
JEREMY XIDO: Well,
I actually just

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.360
answered a question similar
to this yesterday for radio

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.860
in Germany.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.140
I can speak just in terms of
what I think about the people

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.450
that I met in Angola
and my experience there.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.800
A lot of people, when
they see the film,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.890
they talk about what is the
power of this particular form

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.489
of music for this
particular group of people.

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.780
And a lot of times I've been
answering that, well, it's

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.960
a kind of music that can
withstand the stories that they

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.470
have to tell, that
there is something

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.430
almost journalistic in
the phantasmagoric lyrics,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.886
et cetera, somehow are
related to a lived experience

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:43.260
and being able to
express trauma.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.620
But I actually think,
in retrospect, I've

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.500
been thinking that it's just the
fact of having bands and just

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.530
the fact of having
a joint mission.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.030
And being able to touch truth
together with other people

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.210
and to go for it and to create
a safe space in order to do that

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.080
is extremely healing.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.190
And in part because
it allows you

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.020
to fight, to pick up pieces,
disagree with one another,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.160
and negotiate,
which are all things

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.930
that a lot of the people in
this film, at least socially,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.510
the country has lost
the ability to do over

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.890
the course of 40 years
of near constant warfare.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.920
And when I see
them, it's not just

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.610
about cathartic
release and screaming.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.130
It's actually about the
constructive process

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.780
of building an organization and
having to stick with it, partly

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.660
through ambition, partly
through concerts that come up.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.070
And that is,
essentially, for me when

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.922
I think about it, the
main purpose of art,

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:56.880
as a social phenomenon.

00:05:59.968 --> 00:06:01.520
EARL DOUGLAS: I saw the film.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.460
And there was parts of
the movie that as-- I've

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.470
been part of the
BRC for 25 years.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.730
And there were little bits of
our experience in that movie.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.570
Just getting together
is the hardest thing,

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.237
the community aspects of it.

00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:22.570
And I think that was a key part.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.040
It was just like getting
everyone together and just

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.100
having, OK, you feel this way.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.000
I feel this way.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.750
You feel this way.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.870
Let's get together and just
turn whatever pain we have,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.740
whatever issues we
have, whatever we have,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.780
just turn it into art
and coordinating it.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.050
And I think that's
what the arts is about

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.990
is just putting that
all together and making

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.370
something remarkable out of it.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.870
And it always starts
with the arts.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.720
The civil rights
movement started

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.460
within the arts community.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.590
The turning points
came from the artists.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.970
So I always thought the
arts were essential.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.260
And this movie definitely
reinforced that whole idea

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.110
that the arts can still
be a healing force

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.680
and definitely bring
people together.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.790
Again, I love this movie.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.892
I absolutely love the film.

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:27.420
JENNIFER WRIGHT: I'll just
tag on that, that I completely

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.920
agree.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.940
And I was thinking about that on
my way over about civil rights,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.540
in particular in
Vietnam, and all

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.498
the different social
movements that have really

00:07:34.498 --> 00:07:38.400
built from the arts
and how this film takes

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.140
a humongous step forward.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.270
And I just really loved it.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.190
So thank you.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:53.750
And then the other side, for
me, is also the less direct ways

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.474
that we see arts impact.

00:07:56.474 --> 00:07:57.890
Like the other
work that you make,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.806
Jeremy, and the work
that you're involved with

00:07:59.806 --> 00:08:02.600
and a lot of the work that we're
involved with might be deemed

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.270
art for art's sake.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.030
And sometimes that's
a real critique

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.040
in that that's not good
enough, particularly

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.680
in a really competitive
funding environment.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.060
And so how do we grapple with
letting art hold all of that?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.715
Some of it is really direct in
the way these kids are impacted

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:21.430
or the way the
artists are impacted,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.610
the way a country is impacted.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.410
And then the other ways that
art impacts our civic dialogues

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.520
in maybe less a political
way or social justice way.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.585
And how do we hold both of those
in our cultural participation,

00:08:35.585 --> 00:08:36.612
I guess.

00:08:36.612 --> 00:08:38.070
JOSEPHINE DORADO:
Great, thank you.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.970
I know that each
of our communities

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.320
very much addresses
marginalization in each way.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.810
The artists in The Field
community, and the artists

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.560
in the BRC, and the
artists in Angola

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.810
are very much addressing
this kind of marginalization.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.320
What kinds of specific
artists or projects

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.820
can you think of that
have dealt with adversity

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.220
particularly well, whether it's
through Sandy, or through 9/11,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.440
or specific other cases?

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:09.680
JENNIFER WRIGHT:
I'll dive in on that.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.440
For instance, Miguel Gutierrez
has a dance theater music

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.190
company called Miguel Gutierrez
and the Powerful People.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.690
And it might be deemed,
particularly his work,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.190
more art for art's
sake in that way.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.750
But it is grappling with
issues, particularly

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.910
in queer culture, that are
really assertive, and really

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.600
vibrant, and really provocative.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.780
And his work, from
my point of view,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.280
it's not attacking
a specific thing

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.790
like AIDS, culture,
or gay marriage.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.170
It's not political outrightly.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.070
But through his art making
and through his performance,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.649
you are called to respond.

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:42.690
You are called as a human
being to feel something

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.480
and then potentially
do something with that.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.040
Or someone like
Mike Daisey, who's

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.620
more overt in terms of his
monologue work with Apple

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.380
and that work and sort of
pushing those boundaries.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.630
I feel like we probably each
have hundreds of examples.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.420
Those are just two that
were off the top of my head.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.535
EARL DOUGLAS: We've done a bunch
of-- I hate the word tribute.

00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:06.910
We've always done
retrospectives.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.780
We've always targeted a
specific artist's work.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.560
We did the civil rights song
book of Curtis Mayfield.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.650
And in doing that, you
kind of address issues

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.510
that are very universal.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:30.770
He had a song called
"This is My Country."

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.320
And when we did
that show, it took

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.903
on this whole other
different context,

00:10:33.903 --> 00:10:38.990
because we had the immigration
debate going on in the country.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.580
We've taken shows
overseas and done

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.730
salute to women songwriters,
who in general, especially

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.200
in rock 'n roll been very
marginalized and downplayed.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.199
And then you realize,
their catalogs is as strong

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:54.740
as anybody's.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.760
Vernon Reid, he did a suite.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.230
He called it the 9/11 suite.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.630
And it didn't address
9/11 directly.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.260
But it kind of addressed
the aftermath of it.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.940
I saw him do a couple
performances of it

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.220
with Living Colour
also as a solo artist.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.090
And it was very, very powerful.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.220
I think that's kind of where
you can approach an issue

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.210
or problem without actually
just making it a grand theme

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:36.660
and having certain songs,
take them into an entirely

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.540
different level and using it
as a totally different context.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.630
So I think, with us, that's
always been a challenge as far

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.110
as, how do we present
or direct an issue

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.910
without really
politicizing it at all?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.990
We've done two, we
might do a third,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.940
we call it the Million Man Mosh.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.070
And it kind of addresses
how young black men

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.130
are treated in the
criminal justice system.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.200
But it's not direct.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.550
One of our longtime
members, his son

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.390
is kind of going through
the criminal justice system.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.690
And we were doing it
as benefits for him.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.240
And it just took on this
whole other universal theme.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.290
We didn't even realize it.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.050
And I think that's
how you do it.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.040
That's how you attack a problem.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.120
You kind of, OK, we're
putting the same picture

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.379
in a different frame.

00:12:37.379 --> 00:12:39.170
And I think that's how
you can approach it.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.916
And that's how the
arts really can work.

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:45.720
JEREMY XIDO: I mean, I think
these are phenomenon examples.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.540
I think there are
lots and lots and lots

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.110
of artists that are out
there working in this way.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.510
There's a whole genre of art
that I'm particularly fond of.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.480
And it just happens.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.650
It's urban graffiti
art, which I actually

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.270
don't know who does it other
than-- I know people by tags.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:09.360
But the reason why I'm
particularly drawn to it,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.950
and I actually see when
thinking about the film

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.550
and thinking about Okutiuka,
we paid special attention

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.000
to the walls in the space.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.650
And one of the reasons is that,
they're around you everywhere.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.150
And in the walls, there's
something about history

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.170
that's inscribed in it.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.850
So there's time.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.930
There's decay.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.130
There's the war.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:39.480
There's bullet holes and things.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.160
But then there's also the
faded paintings that exist

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:48.630
and the story of Yakuza,
who's a young kid who died,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.480
who they got to
draw on the walls

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.440
and get everybody
else to draw on.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.100
The thing about it
is there's something

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.850
about inscribing
something in space.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.260
And at that point, you've
changed the environment.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.110
And you've established
some form of history.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.710
And so a story is then told out
of that moment, which everybody

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.660
has to know, because
it's where they live.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.490
And you know the
story about that.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.900
And there's a kind
of politicization

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.060
and a validation of
self and a community.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.790
And I find that graffiti
art actually establishes

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.560
a broader community of people
who are not necessarily artists

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.070
but are people.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.970
And that link, at least
from where I come from,

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:36.474
that graffiti is really big
and seeing it in this space,

00:14:36.474 --> 00:14:38.140
I would say all the
graffiti artists out

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.067
in the world, most of them.

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:42.150
JENNIFER WRIGHT: Can I
just add something to that?

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.870
JOSEPHINE DORADO: Sure.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.620
JENNIFER WRIGHT: I was
thinking about your question

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.970
about marginalization and
then those kids in the film,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.386
particularly what
you said earlier

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:52.030
about giving opportunities,
particularly for music, as such

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.690
an outlet for storytelling.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.200
And one of things in terms
of marginalized folks,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.950
even here in the States it's
quite different from Angola,

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:03.230
obviously, but who
gets to be an artist?

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.600
Who gets those
opportunities, whether that's

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.600
funding in the schools
or the price of an MFA,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.400
or equipment to try
and play guitar,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.250
or all of that stuff,
who gets to do that?

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.060
And I am more and more
concerned about that.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.240
I call it the art gap,
for lack of a better word.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.930
Who is getting to do this?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.630
And is it skewing more
and more towards income

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.340
privileged folks, primarily
white folks in this country,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.244
or whatever it is?

00:15:31.244 --> 00:15:32.160
Where is that skewing?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.630
And who are we losing?

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.682
And all the beautiful
making that we're losing,

00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:37.390
whether it's quote
unquote "professional"

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.850
or not, what you
can do with that

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.380
as a human being just
given the opportunity.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.750
There's an organization called
Willie Mae Girls Rock Camp.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.180
EARL DOUGLAS: Rock
camp for girls.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.430
JENNIFER WRIGHT: Unbelievable.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.192
And I did their Ladies
Rock Camp twice.

00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:51.650
And that's for
resilience building.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.590
It saved my life as
the executive director

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.620
of a nonprofit.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.240
But the rock camp is, it's
unbelievable what they offer.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.080
And in terms of gender
issues and sexuality issues

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.110
and then music as
an empowerment tool.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.000
And more and more
concerned in this country

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.545
about where are we investing.

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:10.360
Where are we
investing, particularly

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.120
in kids and who
we're going to lose.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.240
JOSEPHINE DORADO:
Great, thank you.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.824
So those were all really
great jumping off points.

00:16:17.824 --> 00:16:19.740
And so I want to sort
of wrap this up and take

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.370
any questions, or
feedback, or comments

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.328
that we might have from
people in the audience.

00:16:23.328 --> 00:16:26.810
So I feel like I see
one hand out there.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.950
There's that mic and
that mic on that side.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.945
So if anyone wants
to jump up, Shemaine.

00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:36.320
JENNIFER WRIGHT:
Don't be afraid.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jeremy
and everybody else.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.960
I really enjoyed the film.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.127
And I really found the
people just so amazing,

00:16:46.127 --> 00:16:47.960
especially the people
running the orphanage.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.860
Can you tell us more
about how you met them

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.926
and how you got involved
in making this film?

00:16:53.926 --> 00:16:57.110
JEREMY XIDO: Yeah, well, there's
a pat story by now that I tell.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.205
So I'll just tell it.

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.290
It was by accident.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.140
I met them totally by accident.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.960
I was in Angola filming a
completely different movie

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.740
about Chinese construction
workers that are rebuilding

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.310
the train line that cuts
through the middle of Angola.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.740
And the train line just
stops in this town, Huambo.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.460
And I had got out and I wanted
a cup of coffee really badly.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.690
And there's apparently
only one place

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.460
in the entire town that
serves a decent cup of coffee.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.510
It's called Imperial.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.870
So I went there.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.080
And when I was there, I
sat down with my coffee

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.160
and some guy across the way
was like, he waved me over.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.695
And I kind of went over.

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:39.320
I was like, OK.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.230
And I brought my little
coffee and stuff with him.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.688
It's like, hey,
what are you doing?

00:17:42.688 --> 00:17:43.400
And we talked.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.694
And he asked me what I did.

00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:45.860
I said I was making a movie.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.070
That's great, what do you do?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.030
He's like, oh, I'm a musician.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.821
That's really cool.

00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:49.610
What do you play?

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.710
Death metal.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.140
And I was floored.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.810
I said, you what?

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.790
And I said, well,
can you play for me?

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.456
He's like, yeah, yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.020
Listen, here.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.360
Here's my telephone number and
meet me tonight at this address

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.580
at the orphanage,
which I assumed at

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.620
that point was a club.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.010
And I invited the Chinese
construction workers

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.700
that I had been filming
and working with

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.850
to go see this concert
out at the orphanage.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.230
And so we drove in their SUV.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.530
And we arrived to
this neighborhood.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.074
And it just happened
to be on a night

00:18:25.074 --> 00:18:26.240
where the generator was out.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.448
And there was no electricity.

00:18:27.448 --> 00:18:31.510
And so Wilker was there sort
of siphoning electricity

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.059
from his neighbor to
plug-in his amplifier.

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:35.100
And there were no lights.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.460
There was no microphone.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.510
And so we lit it with
the lights of the SUV.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.090
And he proceeded to
play the single most

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.890
harrowing and beautiful open
air concert I've ever heard.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.630
And there were these shadows of
kids running around everywhere.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.000
And I had no idea
what was going on.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.550
And these people became
dear, dear friends.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.890
And about a year later,
we were going back to film

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.130
the train film.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.570
And I called up Wilker, and
by that time I had met Sonia,

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.070
and said we're coming back.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.310
I would love to see you
if your around and film.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.840
They're like oh, my god.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.570
That's great that you're
coming, because we're organizing

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.070
the first ever
national rock concert

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.670
and you're going to film it.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.600
And that was it.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.270
I was hired at that moment.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.880
And that's it.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.980
That's how it happened.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.630
And it built over a course
of a couple of years.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.110
And it was a partnership,
really, between us

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:36.086
and the Association for
Angolan Rock as a friendship

00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:36.585
partnership.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.920
JOSEPHINE DORADO: A
lovely happy accident.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.740
Anyone else?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
again for this film.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.210
It's really amazing.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.900
Is it open to the public?

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.420
Where can you see this film now?

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.019
JEREMY XIDO: I'll
answer that one.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:03.360
Sorry, guys.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.280
The film premiered at the
beginning of the year.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.330
And it's been on the
international festival circuit.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.450
So it's traveled
around the country

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.400
to maybe 30 festivals, 30,
40 festivals worldwide,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.690
every continent
except for Antarctica.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.770
And it is going make its New
York debut on November 16

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.700
at the Doc NYC festival
here in New York.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.220
And we're currently working
with the Fulbright Association

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.720
on organizing a tour of the
film through the United States

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.540
that we're calling the DMA
Resilience tour, which we're

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:47.990
looking to launch in
spring 2014 to cities

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:53.730
around the country like Detroit,
where I'm from, or New Orleans,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:58.320
or a whole slew of others
that have been hit hard

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.560
by economic or a
natural disaster.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.660
And we're going to have
a series of screenings,

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:09.730
town hall conversations about
resilience, and local concerts.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.980
And so we're about to start a
fund raising campaign for that

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.910
and get that off and running.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:22.866
So ideally in the spring, it'll
be much more widely accessible.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:23.920
JOSEPHINE DORADO: Great.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.760
So just to wrap it up,
I think we actually

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.860
have to get things moving.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.990
Just a few last words on--
oh, there's one last question.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.760
Yeah?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.630
OK, sorry.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.060
AUDIENCE: I had a question
for Earl, actually.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.300
I just was really
struck by your feeling

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.090
familiar with the folks in
the film about the early days

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.270
of the Black Rock Coalition.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.130
And now that you're
25 years in, I

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.350
wonder if there's
advice for them.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.770
Or if there's a
way that you feel

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:55.450
like how they're beginning to
gel is really going to stick

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.876
and how you can imagine for
them where the future might go.

00:22:00.876 --> 00:22:02.570
EARL DOUGLAS: Advice
is just keep going.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.990
A, key playing.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.900
Just that little
epilogue at the end

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.650
was very encouraging
as well that they

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.680
were able to do it a year later.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.880
And it was bigger.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.200
And it was clearly more
concise and more organized.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.280
Like the first one, the
sound wasn't working.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.242
The show started
five hours late.

00:22:26.242 --> 00:22:29.040
And this wasn't working.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040
And that wasn't working.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.440
And yet, they
pulled the show off.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.070
And my advice would
be just keep going,

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.740
find ways to make it better.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.060
And just let the scene
kind of go where it goes.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.900
Don't try to shape it anyway.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.530
Wherever it goes, let it go.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.304
I mean, that would be my advice.

00:22:48.304 --> 00:22:50.220
And the chief advice
would be just keep going.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.200
Just keep following the art.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.069
It will not betray you.

00:22:55.069 --> 00:22:56.152
JEREMY XIDO: That's great.

00:22:56.152 --> 00:22:58.568
JOSEPHINE DORADO: Just put one
foot in front of the other,

00:22:58.568 --> 00:22:59.130
keep going.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.600
So what are some last
words that you might all

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.440
have on how we as communities
can support artists

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.350
so that artists can
support their communities?

00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:16.320
JENNIFER WRIGHT: I'll be direct.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:16.870
Go to shows.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.080
I have three.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.940
Go to shows, join a board
of an organization you love,

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.720
and give them money.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.710
So shows, boards, and money.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.260
Sort of back to where are
we going as a country,

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.750
the marketplace has
gotten so competitive

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.890
and questions all the time
about what kind of ROI

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.550
does art give in the
world, and concerns

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.720
about new money versus old
money and all of these things.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.159
And art, I think if we
commit to it as a people,

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.700
like what we believe
and what we want

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.840
to see, we have to
put money behind that,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.280
and time behind that,
and volunteer hours.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.411
If you believe in
it, then go do it.

00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.900
EARL DOUGLAS: I'm kind
of echoing her statement.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.510
Support it with your dollars.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.660
Support it with your
presence, mainly.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.950
Because especially
here in New York,

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.190
it's tough to get-- it's weird.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.760
And now we're in this kind
of internet computer age,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.720
it's harder and harder to
get people to actually leave

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.000
their computer to go to a show.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.520
Support the shows.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.580
Support organizations that
support artists or support

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.730
the nurturing of artists,
especially with young people.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.860
I always say, have an open mind.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.920
I think the biggest
obstacle that we've always

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.100
faced with the Black Rock
Coalition has always been,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.240
I don't like that rock thing.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.990
It's like, have
you listened to it,

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.420
like really broken down
and listened to it?

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.524
And they go no.

00:25:02.524 --> 00:25:03.690
It's like, maybe you should.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.610
Have a better understanding
of its history.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.940
Because for me,
everything connects.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.720
Which is why I like
every kind of music,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.960
because I think it all connects
in some way or another.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.580
There's a connect between
Louis Jordan and Snoop Dogg.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.860
So educate yourself on
top of everything else.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.550
But support the arts.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.400
Whether it's the Willie Mae
Rock Camp, or it's the BRC,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.190
whatever, you support it with
presence and with your dollars.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:40.570
I mean, that's the short answer.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.570
JEREMY XIDO: It's funny.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.028
Because what both
of you are saying

00:25:43.028 --> 00:25:46.290
is exactly what people in Angola
are saying about their worlds.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.410
It's the same issues.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:26:01.400
The only thing I would add
to it maybe is to make stuff,

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:08.740
is to be creatively engaged
in the conversation.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.030
And ultimately I see it as
a conversation or something

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.770
about consuming, the way
that people go see shows

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.300
if you have a good
time or whatever.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.925
And there's another
thing about if it's

00:26:18.925 --> 00:26:22.190
your people in some way or the
people that you've committed to

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.130
or the thing that you
yourself have gone out to do.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.430
And then there's something
about actually creating

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.779
a world in which you
actually just do shit.

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:34.570
JOSEPHINE DORADO: I
would add to that, too.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:35.825
And this sort of
goes on what Earl

00:26:35.825 --> 00:26:37.324
was saying about
having an open mind

00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:43.200
is that having an open mind
with regards to what art is

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.830
and how we as communities
can support art,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.860
so whether that's opening up
different kinds of revenue

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.450
models, looking at different
kinds of crowd funding

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.250
campaigns, or just being
inventive in the way

00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:00.440
that we, as artists look at
our art as an entrepreneurship,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.920
and as a business,
and how we could

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.830
look at hybrid models of
how to do those things.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.655
As Jeremy mentioned before,
the Fulbright New York chapter

00:27:08.655 --> 00:27:11.350
is also helping out with
doing this crowd funding

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.670
campaign of the Resilience
tour, which we're launching

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.240
on RocketHub in
the next few days.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.100
So look for the Resilience
Tour on RocketHub.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.990
But very much around the whole
conversation of opening up what

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.770
we envision as art and as
community and community

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.066
development.

00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:28.690
JEREMY XIDO: If I
can just add to that.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.523
I think one of the
really interesting things

00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:34.580
about the crowd funding
model is the notion

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.740
that it's about democratizing
funding on the one hand.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.470
But it seems to me
that it's even more so

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:47.215
about establishing community
using the internet age

00:27:47.215 --> 00:27:50.920
or in the place,
how do you actually

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.590
get into different communities
and have people invest not

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.720
just financially but
invest emotionally

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.000
and creatively in a
project so that they

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.100
become part of that project.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.170
How do you become part
of the Resilience Tour?

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.290
JOSEPHINE DORADO: How do
we make stuff together?

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.640
JEREMY XIDO: How do you do shit?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.556
JOSEPHINE DORADO: How
do you do shit together?

00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:14.210
EARL DOUGLAS: Yeah, just to
add on to that, Fishbone,

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:19.920
long time BRC supporter
band, their last album

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.350
was crowd funded.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.020
And they had a great line.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.690
It was, you are the
producer of the record.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.660
And I thought that's
a pretty easy way

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.720
to make people understand
what this means.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.350
It's like, you know what, I'm
producing the album of the band

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.930
that I always loved.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.160
And I think it becomes
very empowering.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.770
And I think that's
a very key part of,

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:45.020
I guess, with crowd funding
that kind of gets lost.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.060
You know what, you're
being part of this project

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.770
that you always wanted to see.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:55.200
God knows we hear enough
about stuff that's out there.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.307
And it's being
consumed by the masses.

00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:58.890
And everyone's like
this sucks and how

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:00.051
come people are buying it?

00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:02.300
People are buying it because
people are supporting it.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.850
Somebody's buying it.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.896
And you could do the same thing.

00:29:05.896 --> 00:29:07.520
It's like, OK, don't
complain about it.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.330
Do something about it.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.770
Put your dollars behind it.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.290
And I think, again, it has
to be stressed over and over

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.070
and over again.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.570
Whatever project you're
passionate about, whatever

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.870
artists, whatever you're
into, if you don't

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.740
put the time into it,
if you don't nurture it,

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.883
it's not going to go to where
you think you want it to go.

00:29:29.883 --> 00:29:32.665
JENNIFER WRIGHT: Can
I just tag on maybe

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:35.970
as a Debbie Downer for a second,
just on the crowd funding?

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:40.750
One thing we see a lot with
our 1,400 artists, the crowd

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.600
funding certain
models also really

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.090
not just encourage but
urge you to give away

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.880
stuff for your dollar.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.180
So if I give $25,
I'll get two tickets

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.540
to a show and a signed album
and a dinner with Jeremy.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.530
And suddenly the $25 is
really worth so much more.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:04.930
And it kind of speaks
to the ROI thing.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.140
What is philanthropy
in this day and age?

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.604
And what do we expect?

00:30:09.604 --> 00:30:11.270
And a lot of the
artists we see are just

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.811
giving away so much stuff, in
part because they don't believe

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:16.905
that the experiment and the
art itself is sufficient.

00:30:16.905 --> 00:30:19.030
So they're going to give
you a mug, and a tote bag,

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.150
and a happy ending, everything.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.064
They're going to give away the
store in order to get your $25.

00:30:25.064 --> 00:30:26.980
And we just really try
and work with our folks

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.610
at least, just be
cognizant of that.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.750
One, can you handle it?

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.760
Can handle giving
away all that stuff?

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.640
What does that mean in terms
of investors, and backers,

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.400
and all of that?

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.830
What does that mean?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.500
Are there people who
really are OK with,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.000
let me just give you some money,
because philanthropically I

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.958
believe in the importance
of what you're doing.

00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:45.680
And that's awesome.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.520
So just to be
strategic about that.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.340
And if, for instance, I give
money to WNYC, and I say

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.340
I don't want this stuff.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.700
I don't need this stuff.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.550
I believe in WNYC.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.172
I don't need the tote bag.

00:30:57.172 --> 00:30:59.220
I don't need "The New
Yorker," which I can't even

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.380
read because there's too many
of them, despite the fact

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.010
that I love it.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.549
But I don't need it,
just take my money.

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:06.340
JOSEPHINE DORADO: All
right, thank you all.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.230
Thank you for your
time and your feedback.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.040
And thank you all for your
time and your feedback, too.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.810
JEREMY XIDO: Thank
you very much.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:18.075
