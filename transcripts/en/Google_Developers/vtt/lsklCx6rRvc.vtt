ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello,
and welcome.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.190
Another exciting episode of
Google Developers Live.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.900
This is Google Apps Unscripted,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.400
Google I/O 2013 edition.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.360
And my name is Arun Nagarajan.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.750
And we're coming live from
the New York studio.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.680
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, hi.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.850
And I'm Eric Koleda, also a
member of the Apps Script

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.170
Developer Relationships Team.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.830
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.540
Eric and I haven't been on
air together in a while.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.400
I just realized that as
I saw ourselves in the

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.350
monitor right here.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.680
Super excited to
be on the air.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.750
And in today's episode, we're
going to, of course, talk

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.580
about Google I/O 2013, which we
just wrapped up last week.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.140
ERIC KOLEDA: Amazing
event, wasn't it?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Amazing
event, amazing event.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.900
Still catching up on all the
other things that I've missed,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.540
but super high energy, really
nice to be out there and meet

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.270
a lot of the developers that
work on our product, you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.240
folks, and also just to talk
to other people that are

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.620
working on really cool stuff.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.010
In today's episode, we're going
to focus on recapping

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.170
the session from last week, the
big product launches we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.440
had, a lot of really
exciting things.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.640
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, it was a
good time for App Script.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.710
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good time for
App Script, as I think last

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.479
year of IO was, as well.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.980
And most importantly, we want
to take questions from you.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.530
So there's a Google moderator
link, where I think I've

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.390
already seen a bunch of good
questions come up.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.650
And we'll also have some live
questions towards the end.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.840
So please, put your questions
in moderator or be prepared

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.070
with the questions
towards the end.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.990
And we'll make sure we save
plenty of time for that.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.420
So first things first, let's
talk about all of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.520
the exciting launches.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.210
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So if you've
seen our blog posts, I think

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.135
this went on, I think, the day
before I/O. And then these

00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:39.320
were available, I think, a few
hours before that even.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040
So the big launches, I think
there were, I counted, five

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.430
big launches.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.190
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.220
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Probably the
biggest one was scripts in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.010
Google Docs.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.700
One of the top requested
features for a long time.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.280
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I think
since scripts was in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.980
Spreadsheets, people naturally
thought, why

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.320
not my docs, right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.080
I think Spreadsheets was
a really good teaser.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.070
And a lot of people saw
the power of it.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.290
And obviously, a lot of
Spreadsheets specific use

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.410
cases still apply.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.830
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.750
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But once you
have that natural inclination

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.170
to script and automate things
and be able to do stuff with

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.230
content in a document, you want
to do it in Google Docs.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.566
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:16.010
And I guess if you've used App
Script a lot in the past,

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.790
well, there's always been
a Document app, right?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.750
That's been out for a while.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.080
ERIC KOLEDA: Not always, but
for at least a while now.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.070
But I think we took it a step
further now where it's not

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.120
just that you can manipulate
your document.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.930
You can actually put a script
within a document.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right, and a lot
really cool things that I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.420
think we did a really fantastic
job with the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.910
session, as well, where the team
showed off a really cool

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.060
demo that they built.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.260
Jonathan [? Rascher ?], who was
one of the presenters, I

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.940
think did a terrific job and set
the stage for what we've

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.260
done with the script
service here, the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.310
document service here.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.490
And a lot more to
come, I'm sure.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.660
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.570
I think one of the most exciting
parts about the new

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660
Google Docs integration
is the sidebar.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.080
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.950
ERIC KOLEDA: So we've had the
ability to show pop ups in

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.570
Spreadsheets before and
other UI adjustments.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.070
But the sidebar, I think,
although it's kind of just

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.410
like a dialogue that sticks to
the side, it really opens up a

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.330
lot of whole new use
cases that we

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.240
think are really exciting.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.620
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.830
So I think a pop up's
obviously modal.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.120
They take you out of the
flow if you're a user.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.920
Having a sidebar up and having
you still be able to work on

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.010
the content is, I think,
really powerful.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.500
And the set of use
cases that that

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.019
enables is really powerful.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.649
And we're super excited see what
you can build with it.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.970
So that was a big one.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.940
The next one I know that's near
and dear to your heart is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.020
the form service.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.710
Google Forms, obviously there
was a really good re-launch of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.200
that product with lots of new
features in first quarter, I

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.600
think it was?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.650
Maybe March, April?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.000
ERIC KOLEDA: Right, yeah.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Maybe
even before.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.480
I forget the exact date.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.530
But the natural inclination
again was to be able to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.640
automate and extend
that set of APIs.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.270
So we added a brand new service
called Form Service

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.120
and also brought in all the
capabilities of the UI

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
integration, the trigger
capabilities

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.600
within Google Forms.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.450
So this, you did a session
on this actually.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.770
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.460
It was a lot of fun.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.720
Me and one of the engineers
who builds Forms and has

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.510
worked a lot on the App Script
side as well, we did a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.580
co-presentation at I/O about how
you can use App Script and

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.430
Forms together.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.500
And Forms, it used to be
not its own product.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.280
It was just a different feature
of Spreadsheets.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.390
Now, it's graduated into its
full product and own product.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.560
I think it makes
a lot of sense.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.060
Forms is really widely used.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.460
Very popular for collecting
data, especially in schools

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.850
and other organizations.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.810
And so now, adding scripting
to that just

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.600
made a lot of sense.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.980
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.890
ERIC KOLEDA: And the format that
you can use to manipulate

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.660
Forms, we built it from
the ground up.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.500
It's really good.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.150
It's really complete.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, I
really like the API.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.280
It just felt very natural
to play with it.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.370
And we like to call
Google Apps as the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.460
productivity suite.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.660
And Forms make you
more productive.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.220
And the fact that you can script
against these forms,

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.935
that just takes it off
the charts, I think.

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:52.390
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh,
yeah, totally.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.580
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And I was just
think about, obviously it's

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.640
really big in education and
personal use and whatnot.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.020
And I just see so many use cases
that people have already

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.100
started to do.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.990
And Andrew Stillman's already
put out a couple

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.050
of scripts, I think.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.940
I think it was two scripts,
two separate scripts he's

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.790
already built.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.540
So really excited to see
where all of that goes.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.310
ERIC KOLEDA: I think in one of
his videos he described Forms

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.260
as the paper clip
for MacGyver.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.435
It's this tool that you use to
get out of any situation.

00:06:17.435 --> 00:06:18.180
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Every episode!

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.650
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.060
And that's what I tihnk Forms
is to a lot of teachers.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.830
And so having the scripting
capablities just makes it that

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.205
much more powerful.

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:24.580
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.660
And I really encourage you
to play with this one.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.970
It's really easy to play with.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.610
The API is really
nicely designed.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.190
And I think this, more than
anything else, I feel like

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.290
there's nothing in the UI that
you can do that you can't do

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.590
in the API.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.680
ERIC KOLEDA: It's true.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.610
Yeah, he really made it every
check box, every kind of item,

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.090
it's in there.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.560
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And you'd find
it in the place you'd expect

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.820
to find it, too, which
is the nice thing.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.410
The next thing is the
new Drive service.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.230
So you have probably already
seen this as well in your

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.090
script editor and auto-complete
and all that

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.520
good stuff.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.010
We call it Drive App.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.760
It's a brand new service that
encapsulates the Drive API, so

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.930
the Drive SDK, which
launched last year.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.160
Provides a brand new way to
interact with the documents

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.870
and files you have
in Google Drive.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.840
And we now have exposed
that API as a

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.560
service in App Script.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.980
Really powerful, a lot of
really nice things.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.570
John McGowan, who was a
co-presenter with me on this

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.620
session, we talked about
this launch.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.220
And we're pretty excited about
this one, as well.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.960
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I think
it's pretty cool.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.730
In some ways, you can look at
it and say, ah, I could do

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.820
that via Docs list.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.030
Right?

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.965
What's new?

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.670
I think some of the key things
to remember is while we did

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.470
add a couple new features,
like I think owner

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.690
manipulation was one of them.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.420
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That
was a big one.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.140
ERIC KOLEDA: That was a big one,
especially when people--

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.730
I know a lot of organizations
having people leave and change

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.320
roles, makes it really
important to have.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.190
But even just beyond that, I
think one of the key things is

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.360
that in App Script, we're taking
all these other parts

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.680
of Google and connecting them.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.880
And when we change our
technology to go on to the

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.310
latest kind of new underpinning,
so now that

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.040
we're on the same Drive
infrastructure as the external

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.720
Drive SDK, it makes it so that
we can bring in features a lot

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.170
more quickly.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.410
We can respond to feature
requests.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.370
There's so much more data we
can expose to you now.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.830
And so we launched, I
think, with what was

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.250
more of a parity version.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.090
We wanted to have the same
features, capabilities as Docs

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.660
list, give or take.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.940
But now, we have the ability
that if there's another little

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.300
bit of information you need
from your Drive, from your

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.020
files, we have a lot easier
way to actually

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.560
bring that to you.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.925
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:20.550
And one of the examples that
John gave was the ability to

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.540
search much more interesting
parameters.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.360
And Docs list has some
search capabilities.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.170
But now, you can have the same
searching capabilities that

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.740
you have through the Drive API,
the one you use HTTP and

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.650
RESTful services for,
in App Script.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.230
So when you're asking for
questions on "Stack Overflow,"

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.720
there's a wider community of
developers that can support

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.809
you and help you.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:47.210
And like Eric said, when the
Drive team makes improvements

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.590
to their service, a lot of that
will now be available in

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.420
App Script in a more appropriate
timeframe.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.640
One thing I do want to make sure
is on the record is that

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.560
I mistakenly said during my
session that Docs list was

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.750
deprecated.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.090
It is not deprecated.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.310
It is still marked
as experimental.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.890
And we do recommend you go
to the new Drive App API.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.390
We think it's really easy
to convert your code.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.260
But if you're using Docs list,
it's not deprecated.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.310
So I apologize for
that confusion.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.655
And I know Eric, you caught up
on that right as I said it in

00:09:19.655 --> 00:09:20.305
my session.

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:20.740
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.680
We're not trying to make any
alarm bells go off, right?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.540
You don't need to start
rewriting all

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.970
your scripts today.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.910
If you're writing a new script,
I would really, really

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.300
strongly recommend you look to
the Drive App because I think

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.370
it's going to give you the
features you need, and maybe

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.370
even some features that you
didn't have before.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.150
But for now, everything you
wrote will continue to run.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yup.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.720
And I did add a little comment
in the video recording of the

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.170
I/O session that I was
wrong about that.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.330
So I apologize again
for that confusion.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.240
Great.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.780
So those are the new APIs
that we launched.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.160
We also improved some
existing stuff.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.290
So that the big one that I am
pretty excited about that

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.670
really enabled a lot of the cool
demos that we showed off

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.120
was the faster HTML service,
which comes via an

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.740
experimental flag around the
mode for the sandbox in which

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.820
your code runs, your
HTML code runs.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.510
And we call it ES5,
or ECMAScript 5.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.390
It basically enables
strict mode.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.620
And you do it through a set
sandbox code API call on top

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.210
of your HTML service output.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.840
And it's a really
straightforward one, easy to

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.450
find in the auto-complete.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.630
But we also have some
documentation we'll show you.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.390
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, and if you've
ever seen us on Apps

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.370
Unscripted before, every time
someone asks an HTML service

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.330
question or mentions a problem,
we usually throw out

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.600
the word "KAHA," right?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
the sandbox.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.950
ERIC KOLEDA: It's become kind
of almost a negative

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.170
connotation.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.535
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes.

00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:40.470
ERIC KOLEDA: But essentially,
the sandboxing, we want to

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.240
keep the user safe from
malicious code.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.160
What that usually means is that
we end up putting a lot

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.630
of chains around the code
that you write.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.380
So with this new sandbox method,
it relies much more on

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.520
native browser features.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.310
Which means that everything
runs faster.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.010
There's less restrictions.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.460
And generally, developing on
HTML services is a lot more

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.440
friendly now.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.670
So we have made it an
opt-in for now.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.530
We didn't want to force
it on people.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.650
But we do recommend if you
have a script, opt in.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.820
Just try it on your
development mode

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.890
for your web app.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.790
See if it's--

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.070
most cases I've seen, everything
still runs, and it

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.160
runs faster.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.110
And so I think they'll
really enjoy it.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah, and
it's required for some--

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.400
if you want to start playing
around with Bootstrap, for

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.290
instance, some of the layout
capabilities that that

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.070
provides, and the styling
capabilities.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.460
It's required for those
advanced APIs.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.420
And like Eric said, it actually
runs faster in most

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.650
of the scenarios I've done--

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.520
pretty much all scenarios
I've tested.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.730
So that's really exciting.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.320
Play with it.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.470
Let us know what works, what
issues you're still having.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.300
And we look forward to continue
to improve that and

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.180
providing you more options
on that front.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.500
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I guess we
should warn upfront that while

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.540
it does allow things like
Bootstrap and other frameworks

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.880
to work, we know already
it's not 100%.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.650
So we're really interested
in Angular.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.890
It's one of my favorite
JavaScript frameworks.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.360
And there's still some
problems there now.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.480
The team that's still
working on all the

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.300
sandboxing is on the ball.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.470
They know about this, and
they're working on it.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.790
But a lot more is possible.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.350
But just not everything.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yup,
yup, definitely.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.870
And we're pushing hard on it.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.980
The next one that's also
an improvement is the--

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.070
also experimental, I should
say-- is the improved

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.450
authorization flow.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.730
This is actually one of the
things that I've been turning

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.220
on in all my projects,
all my new projects.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.250
It basically gives you a really
nice, consolidated

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.480
authorization screen that the
users see, that you as the

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.340
developer see when you run it
for the first time from the

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.880
script editor, where you no
longer have to go through

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.840
potentially multiple pop-ups
that look different.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.100
And also, you don't have to
run your script again if

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.390
you're from the script editor.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.280
I think you enable this
by going File, Enable,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.760
Authorization, and New
Authorization Mode, or

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.220
something like that.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.390
I forget exactly what that is.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.500
Upgrade Authorization
Experience is the

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.720
menu option we use.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.990
So under File, Upgrade
Authorization Experience.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.690
We highly recommend you test it
out in your test projects.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.400
But it's one of those things
that I think makes your user

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.090
more comfortable
with your app.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.260
It looks like the other
authorizations screens that

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.810
they see potentially with Chrome
Apps, and Drive Apps,

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.510
other general OAuth2-looking
screens.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.830
It's a consolidated set of
scopes that we ask for on

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.880
behalf of you without you having
to work on those scope

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.870
declarations actively.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.940
And I just think it
looks a lot nicer.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.240
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I was going
to say, we have some really

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.080
great engineers.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.620
They do not really
fit the bill of

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.800
a UI designer sometimes.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.910
So the orange, the red box
around the warning panel.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.130
Sometimes it's green, or
sometimes it's yellow.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.980
It's Times New Roman.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.600
It's not exactly the
most appealing.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.730
And so I know in the past, the
language, and the colors, and

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.420
the look have scared
some users off.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.140
So this new flow goes through
standard Google

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.590
authorization dialogues.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.550
And so it looks very,
very familiar.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.430
Very clean, very appropriate.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.410
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And another
thing I like about it is that

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.395
you, as a developer, your email
address is not exposed.

00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:01.230
So it's actually
a subtle thing.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.270
But in the previous
authorization screen, it would

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.220
say, last edited by, or owned
by, and the two email

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.820
addresses, if not the same,
will also be exposed.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.320
And with the new OAuth 2 screen,
all it says is what

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.400
the project name is, and what
scopes it's requesting for.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.270
And I think that's a lot nicer
for everyone involved rather

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.890
than just seeing some gmail.com
address I think.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.360
So yeah, so little, subtle
things that I think helps both

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.220
end users and the developers.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.840
So that's one of the things
that's really nice.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.210
The other thing is that it
actually creates a developer

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.520
console project for you.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:34.720
ERIC KOLEDA: Right.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.220
I was going to throw
it out there.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.480
So you don't need a
developer console

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.760
project to use App Script.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.770
But some of our advanced
services, we have a URL

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.840
Shortener service, an Analytic
service, an AdSense service.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.450
To enable those advanced
services, you do

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.320
need to have a project.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.070
So previously, we'd advise you
to go to this other URL, and

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.100
set up a project.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.060
Now, we are automatically
creating a project for you

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.490
just when you create
the script.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.240
So there's still a little bit
of setup where you need to

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.690
toggle on and agree to some
terms and conditions.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.930
But it cuts down the setup a
lot, and that's what allows

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.420
you to hide the email
addresses.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.900
We're using the name of that
console project in order to do

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.910
the authorization screens.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.380
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.070
And this kind of bridges
the gap from you

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.010
now have the script.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.070
But now, you're a professional
developer.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.870
Or you brought in a professional
developer.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.190
And you want to take advantage
of these other Google APIs and

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.640
services and all of the cool
things that you get from the

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.820
API console.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.520
You're able to now bridge that
gap from this script editor

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.610
itself, which I think
is great.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.130
So pretty good list of things.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.990
So yeah, we're pretty excited
about it, as you can tell.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.540
And I think we showed off all
of these in some form or

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.210
another at Google I/O. And we're
really excited to take

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.880
this further.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.760
And I think what we want the
most is your feedback.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.410
And I want to make sure you like
what we delivered, and

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.120
what we can improve,
and what are some

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.800
of the things missing?

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.770
And we're really looking
forward to

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:51.660
a lot of that feedback.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.050
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, definitely.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.850
And we haven't stopped,
either.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.680
We're still chugging ahead.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.395
After we got back from I/O, all
the engineers went right

00:15:58.395 --> 00:15:59.660
back to work working
on new features.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.462
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I don't think
anyone took a day off.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.750
ERIC KOLEDA: So even with all
these launches, we know

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.170
there's still so much
more people want.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.550
And even just, people have
already asked for, where can I

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.520
get the sidebar in
my Spreadsheet?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.770
And so Jonathan is hard on the
case of making that happen.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yup.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.570
There's a lot of things that
we can continue to improve.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.660
But yeah, what would really
encourage us is to see what

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.780
you're building and the use
cases that you are not able to

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.750
achieve because this small
API is missing.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.980
So keep sending that positive
feedback or constructive

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.705
feedback over.

00:16:30.705 --> 00:16:33.250
And we're looking forward
to working and

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.300
delivering on those.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.760
Great, so those are
the features.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.310
Now, let's talk a little bit
about what we did at I/O

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.430
specifically.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.970
So we had four sessions.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.240
Which is I think--

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.510
ERIC KOLEDA: I think it's
the most we've ever had.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.010
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Most we've ever
had, so really exciting.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.540
Three of them in the Chrome
and Apps track, and one of

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.180
them in the YouTube track.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.180
So do you want to start off with
the two that you're most

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.890
familiar with, the Forms one,
which you delivered, and the

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.270
Scripts and Google Docs?

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:57.510
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:59.150
So I mentioned the Forms
earlier when we

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.190
talked about Forms.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.700
Me and Matt, we presented
on Forms.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.089
Kind of just a good overview
of what it means to be

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:10.349
integrated into Forms, how the
format works, some brief

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.770
sample code to give
you a feel of it.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.130
And then, going into a little
bit about why it's useful.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.940
We talked a lot about
mini-workflows.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.349
The idea that there's some work
you have to do in your

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.910
organization that's kind of
just pushing data around.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.079
And why have a human push data
when computers can do it?

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.190
So we really think having Forms
plus scripting allows

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.810
you to get people out of the
picture, solve these problems.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.350
So the demo that we showed
off, which I thought was

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.800
really cool, was around
educators.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.020
So it was the idea of a
quick quiz creator.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.060
I think you did a quiz
script also.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.890
Completely code centered.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.750
ERIC KOLEDA: Very popular
use case.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.070
And also makes great demos.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.280
So our quiz creator allowed you
to spin up a form really

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.040
quickly, email it to students,
and then live see their

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.910
responses that trickle in.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.550
So we have that video up.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.075
Actually, all of the
videos are up now.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:55.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.190
ERIC KOLEDA: So for anything we
talk about here, you can go

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.880
watch the full video
afterwards.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.790
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's right.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.010
ERIC KOLEDA: And then, I think
the other one is--

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.990
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Scripts
and Google Docs.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.130
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, the Google
Docs presentation.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.310
So that was by our
PM, Saurabh.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.310
And also co-presenting
with Jonathan.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.660
And their presentation was
focused around Bibstro.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.510
Bibstro is a script that they
built that I guess is a

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:21.270
bibliography management sidebar
app for Google Docs

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.810
that was conceived
in a bistro.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.310
Thus, bibstro.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.970
And they kind of talked you
through how they built it, the

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.010
technologies they used.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.840
And I think it showed off
all the different parts.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.430
They manipulated a doc.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.400
They read a doc.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.460
They showed a sidebar.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.680
They had a menu item.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.950
They really took you through
the full suite of

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.700
functionality.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.550
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah,
that was one of the

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.200
live streamed events.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.100
And I actually had to watch
it live because

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.016
the room was so packed.

00:18:44.016 --> 00:18:45.970
And I needed some alone time.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.000
But the live stream, I
thought it was just

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.350
such a packed event.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.760
There was just so
much content.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.070
The demo itself was awesome.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.940
But then, they walked through so
much detail about the DOM,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.250
or the document object model,
for Google Docs.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:04.090
The APIs, various APIs to get at
modify all the good stuff,

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.220
and how the sidebar and the
menus were injected itself.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.790
So I'd highly recommend you
check out the videos.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.110
And it's a reason why
we record them.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.210
We think even if you were there
or you watch it live, I

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.310
think some of these videos are
worth checking out a couple of

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.510
times because we really do
pack in a lot of content.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.800
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, totally.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.820
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So the other two
sessions, both of them I

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.690
guess I ran.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.070
I'll talk first about the
one in Chrome and Apps.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.380
So this one was all about
Google Drive.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.260
How you can have a Google Apps
Script developed app available

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.480
in the Google Drive UI in the
Create menu, and then have

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.470
your app invoked when
you click on a file.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.440
That's the first part about
integrating into the

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.640
Google Drive UI.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.190
And second part was all about
accessing the files in drive

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.160
from App Script.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.490
So again, we kind of told a
story through an example,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:57.210
through a demo that involved a
teacher publishing a Google

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.390
Docs based quiz out to a
lot of the students.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.280
So there's a roster of student
email addresses and a template

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.310
quiz that has, let's say,
five or six questions.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.840
The teacher's able to take the
set of student emails, and

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.650
then assign each student a
copy of that quiz that's

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.460
shared with only the right
person automatically.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.610
And then, at the end of the
deadline, the teacher's able

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.470
to take away the edit rights
from the student and then only

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.410
make them a viewer.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.020
So that was kind of a story
around publishing

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.010
and closing a quiz.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.470
And then, all about all the
different APIs were on

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.220
creating documents, managing
permissions,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.080
all that good stuff.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.920
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, it's
funny because--

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.270
when I was working on the quiz
script in Forms, I originally

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.720
tried to do a version where
it was free form answer.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.740
But then, there was no
way to score it.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.840
I feel almost like we have
complimentary quiz scripts.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.405
I could make a multiple
choice form.

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:52.150
And blast that out.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.270
And then, you could do an--

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Essay form.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.680
ERIC KOLEDA: An essay form.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.200
And then, they can collect all
of those, and review them.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.770
If you're a teacher, a great
time to be a Google Apps user.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.740
So that was really a
nice set of demos.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.530
And John kind of talked through
some of the new APIs

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.990
including the set owner feature
that we added, and the

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.170
ability to restrict
a Doc from being

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.140
forwarded to other people.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.470
So only the editor can
change permissions.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.310
So previously, this was
something that you couldn't do

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.620
through the Docs
API, I believe.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.170
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.090
Sometimes, you know, there's
just one extra checkbox, or

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.310
one extra method that we add.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.610
But then I forget that
sometimes, that can completely

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.380
make or break a use case.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.720
Like having sometimes a student
be able to share

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.800
something out to the world
with their friends, that

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.840
completely breaks the system.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.010
So these things are small, but
sometimes really important.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.300
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.670
And again goes back to more
of the parity with the

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.470
UI and the API there.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.860
So that was really
a nice session.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.340
And then, the other session I
did was actually out of the

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.200
Chrome and Apps track.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.460
It was with a new set
of developers.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.020
Hello, all, if you're watching,
YouTube developers.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.540
And it was all about YouTube,
we recently announced, a

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.460
billion unique monthly viewers,
which is crazy.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.380
That's a big number,
unique monthly

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.970
viewers, a billion people.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:09.350
I was blown away
by that figure.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.850
But those people, they're
producing a lot of analytics.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.240
And as content creators, you
want to be able to manage

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.180
them, a better interface to
look at that data and make

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.270
meaning out of it.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.440
And you don't want to
necessarily write a whole

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.120
separate app for that.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.860
And what we came up with was
using App Script to pull the

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.980
data from the Google Analytics
API into a spreadsheet with a

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.630
set of focused scenarios around,
I just want to chart

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.700
this particular dimension and
metric data that's available.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.440
Or I want to look at this data
in a geospatial map.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.260
Or I want to be able to automate
something, and

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.040
integrate something with maybe
Twitter analytics data,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.780
something like that.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.500
So those are just setting up a
bunch of scenarios and give

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.380
them some starter code.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.000
And it was actually pretty
well received.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.860
And a whole bunch of developers
that had never

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.940
heard about App Script
now know it exists.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.090
And they were all really excited
because their business

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:04.580
users, who are nontechnical
people, now have potentially a

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.200
tool that works in a spreadsheet
that they're

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.300
comfortable, that they don't
have to know all the coding

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.280
terminology around.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.510
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, I used to
think of a spreadsheet as a

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.190
way to store data.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.470
I've come to think of it almost
like a UI builder.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: A simple
application layer.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.420
ERIC KOLEDA: It's a read-write
layer around data, as well as

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.536
an extra tools for charting
and things like that.

00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:26.184
So when you want to spin up
something quickly, you don't

00:23:26.184 --> 00:23:27.810
want to invest a lot of
resources and building a

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.870
custom app, dumping into a
spreadsheet, and manipulating,

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.420
saving, updating, graphing,
doing it all there lowers the

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.090
barrier to entry.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.820
Where you could get something
up in a day, hand it to

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.530
business folks.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.050
And then, they can actually
start getting value from it

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.510
immediately.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.460
It doesn't take a whole cycle
of design, development,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.850
review, deployment.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.760
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.710
So I think those are some of
the things at I/O. Very

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.010
quickly, I'll also mention some
really good partners that

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:53.860
were there.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.830
Avery Dennison showed off how
you could take a Spreadsheet

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.530
and then be able to do an
envelope merge out of it.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.290
We had Hello Fax shown
off, faxing services

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.060
from a Google Doc.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.790
DocuSign showing off e-signature
services, and Turn

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.210
It In showing the ability to
take an assignment and submit

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.970
it from within Google Docs.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.050
So thanks for those partners,
and a few others that were

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.150
there showing off some really
really cool stuff.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.720
Very quickly, I'll show of where
you can find the videos.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.150
So we have a playlist here on
the screen that shows off all

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.980
the different videos
from Google I/O

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.350
2013 with App Script.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.940
And you can find them from our
home screen if you just go to

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.720
the bottom right corner.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.490
There's a playlist that
you can see to

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.210
catch up on older episodes.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.280
Very easy to find.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.200
Highly recommend watching the
four episodes, four sessions

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.290
if you haven't seen
them already.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.770
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, it's great.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Speaking of
documentation, a couple of

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.110
pretty exciting things that our
tech writer Dan launched

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.740
right before.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.260
In all of these launches, we
did so much launches that

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.790
sometimes those little
things got lost.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.710
But I think they're
really great.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.750
So in addition to just all
this new reference

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.190
documentation around Form App,
and Drive App, and all the new

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.770
things in Documents, we all
published some other great

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:01.330
documentation.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.740
Some of it is related to these
new launches, and some isn't.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.690
So at the top of your
screen here, we have

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.190
some new quick starts.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.970
So our goal was to have
more of these five

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:10.690
minute quick starts.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.220
So that if you're new to
scripting, really quickly you

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.330
can see the power, get
some sample code,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.700
start playing around.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.890
So we have one focused on
Spreadsheets, which is using

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.020
some of the technology that's
been around for a while.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.910
And then, another one focused
more on Forms, but also its

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.650
integration with Calendar,
Docs, and email.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.250
And so it really takes you
through a pretty real life use

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.402
case, although it's a conference
for monsters where

00:25:32.402 --> 00:25:34.240
they have the most
real real life.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.660
But certainly, if you replaced
monsters with something more

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.020
boring, it would seem
appropriate.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.800
We also have then some new
user guides, one for HTML

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.560
service, which we're
highlighting here.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.030
So you mentioned that the HTML
service, we added some new

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.030
sandboxing capabilities.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.800
But we also realized that it was
a bit hard to get started.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.540
There was so much text,
so much documentation.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.090
And so tech writer Dan did an
amazing job of reorganizing

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.300
it, making it clear, doing
a lot of work.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.650
He also separated it out
into concrete sections.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.630
So it's the kind of thing you're
not going to probably

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:07.360
read it every day.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.620
But if you give it a read
through, or if you come back

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.290
and reference it as you're
developing, it's a really

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.590
great tool for that.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.160
And then, the other one is for
Google Docs, since we always

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.600
had this Document app, but we
didn't ever give you a ton of

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.790
information about how a doc
is laid out, and how you

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.850
manipulate it.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.380
We put together, or Dan did,
this guide that shows you the

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.780
structure of a Google Doc, what
parts are manipulatable,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.200
what parts are read only, as
well as a whole bunch of other

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.510
extra information about common
tasks, like replacing text.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:37.570
So if you want to start getting
more into Docs, doing

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.590
more doc manipulation, more
reading and writing, this is

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.240
also a great resource.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.890
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.150
Ton of really good stuff.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.240
All right, I think we are
actually running low on time,

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.530
which is crazy.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.025
Too much talking.

00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:50.020
Let's go to questions?

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:50.780
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, do
we have anybody in

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.010
the Hangout, I wonder?

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.050
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Any
live questions?

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.090
ERIC KOLEDA: Oh,
I see someone.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.330
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hi.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.260
AUDIENCE: First, I'm [? Linni ?]
from Louisiana.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.850
First, I'd just like to give
you all kudos, man.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.070
I am not a programmer.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:08.090
And the work I've done with
our company has completely

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.590
changed our operation through
using App Script and Google

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.100
and all of that stuff.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.750
So first off, kudos.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.170
AUDIENCE: I always have a ton
of questions, but I figured

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.010
just ask you all one.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:25.680
Is maybe a best practice
scenario on pulling data in

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.240
before loading it
into the HTML.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.205
So like, I've written a couple
of the HTML stuff, and they go

00:27:31.205 --> 00:27:33.290
to a spreadsheet to get
the information.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.450
And I think that's where a lot
of the slowdown is obviously.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.340
Is there a best practice
on doing that?

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.220
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah,
that's good.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.730
So definitely, spreadsheet
reading can be slow,

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:47.040
especially if you do it like
get range, get value, get

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.180
range, get value, get
range, get value.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.730
If you get a whole giant range
at once and get all the values

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.640
at once, it can be
a lot faster.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.920
But even then, it's not a high
throughput data store.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.990
It's not meant to do a ton of
reads and writes with a lot of

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.490
efficiency.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:01.270
It's more--

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.900
spreadsheets are based around
user friendliness, not around

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.220
speed optimization.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.100
So if you're trying to throw
some content from a

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.766
spreadsheet into a UI, it
definitely helps to fetch it

00:28:10.766 --> 00:28:14.350
all at once, and then hand
if off to your UI.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.180
Or you may want to look into
other things, like using our

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.890
caching layer with a Cache
Service to perhaps, if you

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.550
know your spreadsheet data's not
going to change during the

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.240
course that the script is
running, maybe throw the data

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.000
into the cache.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.590
And then access it via
the cache later.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.050
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.680
So I think that's the two
high-level bullets that are

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.180
really important, I want to
repeat are, try to get big

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.090
chunks at once.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.680
And then, process in memory.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.570
And then, also use the caching
service so that maybe if your

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.210
spreadsheet's not updating
more than once every two

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.730
minutes, put it in the cache
for 15, 20 minutes or

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.960
something like that.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.870
All right, let me go to the
moderator here really quickly

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.615
because there are some really
good questions in there that

00:28:50.615 --> 00:28:52.720
I'll skip through here.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:58.000
So the first question was
around, any more background to

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.320
the statement, to plan for the
future, we recommend you

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.960
migrate to HTML services?

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.730
I think that statement's
still true.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.500
But we will continue to invest
more in HTML service.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.630
You saw what we added with the
new sandbox capability.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.580
We hope to have better
documentation.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.970
You saw what Dan has done
with the new API guides.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.600
UI App is not deprecated.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.710
UI GUI Builder was.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.660
So UI App will still
be around.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.820
So if you have new apps, we
highly recommend using HTML

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.970
service because that's where
we're investing the energy.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.980
But UI App is still there.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.090
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.290
If you've seen some of the demos
that maybe we showed off

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:37.490
during Google IO this year in
our sessions, some of those

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.140
things just could not
be built via UI App.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.730
So really, we think that HTML
service requires a little bit

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.850
more work, and we're working
on making it so that the

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.540
ramp-up time isn't
quite as hard.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.550
And hopefully, it'll be easier
and easier to use.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.600
But we do think that the
power it unlocks makes

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.330
it worth the effort.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:54.650
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yup.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.385
And we'll work on ways to
have transition guides.

00:29:58.385 --> 00:30:01.950
We'll keep working on that
informally as well.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.890
So some other things around, the
next question's about not

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.160
getting the same options in get
events versus get events

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.900
by series ID.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.620
It is a known limitation
at this point.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.470
We're investigating,
I should say.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.910
Moving to a new Calendar API.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.670
There's some new options
available to

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.790
us in the back end.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.580
So we were going to
investigate that.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.350
And hopefully that will enable
some of these new APIs.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.950
Nothing to announce at this
point, but point taken.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.602
And the next one's actually
one of my favorites.

00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:38.090
The error messages today are not
so helpful, this gentleman

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:42.940
or lady writes here, around when
something wrong happens,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.280
something bad happens.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.560
So there are a couple
things you can do.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.820
In your code itself, you can do
a better job of having some

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.140
more try catches, especially
in the hot areas where, if

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.080
you're doing a lot of file
writes, maybe try to have that

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.420
on try-catch so you know
what is failing.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.550
So the try-catch works.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.810
It's just standard JavaScript.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.460
So that's a really good
way to do it.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.190
And besides that, we know we
have some work to do as well.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.060
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, part
of it is that--

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.170
one day, one of our lead
engineers drew a system

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.070
diagram of how App
Script works.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.990
And the number of boxes and
systems on the whiteboard that

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.950
day was overwhelming.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.770
So we connect to so
many systems.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.230
And if one of them has an
unfortunate outage for a

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.960
little bit of time,
we get an error.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.280
Now, if we gave you that
message, that message doesn't

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.560
provide you any meaning.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.050
It's some internal message
about an internal system.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.680
So a lot of times, we
just wrap it all

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.580
up in server error.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.060
I know that feels really
frustrating.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.230
Like, why does everything
say server error?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.980
That's not telling
me anything.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.540
But whatever we told you would
be just as meaningless, the

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.750
random back end name of
some tool we use?

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.600
It's not going to give you
the information you need.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.620
And a lot of times if it's a
server error, we're saying

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.300
it's our fault.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.380
We're sorry.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.435
But it's not probably
a mistake that

00:31:48.435 --> 00:31:49.350
you're making in code.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.000
So I think you're spot on.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.100
You can identify what portion
of your code is

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.940
throwing that error.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.440
So perhaps you could work around
that for the time being

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.060
or take it out of your flow.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.710
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And
there might be

00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:59.710
an issue you identify.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.550
And that'll be really helpful
to us when you log it in the

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.030
issue tracker if you can isolate
the area that is

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.870
potentially throwing an error.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:10.520
So if you're weaving Drive calls
with Calendar calls with

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.420
Translate calls, there
might be certain

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.220
things that may break.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.000
But if you're writing your code
in a way such that you're

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.100
able to trap that yourself,
that'll really help us and I

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.540
think yourselves as well.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.630
Next question, any plans on
integrated HTML GUI Builder?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.910
As of now, no plans.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:32.090
Our goal is to support
the most popular HTML

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.980
capabilities.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.020
So there are plenty of
other really good GUI

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.150
builders out there.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.380
Our hope is that by supporting
the standard, you're able to

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.420
bring your own tools and use
what you're already familiar

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.210
with or is your favorite.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:46.080
Would you agree?

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.310
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, spot on.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:50.280
I think we're thinking that App
Script, our real power,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.350
what people love about App
Script is the ability to go

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.280
right to your Gmail, right
to your Calendar, right?

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.980
So we're putting more
of our efforts into

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.170
doing what we do best.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.890
And we think that there's so
much evolution in the web, in

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.930
design, in UIs.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.530
Let's use the best of what's out
there, and bring that into

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:07.460
App Script, rather than for us
to invent another builder.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.480
And then, it be some new way
you have to learn how to do

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.220
things, right?

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.910
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So in other
words, we want to invest in

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.110
making sure there's no server
error messages moreso than an

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.790
integrated GUI builder.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.620
There are a lot of other
good tools out there.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.700
ERIC KOLEDA: Do we want to
maybe check back to the

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.140
Hangout in case there's
someone else live?

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.480
I don't want to leave
them hanging.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.210
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Anyone
else live on the

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.140
Hangout with any questions?

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.070
Any questions so far?

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.820
OK, great.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.080
Let's go down the list.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.720
Quite a set of interesting
questions here.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.160
Next one's around the data
validation API, which was

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.680
available briefly, and then
killed a few weeks before I/O.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.530
I wouldn't say it's killed.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.710
So as you could probably imagine
from that, we're still

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.400
working on it.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.540
And keep an eye out.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.190
It's something that
we're looking on.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.130
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah, people have
been asking for data

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.240
validation features
in the Spreadsheet

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.730
app for a long time.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.130
And so this is a hint that
there's something cooking.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.870
Unfortunately, it got thrown out
there a little too early.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.590
And so, we had to
reel it back in.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.790
But I think just keep
your eyes out.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.456
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Sounds good.

00:34:06.456 --> 00:34:08.550
All right, let me see the next
one here is about being able

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.219
to pin content directly
to the sidebar.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.150
So once a sidebar is displayed,
there's no good way

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.219
to add content to the sidebar.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.330
So you can either have the
sidebar itself aware of where

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.860
to get the content from and
using HTML or JavaScript to

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.670
append content to it.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:28.400
Or you can have a reference to
what is displayed manually, as

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.830
this question indicates.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.580
And then update it.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.190
And then, we show the sidebar.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:36.389
As of now, there's no good API
to append or update an already

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:37.699
open sidebar.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.050
ERIC KOLEDA: And I think that's
part of maybe the

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.530
difference in flow between the
UI App world and the HTML

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.290
service world.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.300
In the UI App, your server
code would do some

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.860
manipulations and then throw a
new version out there to you.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.230
Return, and then
update an app.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.139
In HTML service, what we want
you to do is rather than your

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.050
server throwing code to the
client, the client has

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:57.860
JavaScript on it that uses
Google Script Run to reach

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.280
back to the server, pull out a
fresh copy of the data, and

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.160
display it.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.990
And so we're working on making
it so that hopefully someday,

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.480
you won't have to do polling
and possibly keep checking

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.040
your back end.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.850
But for now, it's a really
powerful way to have a really

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.200
responsive UI, too, right?

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.800
Because UI App, you had to
wait for the back end.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.730
Now, you can do nice,
little spinners.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.460
People love spinners, and
always had problems with

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.470
spinners in UI App.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And timers.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.190
ERIC KOLEDA: Timers.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.060
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So you can say,
every five seconds, check

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.580
for something.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.420
Those things aren't possible
in UI App.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.180
All right, let's see here.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.770
Next question is, any way to get
the footer of a document

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.110
so I can remove page numbers
from the first page?

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.045
Or are all footers linked
into a single template?

00:35:36.045 --> 00:35:36.840
That's a good question.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.540
Do you know the answer
to this?

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.930
ERIC KOLEDA: Well, I do know
that in the model, and I think

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.240
if we have the model up there
still on the document guide,

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.110
there is a difference between
the body, the

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.325
header, and the footer.

00:35:46.325 --> 00:35:47.630
Unfortunately, I haven't
played with

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.050
the footer that much.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.990
So I don't know if things like
page numbers, you can get to

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.930
them or remove them.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.590
Certainly, I can see
why it'd be useful.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.170
So if you find something missing
here, please feel free

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.650
to log a feature requests
on our issue tracker.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.720
Next one, two quick ones
here, being able to

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.790
access table of contents.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.300
I don't think that's
possible today.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.560
ERIC KOLEDA: I think you can
read them, read their

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.680
existence, but not exactly
the list inside of it.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.970
And I don't think you
can edit them today.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.040
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Again, if
there's really good use cases,

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.630
please put it on the
issue tracker.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.180
ERIC KOLEDA: I think what we're
going to see is that now

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.870
you can put scripts directly
into a doc, people are going

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:25.540
to be exploring the doc a lot
more deeply than ever before.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.650
A lot of times, people would
just dump a couple paragraphs

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.310
in there, then email
it to somebody.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.680
I think people are going to get
a lot more fine grained.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.440
And so we know that you're
probably going to dust off

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.720
some areas that we didn't
quite nail it down.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.070
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Right.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.620
Could I create a concept form
through Google Forms with the

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.370
App Script HTML service or

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.300
dynamically show next questions?

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.360
So Google Forms has
its own set of UI.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.190
So you cannot actually use
Google Forms with HTML service

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.590
like this question describes.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.950
They're separate technologies.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.000
ERIC KOLEDA: If I'm reading
that one correctly, it's

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.620
something that may
be possible.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.110
And actually, I think Matt the
engineer has even thought

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.080
about it or tried it out once,
which is to build a form in

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.330
Google Forms, then not actually
show it via Google

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.640
Forms, but read its data out,
and then display an equivalent

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.720
form via HTML service.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.360
So kind of like using the Forms
Designer, but not the

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.055
Forms Displayer.

00:37:20.055 --> 00:37:21.960
So it's pretty on the edge.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.650
I would not say this is
something that we've tried a

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.610
lot or we think we recommend
that you could do it, and it

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.680
would be fully successful.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.310
There may be some
issues there.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.670
But I guess the idea is you
could design a form by the

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.110
designer, and that just
gives you some model.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.490
And then, you can do whatever
you want with that model.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.150
You could display it as HTML.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.020
You could put it into any
format you want to.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.510
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.710
We really should wrap up here.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.830
We've gone over time.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.750
Lot of good questions.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.090
We had a lot of content.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.570
So I apologize for going
over by a little bit.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.510
Let you guys get back to work,
or sleep, or breakfast,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.650
whichever time zone you're
watching us from.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.930
Thank you very much
for joining.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.650
Thank you for the questions.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.830
And thank you for all the
support around IO.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.230
We're super excited to see what
you can do with these new

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.590
APIs and services.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:00.880
ERIC KOLEDA: Yeah.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.440
That was great.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.830
And we'll see you for
future episodes of

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.740
Google Developers Live.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.240
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thanks.
