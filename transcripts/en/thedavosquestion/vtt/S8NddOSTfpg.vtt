JOHN HOPE BRYANT &gt;&gt; Hi, this is John Hope
Bryant. I'm the founder of Operation Hope

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
and the Vice-Chairman of the U.S. President's
Council on Financial Literacy. I have had

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.920
the honor or advising President Clinton, President
Bush and now I'm serving President Obama as

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.080
Vice-Chairman into 2010.
So I've watched your video, 'creativescientist,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.190
on moral currency. And I'm only speaking for
myself here now-make that clear-I'm speaking

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.840
as an individual. But-ah-I was inspired-ah-ah-by
your concept. I think it may be complicated

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.460
in the elegant way in which you outline it
for it to be implemented. Although I think

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.489
that a version of it is implemented already.
It's called the failure of Countrywide. [LAUGHTER]

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.600
It's called the failure of Enron. In other
words the market has already paid a tax-ah-on

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:02.110
unscrupulous-ah-companies that have-ah-ah-economically
raped and pillaged consumers. When the only

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.330
equation is an economic equation, when there
is only an-a financial agenda-a money agenda

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.090
and not a prosperity agenda, an ideas agenda-ah-an
empowerment agenda, a service agenda; when

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.880
don't live for something larger or more important
than yourself-ah-ah-well, you go far enough

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.000
to the North Pole you end up south. You out-you
just outrun your course.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
Ah-I think there's also another moral currency.
It's called financial literacy. Ah-one of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
the things that I believe will happen-ah-as
a result of this crisis-well, one thing that's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.659
happened is it's got people like you exercised.
And-ah-and we're having really a crisis of

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.400
values in the U.S. and around the world because
we put all our stock in things. And, as you

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.340
said, we didn't value-ah-if we look at some
of the gangster rap on TV, they glorify a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.240
dollar whether it's made sellin' crack-ah-I
mean the Rolls Royce is bought by the same

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.470
dollar whether it's crack or whether you're
a scientist. Ah-no pun intended. Ah-ah-and

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.570
I think that in the last twenty years my friend,
Quincy Jones, says we've made dumb sexy. Think

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.409
about that for a minute. We've dumbed down.
We-ah-our communities, our kids have really

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:16.730
almost adopted a thug culture. It's laziness.
Ah-and it's just-you know-ah-how do I get

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.760
paid today? So in the last twenty years we've
made dumb sexy.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.209
In the next twenty years we need to make smart
sexy again. So we need to flip the script.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.959
Financial literacy is a way to flip the script,
but it wasn't important before. But with this

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.700
global economic crisis everybody understands
the difference between a payment and an interest

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.901
rate. The problem is that people didn't ask
what the payment was or the interest rate

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:42.859
was. They bought homes from-sometimes-from
unscrupulous predatory lenders and then asked

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.999
only what the payment was. So we weren't taken
advantage of but we participated in that.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.059
We contributed in that. And so we need to
have a new civil right. And that's financial

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.669
literacy for all.
We need to have a new silver right, ah-a bank

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.569
account for every person. Ah-put the payday
lenders and the check cashers and the unscrupulous

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.299
ah-financial predators who ghetto-ize financial
services-run 'em out of business. Ah-using

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.281
free enterprise and capitalism give every
person an electronic FDIC insured bank account.

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:19.010
Ah-and stream-ah-the payments from the treasury
for social security and other payments through

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.779
that bank account. Ah-stream financial literacy
through that bank account, and literally put

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.749
the unscrupulous-ah-financial predators out
of a ten-billion-dollar-a-year business.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:34.439
Ah-so you have a choice to make. In other
words it's not just the government. Your moral-ah-your

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.309
moral currency argument-ah-it was placed,
or at least I framed it-or I heard it, as

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.809
almost irresponsible government. The question
is what can you do. There is only so much

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.479
that President Obama is going to be able to
do. There is only so much that any government

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.999
is going to be able to do. But-ah-Ghandi once
said that you can be the-the change you want

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.089
to see in the world. You can make a choice.
You can make a choice not to do business with

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:59.229
predators-ah-and to honor companies that honor
you and your community. Their code is-ah-do

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.189
well and do good, ah-who are concerned about
their brand and their reputation.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.439
Ah-I guess the last point I'll make is we've
got a massive, massive pullback in consumer

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:14.769
confidence. Well, that's also tied to financial
illiteracy. Ah-and so companies have to realize

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.889
that they have to be concerned about ah-ah-not
just the transaction but the long-term relationship.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.310
If we treat our clients like relationships
and not just as transactions-ah-you don't

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.789
do business with a day, you do business for
a lifetime and that's doing well by doing

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.889
good.
I commend you for your concept of moral currency

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.810
and I encourage you to go out and teach a
class in financial literacy today in your

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.800
community or join Operation Hope and become
a Hope Club member because you're certainly

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800
qualified. God bless you from Davos and thanks
for your passion.
