JUDY SINGER: I'm Judy Singer.

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:09.050
I'm the Senior Vice Provost
for Faculty Development

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.860
and Diversity and I want to
welcome you all to this event

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.630
on how to write
an Op-Ed, getting

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.890
your voice into the news media.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.550
I want to just make
a few framing remarks

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.000
before turning it over to the
moderator of this panel, Ann

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.810
Marie Lipinski.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.940
And in thinking about how
to help the faculty get

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.580
their voice out into the world,
we've done a number of events

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.280
and this one happens to be the
second time we've done this--

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.170
it's particularly popular.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.440
And when we planned
this event, we

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.980
were thinking that there are
people on the faculty who

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.900
are interested in
figuring out how

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.970
to reach a broader audience.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.450
But I think the events
of the last month

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.750
have really called to task the
need for people in academia,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.820
now more than ever, to
get their voices out,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.280
regardless of where
they fall in the debate.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.010
I think there's
just a need for us

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.130
to take the time that we
have spent in dedicating

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.950
our lives to the study
of particular subjects

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.740
to think about speaking, not
just to our colleagues, which

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.720
is what we do as our
bread and butter,

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.150
but to a broader audience.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.480
And people in the room
have a lot to offer.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm particularly
pleased with the breadth

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.740
of people who are here.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.250
We have people from various
different schools at Harvard,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.050
various different disciplines.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.344
We run the gamut
from, oftentimes,

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:37.760
we get arts and humanities and
social science people here.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.330
We have science people, law,
business, public health--

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.400
range of fields--

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.330
and I think that's,
actually, terrific

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.420
because it represents the riches
that Harvard has to offer,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.460
but also the kinds of voices
that the folks who are up here

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.705
are interested in hearing
from because you might not

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:56.330
meet some of these
people in the course

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.190
of your everyday business.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.730
The Op-Ed forum is
particularly interesting

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.530
because it's a short form.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.720
We're used to writing
in longer form

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.940
and I think one of
the things that you'll

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.759
hear from the panelists
is how to help

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.340
think about moving
from the long form

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.420
that we're comfortable
being with whether it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.790
an article which you don't
think of as a long form,

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.700
but to these people,
that's a long form,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.651
or even teaching a
class or a seminar

00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:26.150
where you've got
an hour, two hours,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.020
three hours to give your views
versus 90 seconds on the radio.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.090
So the short form, I think,
is particularly attractive

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.180
and in thinking about how to
take the work that we produce

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.490
and make it more
accessible to people,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.250
but also for people
who are writing a book,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.140
one of my first pieces of
advice is why don't you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.510
start with an Op-Ed because a
book is a very long commitment

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.970
and an Op-Ed is something
that's much more achievable

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.660
and I think that's some
of what you'll hear today.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.570
The third part of
thinking about this event

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.600
is that it's actually quite
instrumental in nature.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.170
Our panelists are very
interested in establishing

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.050
relationships with
members of our faculty

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.720
who do have something to
say about issues of the day

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.080
or other kinds of topics that
would have a broader audience.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.510
And I'm going to
end with an anecdote

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.740
that at the end of the event
that we did two years ago,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.290
one of the people in the room,
who was a first year assistant

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.070
professor, went up
to Trish Hall who

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.340
was Jim Dao's predecessor
at the New York Times

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.020
and pitched an idea.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.110
And three weeks later,
she had the lead Op-Ed

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.880
in the New York Times.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.170
So that gave me great pleasure
to see the kind of instrumental

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.950
nature of that.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.000
So I'm hoping for a
repeat and maybe a repeat

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.100
across some other news outlets.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780
So with those
framing remarks, I am

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.780
going to turn the
moderator role over

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.606
to Ann Marie Lipinski who
is the curator of the Nieman

00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.230
Foundation for Journalism, which
is here at Harvard University.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.960
It's a wonderful resource that
we have here and, in fact,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.270
there are lots of
journalists at Nieman

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.580
who potentially could
also be helpful as you're

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.350
thinking about this role.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.540
She also, before
she came to Harvard,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.630
was the editor in chief
of the Chicago Tribune

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.680
and is a Pulitzer
Prize winner herself.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.790
So she has been both
in the publishing end

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.950
and also now with
many years here

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860
at Harvard and time as also
with the University of Chicago,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.540
also understands
the academic end

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.040
and I think it's
in a great position

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.760
to bridge these two worlds.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.092
So let me turn it
over to Ann Marie.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.580
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
Thank you so much, Judy.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.680
Judy has very happily
made me her co-conspirator

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.120
on a couple of initiatives here
at Harvard bringing faculty

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.500
and journalists together.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.950
And I am always
delighted to play

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.230
that role for her and with her.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.530
So thank you for giving me the
chance to do that again today.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.300
When she first reached out to
me to see if this was possible

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.780
today, it was many months
before the election.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.720
And I think, certainly, my
views and maybe your views

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.760
of the value or lack thereof of
opinion journalism or opinion

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.110
writing have maybe changed some.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.690
But I want to make sure--

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.111
so Op-Ed-- the term comes
from opposite editorials.

00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:37.610
Right?

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.080
That's what it
means, but I think

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.750
the op is often misused
to just focus on opinion.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.050
It's also the first two
letters of that word.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.190
And I think what you'll find
with the group of people

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.330
we are talking with today,
the world is awash in opinion

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.400
and you can publish
it anywhere you want.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.810
You can publish your columns
on medium, you can publish,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.630
you can tweet, you can
post them on Facebook,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.410
you probably are members
of small Facebook groups

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.300
or Google Groups
or Google Hangouts

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.830
or any number of select cohorts
you make yourself a part of

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.180
and you can talk with them and
share your opinions with them

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.290
at ease.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.280
The difference between that
and what our colleagues today

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.650
are going to talk
about is really

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.200
reaching an audience outside
of that bubble and the accent

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:43.700
not necessarily on opinion,
but on information,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.040
on expertise, and on
sharing that expertise

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.200
in a sophisticated
way with a broader

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.830
audience than, perhaps, many
of you are used to speaking to

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.610
or with.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.190
And the value to us as
journalists is tremendous.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.480
The ability of somebody with
an expertise about a subject

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.900
to be able to express that
to people beyond their ken

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.940
is incredibly valuable
in a democracy and just

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.610
to us individually
as people who are

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.950
very interested in
your work, but maybe

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.660
can't always understand it.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.110
And so I think there's sometimes
this divide between what

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.580
journalism does and
what the academy does

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.060
and, hopefully, at the end
of our time here together,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:44.030
that will be demystified for you
and also some for our panelists

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.060
whose backgrounds,
with one exception,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.610
are on the journalism side.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.840
As Judy said, we saw this become
very successful the first time

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.350
she hosted such a conversation
and, hopefully, that

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.350
will be the same for today.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.380
So I was, yesterday
and today, just

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.430
looking at kind of recent
examples of the kinds of things

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.000
that our three journalists
here today think

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.710
about or have chosen as opinion
pieces or Op-Ed pieces to use.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.220
And so James, in
the last day or so,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.390
has overseen the publication
of a piece in the New York

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.620
Times written by a Cuban
born American who's

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.720
writing about her reactions
to Castro's death and the kind

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.870
of haunting presence
he had in her life

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.820
really from the time
she was cognizant.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.160
A freshmen from New
York University writing

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.685
about the animosity that--

00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:49.060
I'm not sure if
it's a he or she,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.495
there were initials
only in the piece--

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:50.780
JAMES DAO: It's a she.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.480
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: She-- that
she has experienced as somebody

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.040
who is a Trump supporter.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.100
A piece about how
the FCC is going

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.750
to auction off a chunk of the
public airwaves and an argument

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.690
that the writer makes for using
the proceeds from that to build

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.790
a 21st century infrastructure
of public interest media

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.720
written by the president
of a foundation.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.280
In the Globe "Ideas"
section, there

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.160
was a piece about
our complicated views

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.320
about nature and how we think
about alien species invading

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.950
our habitats, and
examination of the labor

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.540
movement in the age of Trump.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.620
We've all certainly
heard the term Alt-Right.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.110
I've not heard
the term Alt-Labor

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.120
so I learned about
Alt-Labor through that piece

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.180
and it's a new approach
to pro-worker activism.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.170
And over a cognoscente
at WBUR, there

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.430
was a piece about speaking up
for undocumented workers who

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.280
you may work with yourself.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.610
And also, one that was
very relevant to many of us

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.030
last week, how to go home
and deal with your family

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.870
after the election
at Thanksgiving.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.820
So that's a huge range
of ideas and thoughts

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.975
and expertise represented just
really over the course of 24

00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:23.760
or 48 hours on these three--

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.330
in two publications
and one radio station.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:35.530
But I wanted to start with Naomi
and with that as a backdrop,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:40.450
because Naomi is somebody
who has navigated

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.650
both waters, if we want to
think of them as separate ponds.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.340
So she is somebody who has
written for the Washington

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.950
Post and the LA Times and
Nature and Science and The New

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.380
Statesman and on and on.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.380
She's worked in the print,
she's worked in video,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.010
she's written books, she's
written Op-Eds for newspapers,

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.890
for magazines, she's
done a TED Talk,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.970
she's worked on a documentary.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.910
So on the one hand, she's
very skilled at the popular.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.220
Here are just two headlines--

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.020
one from a piece and
one from a book--

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.560
The Pope and the Planet--
we'd all read that--

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.740
Merchants of Doubt--
we all read that--

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.000
and then, maybe the
not so popular culture,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.050
here's the title of one, The
Rejection of Continental Drift:

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.290
Theory and Method in
American Earth Science--

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.260
probably not something any
of these three would publish.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.056
JAMES DAO: Maybe with
a different headline.

00:11:38.056 --> 00:11:40.222
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Maybe
with a different headline.

00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:42.430
And that's a key, actually,
what Jim just said.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:49.360
And so I want to see if we can
learn from Naomi how she thinks

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.900
about those as very
separate disciplines,

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.630
but rising from the same well
of knowledge and expertise

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.110
that you bring to both.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.180
So talk about coming at popular
pieces, popular culture pieces,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.350
or publications in
the popular culture

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.737
with your academic background.

00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:10.570
NAOMI ORESKES: Sure.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:10.840
OK.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.320
Thanks.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.528
Well, thanks very much for
having me here and thanks,

00:12:13.528 --> 00:12:15.384
Judy, for organizing
this and, Liz,

00:12:15.384 --> 00:12:17.800
I have to say I do feel kind
of a weight of responsibility

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.320
being the token
academic on this panel.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.180
So I guess the
best place to start

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.180
is just by saying I don't
think of them as being

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.320
separate ponds.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.090
I've never thought of
the diverse work I do.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.090
I work in science, I work
in history of science,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.030
I work in what you
call the popular realm.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.710
I never think of
them and I never

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.350
have thought of them as
different projects and that's

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.660
something that deans and
chairs have not always

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.590
understood, although
I think they do now,

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.560
and I'm in a very
nice place now where

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.830
now I get to be trotted
out as an exemplar of how

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.530
this can be done, but it
wasn't always that way.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.360
So the first thing
you have to realize

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.770
is that I think you have to have
a conception of what you think

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.010
your project is and I guess
being an earth scientist,

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.510
for me, the metaphor
I've always had

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.271
is kind of the iceberg metaphor
that what I do in public

00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:05.770
is a kind of the
tip of the iceberg.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.740
It's the small piece that
stands out that people see,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.310
people like yourself
or these folks,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.620
but it's supported by this
giant mass of material

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.650
beneath the surface that
most of you don't see,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.270
but that's the
part that supports

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.520
it, that's the part that
the upper part floats on.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.391
And so all of you, as academics,
have that mass of work

00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:27.640
that you've done that you've
worked incredibly hard on

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.190
or you've spent long
hours in the archives

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.550
or in the laboratory or in the
field or wherever you work.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.670
And you have all this stuff at
your disposal that you can use.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.680
And so I think that's
the starting point

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.417
is a sense of empowerment
based on your knowledge

00:13:41.417 --> 00:13:43.000
and the knowledge
you have that if you

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.610
start to write about something
based on your research,

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.240
you know more about that
than probably anybody.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.000
Right?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.410
And so that's, I think, where
my public work comes from

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.680
is out of this
body, this big body,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.010
of detailed work and long
hours spent in dusty archives

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.960
which Gabriella knows about.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.300
Right?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.750
So I thought,
maybe, I could just

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.180
say something of how I
wrote my first Op-Ed piece

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.350
because that's the other
second really important thing.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.684
And I don't think the folks
on this panel will disagree,

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.933
but they may have a slightly
different view, because I

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:17.650
know sometimes editors work
with academics to figure out

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.240
what they might
want to write about,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.104
but that's not how I came
to write my first Op-Ed.

00:14:22.104 --> 00:14:23.770
I came to write my
first Op-Ed because I

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.430
had something I wanted to say.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.922
And I think that's the
bottom line for anyone is,

00:14:28.922 --> 00:14:30.130
do you have something to say?

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.860
If you don't, then as the
great sage Tom Lehrer said,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.370
the least you can do is shut up.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.390
So don't talk until you
have something to say,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.460
but when you do,
that's the moment.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.870
And so I think the key thing
is to sort of be aware,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.240
to kind of go through the
world with an awareness of how

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.430
your work might
connect to something.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.190
And when that moment
occurs, that's when you act.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.450
And so some years ago,
more than 10 years ago, we

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.674
had some terrible wildfires
in Southern California

00:14:56.674 --> 00:14:58.590
and my children were out
of school for a week.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.540
We had a fire week.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.300
Here we have snow days, but in
California, we have fire days.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.130
And it was a quite traumatic
time in Southern California.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.480
Lots of people were
displaced from their homes.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.542
And my children and I--

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.000
and you couldn't
really go anywhere

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.100
because it was so
much smoke and dust.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.590
It was not safe to be outside.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.410
After three days of baking
cookies and things like that,

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.720
and I'm reading the papers--

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.095
and this is the
other thing, too,

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:23.910
is noticing what's
not being said.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.670
So there were all these things
being written about the fires

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.170
and no one was
making the connection

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.450
to climate change, no one.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.570
And I, personally, think that
of all the different things

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.120
that climate change does,
is already doing, and will

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.120
do to us, at least, if
you live in the west,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.250
fires are the most important
thing because they're

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.050
really, really scary.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.426
People are afraid
of fire, people

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:46.883
get it that fires destroy their
homes and their communities

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:49.440
and their lives and cost
billions of dollars in damage.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.990
So fires connect climate
change to people's lives

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.395
in very real, tangible, and
emotionally present way.

00:15:55.395 --> 00:15:57.020
And so I just wrote
something about it.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:01.190
I wrote, basically,
something that said, guys,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.820
you know climate change.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.460
And I sent it over the transom
to the Los Angeles Times--

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.760
didn't know anybody.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.880
And an editor there
saw it and liked it

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.400
and called me up and said,
we'd like to run with this.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.530
And then over the next 24
hours, we worked together

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.900
to clean it up and
I learned a lot

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.430
working with an editor about
how to write a good Op-Ed piece.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.100
You learn by working
with editors.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.130
So after that experience,
then I realized, OK, this

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.610
is actually not that hard.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.245
I mean it's different,
like I was just saying,

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:32.370
I mean the style of an
Op-Ed is different than what

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.960
we're used to in academic life.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.190
You have to hit it hard, don't
bury the lead, main idea up

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.090
front, only one idea, not
17, no table of contents,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.405
no footnotes, almost
no references--

00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:46.530
and if they already have
to kind of explore-- well,

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.460
I guess now with
hyperlinks, you kind of do.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:48.900
JAMES DAO: That's right.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.670
NAOMI ORESKES: My first
Op-Ed was in the days before

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.550
a hyperlink--

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.790
I mean old fashioned
print-- all that kind thing.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.520
So anyway, the point is
I had something to say

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.410
and I said it and
somebody was interested

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.190
and then things went from there.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.780
So there's not really
like a magic trick

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.579
about writing an
Op-Ed, but you do

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:10.200
have to let go of a lot
of your academic concern

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.930
with detail, nuance, subtlety.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.329
The art of an Op-Ed
piece, subtlety

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.940
is not kind of like
job one, although there

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.230
is a place for it at times.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.240
It's not to say that the best
Op-Ed pieces is a sledgehammer,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.160
it's not.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.730
But it's just we've been so
trained to focus as academics

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.460
on the subtlety, the
nuance, the details,

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.560
and so you do have
to let go of some

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.530
of your academic sensibilities.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.570
If you can find
someone to work with,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.680
that's a really good thing,
but my initial Op-Eds were just

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.476
on my own, but I
was very lucky--

00:17:42.476 --> 00:17:44.850
and this is something I think
we could do here at Harvard

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.183
and I'd actually like talk
to you more about this later.

00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:49.320
So after I wrote my
first Op-Ed piece,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.480
then I got an email
from someone at UCSD.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.910
I was teaching in San
Diego at the time--

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.410
and just a small aside--

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.510
when I was in San Diego,
the New York Times never

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.060
accepted any of my Op-Ed
pieces, and then I moved here,

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.990
and suddenly like [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.980
So OK, better late than never.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.970
I know it wasn't me.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.630
But I got an email from someone
in our press and communication

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.180
office and she said, that was
a great piece, I loved it,

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.560
would you like to work
with me in the future?

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.174
And so, we did and we
had a great partnership

00:18:20.174 --> 00:18:21.090
and it went like this.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.010
I had something to say,
something happened,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.900
I would write a draft,
I sent it to her--

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.389
Inga Kiddera was her name.

00:18:26.389 --> 00:18:28.680
Inga would look at it, she'd
give me some suggestions--

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.830
she had been in journalism--

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.840
I would make them, and then she
would shop them around for me.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.540
And that was a giant blessing
because, frankly, it's

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.880
hard to shop your
own Op-Ed pieces.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.425
And nobody likes rejection,
but it's particularly--

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:46.800
if you're an academic and
you're used to getting reviews,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.780
you get feedback, you
revise, you resubmit--

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.077
to have an Op-Ed
editor to say, sorry,

00:18:51.077 --> 00:18:53.160
we're not interested and
no explanation, nothing--

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.990
because that's how it goes
because they're not obligation

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.620
to give--

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.990
they're not reviewers, right?

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.360
That was kind of hard, but
she would shop them for me.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.920
And so working with Inga, we'd
place pieces, as Tara said,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.130
Washington Post, Chicago
Tribune, Los Angeles Times,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.720
San Francisco
Chronicle-- practically

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.261
every major newspaper
in this country

00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:14.019
with the notable exception of
one in New York, but that's OK.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.810
And here's the other
really important thing

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.910
I just want to say before
I pass on to the others.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:23.246
So one thing I've really noticed
moving here from California--

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:24.912
it's not a criticism
of Harvard which is

00:19:24.912 --> 00:19:26.203
an incredibly great university.

00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:28.020
I'm totally proud and
thrilled to be here,

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.737
but we tend to sort of think
when we think about newspapers,

00:19:32.737 --> 00:19:35.070
the media, we think about The
New York Times, The Boston

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.360
Globe, and that's fine.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.020
They're absolutely
fantastic, amazing newspapers

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.282
and they reach lots
and lots of people.

00:19:41.282 --> 00:19:42.740
But there are
millions and millions

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.990
of people in this country
who do not read The New York

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.170
Times and that could be hard
to believe being at Harvard--

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.900
or The Boston Globe or
even The Los Angeles Times.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.530
There's this world of people are
out there that we don't reach

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.860
and this election has made
that incredibly clear,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.610
if we didn't know it beforehand.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.750
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: So
thank you for that, Naomi,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.520
and I wanted to turn to Katie.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.060
So Naomi said something
very, very important.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.380
She said she's home,
she's baking cookies,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.430
there are fires all around
her, she had this idea

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.410
that fires connect
people to climate

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.540
change in a very real way.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.970
And so embedded in
that observation

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.820
is that this was
incredibly timely.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.760
The wolf was at the
door, she had knowledge,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.460
and she jumped on
it very quickly.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.830
There was a reason
for an editor to look

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.170
at that piece in that moment.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.750
And I'm wondering
if you can talk

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.580
about the importance of
that, Katie, and conversely,

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.730
getting an idea, a
pitch, that's kind of--

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.710
it could happen
any day of the year

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.350
and there's not that sense
of urgency or timeliness

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.930
and how you think about
those two in different ways.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.971
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Sure.

00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:57.680
I can't overemphasize the
importance of timeliness.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.210
If something is
happening, that's

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.990
when you should be contacting
an editor, not three days later.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.620
I often, when I was
the Ideas editor,

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:13.010
would get a pitch about a topic
that was very, very important,

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.820
but not in the news
anymore and there was not

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.910
a lot of reason to start
talking about it again.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.030
So within minutes of
something happening

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.179
is when you should be
reaching out to an editor,

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:26.720
when you should be
thinking about it.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.330
So that talks a
lot to what Naomi

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.707
said which is always be
thinking about these things,

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:33.290
always be thinking
about what you have

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.260
to say on different topics
and areas of expertise

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.350
that you have so that
you can jump on it.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.920
And I would, actually,
say the other good thing

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.800
to do is just talk
to editors in advance

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.020
and get to know editors,
have coffee with them.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.910
I know I often would
make appointments

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:58.040
with academics or
other local voices

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.420
that we wanted to, someday,
have as contributors

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.350
thinking about--

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.470
often, ideas would come
through just a conversation

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.330
and someone would say,
I'm working on this topic

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.130
and I have a lot of research
on x and we would figure out

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.892
an angle together.

00:22:16.892 --> 00:22:19.100
And that was one of the
things that I actually really

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.180
enjoyed about working with
Op-Eds is the idea that I could

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.100
help the person think
through what they

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.100
were trying to say on a topic.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.040
It doesn't need to be a
700 word Op-Ed fully formed

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.510
when you turn it in.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.000
It can be a nugget of an idea
that we can work together

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.114
to form into a piece.

00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:39.530
The counter side
to that, the idea

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.120
that you have something
that could work any day,

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.100
it's often what works
is something that's

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.020
counter-intuitive so
something that breaks

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:53.330
the stereotypes around a
topic or that is interesting,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:57.110
unique research that only you
are working on in that moment

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.860
or that only you are talking
about that will change

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.110
a reader's mind, for instance.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.212
I always say, why are
we doing this piece now

00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:09.920
is one of the questions
that I frequently

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.990
ask people who are
pitching Op-Eds to me

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.900
and kind of making sure that
when you're first approaching

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.489
the editor, that
you can say this is

00:23:19.489 --> 00:23:20.780
why we're doing this piece now.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.750
It's because this is a brand
new piece of research or this

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.630
is something that's on the
news or this is something

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.410
that only I can
bring this expertise

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.230
and the topic is extremely
relevant to your readers

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.462
because--

00:23:34.462 --> 00:23:35.920
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
Can you, Katie,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.550
so because you're The Boston
Globe and you sit in this--

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.950
you're awash in
academic institutions

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.390
and real and potential
contributors,

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.450
do you have any observations
about or maybe an example

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:57.110
of a really successful and also
maybe a less than successful

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.060
pitch that you've
had about something

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.960
related to academic
research and feels right

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.280
or does not in the moment?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.321
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Sure.

00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:06.590
I think that they're--

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.173
all you have to do is read the
Sunday "Idea" section and you'd

00:24:09.173 --> 00:24:11.930
find successful
pitches from academics.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:17.600
We often have pieces,
but things that are--

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.100
I'm trying to think,
of course, I'm

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.210
struggling now that you've asked
me and put me on the spot--

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.140
but we--

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.300
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
I should say,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.320
very excitedly and happily,
Katie's mind is in a new place.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.060
Although she edited ideas and
Sunday Op-Eds for some time,

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.940
she's the recently promoted
managing editor of The Boston

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.090
Globe so yea for Katie.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.700
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Thank you.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.340
I would say that there
are great examples.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.800
We did a piece about
the history of the word

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.440
racism a couple of weeks ago.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.970
I didn't actually
edit that, but I

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.020
was part of the initial process
of soliciting it and bringing

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.770
it to The Globe.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.440
And it was one of
those pieces where

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.960
it could have been very
academic and jargony

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.980
and I know that there
was a lot of work

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.090
put into making it something
that a lay reader could read

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.320
and get through--

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.870
early drafts were
sort of dense--

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.170
but the writer worked very
closely with the editor

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.960
and made it something
that felt very accessible

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.850
to the average reader.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.360
I think that there are a couple
of pitfalls that writers often

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.310
find themselves in which
make things not successful.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.000
So for instance, what
I was saying earlier

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.330
was there's this
phenomenon called editing

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.720
by committee in
which you will go

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.421
through the first
edit with a writer

00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:43.670
and they will send you back
a note that says something

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.620
to the effect of,
OK well, I just

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.110
need to share this
around my department.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.030
That almost never
works for an editor

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:54.230
because what comes
back from that process

00:25:54.230 --> 00:26:01.010
is a lot of caveats being
added to the piece when--

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.140
Going back to
something Naomi said,

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.640
really what works
the best is when

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.220
you have a straight point
that you're trying to make

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.470
and you're using
supporting evidence around

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.130
that as opposed to something
that becomes muddied

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.680
because you want to make sure
that this person gets credit

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:21.260
for their research or a side
is added because you want

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.030
to make sure it feels nuanced.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.920
Nuance is important
and, in fact, I

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.940
think people go too far in
terms of taking nuance out,

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.360
because I think often you do
want to have those caveats,

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.620
but you don't want to
have the caveats take away

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.280
from your argument and
that's often what can happen.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.050
It's when you
start saying things

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.490
like I'm making this
really strident point,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.790
but there is all this research
that says the opposite.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.380
And I feel like there is
a pressure in academia

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.600
to make sure everyone
in your department

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:09.380
feels like they are in the
know about what you're writing

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.140
or about this excellent
opportunity you

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.830
have to contribute to The
Boston Globe or et cetera.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.270
But when that process starts
to take away from the punch

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.600
or impact that the
piece can have,

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.540
that's when it gets in the way.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.120
And so the other
thing that I always

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.850
appreciate, as I mentioned,
is when someone wants

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.760
to credit their bosses' work.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.930
That happens all the time.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.730
It's constantly like--
and I want to say--

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:42.680
in the drafts, obviously.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.440
This doesn't often ever
really make it into the paper,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.080
because that's one of the
first things, as an editor,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.570
that you take out, frankly.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:56.120
So you'll get a piece that's
like this Op-Ed wouldn't have

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.410
been possible without
the previous research

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.560
by my department chair.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.450
So just know going in that
if you want to do that,

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.786
you're going to be really--

00:28:09.786 --> 00:28:11.660
it's going to be hard
to find an editor who's

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.880
going to let that
end up in the paper.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.921
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: I'm
smiling because it's also

00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:18.920
completely antithetical to
what would happen in a newsroom

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.080
where reporters will never
give their bosses credit

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.621
for anything.

00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:22.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.180
It's the precise
opposite, culturally.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.109
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Right.

00:28:27.109 --> 00:28:29.150
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: The
editors only ruin things.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.344
Your bosses ruin your best work.

00:28:31.344 --> 00:28:32.510
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Exactly.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.330
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: One of the
great mysteries of the universe

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.620
is how the pieces get chosen for
The New York Times Op-Ed page.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.730
You're in the really
fortunate position

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.056
to be overwhelmed
with submissions.

00:28:50.056 --> 00:28:51.680
You're in the really
difficult position

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.290
of being overwhelmed
with submissions.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:59.690
So, Jim, can you just
talk about that process?

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:04.130
So you're thinking about
tomorrow's page, what's

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.550
been the run up to what
we will read there,

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.414
what will appear there--
in print or online.

00:29:11.414 --> 00:29:12.680
JAMES DAO: Sure.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.138
I just want to say I've only
been there 10 months so I have

00:29:15.138 --> 00:29:16.484
yet to reject one of Naomi's.

00:29:16.484 --> 00:29:17.900
NAOMI ORESKES: But
it will happen.

00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:23.030
JAMES DAO: And it's true that
we don't give explanations

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.270
because, as I explained to one
writer, if that's what we did,

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.400
that's all we would do.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.710
So I'd love to be
able to boil it down,

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.950
but it's, of course, it's
like a newsroom, in fact.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.460
It's sausage making
and it's sausage

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.870
making as ugly as anything that
happens in the news operation.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.200
But I'll sort of run you
through a typical day

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.420
where we start with
the morning meeting.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.290
We all come in trying to have
read not just our paper, which

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.230
is enough of an ordeal, but
has skimmed other papers

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.510
and have a sense
of what's going on.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:03.150
And we discuss what is the
big story that we care about?

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.650
What is the running story we're
going to continue to follow?

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:11.065
And what is the role of
opinion in this process?

00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:13.660
And that, in and of itself, is
a really complicated question

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.200
because opinion is so much
more diverse and broad

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.260
than it once was.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.660
The Op-Ed page of The Times
historically was two pieces

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.750
and columnists and
it still is that--

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.779
two pieces by outside
writers, often academics,

00:30:27.779 --> 00:30:29.320
but they could be
novelists, it could

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.520
be regular people, and then
two of our regular columnists.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:40.480
But today, we are now
online only essays.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.080
We are the Sunday Review
which is 12 to 15 very

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.840
often long style essays,
sometimes reported

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.930
and sometimes personal
narrative, sometimes

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.640
standard opinionated Op-Eds with
a prescription and a problem.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.680
We are the international
New York Times,

00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.780
which has its own group of
outside international writers

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.780
writing from across the globe.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.720
And there's a whole variety
of online types of pieces

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.020
that we do.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.420
One of our favorites
is something

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.070
called The Stone which is a
philosopher's blog, basically.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.550
It's part of the
Op-Ed operation.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.970
Some of The Stone essays get
into the paper or the Sunday

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.080
Review, but most of
them just live online

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.870
and it has a
dedicated readership.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.650
Maybe, if there's any
philosophers here,

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.070
you've actually looked at it.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.860
And we have others like
that that are developing.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:39.700
So as Katie pointed
out, timeliness is huge.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.460
We're looking for pieces
that can go-- sometimes,

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.210
we get Op-Eds within an hour
of an event taking place.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.682
And very often--

00:31:47.682 --> 00:31:50.140
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: And that's
when you should be pitching.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.840
JAMES DAO: But very often,
they're astonishingly good

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.890
and we try not to
distinguish between what

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.960
goes online versus
what goes in the paper

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.720
because, more and more, we
are purely online operation,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.190
but we do give a little bit more
care and tending to the paper

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.910
because the readers are a
little bit more careful there

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.010
and we have more
time to work on them.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.690
But we get full-fledged
850 word Op-Eds

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.490
within an hour or two of major
events and if they are good,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.610
we will put them online
as quickly as we can,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.355
sometimes within an
hour or two hours

00:32:26.355 --> 00:32:27.730
depending on the
quality of them.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.230
What I would say to sort of be
the counter voice on timeliness

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.320
is every clever reporter
has figured out,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.840
over the course of their
career, that you can make

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.580
almost anything
feel timely if you

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.750
have the right framing for it.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.890
And the key to anything,
whether it's a news story

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.872
or whether it's an Op-Ed, is
that as Naomi points out very

00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:53.830
correctly, you should
write about what you know

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.470
and what you care about.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.200
We receive 1,000 pictures
a day about people

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.760
who want to tell
us why Trump won

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.850
and really, we don't care
almost from any of you.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.910
We have columnists, editorial
writers, and big brains

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.946
across the globe trying
to tell us what that is.

00:33:08.946 --> 00:33:10.570
We're probably not
going to really care

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.514
about your opinion on that.

00:33:12.514 --> 00:33:13.930
What we are going
to care about is

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:17.227
if you have some amazing
data about voting

00:33:17.227 --> 00:33:19.060
patterns in a particular
part of the country

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:24.500
that illuminate how a
certain demographic voted--

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.150
that could be
really interesting.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:35.310
We had a pollster from Cornell
who did that and his material

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.720
made it, it was only online
because we had such a flood

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.430
of post-election stuff.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.100
But it just cut an interesting
slice out of the electorate

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.720
that was really
interesting to us

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.620
and we thought illuminated
a part of what was going on.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.010
Presumably, any
researcher doing,

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:56.530
no matter how niche or esoteric,
has some sort of resonance

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.610
for people and that's the
crucial part of figuring out

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:05.230
whether you can make a New York
Times Op-Ed because we're not--

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.100
as popular as we are in college
towns, most of our readers

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.690
are not academics,
most of our readers

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.606
are not going to know
your subjects very well.

00:34:12.606 --> 00:34:15.940
They're smart generalists,
they're sophisticated readers.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.150
What they want to do is to take
your nugget of information,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.889
your research whether it's
history or science or politics,

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.679
and your ability to
pull back and say

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:29.796
this is why this matters to
lots of people is what's going

00:34:29.796 --> 00:34:31.420
can make the difference
between a piece

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.739
that we take or don't take.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.320
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: How
many unassigned pieces

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.670
do you get over the
transom every day, roughly,

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.400
an estimate?

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.750
JAMES DAO: It's hundreds.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:49.694
And I personally will wake up to
30 in my inbox and many of them

00:34:49.694 --> 00:34:51.860
I will just farm out to
others to read, some of them

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.052
I'll try to read.

00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:55.760
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
And what's the best--

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.500
JAMES DAO: It's both a
blessing and a curse.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.160
It's not a curse--

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.910
the curse part of it isn't
just that it's a lot to read

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.940
and we can't keep up with
it, but to some degree,

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.530
we want to be able to direct
where the Op-Ed page is

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.580
going on our own.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.780
And we could just run
things that were sent to us

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.500
every day of the week
for our entire careers.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.420
What we try to do
as much as possible

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.970
is to step back and
say here's a thought

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.406
that we think people
aren't dealing with

00:35:28.406 --> 00:35:30.530
and then think of who the
right writer is for that,

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.920
whether it's a novelist or
a journalist or an academic,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.580
and that's where your
relationships with editors

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.240
do matter.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.530
It not only helps you
when you do pitch a story,

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.319
but sometimes we'll
come to you because we

00:35:44.319 --> 00:35:46.610
know that you've done research
on something interesting

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.109
or we know that
you've just come out

00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:52.430
with a book on a particular
topic that was totally

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.530
meaningless and obscure
to us until that moment

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.110
when, suddenly, it wasn't
and it really mattered.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:02.870
So our ability to have you on
our Rolodexes is important.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.260
But we publish--

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.400
I don't know, we counted
it up the other day--

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.350
the operation I oversee
probably publishes

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:14.930
over 100 things a week between
small online and long form

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.550
in the Sunday Review.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.890
And then there's video
and now there's audio

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.500
and there's just an incredible
array of things we now do.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.390
Weeding through that stuff
is a huge part of the day.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:35.990
And I guess, the last point to
go beyond the timeliness part

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.440
of it is because Op-Ed has
evolved a lot in the years

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.460
and it's not just policy,
problem, prescription type

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.760
writing which is what it once
was and which we still value

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.490
and we still do, particularly
at this moment when we have

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.490
a new administration where
God knows where they're going,

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:55.470
but you know, perhaps,
it's a persuadable moment

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:58.880
and it's a time for
people to weigh in.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:05.382
But we also we also run first
person essays that are not even

00:37:05.382 --> 00:37:06.590
about a problem, necessarily.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.310
They're experiential, they're
beautifully written very often,

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.200
but they tell us something
about a place in the world

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.270
or about a state of mind or
could be about a problem,

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.830
as well.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.942
And you know that
type of essay often

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:25.400
is written by an
academic, as well.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.930
It's going to sound idiotic
for me to say this, but study

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.780
us, study not just
the daily Op-Ed page,

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.990
but study the Sunday Review
and think about what you like

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.730
and what works
for you and that's

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.150
a very important part of the
learning process in terms

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.300
of figuring out what we
do and how your work might

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.700
fit into what we do.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.320
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Iris, so
you work in a different medium.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.660
On the one hand, you
do publish things

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.110
that would look like
they could work in print

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.020
or they could work on
cognoscente or [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.225
online and its portfolio.

00:38:08.225 --> 00:38:12.050
But I wanted you to talk about
the difference between what

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:14.060
you're looking
for and who you're

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.340
looking for when you're
looking for Op-Ed pieces

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.760
we're going to hear.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.240
There's been an explosion
in the last couple of years

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:30.410
in listening to opinion and
this very energetic podcast

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:35.000
environment that we're
enjoying right now.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.170
Talk a little bit about how
you're choosing or assigning

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:43.530
that's different from what
your newspaper colleagues might

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.030
be doing.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.405
IRIS ADLER: Well,
first of all, I

00:38:45.405 --> 00:38:47.780
would say that the
criteria we use to choose

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.300
a good cognoscente piece--

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.370
they're very similar
to the criteria

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.430
we use for an on-air piece.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.880
And some of those attributes
have been talked about--

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.080
the ability to be concise.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.490
While our cognoscente pieces
might be up to 800 words,

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.680
often we'll take
those exact pieces

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.290
and turn them into
radio commentaries

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.770
and then we face
said academia writer,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:20.930
we say, OK, now it's going to be
cut to 200 words or 300 words.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:26.390
It's really a shocking process
and we get a lot of resistance.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.110
But as you all know,
it is very difficult

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.130
to be listening to the radio
or whatever platform you listen

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.340
and have someone
just talk at you

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.270
without the inclusion
of soundbytes

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.160
or other kinds of sounds.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:46.350
So the length,
literally, is two minutes

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.890
and that's what you get and
it's very difficult taking

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:53.610
that writer from 800
words to two minutes,

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.770
but it's absolutely critical and
some people don't want to do it

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.870
and that's fine.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.870
But in either case,
we really need

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.470
to be very focused whether it's
a cognoscente piece or radio

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.970
piece--

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.970
I think someone has
talked-- but we're not

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.370
dealing with big topics here.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.710
There was a very
prominent Harvard academic

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.170
who used to write
for us and his topics

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.710
would be like how
do we fix education.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:21.210
I mean we really, really do need
a very small, but compelling

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.230
byte.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:28.830
We also have emphasized
more particularly

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.960
for the radio or
podcast, as you said,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.030
this little narrative style.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.330
Ever since the huge success of
This American Life and serial

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.120
that storytelling
narrative has sort of

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.050
infiltrated every part of the
audio world, whatever platform

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.320
we're talking about.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.650
And so often in our cognoscente
pieces or our radio pieces,

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:54.330
if the point could be wrapped
in some kind of narrative,

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.090
it makes it more
compelling for the listener

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.760
and people are just
used to this now.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.220
So we often help people try
and find something of a story

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.616
to help illustrate their point.

00:41:08.616 --> 00:41:11.910
One of the big differentiators--
and this sounds so obvious,

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.700
but it's something we have
to explain to people all

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:18.270
the time-- that just because
you're a brilliant writer

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:23.880
does not mean that you're
a great voice on the radio.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.800
And sometimes, you're
a brilliant talker

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.510
and then you get
someone in a studio,

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.090
you put a mic in front of them,
and it's kind of daunting.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:33.120
You've all done this.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.879
You're sitting there alone in
a studio, the mic, an engineer

00:41:35.879 --> 00:41:37.420
and producers sort
of talking at you.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.795
They're saying
now sound natural.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.580
Not everybody could do it.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.840
We have some people who do
it brilliantly all the time--

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.060
Nancy Gertner comes to mind
who we use a lot-- from the Law

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:49.560
School.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.450
So it's the actual
voice, but then there's

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.090
what I call the
sort of voiciness.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:00.270
You could see why Naomi's a
great writer because she has--

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.230
like right away, we would call
it like pops through the air.

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.470
She just has that
kind of energy.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:12.300
And again, you can be brilliant
and articulate and just not

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.219
be able to bring that
kind of energy that--

00:42:15.219 --> 00:42:17.010
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
Can someone learn that?

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.600
Can you help them achieve that?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.550
IRIS ADLER: Here's what
I think you could do.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.200
You could have someone--

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.990
like literally, I tell people
stand in front of the mirror

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.671
and practice every night and
record yourself and then listen

00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:28.170
back.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.480
Because when you
listen back, you really

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.360
get a sense of how flat
you could sound, how dull

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.310
you could sound.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:39.420
And I will often coach people
as they're in the studio

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.820
and say it's going to sound
very exaggerated to you,

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:46.662
but you need to bring energy
and emphasis which goes back

00:42:46.662 --> 00:42:48.870
to the more important point
that if someone is really

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:51.660
passionate about a
topic, if they can bring

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.560
that passion both to their
writing and to the air,

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:02.700
it is really useful because
radio is a very intimate forum

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.140
and it's very hard, I think,
to be inauthentic on the radio

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.920
or at least to be good.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.510
You know people always
point to Ira Glass who's

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.720
the-- you all know, the huge
radio This American Life star.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.090
And he sounds when you
hear him on the air

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:26.430
so authentic just like he's
sitting down and just talking.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.090
But every word that Ira
writes is written out

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.800
and his ums are written.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.230
This is the sort
of famous thing--

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.154
you know those ums he
does and those like, wait,

00:43:37.154 --> 00:43:38.570
let me correct
myself here thing--

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.830
this is all written down.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.920
So people who are
really talented at it--

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.390
and they're few
and far between--

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.670
know how to write
to sound authentic,

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.160
but for the rest of us, we
just need to be able to do it.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.220
And I think often, some
people, it's just practice

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.100
and just getting
comfortable so they

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.580
can sort of be self-revealing.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.456
For other people, they're
just not going to get there.

00:44:02.456 --> 00:44:04.830
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: You totally
ruined This American Life

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.584
for many people today.

00:44:07.584 --> 00:44:09.750
NAOMI ORESKES: Now, you're
going to tell us Garrison

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:10.749
Keillor isn't authentic.

00:44:10.749 --> 00:44:11.388
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.388 --> 00:44:12.792
IRIS ADLER: I don't know him.

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.970
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
I wanted to ask just

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.410
so we know how the [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.970
I wanted to ask you guys one
more sort of lightning round

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:23.460
question and we're going to
open it up to your questions

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.000
and I want to assure you
all that I'm going to end

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.860
no later than a quarter to two.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.890
I know some of you have classes
to teach a, but b, some of you

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:35.850
probably want to have some
quick introductory conversations

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.570
with our guests here today, too.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.210
So they'll be there'll
be time for that.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:44.330
But the one sort of lightning
round question I wanted to ask

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:50.240
is and, Jim, you hinted at it.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.820
So we've been talking about kind
of a traditional Op-Ed writing

00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:00.320
both for newspapers
and for radio,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.810
but I wanted to talk about
innovations in this space.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:10.970
So The Times is
doing Op-Docs and we

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:17.210
think now about aspects of
journalism being performative,

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:22.700
in a sense, and not to take away
from fairness or verisimilitude

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.840
or any of those
important traditions,

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:32.570
but that just ink on paper
or pixels or airwaves--

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.830
that it's not always sufficient.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:39.450
We're thinking about the
visual nature of these pieces.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.170
We are thinking about sound.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.330
So if we could just
sort of quickly--

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.950
and, Jim, I know The
Times has experimented

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.020
in this space a lot--
started some things,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.610
stopped some things.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.010
But just if you could
each just really quickly

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.380
talk about something that
you're excited about that's

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.570
on the horizon
and how, maybe, we

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:01.970
should be thinking differently
or more innovatively

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.931
about telling these stories.

00:46:04.931 --> 00:46:06.214
I'll start with you.

00:46:06.214 --> 00:46:07.380
JAMES DAO: Want me to start?

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.930
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Yeah.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.730
JAMES DAO: Well, can
I name three things?

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:21.090
So well, you mentioned or I
actually talked a little bit

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:21.930
about The Stone.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.600
So one of the things we're
doing this coming year

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.180
are mostly online.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.810
They're not blogs, but
they're formats, platforms

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.110
for essentially essays.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.020
And I guess I can
talk about this.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.660
It's a little bit
proprietary, but we're

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.000
hoping to start one
on religion and just

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.690
talking about
religion in daily life

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:49.650
from all religious points of
view, anywhere on the globe.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:57.030
And we're expecting some of the
writers will be theologists,

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.670
some of them will be
practicing ministers or rabbis,

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.130
but we're hoping much of it
will be just people talking

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.810
about religion and how it
guides their daily life

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.750
through their
religious experiences

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:09.150
from that sort of ground up.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.526
And that will, we're
hoping, have written essays,

00:47:12.526 --> 00:47:14.400
sometimes it will be
pieces off the news, who

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.260
knows, if there's significant
news in the religion world.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.600
Some of it we're hoping
will be audio, some of it

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.860
could be video, as well.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.530
And that will be
just its own thing

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.540
we're hoping to create
in the coming year.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:34.500
Similarly, we're planning
a mainly online feature

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:41.790
on Vietnam and how Vietnam
the war that has shaped

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:45.210
American life today in all
its many ways, whether it's

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:51.720
having to do with foreign
policy or military policy,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.380
military strategy, how
Vietnam was experienced

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.330
and still how the war
is still experienced

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.370
by people in Vietnam today.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.260
And that's going to
be a running feature

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.460
over the course of the year.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.543
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Will
you bring in other media?

00:48:04.543 --> 00:48:05.070
Not just--

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:05.980
JAMES DAO: Yep.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.652
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: OK.

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:09.610
JAMES DAO: We're doing
this sort of in conjunct

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:13.530
with Ken Burns who's got a big
series coming out on Vietnam.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.820
We are playing with, as I
was talking to Iris and Katie

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:28.060
about, with audio and trying to
go the route of doing podcasts.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.757
And those are still
being worked on.

00:48:29.757 --> 00:48:31.590
We haven't quite figured
out how to do them,

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:33.690
but certainly some
of it will probably

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.920
involve some of our columnists,
people like maybe Gail Collins

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.910
or Nick Krostof's kind of a
natural for any experiment

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:47.040
that you want to try whether
it's social media or video.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.560
And now we're going to launch
him on audio maybe and see

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.185
how that works.

00:48:50.185 --> 00:48:53.304
360 video is the other
thing he's going to try.

00:48:53.304 --> 00:48:54.220
It's an amazing thing.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.345
The camera's-- I don't know
if anybody's seen them,

00:48:56.345 --> 00:49:00.960
but 360 video cameras are the
size of a tennis ball and you

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.080
can put them down and just
let them run for a couple

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.660
of minutes and it's just
going to be a whole other part

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.910
of what we do, both in the
newsroom and in the opinion

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:09.502
section.

00:49:09.502 --> 00:49:10.460
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: OK.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.990
Katie, I have an example
in my head for The Globe,

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.060
but maybe you want to
talk about a different one

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:20.010
and that was the approach you
took to writing about guns--

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.240
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Oh, sure.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.570
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: --which
included a massive tweet

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:25.479
storm--

00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:26.520
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Yeah.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.590
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: --along
with the print presentation,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.048
but maybe you could just talk
a little bit about that which

00:49:31.048 --> 00:49:34.360
I thought was very innovative in
that space and with that issue.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.026
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY:
And that's something

00:49:36.026 --> 00:49:38.550
that we've actually been
experimenting, generally, with.

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.220
I would echo, we're also
doing a lot of experimenting

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.330
with 360 video.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:45.150
We're currently working
with some MIT academics

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.060
on a project mapping
the Charles River.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.884
We have access to
the USS Constitution

00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:52.800
that's in dry-docks right
now that we're doing

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.690
this cool history project on.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.690
And what Ann Marie
is referring to

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:01.410
is a editorial that
we wrote back in June.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:05.640
It was a project
that I led looking

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:08.100
in the aftermath of
the Orlando shooting,

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:13.440
calling for a ban
on assault rifles.

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.330
And what we did for
that project is we

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.770
approached it in three ways--

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.940
one for print, one for
our online desktop,

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.570
mobile experience,
and then for social.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:28.260
The print product was probably
something that all of you

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.550
would be very familiar with.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.000
We wrapped the front
page of The Globe

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.960
on a Thursday morning
with the editorial

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.910
as well as some graphics kind
of making the case that we

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.590
should ban assault rifles.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:48.900
Then, we wrote a very
traditional editorial.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.500
And then for digital,
it was much more

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.120
of an interactive experience.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.610
We also had several
calls to action within it

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:59.160
so we targeted six
senators that we

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.350
knew were vulnerable
on this topic

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:04.200
and asked them to change
their vote and most of them

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.590
lost at the beginning
of November.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:12.050
They received thousands of
tweets via The Boston Globe

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:16.920
website and that was something
that was really heartening.

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.750
Kelly Ayotte was
one, in particular,

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:22.650
that probably because
of the local ties that

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:26.880
came under assault, basically,
off from The Globe's website

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.790
and ultimately changed her vote
which was something that we

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:32.100
were really proud to see.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:35.940
And then finally, we did this
really innovative project which

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:39.570
is something we're
experimenting with more and more

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:42.450
of on social.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:45.900
Every five seconds or excuse
me, every five minutes,

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:55.200
we posted the name and age
of a gun mass shooting victim

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:59.537
since Sandy Hook and
the killings there.

00:51:59.537 --> 00:52:00.120
And that was--

00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:01.582
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Every
single American victim

00:52:01.582 --> 00:52:02.010
since Sandy Hook.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:03.176
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Exactly.

00:52:03.176 --> 00:52:06.390
Well, every single victim of a
shooting in the United States.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:07.230
Some of them were--

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.010
a couple of them were
actually foreigners.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:15.150
But the power of
that was something

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.850
we were experimenting with
and we weren't expecting,

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.580
but the power of that
to see those names

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.940
and to see how frequently they
came and this was something

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:26.760
that took 38 hours
for us to accomplish

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.740
was to list every victim's name.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:31.080
We had a very stringent
standard for who

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:37.950
would be included in that list,
and yet, it took that long.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:44.280
We took over The Globe's
Twitter handle and particularly

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.210
the part when we are talking
about the children who

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:52.920
have died that it became very
poignant very quickly to see

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.820
those names come
one after the other

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.600
and ending on the Orlando
Pulse Nightclub shooting.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.790
Just to kind of see
the raw power of that

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:05.940
was something that we've
tried to take and apply

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.120
in other ways.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.020
So we're actually now,
almost in every major project

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.650
that we do through the
newsroom and the Op-Ed page,

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.960
looking at it through that
lens of what should we

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.730
be doing in print, what
should we be doing in digital,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.320
and what should we
be doing on social.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.370
And we just had a huge
piece about trolley accident

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:30.970
that happened 100 years ago that
we did the similar approach to

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.170
and had a lot of success with.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:35.070
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
So, Naomi, I'm

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.710
wondering if you think
about your pieces now.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.280
You talked about how when
you wrote that first piece

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.170
for the LA Times these
options didn't really exist.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.390
Do you think about
that more acutely now?

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.700
It's not just I write this
thing, I give it to them,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.010
it goes into the newspaper.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.330
Are you thinking about
building audience

00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.631
or trying new forms
of storytelling?

00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.380
NAOMI ORESKES: OK.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.088
To me, those are two
different questions.

00:54:00.088 --> 00:54:02.130
In terms of the
format, not so much.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:06.060
I mean different
things come your way.

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.050
I love radio.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.810
I have to say radio is my
favorite thing because you just

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:10.650
talk.

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.450
It's like you get in
that booth and it's

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.850
like you're in the zone and
everything else drops away.

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.100
You don't have to worry about
the bags under your eyes

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.058
or what you're wearing.

00:54:18.058 --> 00:54:20.580
So I just love radio and I
always say yes the opportunity

00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.371
to be on the radio.

00:54:21.371 --> 00:54:23.730
So don't be afraid of radio.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.490
Radio is an academic's dream
come true because it's you

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.860
and your words and
your voice so I just

00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:31.290
think radio is fantastic.

00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:33.180
I wouldn't say that
it's changed how

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.820
I think about what I'm doing.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.320
I'm not sitting
around thinking, oh,

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.630
could I do a podcast on this?

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.400
I'm not doing that,
although maybe I will--

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.140
I don't know.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.782
But in terms of the
storytelling part,

00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:46.240
absolutely definitely
and actually,

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.090
my great postdoc,
Jeff Zupan, is here

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:51.510
who's working with me right
now on a kind of novel approach

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:53.550
to climate change solutions.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:56.850
So yes, I've certainly been
thinking about that for a while

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.575
and I would say my
work with journalists

00:54:59.575 --> 00:55:01.950
and the work I've done trying
to reach a broader audience

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:03.990
has certainly made
me think much more

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:08.640
about how we tell
our stories and why,

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.480
as academics, what some of
the obstacles are for us.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.420
That as academics, we
have certain conventions

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.390
of academic life that
we subscribe to that

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.640
absolutely do get in the way--

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.300
no question about that.

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.330
And so I think where
I'm at right now

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.610
and I hope Judy's
listening very closely,

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.320
I'm not so much
interested in changing

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.680
what I do for journalists.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:33.180
I'm pretty happy
with what I've done

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.340
in the journalistic
popular domain.

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.510
It's more like I think I'd
like to become involved now

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:41.700
in a movement to change how
academics write for each other

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.390
because I've come to think I
don't actually understand why

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.930
we, as academics, insist
on writing books that

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:52.080
are excruciatingly boring
and that no one will read.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.870
I mean it makes no sense
to me and I'm fully

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.362
tenured so I can say this now--

00:55:56.362 --> 00:55:57.820
and I'm not looking
for another job

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.360
and I don't want to be a dean.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.070
But really, I mean
it's really this kind

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.520
of extremely interesting mystery
about how and why we write

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.170
these incredibly
boring books that only

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.794
17 other people in
our field would read

00:56:08.794 --> 00:56:10.530
and it wasn't always that way.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:12.742
And as a historian of
science, I can tell you

00:56:12.742 --> 00:56:14.700
that we had Harvard
professors of geology right

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.920
here in this institution
who, in the 1920s,

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.880
were writing bestsellers
about continental drift, what

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.250
would have been considered
a very academic topic.

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:27.180
So some of the issues about
why we, as academics, do

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.770
the things we do,
so I'd like to see

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.580
the academic side of this
world begin to move and shift

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:36.300
and think more about who our
audience is and why have we

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.075
defined our audience in such
an excruciating now way.

00:56:39.075 --> 00:56:40.450
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
That's great.

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:42.360
And, Iris, the last word to you.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.040
If somebody comes
to you, are you

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.231
putting a premium on how
innovative the approach might

00:56:47.231 --> 00:56:47.730
be?

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:51.090
Are you looking for new
ways of storytelling?

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.650
IRIS ADLER: We're
pretty committed

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:54.540
to podcast development
I mean I would

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:59.760
say that's, as a senior manager,
90% of my job right now.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:05.940
We kind of understand that
nobody under the age of 40,

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.290
let's say, owns a
radio and that even--

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.650
no, they don't, they listen
on iPhones or their iPads

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:16.170
and even cars which are
now internet connected.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:20.220
We're going to lose that
listening platform, as well,

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.960
listening to radios in cars.

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:25.830
So we're very committed to
developing innovative content

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.030
in the digital space.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:31.470
And for us right now, that means
audio because it's on demand

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:35.010
and it's portable and that's
what these generations coming

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:38.490
up expect and want just like we
do with television, et cetera.

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:42.150
So we're very
committed to podcasting

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:45.489
and I'm happy to say we
produced a very successful one

00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:46.530
with The Times this year.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.090
We took their
"Modern Love" column

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.250
and we produced it as a podcast.

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:53.370
You should go to iTunes and
subscribe if you haven't yet.

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:56.760
We're on the verge, just
hiring people right now,

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.650
working with The
Boston Globe to produce

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:03.870
a podcast on the Isabella
Stewart Gardner theft

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:07.320
as a kind of eight part
serial like series.

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:14.820
And so we're always looking
for great content and voices

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.597
for podcasts.

00:58:15.597 --> 00:58:16.680
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Great.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.820
Thank you.

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.840
So I wanted to turn to
you all for your questions

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:25.130
for our guests today and
my guess is you have many.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:26.610
And if I could
just ask, if people

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.590
would introduce
themselves before they

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:29.916
ask their questions.

00:58:34.332 --> 00:58:35.790
AUDIENCE: My name
is Peter Girguis.

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:37.956
I'm in the Department of
Organismic and Evolutionary

00:58:37.956 --> 00:58:38.641
Biology.

00:58:38.641 --> 00:58:39.640
Thank you all very much.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.186
This was fantastic.

00:58:41.186 --> 00:58:42.060
I have two questions.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.650
I'll start with one that's
more straightforward

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.275
and one that might
be more challenging.

00:58:45.275 --> 00:58:48.630
The first is I think
Iris addressed this.

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.720
To what extent are you open
to academics and others

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.390
bringing you something
that they have developed

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:58.650
if it moves beyond a podcast,
some sort of innovative way

00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:00.840
of communicating what
we do to the public?

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.840
And how might you expect
your various institutions

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:10.770
to engage these maybe sort
of more innovative, if not

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:12.580
unconventional, ways
of communicating?

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:13.250
So first one.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.400
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Do
you have an example?

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.025
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:15.025 --> 00:59:18.150
So let's say that there is--

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.610
this is a kind of shooting
from the hip here example,

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:23.400
but let's say that I'm
a deep sea biologist

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.390
and I'm interested in engaging
the broader public in helping

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.610
me identify and characterize
some of these deep sea

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:31.080
organisms that
people haven't seen

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:34.630
before, just sort of the
citizen science movement, right?

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:37.530
And so let's say I have a web
platform or an app or something

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:40.110
that allows folks
to do this and let's

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:41.490
say there's broad engagement.

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.050
To what extent or how might I
approach you all to say, hey,

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:45.930
can you help me
get this word out?

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:48.820
Is that something that your
office does or another office?

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.422
So that's an example.

00:59:50.422 --> 00:59:52.630
The second question is the
bigger more difficult one.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:54.020
IRIS ADLER: Can I just stop
you there for a second?

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:56.296
IRIS ADLER: Never use
the words will you

00:59:56.296 --> 00:59:58.950
help me get the word out
because that immediately

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:02.606
signals to us that this is a
sort of PR kind of request.

01:00:02.606 --> 01:00:03.272
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:00:03.272 --> 01:00:03.450
Understood.

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.100
So perhaps then to
rephrase it, to what

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.550
extent are you interested
in being a part of this?

01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:13.050
So the second question is,
how are you all viewing

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:16.140
this change in the
way information

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.870
and rather misinformation is
being presented as information

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:25.230
and how do we engage with
you all on topics like that.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:29.250
So if there is a
position or an idea

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:36.090
we have that touches
upon that sort

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:39.526
of the fake news
and the like, where

01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:40.650
are those boundaries drawn?

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:43.050
Frankly, how do you
all as journalists

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.150
decide what is and
isn't ethically

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:48.920
appropriate to take a position
on or does that rest with us?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.462
If you see where
I'm going with that.

01:00:50.462 --> 01:00:53.045
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: So maybe if
we could get one or two of you

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:55.730
to answer the first question
and then one or two of you to--

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:59.880
I mean, we could spend the day
on fake news which many of us

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.570
are obsessing about
and it's not just

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.490
coming from those who would
intentionally do harm,

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:11.391
it's coming from our
own industry, frankly.

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:13.640
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I'm happy
to tackle the first one.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.020
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: OK.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:14.500
Go, Katie.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.583
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I think
that we have actually,

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:19.060
at the Idea section,
we have actually

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.091
experimented a lot with trying
to work with academics where

01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:23.590
they are.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:26.650
So one of the things that I
was going to bring up before I

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:30.527
started talking about the
assault rifle campaign was that

01:01:30.527 --> 01:01:32.860
one of the things that we've
been doing lately is taking

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:39.730
artifacts or different
manuscripts and transcripts

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:44.260
and things like that and having
academics essentially annotate

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.760
them for us and have it be kind
of an actual back and forth

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.630
about a document or something--
a piece of science or--

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:56.260
One of the things that is going
to be in the paper on Sunday

01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.130
is some MIT professors
have come up

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:03.130
with these mathematical quizzes.

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.600
And they're making
a broader point,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:07.750
but we're working on how to
make them online and make

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.430
them interactive.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.870
If you have
something like an app

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.204
that you wanted to
work with us on,

01:02:13.204 --> 01:02:14.620
we would probably
figure out a way

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.790
to repurpose it and
put it in our paper

01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:22.320
or put it online
and then include

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.520
an introduction or something
that directs traffic.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.061
I mean, I think that
there are always

01:02:26.061 --> 01:02:28.510
ways to work these things
out and I, personally,

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:31.010
have always been open to trying
to find a solution on those.

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:34.570
And so I would never hesitate
to kind of approach an editor

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:36.880
with a project like
that as long as you're

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.630
going into it with an open mind
that the solution might not

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.622
be one that works for you, too.

01:02:42.622 --> 01:02:43.330
IRIS ADLER: Yeah.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:46.810
I think it depends
a little bit how

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:49.510
mission central your
project might be to us.

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:53.680
If it's this fascinating new
way of understanding this world

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.680
that you describe and there's a
way that it can be incorporated

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.460
into our platforms and
be of joint benefit

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.950
editorially to
you as well as us,

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:06.730
we're always open
to those ideas.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:10.888
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: And
on the fake news issue?

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:12.950
JAMES DAO: You're looking at me.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:15.550
So actually, I'm not entirely
sure I understand the question,

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:19.040
but fake news is just a
big news story right now

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.940
and how it exists and how it
was disseminated the way it was

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.640
and why people
believed it are all

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.070
like fascinating
elements of a news story

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.010
that we're also weighing
in as an Op-Ed page.

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.119
There's questions about
how social media--

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:33.160
we've ran a couple of
pieces in the Sunday Review

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.510
a couple of weeks ago about
how it's easy to game Facebook

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:40.210
and Reddit, for instance,
to disseminate this stuff

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.970
and there's a huge appetite
for it and it's profitable.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:45.600
And our News section came
out with a similar story

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.350
a few days later.

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.960
In terms of whether
we, as the Op-Ed page,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.850
are susceptible to fakery is,
of course, always been a problem

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:55.930
and always been an issue.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:04:01.110
And the way we deal with it
is we have fact checkers.

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:04.330
The front line editors and
there's about a dozen of them

01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:07.570
that work with me, part of
their job is to fact check,

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:09.670
but we also have a
team of fact checkers

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.410
that go through everything.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:16.180
And every piece gets at least
some basic fact checking.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.367
But because we are opinion,
we're allowing for a certain--

01:04:19.367 --> 01:04:21.700
is not the stretching of fact,
but we're allowing people

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:26.710
to use what they can
say is demonstrably

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:30.820
reasonably provable fact
to build an argument.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.580
And if the basic foundation
of that is true and checkable,

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.130
then that passes our first line
test of whether we'll run it

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.150
or not.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.900
NAOMI ORESKES: Can I
engage you, though,

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.350
in a question related
to this because a lot

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.560
of my work in the last 10
years has been about not--

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.010
I wouldn't call it fake news,
but disinformation promoted

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:55.760
by people for various reasons
and the promotion of what

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.520
I think people now
call false equivalence.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.060
And there's no question that
the mainstream media are

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.810
part of this story because
of the so many times

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:08.327
that mainstream
media have quoted,

01:05:08.327 --> 01:05:10.160
let's say, at least in
the realm of science,

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.800
nonscientific sources
like the Cato Institute

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.760
on a question of science about
which any scientist would

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.670
have agreed that what the
Cato Institution was saying

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.130
was not correct
scientifically, not

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.380
supported by scientific facts.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.540
And yet in an article in The
New York Times, Washington Post,

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.570
The Boston Globe,
you know wherever,

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.987
you would see those quotations
juxtaposed with a scientist,

01:05:32.987 --> 01:05:34.820
therefore creating the
impression that there

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.153
was a scientific debate which,
as I've shown in my work,

01:05:37.153 --> 01:05:40.010
is the whole point of
that kind of thing.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:42.770
So that's one
question I have is I

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:46.460
guess my perception from my
view is that the media, the news

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.490
media, have not been as
alert to that problem

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:51.704
as I think they need to
be-- that's one thing.

01:05:51.704 --> 01:05:53.870
And even though many
journalists I've talked to say,

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.078
oh, we don't do that anymore.

01:05:55.078 --> 01:05:56.810
We don't make that
mistake anymore.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:00.500
We know we shouldn't do that,
yet I see it all the time.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.620
And then the other part has
to do with the Opinion page

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.480
and this is a tricky
one because, obviously,

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.930
opinion pages are opinions.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.040
But I have seen cases-- and I'm
going to be specific to The New

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.160
York Times now because
I'm using facts--

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.650
where someone on
the opinion page,

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:19.049
either a guest writer or
one of your own columnists--

01:06:19.049 --> 01:06:21.590
and if you're interested, later,
I can tell you offline who--

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:24.440
has said something in an
opinion a matter of fact

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.500
that was demonstrably false
and used a false claim

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.177
to build the opinion piece.

01:06:29.177 --> 01:06:31.010
And one time-- this
happened a few years ago

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:33.830
before I had friends on the
editorial page who I would now

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.136
reach out to and call--
but where this happened

01:06:36.136 --> 01:06:37.760
with a particular
columnist where I had

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.260
seen it happen more than once.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.080
And on the third time, it
happened to be about a topic

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.270
that I knew very well that
one of my own students

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:47.060
had written their honors
thesis on was a claim that

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.340
was demonstrably false--

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.000
I had the documentation.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.030
And I did send something
to The New York Times,

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:54.145
never received any reply.

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:58.300
Yeah.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.720
And that false claim is now,
if you go to The New York Times

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.330
microfiche, it's there.

01:07:05.330 --> 01:07:07.070
So I guess I have two questions.

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:10.460
One is about how you think
about it, but the more important

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.251
question, I think, for this
audience is, what should we do?

01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:14.750
So we're reading
The New York Times,

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:17.870
we see something that we know is
false as scholars and academics

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.510
who have worked on
it, yet it's now there

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.760
in The New York Times.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.800
What is the right
way for us to try

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.860
to engage with you to try to
correct something like that

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.715
and prevent that
from happening again?

01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:31.050
JAMES DAO: Sure.

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:33.410
So we pride ourselves
in how many corrections

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:35.050
we run and we run a lot.

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.930
And they can be
unbelievably arcane,

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.990
but it's a crucial
part of what we do.

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:48.440
And as both the newsroom
employee and a newsroom editor

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.260
and now the Op-Ed
editor, I generally

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.950
believe that we should err on
the side of correcting when

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:58.120
we can, because sometimes
it is a little bit

01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.870
hard to get to get to
ground truth on some

01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:01.560
of the issues that come up.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.460
But the columnists, believe
it or not, make mistakes.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.690
In fact, I woke up this
morning to two complaints

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:12.350
about columns over the weekend
and we will take that up

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:12.854
with them.

01:08:12.854 --> 01:08:14.270
They have their
own fact checkers.

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:19.040
They try to run this stuff
through their own process,

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.149
but journalism is an
incredibly imperfect process

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:25.970
and that goes for
the Op-Ed page, too.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:30.020
We are a self-correcting
institution

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.189
and we self-correct in two ways.

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:36.350
Sometimes, when there's
a clear factual error

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.620
that somebody can tell us
is a clear factual error,

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.880
we will push--

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.939
most editors attitude is we
will do a correction on it

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:45.920
and that will go
online under the piece

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.680
as well as in the paper.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.340
Sometimes, the
problems of coverage

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.529
are more nuanced or complicated
and they're not simple facts.

01:08:56.529 --> 01:08:58.520
And we correct by
trying to come up

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.979
with different viewpoints or
different types of stories

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:03.140
to broaden the
understanding of an issue

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:07.102
beyond what might have been a
less than accurate portrayal.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:09.560
NAOMI ORESKES: But if I can
just press slightly, I'm sorry,

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.490
but what should we do?

01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:12.698
Because when I did reach
out, I never got a response.

01:09:12.698 --> 01:09:14.979
And how do we communicate
with you about these issues?

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:16.062
JAMES DAO: There is this--

01:09:16.062 --> 01:09:18.620
I'll be honest, I don't
know where you find it,

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.680
but we have a corrections
editor for the entire news

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.450
organization.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.200
NAOMI ORESKES: You
mean the public editor?

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.844
JAMES DAO: No, you can go to
the public editor, if you want,

01:09:25.844 --> 01:09:27.920
and a public editor
may take it up

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.370
or they may send the note to me.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.140
But there is an editor
who just handles

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:33.859
corrections for the entire--

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:34.310
NAOMI ORESKES: So
that's the right place

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.435
to go, not the Op-Ed page.

01:09:35.435 --> 01:09:36.560
JAMES DAO: And I'm trying--

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.910
I don't know the email off
hand, but it's probably

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:44.910
where you find corrections
in the newspaper.

01:09:44.910 --> 01:09:47.561
You will see an email there
and you send your correction

01:09:47.561 --> 01:09:50.060
to there and, believe it or
not, they go through all of them

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.210
and then they either
dispel them immediately

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.370
if it doesn't look like
it's a correctable error

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.050
or they send it off
to people like me

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:59.756
and then I give it to
another editor who will then

01:09:59.756 --> 01:10:00.880
try to get to ground truth.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.720
So we are constantly
dealing-- and that's really--

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.520
if you know an editor, you
can always send them a note.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.510
NAOMI ORESKES: And that's
what I would do now.

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:09.343
Just curious, though,
because lots of people

01:10:09.343 --> 01:10:10.990
don't necessarily know editors.

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:15.460
JAMES DAO: But there is a public
process and it's laid out,

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.190
I think it's probably a whole
page on The Times website

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.250
that explains the
corrections process.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.740
IRIS ADLER: Yeah.

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.690
AUDIENCE: I am Brigitte
Madrian and I'm a professor

01:10:24.690 --> 01:10:25.940
at the Harvard Kennedy School.

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.610
I work on the behavioral
economics of household

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.440
financial decision making.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.290
I have, I guess, a more
logistical question.

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:36.290
So in my discipline,
economics, if you're

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.230
trying to publish
a paper, it would

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:41.870
be considered an
ethical violation

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.020
to submit your paper to
more than one journal

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.334
at the same time.

01:10:46.334 --> 01:10:48.500
On the other hand, if you're
trying to write a book,

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.540
you could shop your
book proposal around

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.090
to multiple publishers
and find the best deal.

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:55.610
So I guess I'm asking for those
of us who have never written

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:59.210
an Op-Ed before, what are
the ethical norms for getting

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:00.860
an Op-Ed published?

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.230
Can you only shop it
around one place at a time

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:05.000
so you have to do
it sequentially?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.690
Or could you send it to
200 different outlets

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:11.180
and if 150 of them
say they love it,

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.160
you could publish it
in all 150 of them?

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.650
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I would
say definitely, one at a time.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:21.980
Never offer an Op-Ed
to an editor that's not

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.485
an exclusive to that editor.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:31.040
JAMES DAO: Yeah, I
would second that.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.600
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
So can I just

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:35.000
then ask about the
tension between

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.750
that sequential offering and
earlier comments about you're

01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:44.480
getting things within
an hour of an event

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.150
and you want things
that are very--

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:49.850
three days from now is too late.

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:52.640
So that system presumes
that an editor's

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.460
getting back to you
instantly to say I love or I

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.200
don't love this piece.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.270
So how do you navigate
between those?

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:02.840
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I often
suggest putting an expire time

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.960
or date on your email
saying if I don't hear back

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.720
from you by this time, then I
will assume that you are not

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.070
interested and I will move on.

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:16.370
I frequently find myself,
I can't speak for Jim,

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:21.110
but I have 56,000 emails
that are unread right now.

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:22.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.710
NAOMI ORESKES: That
makes me feel better.

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:26.720
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I
literally get thousands

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.420
of e-mails every day and it's
a combination of the fact

01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:37.610
that I have always had a foot
in the newsroom and a foot

01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:43.940
in opinion and with ideas, we
did reported pieces and opinion

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:46.880
pieces so I think I get
more than most people.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.480
But the point
being, I often find

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.250
myself sending a note to
someone whose pitch I am reading

01:12:55.250 --> 01:13:00.140
a day later or two days later
then I should be and saying,

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.880
have you placed
this somewhere else?

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.680
I don't have the
expectation that you've

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.160
been waiting for me
to get back to you

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.510
because of that timeliness and
that importance and timeliness.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.200
So as long as you're
clear up front

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.710
saying, if I don't hear
from you by this time,

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.144
I think that's fair game to
move on to the next place.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.310
JAMES DAO: It's good advice.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:20.450
NAOMI ORESKES: I can
make one suggestion

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:21.800
that could be helpful, too.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.990
Sometimes, you might have
an idea for something,

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:25.970
like something's
coming up and you

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.860
anticipate that you might
have something to say.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.710
So one of the pieces
I'm most proud of

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.450
was one I did in
The Washington Post

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.840
when the fourth assessment
report of the IPCC came out.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.640
And I knew that wants
to report came out,

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.350
they would be swamped
with suggestions,

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:40.725
but I had an idea
for something I

01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:43.280
wanted to say in
advance of the release.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.410
And so I sent it to them
two weeks ahead of time.

01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:48.060
I said, here's a piece
that's anticipating

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.310
the release of the AR4.

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.040
I think this would be great
to run a couple of days

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.570
before it comes out.

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:56.840
And they did and that
piece got huge attention

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.324
because it was actually
ahead of the curve.

01:13:59.324 --> 01:14:00.740
And if you do
something like that,

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.156
then you have a
little bit of room

01:14:02.156 --> 01:14:04.592
to maneuver, too,
because as Kathleen said,

01:14:04.592 --> 01:14:06.550
often, editors don't get
back to you right away

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.300
and then you are in this awkward
position of am I waiting or am

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:09.957
I moving on?

01:14:09.957 --> 01:14:11.540
And usually, what I
do if that happens

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.942
is I'll send a follow up
saying, if you're interested,

01:14:13.942 --> 01:14:15.650
please let me know,
if not, I'm moving on

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:16.761
and then you can move on.

01:14:16.761 --> 01:14:18.760
But definitely, if you
can anticipate and get it

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.310
in ahead of time, that gives you
both a bit of room to maneuver.

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:24.830
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: That's
great, great, great advice.

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:26.390
I mean, editors are
always assigning

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:30.570
their reporters
anticipatorily-- is that a word?

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:32.510
And so to think
about that for Op-Eds

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.060
is a really good
piece of advice.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.284
You had your hand up.

01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:36.950
AUDIENCE: I did?

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:37.560
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
Oh, you didn't.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.161
OK.

01:14:38.161 --> 01:14:39.410
AUDIENCE: Well, I sort of did.

01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:40.743
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Sort of did?

01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:42.452
AUDIENCE: It was a
follow up to this--

01:14:42.452 --> 01:14:43.380
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
Jeff, say who you are.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:43.850
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:44.720
I'm Jeffrey Zupan.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:47.470
I'm Naomi's postdoc.

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:49.090
It was a follow up
to that discussion

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.110
where I've often
been in a situation

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.360
where there's a
timeliness to an issue

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.907
and you'd love for it to
have the impact of The Times

01:14:55.907 --> 01:14:57.240
or Globe or something like that.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.737
But you have a
Huffington Post blog

01:14:58.737 --> 01:15:00.320
and you could just
post it in an hour.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.884
And so there's that
deliberation as to how long--

01:15:03.884 --> 01:15:05.300
you say you're not
waiting for us,

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.591
but we're waiting for you,
like we'd love to hear back.

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:10.340
So is it appropriate
to literally

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.680
give you just five hours
notice or something like that?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.510
I always felt rude putting
such a hard time stamp.

01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:20.450
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I think it's
really a case by case basis.

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:25.540
If it's something like you want
to respond to claims that there

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:31.890
has been a genocide in x country
and that news has just broke,

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:37.390
then I think giving
editors five hours is fine.

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:41.250
I think if it's something
that is a week from now,

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:45.120
we know this report is going
to be released, give me

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:45.780
a day or two.

01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:51.000
And I also think the
other thing I would add

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.990
is it's always appropriate to
follow up because there are

01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:57.510
often times when I
miss the first email,

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:59.410
but the second email
for some reason--

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.500
it's quieter or there's
something happening

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.530
and I can get to it faster.

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:11.680
But I would say you're
selling something

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.680
when you're trying to put
your opinion out there

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.270
and you have every right
to say this offer expires,

01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.870
I would say.

01:16:21.279 --> 01:16:22.279
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Yes.

01:16:24.879 --> 01:16:25.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:28.357
I'm Melani Cammett from
the Government department

01:16:28.357 --> 01:16:30.190
and I have a question
that's sort of related

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:33.820
to the fake news question,
which is are you perceiving

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.940
that expertise is
more discredited now

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.380
or taken less seriously?

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.090
I'm asking for a
particular reason.

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:43.124
I was in a social situation
about six months ago--

01:16:43.124 --> 01:16:45.790
and I work on the Middle East, I
specialize in the Middle East--

01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:49.960
and I was absolutely shocked
at how many statements

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.119
were made that were
completely wrong about Islam

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:52.910
in the Middle East.

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:55.210
So I got it in my head
to write this book aimed

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.170
at the general public correcting
some of this misinformation.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:01.180
And I actually gave
up the idea because I

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.220
became convinced
after conversations

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.510
with colleagues that
my expertise would not

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.780
be taken seriously by precisely
the people I want to target.

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.970
And so I've been
sort of wrestling

01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:15.010
with whether it's
worth bothering

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.155
with this sort of thing
and also whether--

01:17:17.155 --> 01:17:18.640
and this relates
to Naomi's point

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.000
about where we place our pieces.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.640
If I'm writing something
about how Muslims

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.530
do not actually
disproportionately blow

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.280
themselves up or
something like that.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:32.500
Is this better
pitched at an outlet

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.615
that's not The New York
Times or The Boston Globe

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:37.240
or something like that so that
I reach a more general audience?

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.072
Or is my likelihood of getting
discredited higher elsewhere?

01:17:42.072 --> 01:17:43.327
Thank you.

01:17:43.327 --> 01:17:44.785
JAMES DAO: That's
a tough question.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:45.280
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: I know.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.830
I think you've kind of put
your finger on the larger

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:52.150
existential question that
our industry is really

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:55.960
doing some soul
searching on right now.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.260
I think that if you're placing
something with The Boston

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.146
Globe, you sort of
know the audience that

01:18:01.146 --> 01:18:02.770
is going to be reading
The Boston Globe

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.410
or The New York
Times going into it.

01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.150
I would love to
say that you should

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:09.850
be broader in your
thinking in terms

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:12.984
of where you're placing things.

01:18:12.984 --> 01:18:15.400
I think that one of the issues
we saw in the last election

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.940
is the fact that we have seen
the erosion of news outlets,

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.430
particularly in the middle
part of the country,

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.290
given the financial
circumstances

01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:24.940
that our industry finds itself.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:28.420
That said, you are
opening yourself up.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:32.055
I actually often feel
like I'm a therapist as

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:33.430
much as anything
when I'm dealing

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.134
with particularly new writers.

01:18:35.134 --> 01:18:36.550
And I have to
explain, like you're

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:37.810
putting yourself on a page.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:41.740
We had a piece that a writer,
an academic at Berkeley

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.350
wrote for us about
sexual assault

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:46.780
and her own personal
experiences with it.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.670
And I literally had to--

01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:52.480
I went back and forth with
her repeatedly about the fact

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.360
that she was really putting
her own personal experiences

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:59.830
for the world to read and then
the comments were horrific.

01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:04.270
And I felt like we had done
a lot of work to prepare her

01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:06.010
for that I just didn't--

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:07.776
that she was very upset.

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:10.150
And so I feel like that that's
the one thing I always say

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:12.580
is make sure you know what
you're getting into, too, when

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.330
you're offering your
opinion, particularly

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:17.410
on a controversial subject,
that you know going into it

01:19:17.410 --> 01:19:19.850
there are going to be people
who disagree with you.

01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:21.360
NAOMI ORESKES: I don't think
you should give up, though.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.485
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: No, no.

01:19:22.485 --> 01:19:25.009
NAOMI ORESKES: I think,
actually, the harder it is,

01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:26.050
the more important it is.

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:26.905
Right?

01:19:26.905 --> 01:19:27.004
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Yeah.

01:19:27.004 --> 01:19:27.400
It's a good point.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.420
NAOMI ORESKES: And
I think there are

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.961
things you can do
to protect yourself

01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:33.250
and maybe we should have
another session for us academics

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:35.050
to talk about how
to protect yourself,

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:36.550
because I'm trying
to figure out how

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:38.650
come my name got taken
off that list of the 40

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.952
horrible liberal professors--

01:19:40.952 --> 01:19:42.160
anyway, that's another story.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.190
But there are a lot of
people in this country who

01:19:45.190 --> 01:19:46.570
want to hear what
you have to say

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:48.610
and the trick is to figure
out how to reach them

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:49.900
and that means working
with your editor

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.983
to think about strategies.

01:19:50.983 --> 01:19:53.320
And one thing I learned
after my last book

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.530
that I'm taking forward
into my next project--

01:19:56.530 --> 01:20:00.200
and this gets back to the whole
fly over country problem--

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.240
I hate that expression.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.980
But most book editors, like
most newspaper editors,

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.320
are very focused on certain
populations in New York,

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:10.820
Boston, Los Angeles,
San Francisco,

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.820
people who buy books,
people who buy newspapers,

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:15.400
people who still subscribe to
newspapers, and that's great

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.985
and those people are important
and we are those people.

01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:20.110
But there are a lot of
other people in other places

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:23.740
who will buy books and read
books if you reach out to them,

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.459
but your editor
won't send you them

01:20:25.459 --> 01:20:27.250
because your editor's
business model is not

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:29.310
based on Des Moines--

01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:30.490
I keep coming back to Iowa.

01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:32.750
I was obviously out
of my mind right now.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.630
But you can negotiate
with your editor.

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.910
And I learned this in
my last book project

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:38.740
because my editor was
just going to send me

01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:41.830
to five big cities,
urban markets,

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:44.230
but people reached out to
me and I went on a book tour

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:44.890
in Kansas.

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:46.620
I went to three
cities in Kansas--

01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.394
Lawrence, Hays, and Manhattan.

01:20:48.394 --> 01:20:50.560
It was one of the best
things I ever did in my life.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.050
And to this day, I
carry with me the woman

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:54.820
I met in Hays, Kansas.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.670
So I went to Hays, Kansas
to talk about climate change

01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:01.240
in a very, very, very red place
surrounded by wheat fields

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.060
and this woman came up to me
and she said, God bless you

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.280
for coming Hays.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.380
So I mean, you can
reach people, but you

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.750
have to go to where
they are and there

01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:11.890
are strategies to do that.

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:13.880
And I think we could
talk about that

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.120
and I'd love to talk more
about that, actually.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.846
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Yes.

01:21:20.846 --> 01:21:23.220
AUDIENCE: I'm Tyler VanderWeele,
School of Public Health.

01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.680
I was wondering if any of
you had additional balm

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.570
to offer to the
paranoid academic who

01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:31.210
would like to keep in all of
the caveats and exceptions.

01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:36.420
I recently published an
Op-Ed on protective effects

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.970
of religious
participation on health.

01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:42.990
And after the editor was done
with my carefully constructed

01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:45.240
piece, while I could
see how it was much more

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.829
appealing to a general audience,
made me cringe a little bit.

01:21:47.829 --> 01:21:49.620
Is this something that
we just kind of need

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.740
to deal with and get over or
do you have further advice you

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.560
might give to those of
us who find ourselves

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.765
in such a position?

01:21:56.765 --> 01:21:58.140
IRIS ADLER: I
think you just need

01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.450
to keep on focusing
on the impact

01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:03.510
that you're going to have by
getting your pieces published.

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:07.800
that's the price that you're
paying in spite of the fact

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.770
that it might be contrary
to all of your training

01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:12.264
and all of your instincts.

01:22:12.264 --> 01:22:13.680
And quite frankly,
that's why it's

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.230
so hard to work with
academics because they

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:22.032
know they hold and cherish these
sort of rules in their head

01:22:22.032 --> 01:22:23.490
about how they
should write and how

01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:25.500
they should express
them self very dearly,

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:26.980
and it's understandable.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.620
That's how they've been trained.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:33.300
But you just have to think
of the greater impact

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.610
that you will have by
sort of letting go of that

01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:37.050
and just suck it up and do it.

01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:38.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:42.960
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: I want to
be clear to underscore that it's

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:48.150
not an anti-intellectualism
or anything like that

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:53.130
that motivates that
response from journalists.

01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.980
I spent nine years on
the Pulitzer Prize Board

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:58.260
and for those books,
we spent a lot

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.870
of time talking
about the footnotes

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:04.860
because that was very
important to that form.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:09.630
It's a different form and it
has different conventions.

01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:14.910
So one is absolutely
essential for one form

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:17.190
and a different
convention absolutely

01:23:17.190 --> 01:23:20.340
essential for building an
audience with the other form.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.175
So you just have to kind
of think of it that way

01:23:23.175 --> 01:23:24.130
and let go.

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:26.640
IRIS ADLER: I think
it's also important

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.030
that we really have hard
data now, all of us,

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:32.940
on our online
writings and columns.

01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.820
When did people stop
reading, at what point?

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.590
And we have it for
the radio, too.

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:40.230
At what point did they stop
listening to that story?

01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:47.310
And it's not that we don't
want to go long and deep as you

01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:49.380
might want to, it's
just that we really

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:52.500
understand with very hard
data that people are going

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.310
to just stop paying attention.

01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:59.610
JAMES DAO: Ann Marie,
can I just say we all

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:01.320
represent opinion
sections so we want

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.528
you to have a point of view
and so that point of view

01:24:03.528 --> 01:24:05.880
has to be clear and
if it's not, you

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.940
publish it in some other place.

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:14.870
But that said, we often
want Op-Eds or long essays,

01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:18.665
whichever, to reflect you
know the counter argument

01:24:18.665 --> 01:24:21.270
and to the degree
you can explain

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:23.880
what that counter-argument
is concisely

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:27.780
and accurately, it makes for
a better piece, almost always.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:29.640
Of course, you're
setting it up accurately

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.760
so you can knock it down.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.395
But that should be
part-- it doesn't

01:24:33.395 --> 01:24:34.770
have to be a part
of every Op-Ed,

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:38.110
but that's often a part of
a very successful Op-Ed.

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.610
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY:
Sorry, I'll just

01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:42.510
add, the one other thing I
would say is trust your editor,

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:46.710
especially if you're working
with a reputable publication.

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:49.350
You can push back if you
think, for instance, a headline

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:53.689
goes too far or something,
but we do do this for a living

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:55.980
and we do have a sense of
what people are going to read

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:59.530
and what people are
going to respond to.

01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:04.720
And so I often get
pushback that how could

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:09.690
I possibly choose to take this
paragraph out, it's essential.

01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:13.390
But there is actually thinking
behind why we're doing that.

01:25:15.796 --> 01:25:17.920
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: Does
anyone have a question who

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.470
hasn't asked a question first?

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:21.020
No?

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:21.520
OK.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.984
Go ahead.

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:24.650
AUDIENCE: This is
just a quick follow up

01:25:24.650 --> 01:25:26.149
to what the gentleman
asked earlier.

01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:28.160
So I've had great experiences
with most editors.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.470
On rare occasion, I
come across an editor

01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:35.052
who has really taken what
they've gotten from me

01:25:35.052 --> 01:25:37.010
and used it to convey a
very different message.

01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:40.610
So at what point does my
ownership over those ideas

01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:42.590
begin and so on?

01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:44.720
And is it appropriate for
me to say, sorry, I don't

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.400
want to be a part of this?

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.100
JAMES DAO: Yeah, totally.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:46.490
Absolutely.

01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:47.781
KATHLEEN KINGSBURY: Absolutely.

01:25:50.190 --> 01:25:53.270
JAMES DAO: We view-- and if this
was a New York Times editor,

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:55.970
you let me know-- we view our
role as helping you to make

01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:58.400
your argument, not to make our--

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.790
most of us, we're running pieces
regularly that have arguments

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:06.470
that we think are daft or
terrible or wrong headed,

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:08.120
but that's what we do.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:09.460
That's what the Op-Ed is.

01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.460
That's the Op in
Op-Ed, to some degree.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:15.000
So you should always--

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.670
it is your piece.

01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.710
If you don't like where it's
going, then you pull it.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:20.990
If it's right on deadline.

01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:22.810
I may not use you again, but--

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:23.840
I'm kidding.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:29.330
But we always send playbacks
of the edited versions and very

01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:32.480
often people pitch a fit at the
last minute and we try to work

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.682
out a compromise,
and if we can't--

01:26:34.682 --> 01:26:36.140
it's never happened
under my watch,

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:39.110
but I'm sure there's been cases
where people pull their pieces.

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.950
NAOMI ORESKES: I
have to go to class,

01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:42.491
but I wanted to just add because
this is so important for you

01:26:42.491 --> 01:26:45.140
guys on the supply side.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.105
That does happen and I've
had great experiences

01:26:47.105 --> 01:26:48.980
with almost all the
editors I've worked with,

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:49.979
learned a lot from them.

01:26:49.979 --> 01:26:52.280
Totally agree like your
editor is an expert

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.230
and you should trust
them, but I recently

01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:56.060
did have an experience
with a piece that

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.370
had gone back and forth,
worked closely with an editor.

01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:01.300
I was happy, he was
happy, all good.

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.320
And at the 11th hour,
I mean literally,

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.890
like 11 o'clock at night on the
night before this was supposed

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:09.920
to run, he came back with a
change that had been suggested

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.480
by his boss--

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.100
we won't say what
newspaper it was--

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.260
and it was unacceptable to me.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:18.390
And I was actually very shocked
and I said to this editor

01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:19.640
who I had a relationship with.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.960
I said you can't be serious.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.829
Actually, to my mind,
completely undermined

01:27:26.829 --> 01:27:28.370
in a significant
way what I was doing

01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:30.140
and I just said
it's not acceptable.

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:34.190
I said either we get is that
or I'm pulling the piece.

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.500
And at that point, you have
leverage because they've

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.760
actually made a space.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.470
Not that they don't have other
things they could put in,

01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.390
of course, I'm sure you
have tons of things.

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:42.560
JAMES DAO: We've learned
our lesson on that.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:42.710
Yeah.

01:27:42.710 --> 01:27:44.660
NAOMI ORESKES: But the point
is it wasn't acceptable

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.110
and I just said
it's not acceptable.

01:27:46.110 --> 01:27:48.110
And then we went back and
forth a few more times

01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:49.970
and came up with a
compromise that was.

01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:52.190
So you have leverage,
especially at that last moment

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:55.700
and you shouldn't allow
anything to go forward that--

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.480
I mean, stylistic
things are one thing,

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.150
but if there's something
substantive that you are not

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:00.770
comfortable with,
you actually have

01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:03.020
to stop it because
that's your expertise

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.340
and credibility on the line.

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.589
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI: And the
last thing an editor wants

01:28:06.589 --> 01:28:09.979
is the person who wrote the
piece complaining publicly

01:28:09.979 --> 01:28:12.020
about how something was
distorted in their piece.

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.120
So it's just in
everybody's interest.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.800
And before we let
Naomi go, there

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.752
is one point I
wanted to bring up

01:28:17.752 --> 01:28:19.460
that maybe she could
just quickly address

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.830
before she goes to class.

01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:25.610
And that is I think I've
heard from, in particular,

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.910
from junior faculty, that it's
very hard sometimes to think

01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:32.300
about and to justify why
they should be spending time

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.150
doing this kind of
public work when they're

01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:38.780
so busy doing the work they
need to do to achieve tenure

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.352
or some other status--

01:28:41.352 --> 01:28:42.185
NAOMI ORESKES: Yeah.

01:28:42.185 --> 01:28:43.934
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
--and focus third time

01:28:43.934 --> 01:28:45.240
on academic publishing.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.990
And so I'm wondering
if you could just,

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:53.630
from a point of empathy, just
talk about that for a minute.

01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:56.030
What is the value of
doing this work when

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:58.497
you've got so much else to do?

01:28:58.497 --> 01:28:59.330
NAOMI ORESKES: Yeah.

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:01.400
That's a hard one
because I never

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.381
like to tell other
people what to do

01:29:03.381 --> 01:29:05.630
or how to live their lives,
but in terms of the value,

01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:07.770
I think that's a good way
of putting the question.

01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:10.682
I think there's a
couple of things.

01:29:10.682 --> 01:29:12.140
I think this election
really brings

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:15.077
home in a really serious way--

01:29:15.077 --> 01:29:16.910
a lot of people are
beating up on themselves

01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:18.650
about the election
and different things

01:29:18.650 --> 01:29:20.560
they could or should have done.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.359
And all I know is I
sleep well at night

01:29:22.359 --> 01:29:23.900
because I know for
the last 15 years,

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.420
I've been doing everything
possible that I can

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.499
from my vantage
point to communicate

01:29:28.499 --> 01:29:30.290
to the American people
about climate change

01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:31.623
and why it matters to our lives.

01:29:31.623 --> 01:29:35.060
So I sleep well at night
knowing that I've done my part

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.520
and that's, for me,
personally gigantic.

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:41.060
And I couldn't justify being
an ivory tower academic

01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.359
if I didn't personally
have that piece of my life.

01:29:43.359 --> 01:29:44.900
So it's just a really
personal thing.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.510
Other people will
feel differently.

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:50.540
On a less personal
note, I think the value

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:52.880
from a sort of
pragmatic standpoint

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.730
is that you actually do become
a better writer and better

01:29:55.730 --> 01:29:57.740
communicator when you
work with professionals

01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:59.210
like these amazing people here.

01:29:59.210 --> 01:30:02.030
This is my chance to suck up
to these wonderful people who

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:05.270
have taken the time to
come to be with us today.

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:08.270
Just like you want people
to respect your expertise,

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:09.450
they have expertise.

01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:13.200
Like Iris just said, they
have data at their fingertips.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.075
They have experience.

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.102
They know a lot
about what works.

01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:18.560
And when you work with them,
you learn from their expertise

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.320
and you become a better
writer and that carries over

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.210
into your teaching
and makes you better

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:26.372
able to reach your students, it
carries over into your pitches

01:30:26.372 --> 01:30:28.580
to publishers when you're
shopping those books around

01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:30.230
and your publisher
asks, well, who's

01:30:30.230 --> 01:30:33.080
going to read this other than
the 17 experts in Sanskrit

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.590
irregular verbs?

01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:35.090
Right?

01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:38.030
You have to make the
case for your work

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:41.312
on all kinds of
different levels--

01:30:41.312 --> 01:30:43.020
well, Liz isn't at
Harvard Press anymore,

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.050
but when you go to the
editor at Harvard Press.

01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:47.780
So being able to make
that pitch to boil it down

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:52.730
to say why somebody should take
the time to read my 800 page

01:30:52.730 --> 01:30:55.670
magnum ocean opus on the
history of cold war oceans.

01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:01.670
I'm much more able to
sell my academic work

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:05.650
as a result of having
done this more broader--

01:31:05.650 --> 01:31:07.400
I don't like to call
popular broader work.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:11.540
So I think it does make you
better at your job, overall.

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:14.680
That doesn't happen
overnight, but it does happen.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.150
And I know when I work
with my students now,

01:31:17.150 --> 01:31:19.790
Jeff will tell you, I'm always
hitting on my students now,

01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:20.820
what is the point here?

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.670
Why is this important?

01:31:22.670 --> 01:31:25.760
Why Should your reader
now spend the next three

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.590
days of his or her
life reading this book?

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:28.280
Right?

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.570
And that carries over
to everything you do.

01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:33.820
So I think that's the
pragmatic value answer.

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:35.570
ANN MARIE LIPINSKI:
That's a great answer.

01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:38.450
Thank you very much.

01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:42.930
I started by saying it was a
kind of a different time when

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:46.460
Judy first put this together
and a lot has changed

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.510
in the months since then.

01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:51.050
And the discussion here that
came up a couple of times

01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:56.630
about fake news
is really a huge--

01:31:56.630 --> 01:31:59.800
not so much development,
because it had been happening,

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.220
but a moment and a moment
for all of us to acknowledge.

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:10.820
And trust me, it's rocked our
industry in really significant

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:18.260
ways as well as the tech and
the social industry that is also

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.300
grappling with these issues.

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:24.380
But the cure for fake
news is factual news.

01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.840
The cure for lies is knowledge.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:31.850
And it is so
incredibly important

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:34.040
that you all think
about what role

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.550
you can play in that, at least
it is from my perspective.

01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:40.820
And I'm in a completely
share Naomi's view

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.710
of the value of that.

01:32:42.710 --> 01:32:48.180
So really on behalf
of the democracy,

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:55.010
to thank you all who have so
much knowledge and expertise,

01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:57.410
to thank you all for taking
the time to even think

01:32:57.410 --> 01:33:00.170
about this issue
and how you might

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:07.520
bring your voice to the
public in a stronger way.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:10.610
And then, please join
me before we break

01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:13.340
and let you talk to them
individually, if you'd like,

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.850
please join me in thanking
our three amazing panelists

01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:18.050
for their time.

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:20.800
[APPLAUSE]
