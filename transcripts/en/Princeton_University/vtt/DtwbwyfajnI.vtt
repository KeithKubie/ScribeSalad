00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.970
JARED CROOKS: It was my first
time attending High Table.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.470
And not knowing what to expect,
I thought it was

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.610
really fascinating because you
had a chance to mingle and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.150
talk with people from
all over the campus.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.410
My name is Jared
Aldwin Crooks.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.170
I was an undergraduate
here last year.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.440
In fact, I graduated in 2011
in the astrophysics

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.130
department.


00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.150
And now I'm back in as
a graduate student.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.320
We had this fascinating talk by
Professor Gmachl who talked

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.210
about her work through
electrical engineering.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.860
And even though I'm doing policy
here at the Woodrow

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.650
Wilson School, I went because
High Table really gives you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.600
that chance to just spread
your knowledge out and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.460
collaborate with others and
make collaborations.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.470
CLAIRE GMACHL: I'm
Claire Gmachl.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.800
I'm a professor of electrical
engineering here at Princeton

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.750
University.


00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.480
I really enjoyed the invitation
to the Princeton

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.120
graduate school High Table.


00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.040
What impressed me most was the
breadth of students that came.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.150
There were not just engineering
students or

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.820
science students, but students
across disciplines that came

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.370
and asked interesting
questions.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.250
DAVID REDMAN: The graduate
school at Princeton University

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.170
is comprised of four major
academic divisions: the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.880
humanities, the social
sciences, the natural

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.320
sciences, and the School of


00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.570
Engineering and Applied Science.


00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.320 position:97%
 


00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.110
We have, in addition, two other
professional schools,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.480
Woodrow Wilson School of Public
and International

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.030
Affairs and the School
of Architecture.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.300
JENNIFER HUYNH: My name
is Jennifer Huynh.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.570
I'm a PhD student in
the Department of

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.710
Sociology at Princeton.


00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.220
The environment here is very
collegial rather than

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.460
competitive.


00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.590
Students have access to multiple
departments to take

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.660
courses in.


00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.810
So, even though I'm a student
in the sociology department,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.790
I've taken courses in political
science, economics,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.990
the Woodrow Wilson School
of Public Policy.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.460
So, there's this wonderful
cross-fertilization of ideas.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.280
Professors and faculty are very
open to discussing with

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.090
you your academic interests.


00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.640
NICOLE SHELTON: I think just in
terms of general research,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.480
I always tell my students
to think big.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.600 position:97%
 


00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.580
This is an opportunity for you
to explore whatever it is that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.580
you want to do.


00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.370
And Princeton is a great place
for you to do that.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.060
And so, I encourage them
to shoot for the stars.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090
ROBERT KASTER: What to tell
you about Princeton?

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.880
It is for people in my field,
for people in the humanities,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.410
the best working environment
I have ever experienced in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.490
higher education.


00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.670
It is supportive.


00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.800
It is well-endowed
with resources.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.680
And it attracts people who love
what they're doing, who

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.960
in terms of the faculty
love to teach.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.410
No one comes to Princeton to
teach in the humanities who

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.660
does not enjoy having contact
with students.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.810
And that, I think, is the single
strongest aspect of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.870
having your education
at Princeton.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.510
ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: One of
the things I love about

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.400
Princeton is the combination of
a university that has been

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.730
here for hundreds of years
with state-of-the-art

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.470
technology and education.


00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.120
We have lots of traditions
that we're very proud of.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.750
One of them, for instance, for
graduate students is High

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.130
Table at the graduate college
where faculty members like me

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.960
go and present and then
talk to students at

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.660
dinner, at High Table.


00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.020
So, it's that combination of the
old and the new that gives

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.840
this place its special
character.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.280
One of the most wonderful
traditions is really the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.490
hooding ceremony.


00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.970
It is possible for the dean to
hood every single student the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.330
day before graduation.


00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.830
So, there's a marvelous ceremony
with all the friends

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.250
and family in the audience where
each student in academic

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.220
gowns comes up to the stage,
their name is called out.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.510
And as dean, I would put that
hood over that student's head

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.480
knowing that student and knowing
something about where

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.800
he or she had come from and
where they're going.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.710
CLAIRE GMACHL: I think it's a
wonderful graduate school.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.720
I was so impressed by the depth
of the questions and the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.260
breadth of the questions
that the students

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.750
asked at the High Table.


00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.770
I think it's a wonderful
reflection

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.000
of our student body.


00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.720
JARED CROOKS: If a school
doesn't have the mentors that

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.010
you need, then come to
Princeton because

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.880
we have them all.


00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.200
That's all I have to
say on that one.
