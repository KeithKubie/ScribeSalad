00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.680
Awesome job everyone.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.080
You made it through the to do list.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
That was kind of a whirlwind of new
technologies but you'll be rewarded for

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010
your effort once you get Mimi 1.0 up and
running.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.940
In implementing each
of these technologies,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.400
you will undoubtedly get
stucks at some point.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.930
Pretty much everyone does,
so don't sweat it.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.970
Just be sure to reach out
to your classmates and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.180
Udecy team members for help.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.980
Also, be sure to submit your project to
get feedback from our professional code

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.580
reviewers.
