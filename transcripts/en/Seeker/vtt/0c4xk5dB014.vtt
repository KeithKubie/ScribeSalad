00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.620
Fossil fuel energy is the most common type
of power plant in the United States, but solar

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.420
just hit a HUGE milestone that might make
them finally shine past the competition.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.210
For all the talk about solar panels being
better for the environment, they are still

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.810
notoriously inefficient… or were, until
now.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.529
Australian researchers from University of
New South Wales created the most efficient

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.030
solar panels ever; these new panels convert
46-percent of their sunlight energy into electricity.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.920
Typical rooftop panels hover around 15 percent
at best.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.960
This new technology works by distributing
the solar collection into three cells picking

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.710
sunlight up in multiple wavelengths, and then
reflecting the excess light at a fourth panel!

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.710
Genius!

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.760
So 46.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
Percent…

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Yep…

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.180
Ahem… [[pause]]

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.850
46% doesn't SOUND like much, does it?

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.850
Right?

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.850
It's less than half!

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.729
Traditionally, power plants usually use heat
to create steam and move turbines.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520
Those turbines generate the electric current.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.329
I bet you're as curious as I was about which
plants are the most efficient, but they're

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.270
doing better than a LOT of them.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.960
To calculate efficiency of a power plant,
you take the output power and heat, add that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.219
together, and divide by the total amount of
power produced.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.359
Essentially, you're accounting for the fact
that burning fuels is HOT, and you lose a

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.939
lot of heat in the power transfer.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.990
Let me give you an example, in the U.S., there
are over 1400 coal power plants burning this

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.159
fossil fuel at an efficiency of about 33%.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.060
Meaning two-thirds of ALL ENERGY from coal
in a plant designed to use coal to create

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.009
electricity is lost.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.039
Even the most efficient plants are only 45
percent.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.919
Nuclear energy, also measured by the previous
equation, ranges from the low 30s to the high

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:54.919
40s…

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:59.020
With the best, most heat efficient plants
topping out around 48-percent.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.079
As technology improves, and the population
has become more interested in environmental

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.630
protection, both coal and nuclear have become
more efficient.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.250
But if we're all honest with each other, making
the plant perform better isn't easy.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.420
Instead, a quick solution is to take the heat
exhaust and loop it back into the plant.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.939
This conserves those extra BTU's of heat,
rather than letting them float away into the

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:21.939
atmosphere.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.900
Some plants do this to conserve as much heat
as they can.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.959
They can also help burn the fuel more efficiently,
or fine tune the plant to keep it tip top.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.099
Unfortunately, wind power is the big loser
outside of commercial solar, but even with

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.329
that, they're running anywhere from 25 to
50 percent efficiency.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.030
It varies depending on the design, and the
location.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.849
Offshore wind farms run more often than on-shore
ones, but the efficiency depends on how hard

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.140
the wind is blowing and how much of that wind
power the turbine can harvest.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.709
Lots of scientists are working on making super
efficient wind power.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.450
Biomimicry is a big part of their recent advances,
with some scientists discovering that mimicking

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.969
sharks, whales or birds will help make the
installations capture more energy.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:12.959
This also informs the winner and champion
of ALL these power generation solutions -- hydroelectric.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.860
The biggest hydroelectric installations can
get a 95-percent efficiency, and even the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.780
smaller ones can still hit 85.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170
85 is a LOT more than the next closest.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.170
It's pretty incredible.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.109
But when you take into account the simplicity,
the eye is drawn right back to solar.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.379
Sure, coal and nuclear have a lot of bang
for their buck, solar needs a lot of space,

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:40.930
and sun… but while 46-percent didn't sound
like a lot before… an infinitely renewable,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.700
non-polluting energy solution that is essentially
equal in efficiency to other major generation

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.640
techniques sounds pretty darn good.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640
No?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.099
