PAUL LEWIS: The
thing that I love

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.620
most about being a web developer
is seeing what other web

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.820
developers do, because you
see a lot of creativity,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.000
you see a lot of
silliness, I suppose,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.170
and a lot of just experiments
and things like that.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.730
Whether it shows itself in
a library or a framework

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.450
or just pure here's a thing
I made, you see so much.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.490
And it's just wonderful to
have that open forum for people

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.640
to do that.
