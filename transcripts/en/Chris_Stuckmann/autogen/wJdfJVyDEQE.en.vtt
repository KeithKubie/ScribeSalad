written reviews actually which is
something that I think a lot of people

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
something that I think a lot of people
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630
something that I think a lot of people
do not know and so that's one of the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
do not know and so that's one of the
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580

I've actually done both and when I moved
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.190
I've actually done both and when I moved
over to doing video reviews I found that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
over to doing video reviews I found that
 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770
over to doing video reviews I found that
I was able to infuse so much more energy

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
I was able to infuse so much more energy
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.059
I was able to infuse so much more energy
physically

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
physically
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.009
physically
to a video then I was able to in my

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019
to a video then I was able to in my
 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.300
to a video then I was able to in my
writing and that's one of the things

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
writing and that's one of the things
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.830
writing and that's one of the things
that appealed to me the most now in my

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
that appealed to me the most now in my
 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.479
that appealed to me the most now in my
opinion a film review has to contain a

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489
opinion a film review has to contain a
 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.030
opinion a film review has to contain a
few things for one you have to give the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
few things for one you have to give the
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.209
few things for one you have to give the
reader or the viewer some idea of what

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219
reader or the viewer some idea of what
 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.589
reader or the viewer some idea of what
the movie is about and that's why I

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599
the movie is about and that's why I
 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.869
the movie is about and that's why I
always start out my reviews with a very

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879
always start out my reviews with a very
 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.970
always start out my reviews with a very
brief synopsis now some film critics go

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
brief synopsis now some film critics go
 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.039
brief synopsis now some film critics go
very in-depth with this and they go into

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049
very in-depth with this and they go into
 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.379
very in-depth with this and they go into
almost the entire first act of the movie

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389
almost the entire first act of the movie
 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.660
almost the entire first act of the movie
is written as if it's the synopsis you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
is written as if it's the synopsis you
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.069
is written as if it's the synopsis you
don't even have to watch the first 45

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079
don't even have to watch the first 45
 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.899
don't even have to watch the first 45
minutes any more I don't do that I

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909
minutes any more I don't do that I
 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.119
minutes any more I don't do that I
basically tell you a quick little bit

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129
basically tell you a quick little bit
 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.069
basically tell you a quick little bit
like what you might read on the IMDB

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079
like what you might read on the IMDB
 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.409
like what you might read on the IMDB
plot synopsis and then I move on to my

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419
plot synopsis and then I move on to my
 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.149
plot synopsis and then I move on to my
review when Roger Ebert was alive he

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159
review when Roger Ebert was alive he
 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.800
review when Roger Ebert was alive he
said something very profound to me and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
said something very profound to me and
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.179
said something very profound to me and
I'm gonna paraphrase this because I

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189
I'm gonna paraphrase this because I
 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.979
I'm gonna paraphrase this because I
don't have his exact quote if you give a

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
don't have his exact quote if you give a
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.159
don't have his exact quote if you give a

reviewers on YouTube so people gravitate

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980
reviewers on YouTube so people gravitate
 

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.560
reviewers on YouTube so people gravitate
to them and they're like oh that's my

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:00.570
to them and they're like oh that's my
 

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.960
to them and they're like oh that's my
reviewer but then we're relatable and

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:02.970
