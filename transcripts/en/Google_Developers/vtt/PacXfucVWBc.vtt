JULIA FERRAIOLI: My
name is Julia Ferraioli

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.250
and I am a developer advocate
with Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.450
And today I'm
really excited to be

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.140
able to introduce Dan Shapiro,
Founder and CEO of Glowforge,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.970
amongst a number of other
amazing criteria which I'm

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.210
sure we will dive into as well.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.310
Oh, and we've got the
nice screen there.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.290
So in addition to being
the CEO of Glowforge,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
Dan is also the creator
of Robot Turtles.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.840
Who here has heard of the
board game Robot Turtles?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.560
We've got a few.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.630
I highly recommend
checking it out.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.880
It's an amazing board game
that broke Kickstarter records,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.436
which is fantastic.

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:52.310
DAN SHAPIRO: Back when
the records were lower

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.020
a couple years ago.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.430
JULIA FERRAIOLI: You've also
broken some more recent records

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.350
than that with Glowforge
breaking crowdfunding history

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.930
in 30 days?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.680
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.550
I think we had the highest
30 day total for anything

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.382
Kickstarter,
Indiegogo, et cetera.

00:01:08.382 --> 00:01:09.340
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Right.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.911
Yes.

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:11.410
OK.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.700
So I want to show you a
brief video about Glowforge.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.590
This is their introduction.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.450
So you can see what
Glowforge is capable of

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.406
and how you can
interact with it.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.690
-Start with the design that
you download or create.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.510
Choose from dozens of materials,
even recycled cardboard.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.560
The laser cuts and
engraves your design.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.660
It's precise to the
width of a human hair

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.384
so it's easy to assemble
remarkable things.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.040
Use your Mac, PC, or tablet to
drag your design into place.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.290
Print from organic material,
like wood, leather, paper,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.169
cloth, even chocolate.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.790
Sometimes you don't want
to design from scratch.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.970
Print from the
Glowforge catalog.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.070
You can resize and personalize
to make it perfect for you.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Your design can be
as simple as a photo.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.990
Your favorite apps, like
Photoshop and Illustrator,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.990
can print directly to
create physical objects.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.590
Glowforge cuts holes
with such precision

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.492
that you can lace up
leather like a shoe.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.570
If you draw on material
with an ordinary pen,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.800
dual cameras create a 3D
image of your material

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.770
and your drawing.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.870
Glowforge will engrave and
cut directly over the ink.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.060
Then it's as easy to
make a dozen copies

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.310
as it is to make just one.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.950
Glowforge has auto focus that
can follow curved services

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.620
like this MacBook.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.680
Cameras automatically
identify what you put inside,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.200
so it's safe to personalize
your laptop with designs

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.657
from the catalog or your
own photos and text.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.750
You can make a daily
essential, a unique gift,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.460
a thriving business, or
you can just make lunch.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.820
You don't have to be a
clothing designer, an artist,

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.920
or a pastry chef.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.755
You can build a mansion
without being an architect.

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.750
Glowforge is a tool that's
easy enough and safe enough

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.660
for anyone to use, unlike this
drone with rubber band gatling

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.160
guns.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.480
We've been working hard to
make something amazing for you.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.390
-I'm Dan Shapiro and
this is Glowforge.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.840
Our team has built
everything from cell phones

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.050
to search engines, but this,
this is something different.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.480
I have one in my home.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.688
I want you to have one too.

00:04:14.418 --> 00:04:16.294
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:19.108
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:21.950
JULIA FERRAIOLI: That's
an amazing video.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.900
And I want some
printed chocolate

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.596
because that seems A, like a
really hard problem to solve.

00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:29.220
DAN SHAPIRO: It
actually took us a week

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.350
of profiling different
chocolates to figure out

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.372
exactly the right
blend of chocolates

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:35.830
to make that work, and the
right laser settings, everything

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.330
else.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.820
So it was a crazy project.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.690
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Wow.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.070
Imagine that it might
try to melt on you.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.820
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.360
The right trade off between
vaporize it but not melt it.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.110
So you have to cut line
without a big chocolate puddle.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.970
It was a lot of fun.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.560
JULIA FERRAIOLI: And
tasty, I'm assuming.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.840
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.070
It was actually really nasty
because when we were done

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.569
we got tired of
tempering chocolate,

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.680
so we went for the
candy chocolate.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.069
It's like low chocolate
content and it's always shiny

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.360
and you don't have to go
through the tempering process,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.710
but it's easier to work with.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.251
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Easier
to experiment on at least.

00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.500
DAN SHAPIRO: Movie magic, yes.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.708
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Movie magic.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:13.950
Yes.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.810
So, let's see if we can
get the slides back.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.990
So this is actually one of the
images from Glowforge's home

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.790
page.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.540
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.200
Our firmware engineer
Matt actually

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.710
made this for his girlfriend.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.640
I think they met at
Space Needle, had

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.850
their first date there.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.610
And so we did this
set of cherry wood.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.060
It's about a quarter inch thick,
just to get a sense for scale.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.770
It doesn't actually
use any glue.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.860
The whole thing snaps together.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.460
And it was so
awesome I asked him

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.880
to print a couple extras
so we could use them

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.890
as showcase pieces.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.220
But it was just something
he'd done puttering around.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.500
I think he actually
designed it entirely in 2D

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.640
and just did the 3D in his
head rather than doing it CAD,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.680
but it was kind of a neat piece.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.221
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
And it's interesting

00:05:59.221 --> 00:06:02.040
because I know from
my limited experience

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.080
watching old episodes of
"This Old House," having

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.230
the ability to make
tight connections

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.230
without different materials
to glue it together

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.600
or to secure it
together produces

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.670
a much more solid piece
that's less prone to breakages

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.530
as well.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.280
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.800
One of the early
design questions

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.075
was how do we take the
consistent behavior

00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:29.854
of the laser, which
is very esoteric

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:31.770
and has lots of edge
cases, but it pretty much

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.510
operates the same
way every time,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.860
and use that to produce
predictable prints every time.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.560
And that was ultimately the
thought process that led us to,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.710
hey, we want to apply
really large scale computing

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.370
resources to the problem.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.200
We don't want a
little firmware that's

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.210
taking G-code, which is kind of
the low-level language invented

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.720
in the 50s or 60s for
running milling machines,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.620
and running that.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.170
We actually want to have a
very high level of abstraction

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.190
of the material, of the laser,
of the manufacturing process

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.060
so we can produce really
replicable results.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.800
And we didn't think we could do
that cost effectively running

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.544
on the machine, which ultimately
led to the whole let's

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:11.210
put all the brains
in the cloud and make

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.890
the machine as simple and
straightforward as possible.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.120
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So can
you describe a little bit

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.040
about what happens
in the software

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.670
besides the hardware itself?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.640
Like what else is there?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.390
There's the Glowforge,
there's the ability

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.810
to transfer images
to the Glowforge.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.630
What else happens in the cloud?

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.650
DAN SHAPIRO: So the way
the architecture works

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.830
is that the user interface
is through a browser,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.222
it's a browser-based
application.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.430
And you can use your iPad,
you can use your computer.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.096
There's no reason you
can't use a phone,

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:42.180
although we haven't phone
optimized the UI yet.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.450
And so it starts out--
actually when you first

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.050
plug in the machine you're
going to connect to it locally

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.110
over a Wi-Fi access
point that it broadcasts

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.000
and configure it because it's
got one button and no screen.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.590
So you're going to connect up
to it like a Nest thermostat

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.771
or a Dropcam, but no screen.

00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:57.770
So you connect up to it.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.360
You get it on your
home or office Wi-Fi.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.810
That point, you can
log in from a browser

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.020
and you can see the machine.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.550
You can pair it
with your account.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.910
And from then on, that's how
you're interacting with it.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.530
So I'll give you a really
straightforward example,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.230
something we do
all the time, which

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.090
is you might go into Adobe
Illustrator or any other design

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.240
software, create software-- with
Illustrator there's a plugin,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.080
otherwise you can use
a PDF-- and you're

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.920
going to take the output
of that and push it

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.310
to our cloud service.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.810
Pulls up a web page
and then you're

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.860
going to see a real live
preview of the actual bed

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.864
of the machine.

00:08:31.864 --> 00:08:34.030
Put a piece of material in
there-- could be leather,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.559
could be wood, it could
be seaweed or chocolate.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.270
Put something in
there and it will

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.860
have its own unique
characters and imperfections.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.919
And you can actually
drag around your design

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.597
to figure out where
it's going to go.

00:08:44.597 --> 00:08:46.680
And this is all being done
locally in the browser.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.080
So the browser app is
manipulating basically an SVG

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.760
in real time, superimposed
on top of the bitmap that's

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.240
pulled over from the device.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.950
Then you say OK, go, and it
sends that up to the server.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.200
The server actually
goes and does

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.910
a whole bunch of work
manipulating the SVG

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.130
into its final form,
and then doing things

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:10.130
like figuring out what's
the motion plan, where

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.090
does the head of
the laser need to go

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.860
at what time, what speeds.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.940
It knows the acceleration
parameters of the laser

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.960
so it knows how fast it can
go, how fast it can accelerate,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.200
decelerate, when to turn
it on, when to turn it off.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.000
And it winds up with the
simplest possible format,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
which is basically
a pulse file--

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.690
1's and 0's-- compresses
them, and then sends that down

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.770
to the machine.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.790
And the Glowforge's job is just
to decompress that and feed it

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.260
out in real time to the
motors, and to the lasers,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.950
and to the fans, and everything
else, all the onboard systems.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.090
But the goal is to make
the firmware on the machine

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.190
incredibly simple.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.670
So it does run Linux.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.060
It's a fairly standard
stripped down distro.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.390
But we want to update the
firmware as infrequently as

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.180
possible, because
every time you update

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.334
the firmware on a machine
there's risk of breaking,

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:58.500
and risk of everything else.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.740
So we want to be able to
innovate in the motion plan,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.242
in the UI, in the
design, and all

00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:04.200
that from the speed of
software up in the cloud

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.321
rather than having to
do it in the firmware.

00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:08.570
So on the back end we're
running Google Compute Cloud,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.880
we're using Docker containers
for all the various components.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.240
Not using Kubernetes yet,
although one of our investors,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.300
Joe Beda, one of the
creators of Kubernetes,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.780
is helping us get that up
to speed before we ship

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.640
for maintaining containers.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.185
And all the designs are
in Google Cloud Storage.

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:29.560
I'm trying to think if there's
anything else particularly

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.140
interesting about that.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.837
So yeah, every
machine is basically

00:10:32.837 --> 00:10:33.920
connected up to the cloud.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.910
Every user's connecting
up through a client.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.824
And our goal is always to do as
much on the server as we can.

00:10:40.824 --> 00:10:42.490
And the stuff that's
down on the machine

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.090
is basically either
the offline set up,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.290
the updater for the firmware,
and the hard real time stuff,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.460
and that's it.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.110
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So putting
the brains of the operation

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.310
into the cloud allows
you to ship the product

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.600
but continually offer
improvements and new features

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.410
and flexibility.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.160
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.910
I've said half seriously the
only thing we have to get right

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.360
in the firmware is the updater.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.570
Like if we can ship with a
functioning firmware updater

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.650
then all of their
problems are solvable.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.340
But by pulling as much of that
as possible into the cloud,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.320
it lets us do stuff,
and cool stuff.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.500
Like, for example, let's say
we discover a common problem

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.800
with all the existing lasers.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.175
So we've figured
out how to solve

00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:25.460
it is if you're drawing a
square you have to slow down

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.870
for the corners because you've
got physics to deal with.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.550
You have to decelerate
and then start up again.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.060
And you wind up having a
little hole in the corner where

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.035
the laser does a nice-- if
you're just trying to engrave--

00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:37.410
just does a nice
light engraving,

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.220
but then it slows down, stops,
and so you wind up with a hole.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.060
So let's say that we
have a change that says,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.557
OK, we're going to
decrease the power as you

00:11:47.557 --> 00:11:48.390
approach the corner.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.750
We want to push that out.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.780
There's a couple of interesting
problems with doing that,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.280
typically.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.719
One is when do you push that?

00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:55.010
How do you get that update out?

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.135
There are people who are
in the middle of printing.

00:11:57.135 --> 00:11:58.610
You want to test
that with those.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.710
So given this architecture
we can say, OK, first

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.000
we're pushing it out to people
who've signed up for beta.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.609
Then we're going to
push it out to 1%

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:08.150
and we're going to
wait a couple days

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.360
and see if we get
any complaints.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.984
Then we're going to
push it out to 50%.

00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:12.430
Then we're going
to do A/B testing

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.227
and see user
satisfaction results.

00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:17.060
Then we're going to
push it out to everybody

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.320
who is not in the middle
of an active print.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:19.820
Right?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.945
Because at any given time
there are some people who

00:12:21.945 --> 00:12:23.270
are actually using the thing.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.820
And then finally we'll
push it out to everybody,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.820
but we'll let you keep
the old motion planning

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.910
algorithm if you
like its results

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.710
and don't want to change it.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.490
We can leave that
around indefinitely

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.120
and have it run side by
side with the new one.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.620
That's a level of
flexibility that's

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.100
just never before possible
on this sort of machinery,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.510
where you're pushing
like a PC client app,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.190
because most lasers run
Windows XP, Windows 7 if you're

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.942
lucky-- like local
client apps, or it's just

00:12:52.942 --> 00:12:54.650
in the firmware of
the machine and you're

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.270
hoping people push
your firmware update.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.440
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So let's
go back a little bit.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.880
What made you realize
that, hey, lasers

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.110
are a good place
for some innovation.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.700
What drew you to lasers
in the first place?

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.270
DAN SHAPIRO: So it was this
weird line starting in college

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.590
when I built laser shows and
put myself through college doing

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.650
laser shows at parties.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.420
And it was a weird
little DJ business

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.260
at Harvey Mudd, where
I went to school.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.310
But set all that
aside for a long time

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.640
and did a bunch of
software startups,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.560
worked at Google,
worked at Microsoft.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.980
And then took a leave of
absence when I was at Google

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.170
and wound up creating
this board game.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:41.390
And a friend of mine said,
boy, my son loves the turtles.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.690
And he carried the turtle in
his pocket for like three days

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.030
before it got so grimy.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.195
And it's cardboard, right.

00:13:47.195 --> 00:13:48.570
And it was like
a total disaster.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.580
He's like, you should
sell a super premium

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.670
version of the game
where you actually

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.850
have dimensional turtles that
my kid can shove in his pocket.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.929
And I was like all right.

00:13:56.929 --> 00:13:58.470
Turtles you can
shove in your pocket.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.670
That sounds like a fun thing.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.060
I always wanted to
want a 3D printer

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.630
but I could never figure
out what I wanted one for.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.190
And so I was like, as
soon as I figure out

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.050
one thing I'm going to
do with a 3D printer,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.440
I'm going to go to the
MakerSpace and do it.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.650
And if I can figure
out three things,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.090
I'm going to buy a 3D printer.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.580
So I had my first ever thing
to do with a 3D printer.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.340
So I went to the
local MakerSpace

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.980
and I got this stringy blob of
plastic and I paid $20 for it.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.330
I was like, this stinks.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.847
And so I looked at SLA
and different technologies

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:30.430
for 3D printing and
they were brittle,

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.140
and it was all
really frustrating.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.810
So I went back to the same
friend who actually works

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.710
at a shop that does custom
fabrication for Boeing

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.131
and I said tell me every
machine you have in the shop.

00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:41.880
What can I make these
damn turtles out of?

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.088
So we went through the whole
thing, and at some point

00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:45.590
he mentioned lasers.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.425
I said oh, you
know, like the game.

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:49.550
In the game the turtles
have lasers on their backs.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.910
It'd be cool if I had a
special laser edition.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.380
And also it would be really
awesome to have an excuse

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.190
to go buy a laser.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.690
So one thing led
to another and I've

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.470
got this $11,000 industrial
carbon dioxide cutting

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.330
laser installed in my garage.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.380
I should mention I have
a very patient wife.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.060
And it was like this core
of utter magic surrounded

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.212
by layers and layers
of horribleness.

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.670
I have to give you
but one example.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.878
After spending days getting
it aligned and configured

00:15:16.878 --> 00:15:18.990
and everything else
I'm on the phone

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.770
because I'm just trying to
cut a line, the simplest

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.160
thing possible, right?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.000
And it's crashing every single
time I send it to the laser.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.180
And so I talk to the importers.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.050
I try to talk to
the manufacturers.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.430
And it turns out that
the software actually

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.360
comes from Boston.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.960
And so I talked to
the team in Boston

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.370
and I get escalated to the
engineer who wrote the code.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.417
And he says, wait, what
are you trying to draw?

00:15:43.417 --> 00:15:44.750
And I'm like, a horizontal line.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.260
He's like, so you mean
like y equals zero?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.360
And I'm like, yeah.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.930
He's like, oh, I'm dividing by
the height, sorry about that.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.760
Nobody had ever tried to
draw a line before on laser.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.299
So it was designed for small
scale factory production

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:03.590
where people would spend a
long time creating a design,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.380
getting everything to work, and
then you'd just crank out one

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.963
after another.

00:16:05.963 --> 00:16:08.684
But once you did, the
products were beautiful.

00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:10.850
They're actually made out
of materials that you want

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.980
and that you could use.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.610
And it was fast.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.667
And once you had it working,
iteration was really easy.

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:20.000
So it felt like there was
this beautiful core surrounded

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.280
by all this terribleness.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.507
So that's when I started
talking to some friends who

00:16:23.507 --> 00:16:25.965
were entrepreneurs and one who
had a design background, one

00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:28.310
who had a hardware
background, and said,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.730
could we pair up this core of
lasers that can cut and engrave

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.710
things with modern sensor
technology out of-- I

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.997
said let's imagine everything in
a two-year-old iPhone is free.

00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:41.830
Every part on a
two-year-old iPhone is free.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.600
So we got all the microphones
and accelerometers

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.220
and cameras we want for
approximately zero cost.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.110
What could we take out
of the bill of materials

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.159
of a traditional laser, how
could we make it even better?

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:54.700
And that's when we
started to come up

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.480
with all sorts of crazy things.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.940
Like, as an example,
there's an assembly

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.110
in every laser on
the market and it

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.010
deals with how you
align your drawing

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.359
relative to your material.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.930
Because lasers are very
precise relative to itself,

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.261
but you're putting it
on a piece of leather

00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:12.260
or a piece of cardboard,
which is just somewhere

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.460
sitting on the bed.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.030
And the traditional
way to do that

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.089
is with a little
tiny laser pointer

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.339
that is a secondary laser with
this complex optical system

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.020
to have it go exactly where
the real laser is going to go.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.329
And then you tell the laser
to draw an outline of what

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.410
it's going to do,
and it's difficult.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.420
It adds hundreds of
dollars worth of cost.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.860
And it means you actually
have an exposed laser

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.450
beam that the user could reflect
into their eyeballs, which

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.210
means that it's less safe
than if it was all interlocked

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.930
and put away.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.596
In technical terms, it's a Class
III device instead of a Class I

00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:43.070
device, like your DVD player.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.320
And we said, well, what if
we just got rid of all that

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.220
and had a camera, and
you just drag the thing

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.690
to where you want it to go,
and then you could see it?

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.790
And that costs us
less, it's easier

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.920
to use, and so on and so forth.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.960
So that notion of like, hey,
if we brought this into today

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.140
and moved all the
brains off board,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.740
put low-cost sensors on
instead of high-cost optics

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.542
and mechanical units,
what could we do?

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:09.570
That was the birth of
where it all started.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.430
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
So did the people

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.080
who were working on lasers
up to that point just not

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.480
consider these options?

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.240
Were they really building
it more for industrial use

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.180
than bringing it to
the personal use?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:21.400
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.191
I mean there's wonderful
devices out there.

00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:26.610
Companies like Universal
and Epilog make these tanks,

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.830
they're made out of solid metal.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.740
The lasers themselves
are solid laser tubes.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.770
They are designed
to last for decades,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.010
and they do last for decades.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.593
Like if you go onto
eBay, you will not

00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:40.530
see a used one of these
for less than $15,000

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.320
because it doesn't
matter if they're used.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.570
They're just kind of the same.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.180
And every six years you pay 5
to 7 grand to recharge the tube

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.710
and you're off again.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.420
You've got a service person who
comes in and oils everything.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.160
And that's been the
market up till now.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.040
And so to go in
there and say, hey,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.360
what if the market for this was
people who buy amazing sewing

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:02.860
machines?

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.609
What if the market for
this was the people

00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:06.580
who are buying vinyl
cutters and scrapbooking?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.630
What if the market for this is
people who are buying MakerBots

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.640
for their shop, or
for their school,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.640
or for their MakerSpace?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.330
What if that was the
market instead of people

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.690
who are cutting and engraving
things for their business?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.330
P.S. also them too, but
at the smaller scale

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.680
and at the lower end.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.190
Because it's a lower power
laser on this scale and that

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.910
means it's not as fast as the
100-watt or 200-watt laser

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.410
that you can get from some
of the larger companies.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.730
How big would that market be?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.044
And it's been really gratifying
to see that, yeah, this

00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:37.710
is something people
do get excited about

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.896
and do want for themselves.

00:19:39.896 --> 00:19:41.520
JULIA FERRAIOLI: And
in fact, I believe

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.360
you crossed-- was it 20?

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.790
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah, it was
$27.9 million after 30 days.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.600
JULIA FERRAIOLI: In pre-orders.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.392
DAN SHAPIRO: It was a
bit of a surprise to us.

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:54.770
We sat down and when we
were doing our planning,

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.990
we're like, OK,
time to place bets.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.050
And so I sat down with my
exec team and our board member

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.210
Brad Feld from Foundry Group.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.020
And so we all sort of took bets.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.780
And then we said, OK,
and what's the top end?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.150
And the most funded 3D printer
today had raised $3.5 million

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.140
in a 30-day period.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.680
And so we decided $5 million
was our oh my gosh, maybe

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.070
we could do it.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.280
And it's just been
incredible, way

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.330
beyond anything we'd expected.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:28.102
And it really puts a lot on
us in a very positive way,

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:30.310
but also it's something we
think about seriously when

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.880
we come in every day.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.462
If you go to
community.glowforge.com,

00:20:34.462 --> 00:20:36.230
only people who've
ordered can post there.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.330
Anybody can read it.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.920
And there's this really
humbling conversation

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.992
where somebody says this is the
car I sold to buy my Glowforge.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:44.450
And somebody said,
oh yeah, me too.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.310
This is the car I
sold to buy Glowforge.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.221
And somebody else said, I took
out a loan against my 401(k).

00:20:49.221 --> 00:20:50.720
And somebody else
said, I've already

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.260
let my boss know that
I'm going to give notice

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.689
when I get this so I can
go and start my company.

00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:57.230
And when we come
into work every day,

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.605
that's what we're
thinking about,

00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:00.530
which is that we owe
these people something.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.710
They paid for it and we
need to deliver it to them,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.750
and it needs to be even
better than we promised

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.670
because they are
going to be changing

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.010
their livelihoods around this.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.480
And that's one of the tremendous
challenges of creating hardware

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.260
is that people can see
it before it exists,

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.030
people can imagine
it before it exists,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.320
and people will
change their lives

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.850
around what you promise them.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.470
And so being able to
deliver on those promises

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.910
is pretty humbling.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.515
JULIA FERRAIOLI: That's
a huge responsibility.

00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:33.460
And that must make you take the
community aspect of Glowforge

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.900
incredibly seriously as well.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.040
What do you envision for
how the community interacts

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.740
with each other once Glowforge
ships and people start

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.840
making things?

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.590
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.560
One of the things that was
important to us from the start

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.892
was to think about the
software side of it every bit

00:21:52.892 --> 00:21:54.350
as much as the
hardware side of it.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.475
And it's easy to get really
focused on the hardware

00:21:56.475 --> 00:21:59.060
because we need to ship
a large box of laser

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.040
to a whole lot of
people really soon.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.280
But in the longer term,
we think the value of this

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.030
is unlocked by the
software that we build,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.530
and that is just a tool for
building a community around it.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.830
So beyond the
here's the interface

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.890
and here's how it
works, it's this notion

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.510
of how do people share designs?

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.580
How do people monetize
their designs?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.450
At the same time,
how do we make this

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.230
a place where creative
people can build a business

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.750
and how do we embrace
and not commodify

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.070
the design and creativity
that comes out of these?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.895
Because ultimately we
think this is a way

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:35.520
that people can go
and take their ideas

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.228
and turn them into
businesses, whether it

00:22:37.228 --> 00:22:42.275
be a board game, or a wallet,
or a piece of artwork.

00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:43.900
And creating an
environment that's warm

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.020
and welcoming to that while
at the same time respecting

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.760
people's IP.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.760
If you've been to
Thingiverse, which

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.754
is MakerBot's open location,
you can download products--

00:22:57.754 --> 00:22:59.420
there are some premium
products that you

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.300
pay for-- but there's
a whole lot of the,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.002
I call it, skin my
elbow phenomenon.

00:23:04.002 --> 00:23:05.710
Which is, hey, look,
I just got a connect

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.450
and I 3D scan my
elbow, and here it

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.790
is because you can
upload anything there.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.310
And it's not a great
place for designers

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.174
and for creative people
to show their best work,

00:23:16.174 --> 00:23:18.090
and it's really hard,
bordering on impossible,

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.180
to build a business around
it because it's just

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.141
kind of a big repository.

00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:25.140
So figuring out how do
we build a community that

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.400
values that that
creates and contributes,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.750
build a premium experience
where people can go

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.390
and make a living off of
selling their digital designs,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.810
and at the same time empower
people to go and just

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.130
share freely for those
people who want to do so,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.150
that's been a real
ongoing challenge

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.990
as we think about building the
ecosystem around the hardware

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.130
that we're creating.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.088
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Right.

00:23:44.088 --> 00:23:47.560
And when I think about the
potential for people showing

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.320
their designs,
obviously it has a lot

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.540
of the questions surrounding IP.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.210
And I'm seeing the idea
of public domain images

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.500
that people can base ideas off
of getting a lot more popular.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.810
So they can fork,
and modify, and then

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.520
use their Glowforge on.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.300
So it's been really interesting.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.274
It's an interesting journey
to have seen take place.

00:24:09.274 --> 00:24:11.190
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah, we
have a discussion thread

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:15.320
where I basically said, hey,
how do you want this to work?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.590
And it was so far from
having a singular answer.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.060
There were people who
said I want an FTP

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.170
site where I can put any file
in and anybody else can get it.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.370
And there are people who
say I want a completely

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.740
locked down experience
where everything I

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.990
put in there is
DRMed and tracked,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.510
and pay per this and
that and everything else,

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.010
and everywhere in between.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.560
And so figuring out
the right solution

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.890
to accommodate everybody
is going to be something--

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.710
we're going to iterate
towards that after we ship.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.910
But I think that's a
really important part

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.600
of any modern piece of
hardware, which is the value

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.390
so often comes from the
software that plugs into it

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.050
rather than just
the hardware itself,

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.700
figuring out how to create that
ecosystem so that it supports

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.940
rather than undermining
what you're trying

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.720
to build with the product.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.470
JULIA FERRAIOLI: You're
trying to build up

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.576
the community rather than
kind of regulated way.

00:25:05.576 --> 00:25:06.450
DAN SHAPIRO: Exactly.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.366
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yeah.

00:25:07.366 --> 00:25:07.870
Awesome.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.580
So I want to switch
tracks a little bit

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.930
and touch on how this
was really made possible.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.710
You have kind of an interesting
history with crowdfunding.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.140
And coming from one of the
questions on the internet,

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.880
from Twitter and from the
Google forum for the longer form

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.850
questions, was based
from a position

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.360
that you stated in your
book "Hot Seat," which

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.660
is the guide to CEO-hood, which
is an amazing and humbling book

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.410
to read.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.530
But in there you stated
that you were kind of

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:43.840
wary of crowdfunding at first.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.060
How did you grow to
encompass it in such

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.750
a phenomenally successful way?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.880
DAN SHAPIRO: So it started out
in Kickstarter's early days.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.957
And a friend of mine, Elan
Lee-- he's, for those of you

00:25:55.957 --> 00:25:57.540
who played the game
Exploding Kittens,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.160
he's the creator of
Exploding Kittens,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.000
and won a couple of Emmy
awards for TV shows.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.310
And he's this
amazing, creative guy.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.860
And he's like, Dan, I got this
amazing thing on Kickstarter.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.610
It's so great.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.770
I was like, tell me about
this Kickstarter thing.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.980
And he's like, well,
you give them money

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.380
and then maybe later
they send you something.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.150
And I was like, you get equity?

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.014
No.

00:26:19.014 --> 00:26:20.680
But they don't have
to deliver anything?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.210
No, no.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.920
The terms and services
are very clear.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.830
Terms and conditions
are very clear.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.746
They don't actually have
to send you anything.

00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:28.160
I'm like, so it's charity?

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.570
Like I just did not understand
at all what this was about.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.810
And he was really excited.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:34.400
I remember the thing
he told me about

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.320
was a fish tank for jellyfish.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.440
So it was a unique
lucite beautiful thing,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.750
since been called
the-- what was it

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.330
called-- the whining jellyfish
death trap because apparently

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.030
it's a better meat
grinder for jellyfish

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.950
than it is a habitat
for them, and it just

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.720
kills anything you put in it.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.640
So it turned out it did
ship close to on time,

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.550
but was just an utter failure
from a product quality

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.000
standpoint.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.980
He'd backed dozens
of Kickstarters.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.340
And I was just looking at
this going I don't even

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.500
understand what this is about.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.140
So he'd been working
on a TV show that

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.640
had some relationship
to Kickstarter

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.280
and I was helping with him.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.900
And I had this like, OK, I have
to wrap my head around this.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.149
So I went and just
pledged a dollar

00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:22.690
to a bunch of
Kickstarters so I would

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.880
start getting their updates.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.500
And then I was like, oh,
this is kind of cool.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.090
And I kind of want something.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.510
OK, so I pledged some money
to a couple Kickstarters.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.031
And actually, coincidentally,
as it happens,

00:27:32.031 --> 00:27:34.160
this hoodie was a Kickstarter
from some people who

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.680
wanted to start up a clothing
studio in Los Angeles

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.690
and bring back some of
the handmade quality.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.410
And I will say right now their
ship is called Pistol Lake.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.260
They're shipping
amazing clothing.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.910
This one, which is one of the
first ones off their lines,

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.960
has a few frays and
some of the stitching

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.400
didn't quite work out, but
they got it all sorted out.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.000
And so it kind of changed
the way I think about it.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.410
Very cynically, it's
a legitimization

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.240
of vaporware, which has
been going on forever,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.760
but sort of in a good way
in that you're putting

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.104
all your cards on the table.

00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:10.020
You're saying, look, you
used to pay for stuff

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.900
because we lied to you
and told you it was ready.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:12.270
No, no.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.940
Now we're actually telling
you exactly where it's at,

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.898
exactly what you'd get.

00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:17.690
You're going to be paying
usually a better price for it

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.229
than you would otherwise.

00:28:19.229 --> 00:28:21.520
You're going to get it when
it's ready, which we expect

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.260
is going to be on this date.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.040
I think more optimistically
it's this notion of involving

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.890
your customers in your
development process, which

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.420
from the standpoint of
a creator is magical.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.300
You get the funds to
go deliver the product.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.500
But 10 times more
than that, you get

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.340
to find out if people love and
care about what you're doing,

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.610
and you actually get
their participation

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.240
in the creative process.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.230
So the Glowforge is going to
be a 10x better product for all

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.520
the feedback that we've gotten
from our users over the course.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.490
Now it's interesting,
because it's hardware.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.350
We had to make and lock most
of the hardware decisions

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.180
up front before the
crowdfunding campaign.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.837
But we can do so much
in the software based

00:29:03.837 --> 00:29:06.170
on what we've heard that at
launch our software is going

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.560
to be far better than it
would have been otherwise,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.350
and it will continue
to improve with that.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.410
So it means you get
the dollars that you

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.680
can go into production.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.220
There's two real costs to
starting a hardware company.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.090
There's all the
infrastructure, there's

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.850
the rent and salaries
and everything else,

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.210
and then there's the
actual manufacturing costs.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.650
And I'd say that best
practices for crowdfunding

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.280
are that you use
the dollars you get

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.550
from the crowdfunding for
manufacturing and production.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:35.200
And if you're paying yourself a
salary, if you're paying rent,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.180
you get those dollars
from somewhere else,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.790
from your savings,
or from investors,

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.250
or something like that.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.280
But there's some campaigns
that are very upfront as well.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.040
And they'll say I am
raising $50,000 so

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.800
that I can pay myself to
spend the next year of my life

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.399
developing this
software, or I'm going

00:29:51.399 --> 00:29:53.690
spend some of this on the
hardware and deliver and some

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.341
of this on rent and
R&amp;D, or whatever else.

00:29:56.341 --> 00:29:58.340
At the end of the day, I
think any creator who's

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.350
honest with their backers
about where they're at

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.219
and what they're doing
is doing it well.

00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.260
The place where I think
we've gotten into trouble

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.890
is there's a little bit of
malice, where you see people

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:14.470
who are actually trying to
fleece their backers and just

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.160
mislead folks and
take the money,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.440
saying x is done
when it's not done,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.330
or having no
intention of doing it,

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.160
or saying they're
developing something

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.260
but really they're
just repackaging

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.470
something somebody else made.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.740
But that's dwarfed by just
boundless optimism and people

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.806
who are creating projects
without really understanding

00:30:31.806 --> 00:30:33.930
what they're committing
to, without really thinking

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.220
through the financial
repercussions of what they're

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.220
doing.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.370
All that said, if you are
creating a product where

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.840
you have clarity about
what you need to do,

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.760
where you can communicate
that, boy, it's

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.870
hard to argue against talking
to your customers first.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.090
And it's hard to argue that you
should hold off putting it out

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.482
for sale when in fact
there are people out there

00:30:56.482 --> 00:30:58.440
who are willing to buy
it before it's finished.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.500
And as long as you're
honest and transparent

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.830
about that as a business,
I think that it's all

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.414
good for all parties involved.

00:31:04.414 --> 00:31:05.580
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Absolutely.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.810
And as you said, it
gets potential customers

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:09.575
involved earlier.

00:31:09.575 --> 00:31:14.170
And I think it also helps people
conquer that little bit of fear

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:18.682
that says, oh, as I'm going
through and building a product,

00:31:18.682 --> 00:31:19.890
what if people don't like it?

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.420
We can find out early and often.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.170
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:27.860
And that fear, it's
not just self-doubt.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.150
It is actually the existential
question of a company.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.390
Like am I doing something
people care about?

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.240
And it is remarkably
easy to delude yourself

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.530
about where that goes.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:40.310
I will say that both for Robot
Turtles and Glowforge forge,

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.739
I came out happily on
the right side of it.

00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:45.280
In neither case did I know that
it was going to be a success.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.620
With Glowforge, we did
enough market research

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.230
that we had a pretty
good idea that we

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.230
were going to get to half
a million to a million

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.530
and felt good about that.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.510
With Robot Turtles,
I thought 50-50

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.000
it just wasn't going to fund.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.520
Like I trying to raise 25K and
I know there's a good chance

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.310
nobody would notice
and nobody would care.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.190
And that actually would have
been a much better outcome

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.940
than the alternative that was
available five years before,

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.720
which is to spend a year of your
life, go through manufacturing,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.869
tens of thousands of
dollars to populate

00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:17.660
your garage with a
bunch of cardboard boxes

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.340
that nobody cared about.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.306
That was the world
before crowdfunding

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.680
and it's a much
better world now,

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.840
where it may be disappointing if
what you find doesn't catch on

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.992
but you have permission
to go back and try again.

00:32:27.992 --> 00:32:28.950
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Right.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.110
Absolutely.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:34.690
So another question
from the internet,

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:40.660
the internet at large, was
about the idea of kind of best

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.255
practices and crowdfunding.

00:32:42.255 --> 00:32:44.590
I know we've talked about the
clarity, the transparency,

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.280
the early engagement.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.780
This question was specifically
around offering discounts

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.830
of your hardware or your
software product, let's say.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.940
And what are your thoughts
and advice for anybody

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.050
who's considering going
the crowdfunding route?

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.460
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.830
It's challenging to be
transparent about pricing

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.020
only because you never
know what's in the future.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.350
Like we know what our
manufacturer suggested

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.950
retail pricing is for Glowforge,
which is the amount that we--

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.850
so we have a pretty good sense
of what we'll wholesale it for

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.430
and there's this MSRP
which is hey, retailer,

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.070
this is what we think you should
sell it for but then people

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.210
can do whatever they want.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.240
And there's been cases
where-- I know of one case

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:31.540
where a crowdfunding campaign
sold it for x, sold it

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.780
at wholesale for x, and then the
retailer discounted it below x.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.020
This is a loss leader.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.210
Now, if Target wants
to do a loss leader,

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.640
or Macy's, or whatever,
that's their right.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.820
And in fact, federal law
prevents a manufacturer

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.190
from saying you must
sell it at this amount.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.040
But for the backers of
the campaign, that stinks.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.830
By going through
that process and then

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.700
coming out on the other
side and finding out

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.520
that people who came
later paid less.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.560
But it's always
really tough to tell.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.330
So I'll take Robot
Turtles as an example.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.590
So I was selling it for--
the crowd funding campaign,

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.879
it was I think $30.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:09.670
And when the crowdfunding
campaign was done

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.130
I was selling it for $40.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.600
And for six months people
were selling it for $40.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.849
And then I actually licensed the
manufacturing rights to a board

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.760
game manufacturer and
they got the price

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.929
down to $25, which is great for
the world at large who now has

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.809
access to this game for less.

00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:29.600
I didn't feel terrible
about it because I'd

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.090
told my backers up front
that that might happen,

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.500
and because they'd had access to
it a year before anybody else.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.989
And it was a different edition.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.760
When they started manufacturing
bulk it was somewhat different.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.889
But again, it comes back
to that transparency,

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:43.699
not making promises
you can't fulfill.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:47.080
I think you want to try and
give the crowdfunding backers

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.760
the best value you can.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.969
But at the same time, the
flip side of that mistake

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.770
is you see companies that sell
at such an unrealistically

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.580
low price they put
themselves out of business.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.310
And there have
been a lot of cases

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.810
of that, where they just don't
raise enough money to fulfill

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.210
their project.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.890
Or they wind up having
to double or triple

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.910
the price of the product
after the crowdfunding

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.260
campaign, which sort of
feels good for the backers

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.830
but may mean that a project
that looked viable at one price

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.674
isn't viable when you've
tripled the price.

00:35:17.674 --> 00:35:20.090
And so they wind up going out
of business because now they

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.540
have to charge too much.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.870
So at the end of the
day, all you can do

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.210
is try and give the best
value you can to your backers

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.805
and be transparent about
what might happen next.

00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:29.763
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Right.

00:35:29.763 --> 00:35:33.860
Those are good
guiding principles.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.230
Now, you've done
the startup a couple

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.810
of times, a few times now.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:38.360
Right?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.130
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.260
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
And you've also,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.840
as you mentioned,
worked at Google,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.130
you've been at Microsoft.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.440
And I imagine there
might be some people here

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.490
that are looking to either make
a switch one way or another.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.460
What advice do you have
them from your experience

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.320
in industry?

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.070
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.650
I'd say it's been about
a little less than half

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.540
of my working life at a
big company, a little more

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.470
than half at a small.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.290
The first five years I worked at
Microsoft as a program manager.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:06.700
And then I went to a startup.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.949
Now I say I went to a startup.

00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.210
I didn't start a startup.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.930
Actually, I did.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.515
When I was working
at Microsoft I

00:36:11.515 --> 00:36:13.400
had this great idea for
a startup, I thought.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.358
It was a terrible idea.

00:36:14.358 --> 00:36:15.430
It crashed and burned.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.157
I was depressed and
couldn't figure out

00:36:18.157 --> 00:36:19.740
what to do with
myself for six months.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.210
It was one of the most horrible
experiences of my life.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.210
And worked at Microsoft
for a couple more years.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.624
And then went to go work
at a friend's startup.

00:36:26.624 --> 00:36:29.040
And it was amazing because I
learned about all my mistakes

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.190
on somebody else's dime.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.272
That was where I got
my startup degree.

00:36:33.272 --> 00:36:34.730
And not just that,
but that's where

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.100
I met people who I've
worked with ever since.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.220
That's where I met
investors who actually

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.476
had some experience
with me and where

00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:43.850
I could build a
network of people

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.420
who I could raise funds from.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.660
That experience of going
to work at a startup

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.090
was the best training I
could have possibly had

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.610
before starting my own company.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.692
And really, that's what
I'd recommend to anyone.

00:36:55.692 --> 00:36:57.150
Now there's some
real culture shock

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:59.520
around it and some huge change.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.810
Oftentimes you're taking
a pay cut, depending

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.990
how early the startup is.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:07.330
That could be anywhere
from 30% to 100%.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.690
And the environment
is very different.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.680
There's this
realignment where some

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.810
of the skills that made you
very successful at a big company

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.640
may in fact contribute to your
failure at a small company.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.390
For example, being able
to manage a bureaucracy

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:26.810
effectively is a core skill if
you're at Google, or Microsoft,

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.980
or any large company.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.310
And that's not a
negative thing, it's

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.070
that there are these
huge agglomerations

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.720
of people who all have
different motives, and agendas,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.860
and directions
managing your career.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.442
So regularly helping
everybody understand

00:37:41.442 --> 00:37:42.900
where you're at,
what you're doing,

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.000
what value you're providing.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.820
But in a small company you
create value for yourself

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.050
by making the company valuable.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.300
The earliest Google
employees, it

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.350
doesn't matter what they did
while they were there early.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.590
They're perceived to be valuable
because they helped make Google

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.160
valuable in those early days.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.640
Same is true of every
other successful company

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.610
at the start.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:09.040
So it has so much more to do
with the output of the company

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.350
than it does with your
particular contribution.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.660
And that just changes the way
you go into work every day.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.520
You go into work every day
thinking where are we going

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.120
and how do we get there rather
than what's expected of me

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.990
and how do I deliver
on that today.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.630
And neither one is
right nor wrong.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.030
Some people love
both, but some people

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.030
have a strong preference
towards one or the other.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:29.220
It's much better to figure
that out as an employee,

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.670
where if you change
your mind you

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.470
can fix that, than as a founder
where if you change your mind

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.554
you're abandoning people
who are depending on you.

00:38:35.554 --> 00:38:36.511
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Right.

00:38:36.511 --> 00:38:37.070
Absolutely.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:43.380
And so given all of
that experience and now

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.120
you're starting another company.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120
DAN SHAPIRO: Once again.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.349
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Once again.

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:49.640
What have been some of the
guiding principles that have

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.290
come out of your experience?

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.870
What has backed your
company and made

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:59.220
it the strong
community that it is?

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.350
DAN SHAPIRO: One of the really
transformational experiences

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.339
I had was the second
startup I had.

00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:06.630
It's a company called Sparkbuy.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.780
It was comparison shopping
for consumer electronics.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.290
So it was on the back end that
nobody saw and nobody even

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:13.880
knew existed.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.921
It was hundreds of people
in emerging markets who

00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:18.310
are manually
scouring spec sheets,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.160
calling manufacturers,
and inputting data

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.872
about every piece of consumer
electronics on the market.

00:39:23.872 --> 00:39:25.580
And then on the front
end it was a really

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.960
simple and straightforward
UI that you

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.760
could say I want a big
TV that can accommodate

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:37.820
my N64 and my PS3, and has
an HDMI 60 hertz input,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.760
or whatever it is.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.930
Or I want a fast
red Sony laptop.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.600
And it could understand
those things,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.380
translate them into
quantitative measures,

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.260
and bring up the
best products first.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.690
That company existed for six
months before it sold to Google

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.940
and that's how I
wound up at Google.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.400
But we had this experience
that was just transformational

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.650
there.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:03.560
We were debating between
building first for mobile

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.330
and building first for the web.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.210
And I had this idea
that I wanted to try

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.880
and it was ultimately why
we built first for the web.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:15.460
What I wanted to do was to
run usability tests every day

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.530
on the build of the day.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.600
This was the crazy idea.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.360
Every day we'd check in code.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.220
Every night we'd
have people use it.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.320
And every morning we'd
see what happened.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.980
And so Scott, my chief
architect there and now

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.834
chief architect
again at Glowforge,

00:40:30.834 --> 00:40:32.750
thought it was a little
crazy when I was like,

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:34.940
guess what, we're going
to have five people use

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.140
that code we just checked
in the first time we did it.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.739
We pushed it out to
a staging server.

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:41.530
I went to MTurk and I
recruited five people

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.590
to go use the software.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.140
And the deal was they were going
to turn on their microphone,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.780
turn on screen capture, upload a
video to YouTube of them trying

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.160
to research a laptop.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.900
And so we came in the
next morning, we sat down.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.410
Actually, it was lunch
we decided to do this.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.180
So I had this vision
in my head of Scott

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.660
with his burrito in hand,
took a bite, I hit play,

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.160
and he stops chewing with a
mouthful burrito and stares

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.090
in horror.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.460
We had this huge list of bugs.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.730
They were like oh, if you
pick these two filters then

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.480
things will crash.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.050
And this filter isn't working
properly, and everything else.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.630
And they were just
clicking on something

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.505
they thought was a button
and wasn't a button

00:41:21.505 --> 00:41:23.600
and were getting
progressively more frustrated.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.220
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
There are some people

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.520
who identify with this
feeling in the audience.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.270
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.944
And/or going like oh no.

00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:31.360
And then they're going in and
there was some other problem

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.860
where like there
was a slider and it

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.960
didn't look like a slider.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.230
And so they're trying
to click the slider

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.330
and it was a drag slider.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.800
And he just quietly
set down the burrito

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.062
and pulled up his laptop and
no lunch was eaten that day.

00:41:43.062 --> 00:41:44.020
It was so embarrassing.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.920
And the worst part
was we'd already

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.890
committed that we were going
to push again and run five more

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.170
tests that night.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:54.240
And we felt so horrible
watching our users

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.650
suffer through our
incompetence that it did more

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.660
to motivate the
development of that product

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:03.319
and motivate the development of
the product in the right way.

00:42:03.319 --> 00:42:04.860
Not when you click
these three things

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.240
and move the slider
to the right,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.430
the server crashes, which
to us seems like the worst

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.990
thing on the planet, but
that looks like a button

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.340
and it's not a button so
they're stabbing their finger

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.060
in increasing frustration.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.230
Server crashes, UI freezes,
they're going to be annoyed,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.660
they're going to leave
and not come back.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.250
But they have rightfully
left you behind.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.620
This was just
torturing our users,

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.320
and that's what we were doing.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.749
And so we had our
bug database and it

00:42:30.749 --> 00:42:32.540
was full of all this
stuff we needed to fix

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.920
and we wound up basically
completely ignoring all that

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.870
and developing and fixing
bugs entirely based

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.000
on what we found everyday
users were telling us.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.035
And that was completely
transformational.

00:42:44.035 --> 00:42:45.660
It was the first time
that I had really

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.090
moved in the most
dramatic way possible

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.470
from we're going to
build everything we can

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:52.470
and design everything we
can, and we will push,

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.790
and we'll accept bug
reports, and then

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.248
we'll look at those, interact
with them, to like we're just

00:42:56.248 --> 00:42:57.800
going to sit here
with our ears open

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.920
and you're going to tell
us how stupid we are.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.370
We're going to listen and
we're going to try and get

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.620
better, and try to get better.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.140
And at some point
we'll be caught up

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.510
to the point where our
product doesn't suck horribly.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.426
And then we've earned
the right to go innovate

00:43:08.426 --> 00:43:10.434
and to go try things
out and be like,

00:43:10.434 --> 00:43:11.850
no, no, we think
there's something

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.250
here that you didn't
ask for but that's

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.541
going to make your life better.

00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:16.370
But until we've
earned that right,

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.330
we need to just sit
there and listen.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:21.740
And so Glowforge is challenging
because with hardware you have

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.090
to do a lot of that up front.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:24.990
But a core part of
the Glowforge design

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.236
was make ourselves as
responsible as possible,

00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:29.860
both in terms of how
we run the company

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:34.630
and in terms of how we architect
the platform, allow ourselves

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.684
to be that responsive to
the users that we have.

00:43:37.684 --> 00:43:39.600
JULIA FERRAIOLI: The
flexibility that you get.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.210
No, that makes a ton of sense.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:47.110
So let's switch a little bit
to the personal fabrication

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.076
side of it.

00:43:48.076 --> 00:43:49.450
Now, the audience
has heard a lot

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.950
about ubiquitous computing--
signed up for this conference.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:56.610
And they've got a day and a
half so far of great talks

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.810
about ubiquitous computing.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.070
You actually place
Glowforge more in the realm

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:04.990
of personal fabrication, right?

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.730
So what do you mean
by that and what

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.290
excites you about the potential
in this emerging area?

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.582
DAN SHAPIRO: I think
there's two approaches

00:44:15.582 --> 00:44:16.790
and they're both interesting.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.000
One is we have this
sensor package,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.780
we have cloud storage,
what can it do?

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.570
The other is we have this old
machine that does one thing

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.290
and does it well, what could
it do if we hooked it up

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.430
to the wider world?

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.720
And they both can
produce amazing results

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.010
and they can both produce
comically ridiculous mash ups

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.580
of the internet and hardware.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.010
And where you land
ultimately is up to customers

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.880
to tell you about that.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.800
This started out very much
from the standpoint of we

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.860
think that there is something
wonderful in the world that

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.840
isn't accessible to
most of the people who

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.350
would benefit from it.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:55.800
And how can we go use the
power of ubiquitous computing

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.530
of cloud services,
of low-cost sensors

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.580
to go bring that
value to everybody?

00:45:04.464 --> 00:45:06.840
This is a very common trend.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.626
So the 3D printer
revolution started--

00:45:09.626 --> 00:45:12.000
most people don't know-- but
3D printers have been around

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.897
for decades.

00:45:12.897 --> 00:45:14.480
They're just giant
industrial machines

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.735
that cost a quarter
of a million dollars

00:45:15.735 --> 00:45:17.837
and were totally inaccessible
to the home user.

00:45:17.837 --> 00:45:20.170
And it was only with the
expiration of the first patents

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:25.250
around-- FDM I think it is, the
little, tiny hot glue guns that

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.150
build stuff up, like a
MakerBot-- with the expiration

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.630
of those patents that you could
actually go build a desktop 3D

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.430
printer and go drive
the price down.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.160
And that's what created the
first 3D printing revolution.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.850
Now, most of the core
patents around lasers

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.800
expired decades ago, because
the heyday of development

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.770
was really around the 80s.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:47.980
But what kept it from
getting to people

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:50.200
was-- it was really two things.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.300
It was all the support
systems required.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.410
Like the very lowest cost
motion planners you can buy.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.752
The motion planner
takes G-code via USB

00:46:00.752 --> 00:46:02.960
from your computer, the
low-level language describing

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.230
where it should move,
turns it into pulse files,

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.090
is on the order
of $600 wholesale.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.140
So slap that on top
of whatever cost

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.830
you're paying already for it.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.850
So the cost of these support
components was enormous.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:21.190
And ironically the
actual laser parts

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:23.010
were reasonably
commodified because they're

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:26.430
used enough in other things
that those weren't so expensive.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:29.720
It was the boards
that were created only

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.610
for laser cutters,
which ties right

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.050
into the second part, which
was the market was tiny.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.800
And part of the reason
the market was tiny

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.920
was because everybody
knew the market was tiny.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.920
And it's hard to grow a market
when everybody has for decades

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.960
seen that as best I can tell the
analysts say there's something

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.900
on the order of $110 million a
year worth of CNC laser cutter

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.340
engravers under a kilowatt sold.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.160
And that's just not
big enough to get

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.890
people excited about
investing in that market.

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:00.660
So the way to move
that to the next level

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.600
was to say, OK, if we could take
technology that was not readily

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:09.120
available 5 or 10 years ago and
bring that into this product

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.070
so that we could lower the
cost and improve the usability,

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.570
does that give us
access to a market that

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.070
doesn't exist before?

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.960
And none of those pieces
would've worked by themselves.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.900
And in fact, had
any one of them not

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.957
been there the whole principle
wouldn't have come together.

00:47:24.957 --> 00:47:27.040
All those pieces had to
be there at the same time.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.800
So this isn't a
company that I think

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.930
could have been realistically
started 5 or 10 years ago,

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:37.564
but it is the confluence of the
low-cost sensors, of the cloud,

00:47:37.564 --> 00:47:40.150
of the ability to bring
meaningful computing resources

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.510
to bear without having
to put them locally

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:46.630
on board the machine that
made this all possible.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.550
JULIA FERRAIOLI: And
with the recent advances

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.280
you're really
creating this market,

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.250
you're planting the
seeds so that it

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.830
can develop in new and
unpredictable ways as well.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:57.900
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.900
One of the questions
that I get a lot,

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.130
especially from press and
journalists, is who is it,

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:07.650
who bought this thing, or
who is your target market?

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:10.810
And I always am embarrassed by
this because the honest answer

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.740
is before we started we said
here are a bunch of markets

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.010
that we know are interested but
we don't know how interested.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.347
So there's educators who
are buying 3D printers

00:48:22.347 --> 00:48:23.430
to go use with their kids.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.160
And we think this is
a more compelling.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.320
It's faster and the
product is more beautiful.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.220
There are engineers
who are using

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.707
these for prototypes
and fixturing

00:48:31.707 --> 00:48:34.040
and that sort of thing, and
for first generation product

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.870
design.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.930
There are scrapbookers who are
using tools to go and create

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.260
beautiful crafts.

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.480
There are leather workers, and
woodworkers, and Etsy folk,

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.549
and there's all these.

00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:47.840
And we're like, we know
there's interest in all of them

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.840
but we don't know
the one who's going

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.200
to get really excited
about it and bring us home.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.450
And what we found was it
was kind of all of them.

00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:59.700
That was the big surprise
of the crowdfunding campaign

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.810
is there wasn't one group
that stepped up and provided

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:03.850
the bulk of the orders.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:07.100
It's this incredibly
diverse set of users

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.420
who see this as a tool that
would help them do what it was

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.170
that they wanted to do anyway.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.044
JULIA FERRAIOLI: So you
touched on something.

00:49:14.044 --> 00:49:18.010
And I recently went and toured
a school, a K through 12 school,

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.230
and looked at their
computing lab.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:23.360
And they had a MakerBot,
they had a CNC machine.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.680
It was a very nice school.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.560
But how does this
actually change

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.400
how kids approach technology?

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.190
Like how does this personal
fabrication revolution,

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.890
in a way, change the
youth who is growing up

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.260
to be the next technologist?

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:45.320
DAN SHAPIRO: So when I was 7--
my parents are both professors.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.022
My dad was a professor
of CS and my mom's

00:49:49.022 --> 00:49:50.730
a professor of speech
and communications.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.326
And they got into
an argument about

00:49:52.326 --> 00:49:53.950
whether or not I
should own a computer.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.390
And my mom won so
I got the computer.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:00.030
My dad, the CS
professor, thought

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.540
this doesn't makes
sense for a kid.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.750
So they spent, as best I can
tell, it was about $2,500

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:08.270
in today's dollars to buy a
Commodore 64 and a disk drive.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.700
And when I was 7, I remember
sitting on my dad's knee,

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.950
I had just seen the musical
Joseph and the Technicolor

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:16.470
Dreamcoat, and stringing
together AND statements to go

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:21.290
make a choose-your-own-adventure
type game around the story

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.000
of the musical that
we'd just seen.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.260
So, fast forward.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.210
I have twins, boy and a girl.

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.530
They're both 7 now.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.110
And they came home
from school-- this

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:36.450
is early on in Glowforge's
existence-- they came home

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:40.020
and they said tomorrow we're
having Wild West day at school.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.594
We need sheriff's badges.

00:50:41.594 --> 00:50:44.010
And so they sat down and they
drew their sheriff's badges.

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.874
And I went over to early,
early, early version

00:50:46.874 --> 00:50:48.540
and cut and engraved,
and this and that.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.840
Put a magnet on the back and
they wore them to school.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.859
And this has been pretty
typical of the interactions that

00:50:53.859 --> 00:50:55.400
have been happening
for months prior.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.991
And my wife turned
to me and said,

00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.490
have you noticed
the kids are asking

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.110
us to make things for them more
often than buy things for them?

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.140
And that was the
like, oh my gosh,

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:09.700
like this is the Commodore 64
that I had when I was a kid.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.800
This is a new way
the world works,

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.310
which is there's a revolution
30 years ago that when

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:19.540
you thought of an
idea you could realize

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.960
it yourself in software.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.180
And now we're reaching
another revolution

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.670
where when you have an
idea you can realize

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.160
it yourself in hardware.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.970
And that's something
I can't wait

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.370
to see what kids who grow
up assuming fabrication

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.250
capabilities, the same
way that I grew up

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:39.010
assuming computing
capabilities, to see

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.160
what they do with the world.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.000
Absolutely.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.267
And on the more
grown up front, I

00:51:47.267 --> 00:51:49.600
know I've been having a lot
of these conversations where

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.510
a lot of us who
work in technology

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:56.960
deal so much with the
intangible that we--

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.220
it's flowery language-- but
we yearn for the physical,

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.020
to interact with the
world on a tactile level.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.590
And Glowforge is part of the
way that we can get that back

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:10.370
into our lives.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:11.290
It's really exciting.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.310
DAN SHAPIRO: I spent
years building up

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.260
a wood shop in the
basement so that I

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:17.550
would have a way to go
actually make physical things.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:21.549
And after years of kind of
getting the hang of everything

00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:23.090
I talked to a friend
and he was like,

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:26.940
oh, I made this cool wallet
because I do leather crafting.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.770
And I was like, [SIGHS].

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:31.450
If I would've changed
materials, that

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:35.030
is thousands of
dollars and years more,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.570
and I wish there
was some way that I

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.194
had a tool that let
me work across all

00:52:38.194 --> 00:52:39.360
these interesting materials.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.780
This is years before Glowforge.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.610
When the twins were
born, I no longer

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:46.270
had time to go into the shop,
set up everything, set up

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:48.600
all the jigs, do some
work, vacuum everything up.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.550
So I started building
RC airplanes and drones,

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:53.480
and flying stuff I got.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.330
Because I'd go in and tinker
for 20 minutes and go out,

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.760
plus going to the park
with babies is fun.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.410
So I'd fly things and
they'd kind of stare.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.030
And I still had that
outlet of physical stuff.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:09.470
The thing that's never existed
before in the world as best

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.890
I can tell is a
tool that actually

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:13.370
lets you realize
a creative vision

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.942
across multiple materials.

00:53:15.942 --> 00:53:17.400
You could be a
furniture maker, you

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.400
can be a woodworker, you can
be a paper crafter, leather.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.130
And every one of
those has always

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:26.210
been a specialty that took
years, if not decades,

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.570
to become proficient at.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.070
And so saying, hey, here's one
tool that can give you access

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.360
to all of those
and it's up to you

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.500
whether you want
to draw to use it,

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.530
because you can draw and have
it engraved and carved directly

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:38.990
based on your
drawings; whether you

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:42.332
want to use Adobe Illustrator
or Photoshop, Gimp, Inkscape;

00:53:42.332 --> 00:53:43.790
or whether you're
going to use CAD;

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:46.164
or whether you're going to
create designs parametrically.

00:53:46.164 --> 00:53:48.940
I mentioned Joe Beda earlier as
doing some really cool software

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.580
generated parametric
designs to go create things

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.130
that you can then print.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:56.509
However you want to
express your creativity,

00:53:56.509 --> 00:53:58.300
you can bring that to
the table and turn it

00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.900
into something beautiful.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:01.840
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Just fantastic.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.370
But that also leads
into I think what

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.540
has to be a final question.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.870
It went by so rapidly.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:12.100
What is the favorite thing that
you've made with the Glowforge?

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.111
DAN SHAPIRO: Gosh.

00:54:14.111 --> 00:54:16.610
Just because there have been
so many crazy stories about it,

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.620
there's a board-- and I've had
so many wonderful experiences

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.120
with it.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.160
There's a board for the
game Settlers of Catan,

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.608
for those of you
who are familiar.

00:54:23.608 --> 00:54:24.062
Yeah.

00:54:24.062 --> 00:54:24.970
JULIA FERRAIOLI:
Some nods out there.

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:25.720
DAN SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.090
So I bought online-- because
I was a terrible artist--

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.500
I bought some artwork.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.750
And it was you can go print one
of these for yourself for $29.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.750
So I bought the artwork,
did it, printed a game,

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:36.780
had it in the office.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.732
"Wired" came by, took a picture
of it, which I hadn't realized.

00:54:39.732 --> 00:54:41.190
The picture wound
up in the article

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.401
and I went, oh, that's not cool.

00:54:43.401 --> 00:54:44.900
Like we don't really
have permission

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.816
to put that artwork in
there and we definitely

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.460
don't permission
from Mayfair Games.

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.247
And then somebody
posted it to Reddit

00:54:50.247 --> 00:54:52.080
and it wound up on the
front page of Reddit.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.920
Just the giant
picture of Settlers

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.820
of Catan, not the article.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.430
And so I immediately started
calling everybody I knew.

00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:03.130
And it got a hold of, I
think it was Guido Teuber,

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.840
the son of the creator Klaus.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.361
I may have that backwards.

00:55:07.361 --> 00:55:08.610
And I explained what happened.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:15.582
I said, would it be OK if
we used Settlers of Catan

00:55:15.582 --> 00:55:16.576
in these pictures.

00:55:16.576 --> 00:55:17.700
I'm so sorry this happened.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.950
And he said absolutely
not, unless you

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.820
put water tiles on there.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.679
Catan's an island.

00:55:22.679 --> 00:55:23.470
What are you doing?

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:24.178
There's no water.

00:55:24.178 --> 00:55:26.750
And I was like, yes, sir.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.460
Right on it, sir.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.380
So we brought in this
amazing illustrator.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.250
She actually worked
professionally

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.230
as a program manager
and then retired

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.950
to go illustrate coloring
books for grown ups, which

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.370
I didn't even
realize was a thing,

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.670
and it's an amazing thing.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:41.110
And brought her in for a day.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.890
And so we did this cool video
where she illustrated by hand

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.610
with pen on paper this
triple-sized Settlers of Catan

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:51.370
set, scanned those, reduced
them, carved and engraved them

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.962
onto all these exotic hardwoods.

00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:54.920
And it's awesome because
the wood is beautiful.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.910
So the finish is just you go
at it with some spray shellac

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:59.230
and you're done.

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.324
There's not a big painting,
and staining, and all this.

00:56:02.324 --> 00:56:03.990
And then turn it into
this gorgeous set.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.342
And I've had more people
ask me if they can buy one.

00:56:06.342 --> 00:56:08.050
The great thing is
when we ship Glowforge

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:09.810
is there will be
tens of thousands

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:12.624
of people who can go print
one of those and make it.

00:56:12.624 --> 00:56:13.290
Sorry, I had to.

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:14.130
It's my favorite.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:16.130
JULIA FERRAIOLI: And you know,
I actually saw that on Reddit

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.760
and I didn't even
make the connection

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.540
until, embarrassingly,
quite a bit later.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.790
And it was gorgeous.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:23.748
DAN SHAPIRO: Thank you.

00:56:23.748 --> 00:56:25.780
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Top post.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.080
Thank you so much for
coming and talking to, Dan.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.909
And I think that's
all she wrote today.

00:56:31.909 --> 00:56:33.200
DAN SHAPIRO: Thank you so much.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:33.990
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Yeah

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.350
DAN SHAPIRO: I really
appreciate being here.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.475
JULIA FERRAIOLI: Thank you.

00:56:36.475 --> 00:56:37.450
[APPLAUSE]
