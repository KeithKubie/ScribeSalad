00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:01.537
- [Voiceover] Alright, so we left off

00:00:01.537 --> 00:00:03.547
with The Battle of Gettysburg,

00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:05.797
from July 1st to 3rd, 1863.

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:08.930
And as I mentioned in the last video,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.568
Gettysburg was a really significant battle

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:13.849
in the Civil War.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.448
It was a real turning
point for the Civil War,

00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:19.665
at which Lee brought
the forces of the South

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.291
up into the North for a
second attempt at an invasion,

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:25.454
and once again, was turned away by

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:28.853
the forces of Union General, George Meade.

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:32.264
Gettysburg was the most destructive
battle of the Civil War,

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:35.479
there were about 50,000 casualties,

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.435
and it, along with the victory
of The Siege of Vicksburg,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.289
which followed the day after, on July 4th,

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.210
really start to signify
the beginning of the end

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.023
of the Confederacy's bid for independence.

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.928
Now, what you may not know
about The Battle of Gettysburg,

00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:53.447
is that is was almost the end of the war,

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:56.309
in fact, Lee took his
army, trying to cross back

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.414
over the Potomac into the South,

00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.757
and the Potomac was flooded so,

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.037
he and his army were pretty much pinned,

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:05.551
between this flooded river,

00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.206
and the forces of Meade in the North.

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.451
Now Meade, if he had
attacked, probably could've

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.421
won the war right there and then,

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:18.278
and Lincoln was so angry
that Meade didn't attack,

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.427
he wrote him this really
nasty letter saying,

00:01:21.427 --> 00:01:23.792
"I think you don't even
realize what you've done here

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.862
by letting Lee get away,
we could've ended the war

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:29.807
right now", but actually
Lincoln didn't send that letter,

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:31.919
he thought better of it, and instead

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:35.533
congratulated Meade on
his great victory and,

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.178
the boost of morale
that it gave the forces

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:40.172
of the United States, at Gettysburg.

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:42.123
So now I'd like to take
some time to talk about

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:44.991
The Gettysburg Address, which is arguably,

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.906
the most famous speech
in American History,

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:49.499
it's pretty up there.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.601
And it's extremely short,
it's only 272 words.

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:55.997
Now Lincoln delivered
The Gettysburg Address,

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:57.914
on November 19th, 1863.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:04.513
So it's about three
and a half months after

00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:07.225
The Battle of Gettysburg.

00:02:07.225 --> 00:02:09.681
I think The Gettysburg
Address is really interesting,

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:11.921
and all of the events surrounding it,

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:13.914
the circumstances surrounding it,

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:16.938
tell us a lot about
the culture and society

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:18.530
of the 19th Century,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.946
the progress of the Civil War,

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.587
and also the way that things
are going to kind of be

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:25.840
wrapped up in the end of the Civil War.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.404
What the ultimate message
of the war is going to be,

00:02:29.404 --> 00:02:32.057
and what the blueprint
of reuniting the country

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:33.498
is going to look like.

00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:37.433
So Gettysburg was this
tremendously destructive battle

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.945
with 50,000 casualties.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:41.939
And remember that, after the battle,

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.427
Lee is kinda fleeing for
the life of his army.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:49.908
And not too long after
that, Meade pursues him.

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:53.755
So the Armies make kind
of an incredible mess,

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.356
and then they take off,

00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.653
leaving this tiny town of Gettysburg,

00:02:57.653 --> 00:03:00.618
which has I think about 2,500 people,

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:03.201
to deal with 50,000 casualties.

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:07.141
So men who are dead, or wounded,

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:09.730
maybe missing in action somewhere.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.552
And they really just don't
have the capacity for it,

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:14.830
so the Governor of Pennsylvania,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.695
contracts out to create a cemetery.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:20.929
And in this period of
three and a half months,

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:25.229
there are bodies literally
rotting on the ground,

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.356
so it's a bit of a hellscape,

00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:30.439
the entire town of Gettysburg stinks,

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.524
they had to burn all the dead horses,

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:37.945
so it smells like burning
horses, and rotting human flesh.

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:40.160
It is not a happy place to be.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.293
So the town of Gettysburg and
the State of Pennsylvania,

00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:47.552
are very eager to get a
cemetery underway at Gettysburg.

00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:51.232
And so they begin the process
of burying the bodies,

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:53.166
and re-burying the bodies,

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.525
trying to identify the various corpses

00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:57.319
that are left on the fields.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.917
And they ask this man, Edward Everett,

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:05.071
who is really the Preeminent
Orator of his day.

00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.685
He was like the rock
concert of the 19th Century,

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.765
to come and give an Oration
on the Dedication of

00:04:11.765 --> 00:04:13.470
the Gettysburg Cemetery.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.748
And they say, "Everett, do
you think you can do this

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:17.165
on October 23rd?"

00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:20.593
And Everett says, "No, I
definitely won't be ready

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.773
to have a script for an Oration by then,

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:27.173
so can you push it back to November 19th?"

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:29.509
So, it's actually Everett who decides,

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.465
what day The Gettysburg Address
is going to take place on.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.510
Lincoln, by contrast,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.698
was only invited maybe
a month or so before,

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:41.824
and he wasn't really considered
the important speaker

00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:43.722
of the day, that was Everett.

00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:47.427
But Lincoln knew, that he
wanted to make something

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.153
of his remarks at Gettysburg.

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:53.946
Now remember that, an election
year is coming up in 1864,

00:04:53.946 --> 00:04:57.288
it's been a hard year,
Gettysburg is the first

00:04:57.288 --> 00:05:00.296
major victory that the
United States forces

00:05:00.296 --> 00:05:02.152
have had in a long time,

00:05:02.152 --> 00:05:04.859
so he kinda wants to make sure that

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:07.852
he can set the tone of how Gettysburg

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:09.499
is going to be remembered,

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.208
and to reconfirm a sense of mission,

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.664
about the Civil War right,

00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:16.784
when there's been such
a great loss of life,

00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:18.430
and when you're standing around looking

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.556
at that loss of life,

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:21.835
it can be very easy to
get discouraged and say,

00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:24.492
okay, maybe we should just end the war,

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:29.479
we should have peace now,
allow the South to secede and,

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.412
retain slavery, and
Lincoln wants to make sure

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:36.837
that people come away from
this Dedication at Gettysburg,

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.212
with a renewed sense of purpose,

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:41.357
in continuing to fight the Civil War.

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:43.612
Now there's a common misconception that,

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:45.877
Lincoln wrote The Gettysburg Address

00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:49.732
on the back of an envelope
on the train to Gettysburg.

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.860
That is almost certainly not the case,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.704
because Lincoln was a planner.

00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:57.157
Remember that he was self-educated,

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:01.111
and he always took a lot of
time in anything that he wrote.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.758
He wrote drafts and got revisions and,

00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:05.644
wrote yet another draft.

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:09.372
He liked to be extremely
precise with his language,

00:06:09.372 --> 00:06:10.996
and you can see that throughout

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:13.149
pretty much everything that he's written,

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:17.379
that he is an extremely
effective and eloquent writer.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.727
And that wasn't just because he was

00:06:19.727 --> 00:06:22.009
an extremely eloquent person, he was.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.700
That's cuz he worked really hard at it.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.021
So we're fairly certain,

00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:27.062
that Lincoln spent some time drafting

00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:28.733
The Gettysburg Address in The White House,

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:30.203
long before he left.

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:33.620
So, the day arrives, November 19th, 1863,

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:37.380
and Everett gets set up in a tent,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.101
cuz he's the real headliner of the day.

00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:41.700
Now Edward Everett was I think,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.867
the undisputed champion of
giving speeches in his day.

00:06:46.803 --> 00:06:49.216
He was an incredible speaker,

00:06:49.216 --> 00:06:51.888
and everyone who was there,
actually agreed that,

00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:54.312
Everett did an incredible job speaking,

00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:57.167
he spoke for over two hours,

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.180
and if that sounds like
a really long time to us,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.597
for the 19th Century that was
actually pretty appropriate.

00:07:03.597 --> 00:07:06.019
That's what people
expected out of Oratory,

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.149
in the 19th Century.

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.411
They paid attention,
they were riveted by it.

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:13.829
It was like going to see a
movie or a concert today.

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:17.955
So people really wanted to hear
Everett talk for that long.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:19.235
In fact, they were quite confused,

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:20.818
when Lincoln didn't talk for longer

00:07:20.818 --> 00:07:22.523
then just a couple of minutes.

00:07:22.523 --> 00:07:24.691
A lot of people even were reported to say,

00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:25.692
"Was that it?"

00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:27.300
So here in the center we have a picture

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.918
of the day at Gettysburg and,

00:07:29.918 --> 00:07:33.559
we're pretty sure that this
is the only confirmed picture

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:35.516
of Lincoln at Gettysburg.

00:07:35.516 --> 00:07:36.683
Now, he's kinda small here,

00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:38.795
but I think this is a
really interesting picture,

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.753
cuz it gives you a sense of

00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:42.983
what Lincoln's stature was at the time,

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:45.678
and also the people that
he surrounded himself with.

00:07:45.678 --> 00:07:50.090
So, this is Lincoln here,
right here in the center,

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.803
not wearing a hat, looking down,

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:56.060
and then he's surrounded
by the important people

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.560
of his cabinet, so right here,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.724
I'm pretty sure this is William Seward,

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:04.343
who was the Secretary of State,

00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:08.227
and over here, these are
John Hay and John Nicolay

00:08:08.227 --> 00:08:10.205
who were Lincoln's Personal Secretaries.

00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:11.894
They went everywhere with him,

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:16.259
and this guy up here is
a little harder to see,

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:18.299
that is Edward Everett.

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.268
Now imagine what it would have been like,

00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:24.676
to stand on this field,
in this growing cemetery

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:27.619
at Gettysburg, and
listen to Edward Everett,

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:30.531
and Abraham Lincoln talk about the meaning

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.053
of the battle around you.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:35.163
Now remember, that it's
November, so it's been

00:08:35.163 --> 00:08:37.880
three and a half months since the battle,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.020
but The Battle of Gettysburg took place,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.892
in the beginning of July,

00:08:41.892 --> 00:08:45.459
and it was 90, 100 degrees outside,

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.530
so when Lee and Meade left Gettysburg,

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.113
they left 8,000 or more bodies,

00:08:52.068 --> 00:08:55.043
rotting in the hot July sun.

00:08:55.043 --> 00:08:58.027
And many of them had
been out there rotting,

00:08:58.027 --> 00:09:00.259
for those three months so,

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:03.659
when you were standing on
this field at Gettysburg,

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:07.618
there would have literally
been human bones around you,

00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:08.554
that you could see.

00:09:08.554 --> 00:09:12.259
It probably would have still
smelled pretty terrible,

00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:14.708
so you're really kind of in the thick of

00:09:14.708 --> 00:09:17.115
the destruction of the Civil War,

00:09:17.115 --> 00:09:18.724
and listening to these two men,

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.053
who are trying to make
meaning out of it for you,

00:09:21.053 --> 00:09:25.229
so Everett gets up, and
he gives this fiery speech

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:28.661
for two hours, and he goes
through all of the details

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:30.915
of the battle and says,
"This is what happened

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:32.759
over on that hill, and
this is what happened

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:36.435
over on that hill", and he
tries to rev up the crowd

00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:39.252
into kind of this patriotic fervor,

00:09:39.252 --> 00:09:42.479
of not only appreciating the glory of

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.567
The Union Victory at Gettysburg, but also

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:47.267
renewing their hatred for their enemy,

00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:49.254
and then Lincoln gets up to speak,

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:52.164
and he speaks for just a couple minutes,

00:09:52.164 --> 00:09:53.617
and we'll talk more about that,

00:09:53.617 --> 00:09:54.613
in the next video.
