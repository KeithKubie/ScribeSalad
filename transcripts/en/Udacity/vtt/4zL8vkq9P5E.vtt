00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here's our formula again. Let's assume I have the following the data.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's an x variable, y variable, and we have four data points.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
6 goes to 7, 2 to 3, 1 to 2, -1 to 0, and very quickly we can just look at the data diagram.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this case, a scatter plot. So here's the x axis and here's the y axis.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And if I plug the data, 6 goes to 7, just about here, 2 to 3, 1 to 2, and 1- to 0,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
not surprisingly this data is in fact, linear.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Whatever nonlinear you see is because of my poor drawing skills.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And if you analyze carefully, you already saw that y is always respond larger than x.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So before we apply the formula, let's just quickly guess what b and a would be,

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
if y is always found larger than x. What are the coefficients of b and a?
