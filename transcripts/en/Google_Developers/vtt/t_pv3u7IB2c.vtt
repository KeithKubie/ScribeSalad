WIM MEEUSSEN: Welcome,
and thank you for coming.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.390
I know it's been a long day.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.650
I think this is probably
the last talk for today.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.640
So I appreciate your being here.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.380
I'll try to keep
it very exciting.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.810
I have a lot of
live demos lined up.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.330
So hopefully this will be fun.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.790
So my name is Wim Meeussen.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.340
And I lead the developer
engineering team

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.010
for the Asia-Pacific region.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.570
And today I want to
talk a little bit

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.690
about why we are
investing in Tango

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.170
and why we care so much
about this technology.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.500
I want to go into
what exactly Tango is

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.000
and what kind of experiences
you can enable on top of Tango.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.870
And then, of course, this
is a developer conference.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.320
I want to talk about
how you, as a developer,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.630
can use Tango to
build new experiences.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.280
So first, I guess,
before I start,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.530
I always like to get an
idea of your backgrounds.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.570
So by raise of hands, who
has heard about Project Tango

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.770
before today?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.240
That's about, let's say,
a third of the room.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.330
Great.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240
And then maybe the
harder question.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.166
Has anyone developed
on Tango before?

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.540
No developers?

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.060
OK, this is awesome.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.320
So today I will show you how
you can get started on Tango.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.290
I'll show you the experiences
that you can build.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.450
So let's first do a little
introduction in Tango.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
So fundamentally Tango is
about using computer vision

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.690
to allow your mobile device to
understand the world around it.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.860
And as people, we have
this really amazing skill.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490
We can just look at the
world and really understand

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.812
the geometry, and we
understand how we move.

00:01:49.812 --> 00:01:50.770
That's kind of amazing.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.410
It's just light
coming into our eye.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.500
And then our brain is
processing those signals.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.300
And based on that, we know
how to operate in the world.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.180
As a person, if you
look at this scene,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.830
you immediately understand that
this wide blob is a place where

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.580
you can go sit down.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.040
And you know the brown area
is a place where you can walk.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.990
Or as a person, just
by looking at a scene,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.250
you would know where you could
put down a glass of water.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.070
Or you can recognize
a dangerous situation,

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.230
like somewhere where
you have to watch out,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.660
just by looking at the scene.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.000
And we want to give
your mobile device some

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.550
of those same capabilities.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.510
So with Tango, instead
of seeing this scene

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.870
as just millions and
millions of pixels,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.700
we want your phone
to really understand

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.290
the geometry of that room.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.890
And we want your
phone to understand

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.710
how it moves through the space.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.410
So with Tango, we're
using computer vision

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.600
to really give your mobile
device an understanding

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.680
of space and motion.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680
So maybe that sounds
all a little hand-wavy.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.500
So let me just show you a demo.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.180
I'll show you the app that
you get to see when you first

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.650
buy a Tango phone.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.940
This is the welcome
experience that you get.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.260
And I have this Go Pro rig.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.780
It's not perfect, but
it really shows you

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.664
what the experience would be.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:26.830
Could we switch to the demo?

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.711
So this is a welcome
experience for Tango.

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:51.693
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.361
There you go.

00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:24.285
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.450
So this really gives
you an idea of all

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.960
the different
capabilities of Tango.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.040
And we'll go into
a lot more detail

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.330
during the rest of this talk.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.420
So to look a little bit
at what's coming up.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.020
So first I'll talk about
exactly what is Tango.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.070
What is the hardware?

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.370
What are the software
building blocks?

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.870
And how did we construct it?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.200
Then I'll give an overview
of all the different types

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.370
of experiences that you
can build with Tango,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.690
like going from AR to VR
to video stabilization

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.950
to-- even to navigation.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.880
So we'll cover the
entire spectrum.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.840
Then I'll go into
much more depth

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.830
and explain step by step how you
can build an augmented reality

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.990
experience.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.060
And of course, we're in China.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.000
So I want to talk about
how can you use Tango

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.620
as a developer in China.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.709
What are all the tools
and building blocks

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.000
that we have available for you?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.810
So let's get started.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.700
What is Tango?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.450
What exactly is it?

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.120
So first we'll go
into the hardware,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.810
because Tango runs on
custom hardware that

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.610
enables these kind of
computer vision capabilities.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.550
So I want to give you a little
bit of an overview of where

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.490
we've come in the
last four years

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.100
as we've been building Tango.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.600
So back in 2012, we started
out with just an idea.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.850
We had this sketch.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.800
We had this idea for what would
be possible on a mobile device.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.150
A little later, we built
our first prototype.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.020
So I found this really
old picture of one

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.280
of our very first prototypes
built into plexiglass.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.440
After that, we
started looking at can

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.650
we reduce the form
factor for Tango?

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.990
Can we make all the
components smaller?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.460
Can we deal with
all the thermals?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.240
And can we create it
into a phone form factor?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.640
And then about two years ago--

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.370
this was one too fast--

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:37.290
about two years ago, we released
our first Tango developer kit.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.680
So this was still a
platform at small scale

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.390
to give our developers a
preview of what Tango could do,

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.720
so they could experience
Tango even before we publicly

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.870
released a real device.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.950
And I'm really exciting,
just last month, Lenovo

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.340
announced their first
consumer Tango device.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.620
And this device will
be launched worldwide.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.360
It'll also be available
here in China.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.320
So let's break down
the phone a little

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.560
and think about all these
different prototypes.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.810
They have three
things in common.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.610
Those are the three
specific things

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.530
that every Tango
enabled phone has.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.490
So first, every Tango
device has the ability

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.380
to sense 3D in the world.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.440
So every Tango device
has a depth sensor.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.330
Second, every Tango device
has a wide angle motion

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.240
tracking camera.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.720
And this allows
your device to know

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.360
how it moves through space.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.610
And then, of course, to
do all the heavy computer

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.510
vision processing, we have
a special vision processing

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.060
chip in every device.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:01.010
So the Lenovo device comes with
a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.250
So these are the
three components,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.180
the specific hardware specs
that you need to have a Tango

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.499
compliant device.

00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:11.040
And if we take a
little bit of a step

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.330
back and look at mobile
phones, some time

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.470
not too long ago a phone was
meant to make phone calls.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.950
And then slowly over time, more
and more pieces of hardware

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.000
got added to it.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.770
At some point, cameras became
standard on every phone.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.500
Accelerometers came, gyros,
GPS is of course in every phone

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.662
right now.

00:09:34.662 --> 00:09:37.120
And then more recently, you've
seen things like fingerprint

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.350
sensors on every phone.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.820
And we believe that the
ability for your phone

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.120
to see the world in
the same way we do,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.450
for your phone to
understand motion and space,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.620
it's so fundamental in how
we interact with the world

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.300
that we believe that
these Tango specs are

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.900
inevitable for mobile
phones to also add

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.620
this as a next capability.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.940
So let's take a look at
the different software

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.380
components that make Tango.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.770
So there's three
core building blocks

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.630
that you find on
every Tango device.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.830
So there is motion
tracking, area learning,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.140
and depth perception.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.000
And I'll go into more detail for
each of the three components.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.300
Let me just grab a
phone real quick.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.900
So motion tracking is
kind of what it says.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.370
It allows your device to know
how it moves through space.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.040
So if I start with
my device here,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.280
and I move forward by a
meter, motion tracking

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.180
will tell me you moved
forward by a meter.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.920
If I rotate 180 degrees,
motion tracking will tell me,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.910
you moved forward by a meter,
and I rotated 180 degrees.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.850
If I then go back
to where I started,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.890
again, motion
tracking will tell me

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.770
that I'm back approximately
to where I started.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.370
So motion tracking tells you
how you go forward, backwards,

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.440
left, right, up, down.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.780
And it knows three
different rotations.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.370
So in full six
degrees of freedom,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.380
it knows how your
device moves in space.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.340
So our second building
blog is area learning.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.570
And I want to try something
new with you guys.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.830
I want to try a
little experiment.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:39.360
So I want to ask everyone, close
your eyes for just a minute.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.110
Everybody eyes closed?

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.840
So now point with your
finger to the door

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.090
where you came into this room.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.880
Yeah, awesome, thank you.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.990
Everyone of you, as
you walked into here,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.760
you built up a memory of
what this space looked like.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.260
You can open your
eyes again, sorry.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.480
But think about it.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.580
You built up this memory.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.134
You remembered
where the door was.

00:12:11.134 --> 00:12:12.550
You remember where
you're sitting.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.070
You probably remember
where the stage is.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.010
So you build up this
memory of your world.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.630
And this is exactly what
Tango does for area learning.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.190
Area learning gives
Tango a memory

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.430
so it can recognize a
space it has seen before.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.810
That's our second
building block.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.530
Our third building block
is depth perception.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.490
So because every Tango
device has a depth sensor,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.010
if I point my
device at something,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.630
the depth sensor will be able to
see the geometry of everything

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.130
I point at.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.090
So if I point here,
my depth sensor

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.640
will be able to see
the surface here.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.080
If I point it at the back, I'll
see the surface of the back.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.230
So everywhere I point
this, I can see the world

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.200
in three dimensions
with the depth sensor.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.680
So those are the three core
building blocks for Tango.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.530
So now, I guess, you
have an understanding

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.569
of what makes a Tango
hardware unique.

00:13:16.569 --> 00:13:18.360
And you understand the
three basic building

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.400
blocks in our software SDK.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.850
So let's look at what
are all the things you

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.235
can build with this using
these three building blocks?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.540
So I will show a
number of demos now.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.040
And for each of the
demos, I will show you

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.320
which of those three
building blocks

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.220
that we use to build that demo.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.410
So I'll tell you if something
used motion tracking, area

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.400
learning, depth perception,
or a combination of those.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.790
So first let's look
at a VR experience.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.970
So it's not VR as in Daydream
that you have a headset.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.460
This is handheld VR.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.550
So it means that
everything Tango shows you,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.650
it's all virtual.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.590
So let me switch to a demo here.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.550
And I'll show you a fully
VR application in Tango.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.060
It's called Hot Wheels.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.040
You get to race cars.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.830
I'm already at level three.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.670
I earned some coins.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.170
One second, there we go.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:53.460
So here you can see, I am
in a complete virtual world.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.190
And with Tango, I can
walk around in that world.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.380
And I can go look
at little details.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:07.150
But everything my
device shows is virtual.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.180
And then from here, I can start
interacting with the world.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.460
If I go to the start of my
track, I can launch my car.

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:21.170
You'll watch it
drive over the track.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.660
So here my Tango phone is this
six degrees of freedom joystick

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.340
almost to guide me
through the world.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.360
And I can interact at different
places with the world.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.750
So to build this kind
of VR applications,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.850
let's see what kind of
building blocks you need.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.650
And that is one of
the simplest things

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.010
you can do, because all you
need is motion tracking,

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.660
because you only
need to know how

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.700
are you moving through space.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.640
Once you know how you're moving,
you know what kind of scene

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.080
to render.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.430
So that's VR.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.780
Let's look at the next part.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.440
So if we take it
one step further,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.230
what if you want to build an
augmented reality experience?

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.965
So let's jump back
to a few demos here.

00:16:22.797 --> 00:16:25.080
And I have a few different
apps I wanted to show you.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.110
So the first app allows me
to put a virtual dinosaur

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.860
in the real world.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.300
So I can select what
dinosaur I want,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.230
and then just add
it to the world.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.500
And you can go look at it
from all different angles.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.869
You can make it small.

00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:00.660
You can make a big.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.300
So let's see.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.660
Let's add a bigger guy here.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.470
Now he's at 55%.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.020
So let's blow him
up all the way.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.430
You can really get a sense
of the size of this animal.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.180
If I go a little
closer, you really

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.530
get a sense of this big
animal being right here.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.790
So let's jump to another demo.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:48.600
So this was more I was
showing you a static object.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.380
But in AR, you can also start
interacting with the world.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.320
Let's show another game.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.440
It's called Domino World.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.810
So in this game, I can
start building my own domino

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.230
track on the real world.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.985
So let me build some here.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.820
And I can just place
blocks by moving around.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.320
And then I have a whole toolbox.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.120
If I want to add,
let's say, a bridge,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.500
I can add a bridge to my game.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.840
I can add different
color blocks.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.360
And I can literally freely
walk around in my space.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.810
And maybe we can hop onto
stage and continue right here.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:51.280
So you can build this entire
track of domino blocks.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.320
And then we can add
some cool effects.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.820
So let's add some explosions
to some of our blocks.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.874
And then maybe try
one more trick.

00:19:04.874 --> 00:19:06.540
I don't even know
what it's going to do.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.650
So now that I've created
this virtual domino,

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.440
I can just start
it and let it run.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.998
Let me give you some sound.

00:19:20.998 --> 00:19:22.982
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:32.655
Let's see what happened.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.330
I added a difficult block.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.920
I do not know how
I can fix this.

00:19:56.057 --> 00:19:59.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.605
So even in the virtual
world, this is kind of hard.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.498
OK, let me try one more.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.560
I added a few more blocks.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.110
Last attempt.

00:20:33.057 --> 00:20:33.890
They're still going.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:34.570
There we go.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.667
Dominos.

00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:44.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:44.239 --> 00:20:45.530
I could use some practice here.

00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:50.350
So one more app I
wanted to show you.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.080
And this one I'm actually
pretty excited about.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.720
So Jingdong has built an app
on top of Tango that allows

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.550
you to do online shopping.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.500
But then you can visualize
items in augmented reality.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.470
That's one of the challenges
you have in virtual shopping,

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.960
with online shopping.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.570
You don't get a real idea
of what things look like.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:21.710
So if the Wi-Fi works out, let
me show you what this could be.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.750
So here I can choose
between AR and VR.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.065
So let's pick AR.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.730
And now we're waiting
for the Wi-Fi.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.250
There we go.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.256
So I could scroll through
different products.

00:21:35.256 --> 00:21:38.370
So let's say I wanted
to try out a couch.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.260
So this app is live.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.576
It's running right now,
getting data from the internet.

00:21:49.576 --> 00:21:51.200
It's also part of
the Lenovo app store.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.930
And let's see if the
Wi-Fi comes through.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.090
Let me just give this a little
bit of time while it's loading,

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:11.050
and talk already about what
the building blocks are

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.810
that we need to build these
augmented reality applications.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:20.372
So obviously, to build this
you need motion tracking,

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.830
because, again, we
want to know how

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.530
we are moving through space.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.630
But motion tracking
alone is not enough.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.710
In order to know where we
can place virtual objects--

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.780
like you want your dinosaur
to be on the ground--

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.540
so in order to know where
we can place things,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.330
we also need depth perception.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.990
So to build AR, you need both
motion tracking and depth

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.007
perception.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.225
Let me give this one more
try, because it's super cool.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.357
Not enough Wi-Fi, maybe too
many people in one room.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.650
Let's jump back to
the slides then.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:19.250
So as I talked about for AR,
we need both motion tracking

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.920
and depth perception.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.260
With those two building blocks,
you can build these experiences

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.060
that you just saw.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.690
So now let's take
a look at things

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.470
we can do if you use a
depth sensor for more

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.960
advanced capabilities,
because depth sensor

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.850
can see the world in 3D.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.180
So let's see what we can
do with an app to start

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.290
measuring the real world.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.716
So let's jump back
to the demo here.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.660
This is an app called Measure.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.310
And again, because it's Tango,
I can freely move in space.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:07.480
So I can come here to the
front and maybe measure

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.200
how wide this row of people is.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:19.900
And I can place my second point.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.990
There we go, three
and a half meters.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.180
So I can just freely
move through space

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.830
and start measuring things.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.410
So let's try
something more in 3D.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:38.050
So let's start measuring some
of the tiles on the floor here.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.740
So now it allows me to
fully extend it and create

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.920
a full volume out of it.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.300
So if I go a little
further away,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.480
you can see I can
start measuring areas.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.450
I can start measuring volumes.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.320
And I can just do it
anywhere in the world.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.940
Anywhere where I
can tap and click,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.600
I can start measuring in 3D.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.460
Let's jump back to the slides.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.370
So to enable this 3D
measuring, we actually

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:35.130
will rely on motion tracking
and area learning and depth

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.850
perception.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.240
So you probably understand
why you need motion tracking

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.750
and why you need depth.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.680
But why do you need
area learning here?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.240
And area learning
is going to help

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.110
you to improve your accuracy,
because when I place points

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.980
in the world, I want my Tango
device to remember where

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.560
exactly it placed those points.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.170
I don't want those points to
start drifting away over time.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.310
So by using area learning and
giving my device a memory,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.520
it can remember exactly
where it placed those points.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.642
And when I walk around and
start putting dots all around,

00:26:09.642 --> 00:26:11.100
Tango remembers
where I placed them

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.930
and gets more
accurate measurements

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.790
than I would otherwise get.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.910
So area learning can help
you to increase the accuracy

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.280
and reduce drift
for your device.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.170
Let's look at what
if we go all the way?

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.920
What is the very best we can
do with our depth sensor?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.910
Can we build 3D
models of the world?

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.320
And I have a pretty
cool application here.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.810
It's called The Constructor app.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.870
And I'm going to try to make
a model of some of you guys

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:42.370
here in front.

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:48.170
Let's just jump back
to the demo here.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.840
So now you can see
a live view of what

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.360
the depth sensor can see.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.020
So you can see right
in front of me,

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.804
it can see the 3D
shape of people here.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.560
So now what if we, instead of
taking one depth measurement,

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.570
if we start accumulating
all these depth

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.040
measurements together?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.240
So if I could ask you
guys to sit really still,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.260
then we can build a
really nice model here.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.060
So I press Record.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.530
And I can keep adding
new information

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.450
and keep accumulating more
and more depth measurements.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.880
So now I save it.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.574
So now the model gets optimized.

00:28:07.574 --> 00:28:08.990
And the camera is
a little blurry.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.721
I apologize for that.

00:28:11.721 --> 00:28:13.220
It looks a lot
better on the screen.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:20.070
So now we have an
actual 3D model

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.880
of the people in this room.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.816
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.350
All right, let's jump
back to our slides.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.090
So to build this 3D model,
again, we need motion tracking.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.930
Motion tracking, as
you probably see,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.710
is one of the core
foundations of Tango.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.340
Almost anything
you do with Tango

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.670
will rely on motion tracking.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.950
And then here, obviously, we
need the depth sensor again.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.825
You could use area learning
if you need more accuracy.

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:07.880
But this demo that I just showed
was not using area learning.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.595
So it shows you what you can do
even with just motion tracking

00:29:10.595 --> 00:29:11.095
alone.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.120
Let's look at some other
applications that are possible.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.220
Because Tango knows exactly
how your device is moving--

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.480
so let's say you're shooting
a video while you're walking.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.134
Tango will know exactly how your
device is moving as you walk.

00:29:31.134 --> 00:29:32.800
And obviously you
don't want your device

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.190
to shake up and down as
you're making a video.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.930
So because Tango
knows how you move,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.950
it can also compensate for
the motion in your video.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.600
So you can start doing
video stabilization.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.630
And because Tango is
six degrees of freedom,

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.270
you can do a full 3D video
stabilization with Tango.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.950
It's not just orientation.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:01.040
But you can compensate for
all the motions of the camera.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.910
And for this, obviously, again,
you need motion tracking.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.680
And optionally,
you could use that,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.360
if you want to have
more information

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.910
about your scene on how
you want to correct it,

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.150
or you could it without it.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:15.790
It depends on how you want
to correct for the motion.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.530
But that is available
if you want.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.300
So now let's look at
a future application.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.650
So imagine if you used area
learning, not just to remember

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.230
a few feet in front
of you, but what

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.140
if you remember an
entire building, if you

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.680
go scan an entire mall,
or an entire museum?

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.830
Then Tango could
provide you directions

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.300
on how to get from A
to B in that space.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.530
And you could do it in full AR.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.917
The video is a
little choppy here.

00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:52.000
You can see on the screen.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.930
You could paint dots on the
floor in augmented reality.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.880
They guide you all
the way from where you

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.430
are to where you want to go.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.230
If you want to build something
like this, of course,

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.920
motion tracking is one
of your components.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.170
But then to do this, I
guess you need something

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.760
like area learning, and not just
area learning on your device.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.810
You need area
learning on steroids.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.730
You want to put area
learning in the cloud,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.010
process very large
amounts of data

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.010
if you want to enable
something like this.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.620
So this is one of the
future applications that

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.140
can become possible with Tango.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:37.280
So right now you
understand how Tango works.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.800
You have a bit of an idea
of all the different things

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.660
you can do with Tango.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.750
So let's take some time
and just focus on AR,

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.440
because what we see is most
of our compelling experiences

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.880
tend to be in the AR space.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.720
So let's go step by
step on how you build

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.698
augmented reality with Tango.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.520
So let's say we want to do this.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.840
We want to add a virtual
cat into the real world.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.950
Sounds pretty simple, right?

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.390
Let's go through step-by-step.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.360
So first let's think
about the real world.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.480
Obviously, the real
world is all in 3D.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.370
And what happens when our
phone looks at the 3D world,

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.330
we get to see a 2D
projection of the 3D world

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.990
in our camera view.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.410
So if you look at it
from a different angle,

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:34.270
the 3D world gets projected
in 2D in our phone.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.490
So our phone sees something
like this through the camera.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.660
And as you move
around, the 3D world

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.154
would get projected in different
ways onto your 2D phone.

00:32:46.154 --> 00:32:47.570
So as you move
around, you can see

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.270
different angles of the table.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.690
And of course,
this is just video.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.040
This happens automatically.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.590
We don't need to do anything.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.360
But now, if you want
to add a virtual object

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.290
into this real world,
it's the same principle.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.170
We have a virtual 3D object.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.100
And we want to show that in
a 2D projection in our world,

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.180
in our camera.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.660
So we're going to do the
same thing as what naturally

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.170
happens with the camera.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.040
We're going to go from 3D to 2D.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.380
And as we walk around, you
want to get all different 2D

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.200
projections of the real world.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.460
Let's try something
simple first.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.300
Let's just try to render
that virtual object alone.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.900
Let's forget about the
real world for a second.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.724
And let me show you a demo here.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.690
So in this demo, I'm
just going to try to add

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.510
a virtual object to the world.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.815
We want to be able to see it
from all different angles.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.000
There's our cat.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.710
And then now, as
I walk around, I

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.900
can see it from all
different angles.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.719
So it's doing exactly
what we want to happen.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:15.500
We take our 3D virtual model
and create all different 2D

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.334
projections as we walk around.

00:34:20.334 --> 00:34:25.010
So now let's try to do a
little bit of a naive step.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:29.120
Let's take our virtual cat
and just add it together

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.130
with a video feed.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.050
Let's just put the two
together in a naive way

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.982
and see what happens.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.100
So this time, here's
the real world.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.659
And there's our cat.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:48.750
So if you put the two
together, it obviously--

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.719
it's not quite right.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.710
Even though we're doing
all the rendering good,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.650
we're doing all the
motion good, it still

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.080
doesn't look realistic,
because, obviously, we don't

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.910
want our cat floating in space.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.440
So to create a
compelling AR experience,

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.770
we need to know where we
can put these objects.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:10.390
We cannot just put
them anywhere we want.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.728
So let's jump to the
slides real quick.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.930
So this is what
we did until now.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.500
We just took our virtual
cat, added it to the world.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.930
Not good.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.200
So what we really
want is we want

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.030
to find all the different places
of where we can place our cats.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.060
And luckily, the
Tango SDK allows

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.240
you to do this with
just one function call.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.090
You can tap somewhere
on the screen,

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:46.330
and the Tango SDK will tell
you what the local surface is.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:49.090
It'll tell you where
you can place something.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.150
So it'll give you a
3D point and a normal.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.120
So you could tap
anywhere on the screen,

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.310
and Tango will tell
you, here's where

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.930
you can place your virtual
objects in the real world.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.800
So if you select
one of those points,

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.980
you want to put our
virtual cat right there.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.317
So let's give it a try.

00:36:09.317 --> 00:36:10.525
Let's put those two together.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:26.630
So the next step in our demo,
so again, we see the real world.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.640
And there our cat is now
not floating in space,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.290
but nicely sitting
on the ground.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.210
So this looks a
lot more realistic

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.250
than our floating cat.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.670
We can go up close.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.310
And now, since Tango can
understand the world,

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.070
I can just tap
somewhere on the screen

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.910
and let my cat walk there.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:07.290
And I can go back on stage
and tap on a higher surface.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.480
And because Tango
fully understands 3D,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.880
We know exactly where
to jump through.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.550
Again, just I do a
click, and Tango tells me

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.096
where the 3D surface is where I
can make my virtual object go.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.592
Let's see if we can go
onto the table here.

00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:31.560
There we go.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.680
So this is all pretty cool.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.220
So let me show you where
it's not quite right yet.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.330
So I'm going to put the
cat here behind the table.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.719
And I'm going to move to
the other side of the table.

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:49.260
And you're going to
see what happens.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.430
Again, no good.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:02.190
So even though our cat
is in the right place,

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:07.030
if I don't hide the cat when
it's behind a physical object,

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.410
it doesn't look good again.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.030
So we really want
to know where there

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.186
are occlusions in the world.

00:38:13.186 --> 00:38:14.560
So let's jump back
to the slides.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.640
So remember we just built
this 3D model with Tango

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.530
using a depth sensor?

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.710
So what if we use that
to construct a model

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.540
of our occlusions in the world?

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.540
So instead of showing the
cat through an object,

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.790
we can create a simple model
of what the obstacle looks like

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.760
and then use it to
hide a part of our cat.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.690
So we can do at least an
approximate occlusion of what

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.180
we can see and
what we cannot see.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.760
So let's go to
the demo once more

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.750
and show the last version
of the cat AR demo.

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.170
So in this application,
we're going

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.190
to start out by building
a mesh of the world.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.640
So you can see the gray.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.830
That's the mesh that
we're slowly building.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.666
So as I walk around, I'm
creating a 3D model of what

00:39:38.666 --> 00:39:39.790
the environment looks like.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.990
And I can tell Tango
to save the mesh.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.760
So now we have a mesh saved.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.290
So if I go find
my cat somewhere--

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:58.630
so let me ask my cat again
to go behind the table.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:05.830
So now if I move, my 3D model
can help to hide the cat.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.450
Let me put it back up here.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:11.920
There we go.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.580
And here we're not
actually hiding the--

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.770
it really likes to
jump down there.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.540
OK.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.557
Let me try once more.

00:40:24.966 --> 00:40:25.730
There we go.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:37.140
So I'm actually
still showing the cat

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.900
where we would have
rendered it, just

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.360
to show you what we're hiding.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.710
And if I come out
from behind the mesh,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.017
we can see that cat again.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.750
You can see it's
not 100% perfect.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.520
The edges are not quite always
exactly at the right place.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.340
But as a developer, you can
kind use some creativity.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.100
Maybe you can blend
the edges a little

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.230
and work around some
of those limitations

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.594
to make it a really
compelling experience.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.470
Let's jump back to our slides.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.280
So these were all the
steps to go building

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.020
in the AR application.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.750
And for all these steps, we have
tools built into the Tango SDK.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.020
So all of these things are
very easy as a developer.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.460
They're just functions
available for you to use.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.150
If you look at what AR can
do, this is an example of--

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:40.590
it's pretty amazing.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.580
It's like one virtual
car, one real car.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.070
If you look on the
roof of the car,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.720
you can even see the reflection
of the building onto the car.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.890
So to create really,
really perfect AR,

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.720
there's a lot of
additional steps

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.000
on top of just dealing
with occlusions

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.910
and geometry of the world.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.520
But even with the
tools we already have,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.280
you can create really
compelling experiences.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.209
It doesn't have to be
picture perfect to make

00:42:10.209 --> 00:42:11.958
a really compelling
experience for a user.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.360
Let's talk a little
bit about developers,

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.850
how you guys can develop on
top of Tango from within China.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.370
And I want to go through
a number of building

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:33.010
blocks of things that
you need to be developer

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:34.810
and to be successful.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.620
So first, obviously,
you need devices.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.570
You want devices to develop on.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.390
And you want to have
users to have devices

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:45.510
so they can use your apps.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.140
And this is why it's
great that Lenovo

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.870
has launched the Tango device,
the Phab 2 Pro, worldwide.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.430
Very soon you
should be expecting

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.490
an announcement from Lenovo
about where and when you

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.570
can buy it in China.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.490
That's coming up very soon.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.410
This device will be available
in China for purchase.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:13.230
So first thing you want devices
in China, Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:18.570
Second part, and you probably
know as a user in China,

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.490
you don't always get
the latest updates,

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:23.250
because there's multiple
Play Stores available.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.752
And you don't always get
the latest software updates

00:43:25.752 --> 00:43:27.210
that are available
through the Play

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.310
Store in the rest of the world.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:33.090
So for Tango we will make
sure that every time we

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.730
release a new version
of the Tango software,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.490
we will also release it
in the Lenovo App Store.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:44.010
So users in China
will always have

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.920
the latest and greatest
Tango software, just

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.960
like the rest of the world.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.170
So you get Tango
software updates.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.550
The third component,
documentation.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.680
And just today, there was
actually two important launches

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.300
that happened.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.480
One is Google made all their
developer documentation

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.630
available directly in China.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.590
And at the same time, we
launched a new Tango website

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.600
that is compatible with the
content you can view in China.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.330
So I'll show the
link a little later.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.890
But you have all
our documentation,

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:26.060
all our example
apps, all our SDKs.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.171
Everything is there available
from China directly.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.690
And then, of course, when
you build applications,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.740
you want to have a
place to find users.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.030
And Google Play is
a great platform

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.880
to find users worldwide.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.860
But then you can use
the Lenovo store.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.390
Lenovo has built a special
Tango section in their app store

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.550
to release your apps
to the Chinese market.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.700
So you have both a solution
for the international

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.165
and for the Chinese market
to get your apps to users.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.550
So we have these four
components, devices,

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.970
software updates, documentation,
and the app store.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:13.090
So it means, as a
developer in China,

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:16.150
you have all the building
blocks to build compelling Tango

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.255
experiences and address
both the Chinese

00:45:19.255 --> 00:45:20.505
and the international markets.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:28.220
So to end, I wanted to give you
the link of our brand new Tango

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.670
website.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.250
On this website, you can
find all the documentation.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.840
You can download our SDKs.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.940
We have support for C,
Java, Unity, Unreal.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.220
So everything is there
for you to get started.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.910
And maybe to add one
more thing to this,

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:50.050
because the Asian markets
are really important for us,

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:54.130
we just started staffing up a
new developer engineering team

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.170
for the Asia-Pacific markets.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.240
So we want to be here to
support you guys, and make sure

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.000
that you have everything
you need to build

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.160
really amazing applications.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.390
So go check it out, and
thank you very much.

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:11.389
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.520
You should all go check out the
Tango booth and the Daydream

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.510
booth if you haven't already.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.640
I think we still have an
hour of demos going on.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.660
So if you want to try some
of this with your own hands,

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.530
go check out the booth.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.270
Thank you.
