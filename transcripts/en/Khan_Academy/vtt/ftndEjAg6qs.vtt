00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.514
We're asked, what time is it?

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:05.180
So first, we want to look at the
hour hand, which is the shorter

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.514
hand, and see where
it is pointing.

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:08.930
So this right over
here would have

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.800
been 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 2
o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.630
And it looks like it's a
little bit past 4 o'clock.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.780
So we are in the fourth hour.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.007
So the hour is 4.

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:23.840
And then we have to
think about the minutes.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.390
The minutes are the longer hand,
and every one of these lines

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.810
represent 5 minutes.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.600
We start here.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.700
This is 0 minutes past the hour,
then 5 minutes past the hour,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.750
then 10 minutes past the hour.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.230
So the time is-- the minutes are
10, 10 minutes past the hour,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.610
and the hour is 4, or it's 4:10.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.120
Let's do a few more.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.110
What time is it?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.110
So first, we want to
look at the hour hand.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.520
That's the shorter
hand right over here.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.430
It's at-- let's see.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.160
This is 12, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.930
And it's between 9 and 10.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.720
It's just past 9.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.640
So it's still in the ninth hour.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.990
It hasn't gotten to
the 10th hour yet.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.360
The ninth hour's from starting
with 9 all the way until it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.015
right almost before
it gets to 10,

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.630
and then it gets
to the 10th hour.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.850
So the hour is 9, and
then we want the minutes.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.410
Well, we can just
count from 0 starting

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.770
at the top of the clock.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.330
So 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.267
It's 9:30.

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:32.850
And that also might
make sense to you,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.480
because we know there are
60 minutes in an hour.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.390
And this is exactly
halfway around the clock.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.080
And so half of 60 is 30.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.850
Let's do one more.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.170
What time is it?

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.950
So let's count.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.160
This is 12, 1-- actually,
we can even count backwards.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.750
We can go 12, 11, 10.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.510
So right now we're
in the 10th hour.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.530
The hour hand has passed 10,
but it hasn't gotten to 11 yet.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.250
So we are in the 10th hour.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.970
And how many minutes
past the hour are we?

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.340
So this would be 0, 5, 10,
15, 20 minutes past the hour.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.270
That's where the longer
hand is pointing.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.670
It is 10:20.
