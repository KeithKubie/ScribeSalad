00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.050
- [Instructor] There are
461 homes in the part

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.990
of town where Samir lives.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.300
He counted that 352 of
those homes are apartments.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.890
How many of the homes are not apartments?

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.710
So like always, pause this video and see

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.060
if you can work through it on your own.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.780
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.720
So we're starting with 461 homes.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.570
So we have 461, and we wanna know how many

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.270
are not apartments.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.080
So what we wanna do is take out the number

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.200
that are apartments.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.000
And they tell us that 352 of
those homes are apartments.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.690
So we'll take out the
number that are apartments

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.000
and what we will left it with is going

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970
to be the number that are not apartments.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.490
So we really just have to
evaluate 461 minus 352.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.570
And as we've talked about in other videos

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.840
there's many techniques for doing this.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.840
We could break apart 352 into
the various place values.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.680
So we could say that
this is the same thing

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.680
as 461 minus, we'll do
this in different colors,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.170
minus three hundreds,
or 300, minus five tens,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.420
or 50, and then minus
two, and then minus two

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.020
right over there.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.720
And then you might be able to figure out

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.470
that 461 minus 300, that
that is going to be,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.610
I'm just taking three 100s from this,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.640
so that's going to be 161.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.980
And then if I subtract 50 from that, well,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.280
what's 61 minus 50?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.520
Well, that would be 11.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.550
So 161 minus 50 would be 111.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.010
Or another way of thinking about it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.470
is if you take these five 10s away

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.150
from these six 10s, you'll
be left with one 10,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
so that would be 100, one 10, and one one.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.860
So you have 111.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.410
And then you want to subtract that two,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.680
last but not least, and 11
minus two would be nine.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.697
So 111 minus two would be equal to 109.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.620
But I mentioned there's many other ways

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.580
that you might try to
approach something like this.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.010
You could say, hey, well maybe it's easier

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.940
to subtract 50, or 350
I should say, then 352

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.800
and so you could subtract two
from both of these numbers.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.120
So if you subtract two
from 461, if you subtract

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.630
one you get to 460, you
subtract two you get to 459.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.630
459 minus, you subtract two
from this you get to 350.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.020
And this is all about the idea

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.810
that the difference doesn't change as long

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.090
as you add or subtract
the same number to both.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.290
And so here we might say that four 100s

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.270
minus three 100s is 100.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.110
And then 59 minus 50 is nine.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.970
So we would get the same result.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.730
The thing to appreciate
is that this is all

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.590
about subtracting 352
from 461 and that there's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.633
multiple ways of calculating this.
