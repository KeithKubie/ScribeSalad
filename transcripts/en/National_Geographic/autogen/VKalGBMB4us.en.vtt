clearly I'm wrapped up with this thing
somehow<00:02:19.350><c> so</c><00:02:19.710><c> but</c><00:02:20.190><c> I</c><00:02:20.220><c> get</c><00:02:20.400><c> it</c><00:02:20.490><c> pinned</c><00:02:20.730><c> down</c><00:02:20.850><c> with</c>

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 align:start position:0%
somehow so but I get it pinned down with
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.930 align:start position:0%
somehow so but I get it pinned down with
my<00:02:21.180><c> left</c><00:02:21.210><c> hand</c><00:02:21.510><c> and</c><00:02:21.870><c> then</c><00:02:22.650><c> I</c><00:02:22.890><c> try</c><00:02:23.220><c> to</c><00:02:23.280><c> move</c><00:02:23.790><c> my</c>

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
my left hand and then I try to move my
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.220 align:start position:0%
my left hand and then I try to move my
right<00:02:23.970><c> arm</c><00:02:24.300><c> so</c><00:02:24.480><c> I</c><00:02:24.510><c> can</c><00:02:24.660><c> pin</c><00:02:24.840><c> it</c><00:02:24.960><c> down</c><00:02:24.990><c> with</c><00:02:25.170><c> my</c>

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
like this and and what had happened was
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
like this and and what had happened was
my<00:02:37.500><c> arm</c><00:02:37.950><c> had</c><00:02:38.070><c> fallen</c><00:02:38.280><c> asleep</c><00:02:38.520><c> and</c><00:02:38.970><c> then</c><00:02:39.060><c> it</c><00:02:39.150><c> was</c>

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
my arm had fallen asleep and then it was
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
my arm had fallen asleep and then it was

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 align:start position:0%
across me like this and so so there
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
across me like this and so so there
actually<00:02:43.380><c> was</c><00:02:43.710><c> no</c><00:02:43.740><c> snake</c><00:02:44.160><c> and</c><00:02:44.630><c> and</c><00:02:45.630><c> so</c><00:02:46.140><c> then</c><00:02:46.260><c> I</c>

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 align:start position:0%
actually was no snake and and so then I
