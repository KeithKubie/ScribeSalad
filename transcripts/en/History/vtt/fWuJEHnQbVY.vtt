00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:01.876
Sweet, let's do this!

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.795
Let's get the show on the road!

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.718
MAN: You're going to be
the eyes and the air.

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:10.802
I'll be here on the ground.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.853
[inaudible]

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:20.937
Today's the day!

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.361
I believe the only way
to find Eugene's treasure

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.407
is to walk in his final steps
to the place where he died.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:37.120
NARRATOR: And that's just
what these boys are gonna do.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.496
Let's rock and roll!

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.551
Woo hoo hoo!

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.927
NARRATOR: Now when you
got miles of ground

00:00:52.927 --> 00:01:00.185
to cover looking for treasure,
it's always best to get

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:01.686
one of them bird's eye views.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.401
Man, lord, [bleep]
Willie's in the boat.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.903
NARRATOR: And no one
knows that better

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.654
than the swamp man himself.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.990
ANDRE: The other day, the boat
drifts away with Willie in it.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.242
NARRATOR: Especially if you're
trying to find something

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.577
that means the world to you.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.003
That's it.

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:27.712
That's it.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:28.588
That's it.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:29.506
Thank God, the boat!

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.382
Thank the lord Jesus.
- Willie!

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:40.725
NARRATOR: And just
like the swamp man,

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.228
Brandon and Dre are hoping
to find something that could

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.521
mean the world to them too.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.238
And high up in
the skies, Brandon

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.782
might have found something
peeking out from down below.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.296
He said it's back here
about a half a mile back.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:14.968
OK, let's [inaudible]
let's go get it.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.635
[inaudible] back.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:25.103
Right here.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.569
Oh my God.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.820
LANE: What is it?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.158
Lane, I think I know
exactly what this is.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.411
BRANDON: Woo, I'm so pumped!

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.455
I'll pull this
thing out of the mud.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.499
LANE: I could tell something
was back here, but I don't know.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.126
Just looks like a
piece of wood to me.

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.502
Yeah, but look.
See it?

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.503
See the tip, how it's carved?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.130
LANE: Yeah.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.965
This is a dugout.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:54.966
Easy does it.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.175
LANE: I got you.
- Here, here, grab my--

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.845
- I got you.
- Grab my [inaudible].

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.513
NARRATOR: Back in
Bunch's day, there

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.599
weren't no jet boats or yachts.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.184
In these parts, if he
wanted to get around fast,

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.312
you built yourself a dugout--

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.648
a small, lightweight canoe
dug right out of a tree.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.943
Swing it closer.
I'm a pull it up on the boat.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:17.614
NARRATOR: It wasn't fancy, but
for a train robber on the run,

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.574
it more than did the trick.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.785
This is the same bayous
that Eugene Bunch used.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.370
The swamp is right over there.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.872
The hollows are not far.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.373
This is the exact kind of boat.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:27.874
LANE: This is exactly
what you need.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:28.708
Exactly.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.542
LANE: Get out.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.835
I'm telling you.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.545
NARRATOR: Just like
Shelby Dunn when he

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:35.423
found that three ton anchor--

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:37.467
If it wasn't for
you, we wouldn't

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.261
have this here for the
general public to look at.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.722
NARRATOR: --Brandon and
Dre might have uncovered

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.725
a genuine piece of
Louisiana history

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.436
and a slice of their
swamp heritage.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.314
We're on it.
Look at this thing!

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.108
We're this close to
finding Eugene's treasure.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:56.569
This is the spot.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.570
The treasure's got to be close.
