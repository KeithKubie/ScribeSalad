00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.460
There's a stigma today that the older you get, the more popularity points you lose

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.660
We're afraid to age because it often translates to additional responsibilities,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540
set routines, and monotony.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.440
But what if getting older, or rather, being an old soul,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.160
regardless of what age you are, is actually rewarding?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.860
When asked what attracted him to make the film, Howl's Moving Castle, Hayao Miyazaki states

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.140
"Sophie, the girl, is given a spell and transformed into an old woman.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.380
"It would be a lie to say that turning young again would mean living happily ever after.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.240
"I didn't want to say that. I didn't want to make it seem like turning old was such a bad thing.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.120
"The idea was that maybe she'll have learned something by being old for a while

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.920
and, when she is actually old, make a better grandma.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
"Anyway, as Sophie gets older, she gets more pep. She says what's on her mind.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.200
"She's transformed from a shy, mousy, little girl to a blunt, honest woman.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.880
"It is not a motif you see often, and, especially with an old woman taking up the whole screen, it's a big theatrical risk.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.980
"But, it's a delusion that being young means you're happy."

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.600
Miyazaki breaks away from the stereotype of starring young faces when he lets old Sophie be the center

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.880
because he understands the value of her journey of maturing, giving the audience an authentic message.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.240
Being an old soul means having a sort of wisdom and outlook on life that indicates intelligence.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.100
This type of intelligence isn't synonymous to memorizing textbook definitions

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.500
but, rather, it can only be gained by observing what happens in the world

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.460
and understanding the intricacies of why those events occur.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.340
On the surface, an old soul might seem bland because they usually don't take part in culturally hip activities.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.560
but there's always more to them than meets the eye.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.100
Sound familiar? Here are 10 sure signs to look out for, if you think you identify as an old soul.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.140
One: you have a deep thirst for knowledge.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.220
You're constantly tying together information you pick up on,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.660
whether it's from literature, film, or social interactions.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.640
Instead of just skimming over various topics, you take the time to go in-depth,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.600
and carefully investigate things you strongly connect with, developing your wisdom.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.820
Two: you hate superficial small talk.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.320
Forget mentioning the weather or what you had for dinner last night.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.480
Instead, you like having meaningful conversations that stimulate your thinking.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.000
You're careful and selective about your word choice, because you like making every thought count.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.160
You naturally have strong communication and verbal skills.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.340
Sometimes others can't keep up with your conversations, making you feel lonely.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.200
Three: you see the big picture.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.680
Philosophy intrigues you. You're not afraid to question the systems and institutions of society,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.920
and ask the wise instead of just accepting things at face value.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.380
You're comfortable delving in the realm of abstraction, exploring theories, and what-ifs.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.380
You lean towards possibilities, and you're fixed on the future.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.060
because what's more abstract than the idea of a moment that hasn't happened yet?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
Four: you don't want to date.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.380
Hook-up culture is something that is difficult for you to wrap your head around

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.320
and your prefer not to participate in it.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.820
Shallow flirting, playing games, and stringing others along, are all languages you simply don't speak.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.400
You have a strong sense of self, and hold standards you refuse to lower,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.660
because that would only mean denying a core part of who you are.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.840
after all, there's bound to be someone else out there who wishes to meet someone like you.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.280
When you finally find someone who gets it, you don't take them for granted

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.880
because it was hard for you to find them in the first place.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.100
Five: you can see right through people.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.980
You can detect lies and deceit miles away.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.740
You're good at reading peoples' intentions, and you don't let just anyone in,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.640
being extra careful about who you associate yourself with.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.820
People often find it uncanny that you're able to figure them out right from the get-go,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820
making you a natural psychologist.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.660
Six: people often go to you for advice.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.900
They gravitate towards you because they admire your maturity.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.040
You're often seen as a role model

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.700
Even if you don't have it all together, somehow you can take even the most chaotic situations

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.700
and find some sort of valuable lesson in them.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.400
Your introspective nature is what helps you make important revelations and reflections,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.300
leading people to respect and trust you for having clear, sound judgments.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.220
Seven: empathy is your middle name.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.640
Sensitive by nature, you are an emotional sponge, and can pick up how the people around you feel.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.680
You're always willing to lend a helping hand to someone in need,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.720
and you're naturally skilled at seeing from different perspectives.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.200
Instead of being judgmental, you're very open minded and open hearted.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840
Eight: you like your space.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.920
You value your alone time, as it helps you recharge.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.520
You find it meaningful to roam off on your own

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.180
because distance and time away from the social scene helps you connect the dots

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.700
and make sense of things that can't be understood in a busy environment.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.020
Nine: you have a hard time fitting in with people your age.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.740
You often feel light years away from your peers and seek people with wiser personalities

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.880
and more life experiences to become your friends and lovers.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.460
You always feel out of place with what is currently trending in pop culture,

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.560
which can easily cause others to categorize you as a non-conformist or an oddball.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.480
But you're willing to be misunderstood if it means keeping some of the genius you have tucked away.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.220
You want to keep growing at your own, unique pace.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.740
Instead of hanging out with a group of people who make you feel even more alone,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.700
you find the special few who encourage and nurture you to be the authentic old soul you are.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.660
Ten: and yet, despite feeling out of place, no one gives you as much clarity as yourself.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.860
Knowledge is power, and you cherish every ounce of knowing who you are.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.620
Even if it's in disagreement with your generation.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.360
At one point, you realize that you're not obligated to explain yourself.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.500
You just are.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.400
And no matter how lonely the path may seem at first glance,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.700
you ultimately realize the way you function plays an important role in this world.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.960
Old souls have their own special niche.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.680
So may you always have the courage to embrace it.
