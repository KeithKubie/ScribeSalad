simulation<00:04:13.310><c> so</c><00:04:13.700><c> we</c><00:04:13.820><c> did</c><00:04:13.970><c> it</c><00:04:14.090><c> as</c><00:04:14.210><c> I</c><00:04:14.300><c> said</c><00:04:14.510><c> 380</c>

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 align:start position:0%
simulation so we did it as I said 380
 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.610 align:start position:0%
simulation so we did it as I said 380
games<00:04:15.680><c> over</c><00:04:15.950><c> a</c><00:04:15.980><c> season</c><00:04:16.430><c> a</c><00:04:16.720><c> million</c><00:04:17.720><c> seasons</c><00:04:18.200><c> it</c>

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 align:start position:0%
games over a season a million seasons it
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.020 align:start position:0%
games over a season a million seasons it
is<00:04:18.739><c> quite</c><00:04:18.890><c> quick</c><00:04:19.070><c> I</c><00:04:19.220><c> mean</c><00:04:19.250><c> I'm</c><00:04:19.670><c> not</c><00:04:19.820><c> going</c><00:04:19.940><c> to</c>

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 align:start position:0%
is quite quick I mean I'm not going to
 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.580 align:start position:0%
is quite quick I mean I'm not going to
take<00:04:20.150><c> the</c><00:04:20.239><c> credit</c><00:04:20.420><c> for</c><00:04:20.570><c> this</c><00:04:20.750><c> I'm</c><00:04:21.230><c> sure</c><00:04:21.380><c> if</c><00:04:21.500><c> I</c>

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
take the credit for this I'm sure if I
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.050 align:start position:0%
take the credit for this I'm sure if I
wrote<00:04:21.799><c> a</c><00:04:21.830><c> bit</c><00:04:22.010><c> code</c><00:04:22.220><c> that</c><00:04:22.400><c> tried</c><00:04:22.580><c> to</c><00:04:22.610><c> do</c><00:04:22.910><c> this</c>

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 align:start position:0%
wrote a bit code that tried to do this
 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
wrote a bit code that tried to do this
it<00:04:23.180><c> would</c><00:04:23.240><c> take</c><00:04:23.540><c> forever</c><00:04:24.080><c> but</c><00:04:24.590><c> my</c><00:04:24.860><c> friend</c><00:04:25.130><c> Adam</c>

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
it would take forever but my friend Adam
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
it would take forever but my friend Adam
is<00:04:25.520><c> much</c><00:04:25.670><c> better</c><00:04:25.910><c> at</c><00:04:26.030><c> that</c><00:04:26.060><c> sort</c><00:04:26.300><c> of</c><00:04:26.390><c> thing</c>

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 align:start position:0%
is much better at that sort of thing
 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.850 align:start position:0%
is much better at that sort of thing

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 align:start position:0%
were really able to go out some fun
 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
were really able to go out some fun

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
place was eighty five point two so
 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
place was eighty five point two so
basically<00:04:46.940><c> that's</c><00:04:47.120><c> telling</c><00:04:47.510><c> us</c><00:04:47.630><c> that</c><00:04:47.780><c> you</c><00:04:47.960><c> if</c>

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 align:start position:0%
basically that's telling us that you if
 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.890 align:start position:0%
basically that's telling us that you if
you<00:04:48.290><c> get</c><00:04:48.440><c> 86</c><00:04:49.250><c> points</c><00:04:49.570><c> chances</c><00:04:50.570><c> are</c><00:04:50.690><c> you</c><00:04:50.780><c> gonna</c>

that's<00:04:57.380><c> because</c><00:04:57.740><c> city</c><00:04:58.070><c> did</c><00:04:58.310><c> so</c><00:04:58.580><c> well</c><00:04:58.790><c> our</c>

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 align:start position:0%
that's because city did so well our
 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.340 align:start position:0%
that's because city did so well our

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
nil drawer is it's kind of could be kind
 

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.130 align:start position:0%
nil drawer is it's kind of could be kind

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:18.140 align:start position:0%
of a game of attrition we you know once

of a game of attrition we you know once
a<00:11:18.260><c> team</c><00:11:18.470><c> gets</c><00:11:18.740><c> sort</c><00:11:18.980><c> of</c><00:11:19.040><c> set</c><00:11:19.339><c> in</c><00:11:19.520><c> like</c><00:11:19.730><c> that</c>

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:19.970 align:start position:0%
a team gets sort of set in like that
 

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.930 align:start position:0%
a team gets sort of set in like that
then<00:11:20.210><c> that</c><00:11:20.660><c> dictates</c><00:11:21.440><c> what</c><00:11:21.650><c> happens</c><00:11:21.680><c> next</c><00:11:22.580><c> and</c>

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:22.940 align:start position:0%
then that dictates what happens next and
 

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.550 align:start position:0%
then that dictates what happens next and
the<00:11:23.480><c> model</c><00:11:23.720><c> doesn't</c><00:11:23.960><c> do</c><00:11:24.050><c> that</c><00:11:24.170><c> because</c><00:11:24.440><c> it's</c>

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
the model doesn't do that because it's
 

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
the model doesn't do that because it's
really<00:11:24.589><c> really</c><00:11:24.830><c> about</c><00:11:25.190><c> randomness</c><00:11:25.850><c> okay</c><00:11:26.630><c> so</c>

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:26.690 align:start position:0%
really really about randomness okay so
 

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.780 align:start position:0%
really really about randomness okay so
it<00:11:26.870><c> doesn't</c><00:11:27.110><c> really</c><00:11:27.470><c> capture</c><00:11:27.710><c> nil</c><00:11:28.040><c> nails</c><00:11:28.279><c> very</c>

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really capture nil nails very
 

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really capture nil nails very
well<00:11:29.029><c> so</c><00:11:29.300><c> that's</c><00:11:29.480><c> one</c><00:11:29.690><c> of</c><00:11:29.810><c> one</c><00:11:30.020><c> of</c><00:11:30.050><c> the</c>

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.290 align:start position:0%
well so that's one of one of the
 

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
well so that's one of one of the
weaknesses<00:11:30.830><c> of</c><00:11:31.070><c> it</c><00:11:31.339><c> and</c><00:11:31.640><c> actually</c><00:11:32.000><c> it's</c><00:11:32.240><c> not</c>

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.330 align:start position:0%
weaknesses of it and actually it's not
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.510 align:start position:0%
weaknesses of it and actually it's not
really<00:11:32.570><c> clear</c><00:11:32.810><c> how</c><00:11:32.930><c> you</c><00:11:32.960><c> would</c><00:11:33.230><c> fix</c><00:11:33.620><c> that's</c>

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
really clear how you would fix that's
 

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.330 align:start position:0%
really clear how you would fix that's
tricky

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:39.340 align:start position:0%
