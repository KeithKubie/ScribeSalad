MIKE DENNY: Hey, there and
welcome to another episode

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.660
of Android design in action.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.182
My name's Mike Denny.

00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:13.890
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.230
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.370
MIKE DENNY: And we also have two
special guests with us today.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.828
MARCO PAGLIA: Hi,
my name is Marco,

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:21.453
I'm an Android designer
here at Google.

00:00:21.453 --> 00:00:23.036
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Hey, I'm Abhilash.

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:24.940
I work on the Android
Design team with Marco.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.990
I also have the site
called Android Niceties,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.230
that maybe some of you use.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.992
MIKE DENNY: And we
also have in New York--

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:32.950
ROMAN NURIK: Hey, guys.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.666
Roman Nurik from
New York, as usual.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.040
NICK BUTCHER: So,
Happy New Year.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.590
Welcome to the first
episode this year.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.410
We're going to,
today, cover an update

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.700
to the Beautiful
Design Collection,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.690
which is a collection of apps
on Google Play that was updated

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.340
just after Christmas,
the end of last year.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.060
And so this is a
collection which

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.280
Google Play uses
to showcase some

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
of the most beautiful
design apps out there,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.350
and is a really, really
good source of inspiration

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.069
for looking at apps which
are doing some really, really

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.844
great work.

00:01:05.844 --> 00:01:07.510
So we'd like to take
the next 20 minutes

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.890
or so to take a look
at some of these apps,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.560
and call out some of the
individual design details which

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.160
we really enjoyed from them.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.924
And two of the apps from
the previous collection

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.590
have stayed in the
collection, so that's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.610
Pinterest and Grand
St., so we're not

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.870
going to cover those today.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.350
Feel free to go back to the
previous episode of Android

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.419
Design in Action, where
we looked at those.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.460
But we are going to take
a look at the other apps

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.432
in the collection.

00:01:30.432 --> 00:01:32.390
So without further ado,
we've got a lot of apps

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.015
to get through.

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:35.170
We're going to dive straight in.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.872
The first app that we would like
to take a look at is Timely.

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:40.830
So if you're a fan of
Android Design in Action,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.450
you've probably heard us talk
about this a couple of times,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.620
so I'm going to be very
brief with this application,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.260
but essentially it's beautiful.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.430
It really defines
a very high level

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.710
of polish and subtle
animations, that just really

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.995
showed a lot of thought
went into this application.

00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:58.620
So I think, Mike,
you talked about this

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.442
in a previous episode.

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:02.150
I think one of your
favorite interactions

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.390
is simple things like
setting a timer is

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.419
a very, very visceral and
enjoyable interaction.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.450
Things like if I want to set an
alarm, instead of controlling

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.100
knobs and levers, I just kind
of swipe out from the edge.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.880
And I can just tap up and down
to finely adjust it, and so on.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.210
Everything is kind of
a direct manipulation

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.950
kind of interaction,
which speaks

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.430
to some of the
design principles.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.110
It's much more fun to
directly control stuff,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.010
than to control these
knobs and levers.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.644
And again, it's just
polish, polish, polish.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:37.310
Anyone else have any
thoughts on Timely?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.434
MARCO PAGLIA: Another thing
about this applications

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:42.010
is that you don't
have any [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.750
All the transitions, they go
from one point to another,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.404
I think.

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:46.820
But you heard this
is my favorite,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.560
is how the number zooms
into positions and back,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.050
really, really nicely.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.170
All the things they
have, the transition

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.060
between each other,
the interaction

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.300
feels a continuous
thing rather than

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.890
broken into different screens.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.740
NICK BUTCHER: It's almost
like a game or a movie, right?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.540
In that everything
just kind of seamlessly

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.500
transitions between
things, rather than

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.479
a series of individual screens.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.270
MARCO PAGLIA: More than
a storyboard, yeah.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.720
MARCO PAGLIA: Right, exactly.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.230
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI: I think even
like when you're counting down

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.396
and you're starting a timer,
and each of the seconds

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.400
come out as you go
past them, instead

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.172
of a little finger or
dial moving past them.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:23.880
There's lots of little
touches like that,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
that are pretty amazing.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.650
MARCO PAGLIA: And we don't
have to forget the transition

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.573
across the numbers.

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:29.754
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:29.754 --> 00:03:31.670
MARCO PAGLIA: That's a
pretty cool transition.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.317
It's great that people are
playing with those things.

00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:35.150
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.480
So once again, love the app.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.410
Next up, I think, Roman, you
wanted to take a look at Circa.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.180
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, so Circa is
basically a news reader app,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.540
right.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.035
I think the company
provides its own news,

00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:51.830
or they edit their own articles.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.810
But at the heart of it,
it's a news reader app.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.740
It has just a handful of topics.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.250
It's very highly curated.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.120
So the content
itself speaks volumes

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.680
about the app and the company.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.990
They're really crafting
the content for, I guess,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.050
almost micro news consumption.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.080
So on top of the visual
awesomeness of the app,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.800
it's very simple.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.779
There's very little
Chrome in the app.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.079
It's really the content,
the images, the photos.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.580
They really stand out,
and the type as well.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.252
Beyond all of that,
there's one thing

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:25.710
that I really wanted
to talk about.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.510
And that's when you look into
or when you open an article,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.560
the way in which you interact
and consume the article

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.670
is very novel.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.280
Basically, instead of
just scrolling vertically

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.062
through a long list of
paragraphs and images

00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:41.520
and things like
that, they actually

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.190
take each point-- each
individual point of the news--

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.530
and they make that into a
single little card type-thing.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.690
It's a little object, right?

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.100
And you flick vertically.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.450
You page vertically between
these individual points.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.390
So consuming the
news is actually

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.240
very fun and very quick.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.980
You can flick through to
see what's interesting.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.310
If there's a map or a
photo, it kind of takes up

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.830
the majority of the space
in that little point,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.930
in that little card.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.100
And it's really consuming
news at your own pace,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.060
I just really love
the interaction.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.930
Also there's a little
scrubber at the right.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.055
You can scrub along the right
side of that scroll bar thing.

00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:28.000
And you can quickly flip through
the different news sections.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.269
So those are my
favorite aspects.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.060
You guys have any other
points about Circa?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.810
MIKE DENNY: Just to
follow up on the point

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.940
that you just made about the
digestible scrolling format,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.350
I've actually been staying
up-to-date more on the news

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.010
by using Circa thank looking
at news from other sources,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.580
just because it definitely
caters to the skimming

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.750
kind of reading where it's
just tiny chunks at a time.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.500
So it's great when
an app actually

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.075
changes your day-to-day
where you're more informed.

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:00.950
MIKE DENNY: I also quite
like the information

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.780
density they use
on the home screen.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.540
They're unashamedly using
lots of space per story,

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.180
rather than trying
to cram in the most

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.940
number of stories per screen.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.400
And they also don't present
a ton of stories per day.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.200
So all in all, their
design conveys to me

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.200
that they've selected the
most important things,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.700
and these are
important things which

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.500
you should pay
attention to and read.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.930
So, like you say, it makes it
very easy to scan a day's news,

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.251
and it communicates that
to me for their design.

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:30.000
MARCO PAGLIA: Yes.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.730
One more aspect that
I'd like to have people

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.880
look at, which is typography.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.386
So it starts from the
Circa logo itself,

00:06:37.386 --> 00:06:38.760
which is just a
typographic logo.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.030
It was also interesting
how, in the main view,

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.090
you see the whole logo.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.200
But when you get into
different sources,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.320
they use it differently,
which is really Interesting.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.520
Then obviously you will
recognize this is not

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.200
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.337
And I think applications
that can play with phones

00:06:53.337 --> 00:06:54.920
and have different
types of typography

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.460
will enrich our platform.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.260
Now obviously
[INAUDIBLE], but it's

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.060
good to see other
phones out there.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.550
It's also interesting how they
use words together with icons,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.890
as we do in our platform,
in the action bar.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.950
But even there, they use
a different typography,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.680
which makes this application
feel very distinct.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.980
MIKE DENNY: Yeah,
so we love Circa.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.540
And I think the next app we
want to talk about is Airbnb.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.550
So Airbnb obviously is an
app for the-- it's not really

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.974
couch surfing.

00:07:32.974 --> 00:07:35.390
The best way to explain it,
if you don't know about Airbnb

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:41.020
already, it's finding traveling
rental, people renting out

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.400
properties that they
have for smaller chunks,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.950
as competition to other forms
of travel housing like hotels.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.420
So the thing that
stands out immediately

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.150
to me about the Airbnb
app is the use of photos.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.580
And that they're really
utilizing the visual style

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.570
of Android, which is to
show full-bleed photos,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.130
so the Chrome kind
of fades away.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.360
It's just about the spaces.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.990
And here we can just tap into a
little bit more detailed view.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.970
But even if you want
to just scroll through,

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:20.154
they have this horizontal
paging within a given property,

00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:22.070
so that you don't have
to leave the full list.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.690
This really, really allows for
a simple browsing experience

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.901
to find a place that
you want to stay.

00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:30.400
MARCO PAGLIA: And
this really speaks

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.740
about the philosophy
of Airbnb itself,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.990
which is a company that
had invested tremendously

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.120
in design, in particular
had been sending

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.370
professional photographers
to people who were renting

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.620
their places, in order to
make that experience better,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.050
because everything starts from
looking at the photos where

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.320
you're going to be staying.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.300
And the app really
reflects their philosophy

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.360
by focusing so much on photos,
and even just little things

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.300
like this little snappy way to
go through photos real quickly.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.140
And obviously it carries
through in the full-screen view.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.400
It's super important.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.022
You don't know how
important it is,

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:08.230
moving towards that kind of
interaction versus having

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.632
a typical, maybe, obsolete
gallery where you have to keep

00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:14.090
on going back and forth within
the photos that are provided

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.590
to you.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.955
That makes the whole difference.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.330
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Yeah, I think

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.830
the other thing for me, as
someone that's used Airbnb

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.735
quite a lot, is how functional
in feature this app is.

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:26.110
I thought you could just browse
listings, make a booking.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.070
But you can create a listing so
easily, it kind of makes sense.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.260
You have your mobile device.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.593
You choose your number of rooms.

00:09:32.593 --> 00:09:33.540
You take photos.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.760
It does it really nicely.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.037
So I feel like there's
a lot of screens

00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:39.120
that they put a lot of
effort into designing well.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.477
So that's the other thing
that stood out for me.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:43.060
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah,
even the dialogues

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.390
with renters and
the chat system,

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.270
it feels almost
like it could have

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.699
been an application in itself by
how beautifully it's designed,

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:52.240
and by the level of
details they had,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.070
like the profiles of the house.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.120
Everything is very,
very well curated.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.874
You feel welcome in
their application.

00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:01.540
NICK BUTCHER: So
moving on, the next app

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.290
that we would like to
cover is a heart rate

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.160
monitor from Runtastic.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.940
And so this is an excellent
example of what we're always

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.700
talking about on Android
Design in Action,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.820
is to take the holo
design language

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.320
and use that as
your starting point,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.650
and really bring
your own personality

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.527
and your own branding
to the equation.

00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:23.860
So I think they've done an
excellent job of interpreting

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.000
the raw holo design language and
doing that-- so simple things

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.650
like the way they've
recolored a bunch of elements,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.030
and the use of the
typographic styles

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.880
we commonly use, like the
block capitals, when to use,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.090
and robust or light
or larger-set text

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.170
to bring emphasis
to certain elements.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.806
I think they've done a really,
really nice job of doing that.

00:10:44.806 --> 00:10:46.430
The one screen I
would like to call out

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.730
as being extremely
beautifully is the hero screen

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.660
of application, which
is when you're actually

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.280
using the application to
measure your heart beat.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.595
So if you haven't used the app,
it's pretty innovative really.

00:10:56.595 --> 00:11:00.690
It actually fires up your
camera and the flashlight

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.960
on the back of your phone,
and actually shines the light

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.800
through your finger and
measures the difference in color

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.070
to actually measure
the heart rate, which

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.160
is pretty innovative.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.930
But if we look at it now,
when it's doing that,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.570
it uses this
beautiful blur effect

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.500
to indicate when it's
picked up your heart beat.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.110
And you have this live graph
going along the bottom, which

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.950
will show you you're going
to get an instant response.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.950
It's doing something
that's trying to find it.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.741
And it's just a really,
really beautifully,

00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:32.900
well-designed experience to
communicate what it's doing,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.331
which is pretty novel.

00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:34.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.050
So that was Heart Rate Pro.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.952
Does anyone have
anything to add?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.660
MARCO PAGLIA: Just a
little simple thing.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.610
Even the dialogues
are personalized.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.970
They have a strong web
collar on top of dialogues.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.240
I think they use all caps.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.250
They use the font,
with a different size--

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.992
different from the very
typical out-of-the-box dialogue

00:11:59.992 --> 00:12:00.950
framework that we have.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.158
And I think it's something
that we invited developers

00:12:03.158 --> 00:12:06.510
to play with, as long as the
interaction would be the same.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.900
It feels novel, but it
doesn't feel completely

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.817
different from everything
within our platform.

00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:14.108
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, it feels
completely native Android,

00:12:14.108 --> 00:12:16.276
but it feels completely
Runtastic at the same time,

00:12:16.276 --> 00:12:16.775
right?

00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:18.170
It's that good marriage of both.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.830
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, definitely.

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.740
So the net app that
we want to talk about

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.120
is called The Whole Pantry.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.960
And we've already talked
about the importance

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.230
of high-quality photos
and photography,

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.960
and the impact that
can make on your app,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.620
obviously depending
on the kind of app.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.670
But for The Whole Pantry,
they use beautiful photos

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.980
to really sell the entire
purpose of their app, which

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.650
is to present a very holistic
approach to nutrition,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.650
lifestyle.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.550
They've got recipes.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.200
They have health guides.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.800
They have recommended
products and services.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.090
We can drill in here and
look at macadamia and caramel

00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.990
cheesecake.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.180
The photos are very
high resolution.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.580
I think the app itself is
a 75-megabyte download.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.700
So it's definitely
in the forefront

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.440
of the app presentation.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.070
MARCO PAGLIA: And I
can't stress enough

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.560
how important having the
right resolution for assets

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.450
and for photos is.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:23.080
I think The Whole Pantry, on a
tablet like [INAUDIBLE], really

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.940
defines a beautiful experience,
because the photos are so much

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.900
high res, and unfortunately
something we don't see enough

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.775
out there, because
they're expensive,

00:13:31.775 --> 00:13:32.650
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.300
But when you see it, you
know that it is important.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.840
So I'm actually very
much looking forward

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.350
to seeing bandwidth
getting faster, and seeing

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.690
more and more high-resolution
photos in a large-form factor,

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.500
because it defines
the experience

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.650
in a whole new light.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.240
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Yeah, I've tried

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.615
a few of these recipe apps--
not that I cook or anything.

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:55.190
But they've put a lot of
effort into curating it,

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.960
and they've slowly released
updates to recipes.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.890
So you can see with
the recipes they

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.200
have, there's nothing
that looks broken.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.690
Every photo is amazing.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.330
The ingredients,
the instructions--

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.330
they're all nicely done.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.700
So it doesn't rely on
trying to render something

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.280
from a junky website.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.372
They've tried to keep
it within the app.

00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:15.830
NICK BUTCHER:
Especially food porn.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.079
It's just like
everything looks amazing

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:20.120
MARCO PAGLIA: Anything
here like we saw in Circa,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.390
I'd like to make people pay
attention to the different font

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.810
style in the action bar.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.470
Which really, those
small differences

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.920
will make your application
different from the rest.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.030
And Circa had different fonts.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:42.040
Whole Pantry has this
italic serif-type of font.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.910
It really makes the
application stand out

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.190
with a very simple change.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.545
You don't have to do
a custom action bar

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:50.824
or go crazy with things.

00:14:50.824 --> 00:14:53.240
You just need to curate your
application with a very small

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.990
difference, and it really
stands out from the crowd.

00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:00.410
MIKE DENNY: Yes, so the next
app we want to talk about

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.260
is Tumblr.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.550
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, so the
thing about Tumblr-- Tumblr

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.640
in itself, I think everybody
knows what Tumblr is.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.460
It's kind of a micro-blogging
platform, I guess.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.150
The thing I want to focus on
for Tumblr, the app itself,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.260
is not so much see the actual
experience of using Tumblr,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.040
but it's the onboarding-- the
first time you run the app.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.790
And we had a whole episode
of Android Design in Action

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.110
just on this, because
it's so very important.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.857
When you get featured
on Google Play,

00:15:29.857 --> 00:15:32.190
or when you're in a collection
like the Beautiful Design

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.360
Collection, a lot of people are
just discovering your brand.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.500
And they're coming to
your app, and just kind

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.160
of getting a feel
for what it is.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.850
So you don't want to throw up
a login now or register now

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.434
type dialogue.

00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:45.308
You want to give them
a taste of what they're

00:15:45.308 --> 00:15:47.330
going to get when they
sign up, if they sign up.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.630
And so Tumblr does
this brilliantly.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.130
They go above and beyond.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:57.160
You can obviously view public
Tumblr content in the app,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.810
I guess in the explorer tab.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.000
But you can even
start following.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.070
You can even start
personalizing the app

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.410
before you even have an account.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:08.980
Obviously once you follow
more than ten Tumblr blogs,

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.150
they'll say hey,
you probably should

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.710
start saving this
somewhere, because this

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.790
is just kind of stored locally.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.340
And as soon as you, I
guess, sign in or sign up,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.490
they actually add
that to your account.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.690
So it's just done
very brilliantly.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.340
Besides that, obviously
the UI's very clean.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.400
Again, the content stands out.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.630
The Chrome is
almost transparent.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.180
It's there.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.237
There are the icons
there and the text,

00:16:36.237 --> 00:16:38.070
but it's really the
content that stands out.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.110
But to me, the number
one thing in this app

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.714
is the amazing
onboarding experience.

00:16:42.714 --> 00:16:44.380
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Yeah, I mean there's

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.920
a few little nice animations.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.360
Like when you follow
something for the first time

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.780
in the explorer tab, and it
flies into your home tab,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.380
it's just a nice
little indication.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.976
The pull-to-refresh, even like
how the radio menu comes out--

00:16:55.976 --> 00:16:57.600
yeah, there's quite
a few nice touches.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.750
NICK BUTCHER: OK,
so the next app

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.160
that we would like to
talk about is Umano.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.609
So Umano is a news
consumption application,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:11.450
but it's kind of different to
Circa and other standard ones

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.579
in that it's all
orientated around listening

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.220
to the news, having the news
read out to you, spoken to you.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.670
And so one of the
things I very much like

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.010
about this application
is they have

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.230
quite a complex
information hierarchy,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.200
but it's expressed
very, very clearly,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.700
using some very familiar
Android patterns.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.240
So they used the drawer for
the major organizational tasks,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.230
as it were.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.320
But they also have this partial
width and swipeable tabs,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.430
to allow you to filter
down by categories

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.485
and really find the
content you're looking for.

00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:44.110
Another interaction
which I really like

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.450
is they've learned from
the best, as it were,

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.440
and they've done a very similar
implementation to Google Play

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.240
Music, to allow you to see
what you're currently listening

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.570
to you while navigating around,
to find the next story you

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.710
might want to listen to.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.835
So here at the bottom, I
have a Now Playing drawer.

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:02.230
And I can drag it up
or just tap on it,

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.460
and quickly get back to
the current story which

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.190
is now playing, so I can quickly
go in and rewind a minute,

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.350
or add it to a favorite
playlist or something like that.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.400
And it works very nicely.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.830
You can see as you drag up,
it just kind of replaces

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.650
the content behind it and acts
similar to the action bar.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.066
MARCO PAGLIA: It's beautiful
how the action bar moves away

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:23.610
together, with a sort of
parallax effect, as the view is

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.110
coming up.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.472
It's a very , very nice detail.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.680
MIKE DENNY: And one of the
main use cases of this app

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.490
is to listen to the news
during your commute, right?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.000
So they've actually added
something particular for use

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.249
in the car.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.915
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Do you want to talk?

00:18:38.915 --> 00:18:39.630
MARCO PAGLIA: No.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.140
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Basically when

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.400
you're listening to something,
when it starts playing you

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.050
can switch into car mode
by tapping the car icon.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.990
And they've just
done a beautiful job

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.890
of presenting a UI that's
very touch-friendly when

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.110
you don't have a
lot of attention.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.610
There's a nice overlay.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.532
There's a remote control view.

00:18:57.532 --> 00:18:58.490
It's just a nice touch.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.906
NICK BUTCHER:
Easy-to-hit buttons.

00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:03.021
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI: Very easy
to hit buttons while driving.

00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:05.270
MARCO PAGLIA: They used the
new framework from KitKat,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.200
where the view goes full-screen.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.320
And how it fades in and
out is really [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.870
This is an application that
tries to make something

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.750
that we've got used to, which
is hearing things being read

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.820
out loud by our machines,
but it makes it more human,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.470
bringing human beings
back into the game.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.030
So obviously there's a
focus in design on humanity,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.600
if you wish, across the
app visually, and even

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.126
from the audio perspective.

00:19:32.126 --> 00:19:34.000
NICK BUTCHER: And the
[INAUDIBLE] developers,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.890
I know that they've
open-sourced their drag-up panel

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.290
implementation as well.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.870
So if you have a similar
kind of interaction,

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.330
you might want to look at that.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.401
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:46.150
So the next app that
we want to talk about

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.750
is perhaps slightly
controversial.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.080
I know that when the
app was first released

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.060
there was a flurry of discussion
about it, and that is Yahoo!

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.824
Weather.

00:19:56.824 --> 00:19:59.240
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, so I want
to spend a little bit of time

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.345
talking about some of
awesome details in Yahoo!

00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:01.845
Weather.

00:20:01.845 --> 00:20:04.850
Now again, all these apps
are not without their flaws,

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.350
but here we really
want to highlight

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.380
some of the best details.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.200
So Yahoo!

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.658
Weather, when you
first open it up,

00:20:10.658 --> 00:20:13.300
it just shows you, obviously,
the weather near where you are.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.050
Now front and center-- I guess
back and center-- is a photo.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.410
And this photo is actually
highly contextual.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.900
The photo is not only about
the current weather type--

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.739
whether it be sunny or
rainy-- but it's also

00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:29.030
contextual in the sense that
it shows you the location.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.200
So I think that if you're in
London and it's super sunny,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.250
it'll show you London
when it's sunny.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:40.632
But if it's rainy-- [LAUGHTER]

00:20:40.632 --> 00:20:42.965
ROMAN NURIK: But the idea's
that it's highly contextual,

00:20:42.965 --> 00:20:45.260
so it actually gets you a
pretty good feel of what

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.410
it may actually
look like outside.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.400
Now in terms of the UI itself,
if you have multiple locations

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.550
set up, you can swipe
left and right, obviously,

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.070
between your current location
and your predetermined

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.910
locations.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.380
And there's a nice parallax
effect where the background

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.030
image actually scrolls
at a slower rate,

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.990
and it kind of
transitions neatly

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.920
into the next image
for the next location.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.920
But within a specific location
as you start scrolling down,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.730
that background image
actually starts to blur.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.430
And this blurs so
that you can actually

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.780
focus on the information
that's in the foreground--

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.042
things like the forecast and
the details of the weather.

00:21:26.042 --> 00:21:28.000
And then if you scroll
down to the very bottom,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.580
this is probably my
favorite detail in this app.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.770
You get to these really
awesome animations

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.600
of wind and sunlight.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.140
And it's these really
small, little touches

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.820
that really set this app
apart from other weather apps.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.730
So I really like a lot of these
different touches in there.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.270
Those are my favorite elements.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.860
NICK BUTCHER: One of
my favorite things

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.730
as well is as you're
scrolling down

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.000
to see some of the more
detailed information,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.430
I love that it synchronizes
the scroll position.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.320
So that if you
swipe horizontally,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.570
you can easily
compare two locations.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.600
So if you're trying to decide on
you want to go to either City X

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.800
or Y this weekend,
you can scroll down

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.810
to the long-range forecast
and easily pan between them

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.452
and have these comparisons.

00:22:11.452 --> 00:22:13.660
Little details like that
just show how much thought's

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.770
gone into that.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.228
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah,
it really shows

00:22:16.228 --> 00:22:19.430
how design follows
functions after all.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.930
And all these details
we're seeing ,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.000
they're not just to make the
application more beautiful,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.290
but even more functional.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.890
And they create a story
that is understandable.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.190
To those details that
Roman was talking about,

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.060
that information at the bottom,
also when you pull it down,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.310
you have this pull-to-refresh.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.430
They have this little
sun spinning around.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.630
So a lot of little
playful elements

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.270
that they embed
in the application

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:45.647
that make it fun and surprising.

00:22:45.647 --> 00:22:47.730
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, so we
definitely love the Yahoo!

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.520
Weather app.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:56.256
Speaking of visual design when
compared to interaction design,

00:22:56.256 --> 00:22:57.880
the next app that we
want to talk about

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.980
is Etsy, where it's
just a gorgeous app that

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.850
screams their own brand.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.330
It very loudly has a voice.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.660
And it's interesting because
visually you might not

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.050
recognize Android
glyphs or icons.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.060
They've got a lot
of custom things.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.410
But the interaction
design, the design patterns

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.030
for navigation
throughout the app

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.250
are very consistent
with platform standards.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.280
And that means that
users will instantly

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.600
feel at home using
the app, while still

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.225
being exposed to Etsy's brand.

00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.600
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Yeah, I think

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.016
Marco mentioned
earlier dialogues.

00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:37.770
And again, Etsy, the
custom dialogues they use,

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.020
I really like.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.860
And the other thing I
liked is the purchase flow.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.169
I feel like a lot of apps, once
you get into the purchase flow,

00:23:45.169 --> 00:23:47.710
they kind of get into web views,
or they're not as well done.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.970
But these guys, again, have
paid a lot of attention

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.267
to the purchase flows through
the app, which is important.

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.850
MARCO PAGLIA: For
us it's amazing how,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:59.180
when we define certain rules
for the UI-- like the new side

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.070
drawer and things like
that-- how good developers

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.980
and good designers,
they go above and beyond

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.920
to play with that simple
rule, but to make it special.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.710
We have seen it
before on Airbnb.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.390
But if you pay attention when
you bring the side drawer in,

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.030
your view zooms back.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.720
And if you look
into Etsy instead,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.300
when you pull the drawer
in, the view fades.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.240
So there are a lot
of little effects.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.420
And again, it's what
I was saying before.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.170
Just changing the font
in your action bar,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.461
but keeping the action bar
as it is from an interaction

00:24:29.461 --> 00:24:31.060
point of view, or
changing the effects

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.285
when the drawer comes in, is
enough to really distinguish

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:36.750
your application from
the rest of the crowd.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.090
In this case, Etsy also
made their site navigation

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.800
to be very colorful.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.260
Also here to be noted
is the different font.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.500
Treatment for the side drawer,
for the action bar as well.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.357
A lot of elements that I
invite everybody to play with.

00:24:50.357 --> 00:24:52.440
NICK BUTCHER: And we're
not showing it right here,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.520
but this app is
[INAUDIBLE] responsive.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.030
So if you try it on all manner
of different size and shape

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.450
devices, they use this very
flexible staggered grid layout,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.200
which they kind of change
between different columns

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.370
and so on, just to maintain
the same aspect ratio,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.930
but to fill up the
space beautifully.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.970
So while they do maintain great
use of white space and so on,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.570
they really just fill
up available room

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.379
to make the most
on other devices.

00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:17.795
I guess it's
stretched experience.

00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:19.960
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI:
Have they open-sourced?

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.500
NICK BUTCHER:
They've open-sourced

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.050
that staggered
grid view as well.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.800
MARCO PAGLIA: If I remember
correctly, even the dialogues,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.180
they bring a nice surprise
to the experience.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.530
They don't simply pop.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.816
They don't simply fade in
the middle of the screen.

00:25:31.816 --> 00:25:33.190
They actually come
from the back,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.950
from the bottom of the screen.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.560
It just creates more of
a metaphor about where

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.970
these dialogues are coming from.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.672
And it's definitely
a nice touch.

00:25:43.672 --> 00:25:44.630
MIKE DENNY: Definitely.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.350
So this has been a look at the
Winter 2013 Beautiful Design

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.310
Collection.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.750
We hope you enjoyed watching it.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.810
And until next time,
I'm Mike Denny.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.850
NICK BUTCHER: Bye
from me, Nick Butcher.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.070
MARCO PAGLIA: Bye.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.710
This is Marco.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.920
See you next time.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.086
ABHILASH KUDUVALLI: See you.

00:26:00.086 --> 00:26:01.340
It's Abhilash.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.360
ROMAN NURIK: And see you
guys later from New York.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.910
It's Roman.
