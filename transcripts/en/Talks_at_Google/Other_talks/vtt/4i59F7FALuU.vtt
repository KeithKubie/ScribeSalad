00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:02.850
MALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.080
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.340
I hosted this talk-- I
initially was introduced

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.550
to Clarity Media when
I was interviewing.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.290
As many of you know that
the Google interview process

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.105
can be a little challenging,
especially from the outside.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.355
And it's even weirder when
you see it from the inside.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.610
So I worked with Clarity
Media to become more effective

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.700
in interviews and
learned how to prepare

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.850
to be more effective
in general in speaking.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.910
And I was able to take the
things I learned from them

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.390
and apply them to
wedding speeches I gave,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.465
to be more effective
in meetings.

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:41.090
Even one of the
wedding speeches I gave

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.700
was actually in Japanese,
and I don't speak Japanese.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.290
So there's a lot of
really incredible stuff.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.440
So hopefully it's really
useful to everyone.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.802
And a pleasure to
introduce Bill McGowan.

00:00:53.802 --> 00:00:55.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.840
BILL McGOWAN: Thank you.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.490
I had no idea we specialized
in bilingual wedding toasts.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.390
That's actually even
a surprise to me.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.230
I appreciate everybody coming.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.650
And presumably, everybody
here or watching

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.980
is here because you'd
like to be better

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.630
at public speaking or
external communication.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.620
So I want to give you
a bunch of tips today

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.370
that I think would
up everybody's game.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.490
Right off the bat,
just about every year

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.440
some kind of
publication comes out

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.110
with a list of what the
biggest fears in our life are.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.780
And every year, the list
stays pretty much the same.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.330
Our fear of our own mortality
is usually at number one,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.610
getting on a plane
is number three,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.470
and I'm sure it comes as no
surprise to everybody what

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.160
the number two fear is.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.640
Everybody knows that it's
public speaking, right?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.810
And there are a
number reasons why

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.440
this can throw us and send
us into angst before we

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.130
have to get up and present.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550
Most of the people
we work with are

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.539
on the left side
of this spectrum.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.640
They either have a
fear of doing it,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720
or they can tolerate it
if they're asked to do it.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.830
They're on a team and
it's their responsibility.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.080
But very few people actually
get a buzz from doing it.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
And what we tend to do is try
to get people from apprehension

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.270
to being OK with it.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.290
And the encouraging news is once
you get to being OK with it,

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.190
there is a way to
actually get to the point

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.180
where you enjoy it.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.890
And that's really
the sweet spot,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.780
because the more you enjoy it,
the more you'll raise your hand

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.260
and volunteer to do it.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.860
And the more you do it, the
better you'll get at it.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.390
So my key advice would be
embrace every opportunity

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.000
to get up and talk when
somebody on your team

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.170
suggests you do it.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.500
Or don't shy away from an
opportunity to public speak.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.742
It's the best way
to get better at it.

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:02.200
The one thing you
should definitely

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800
stay away from
though is winging it.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.330
And I find this
is not a strategy.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.530
Thinking that magic fairy
dust is going to sprinkle down

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.770
on you and you're going to be
eloquent and articulate and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.520
effective and persuasive in the
moment is really not realistic.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.960
And this isn't just about
giving a keynote speech

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.110
or giving a presentation.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.374
This about heading into a
meeting where you may think,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.540
I'm probably going to be a
spectator in this meeting

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.100
and I'm very likely not going
to be asked for my input.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.480
You can't assume that.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.700
You should even
go into a meeting

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.760
that you think you're going to
be a spectator at with an idea

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.770
of what am I going to say if
somebody wheels around asks me

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.410
for my opinion on this subject.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.980
Let me plan what my point of
view is and make it succinct.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.850
Sometimes we work with very
accomplished, grade A speakers.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.260
And we'll be in a
private session with them

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
and we'll be role playing,
we'll be videotaping them.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.100
And their energy level
is not that great,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.450
and I'll tell them I think
you need to bump this up.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.290
You're sort of
mailing it in here.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.270
And oftentimes what we'll hear
from a client is don't worry,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.790
when the adrenaline is going
and I'm doing the real thing,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.039
everything's going to be fine.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.519
I'll be great.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.690
And my urging to them
was about practicing

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.710
the same way you play for
real often fell on deaf ears

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.660
until the first presidential
debate of the last election

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.370
cycle.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.110
And if anybody has read
the dissection of what

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.510
happened there, the present
went out to Las Vegas

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.310
and he set up debate camp.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.990
And he was handed
videotapes of Mitt Romney

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.752
and his primary
debates, and he was

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:54.960
asked to take a look at them.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.834
Next thing you know, he
was off at Hoover Dam

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.900
shaking hands and
doing some photo ops

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.180
and he's just not engaged.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.434
And David Axelrod, his chief
adviser, came up to him

00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:07.600
and he said Mr. President,
we're a little concerned.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.210
You don't seem plugged in.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.940
You don't seem like
you're investing the time.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.730
And the president's
response to Axelrod

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.440
was very much what
I hear from people

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.510
who realize that they have a
tremendous aptitude for this.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.760
So my point is if that guy
can't magically flip a switch

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.640
and be great because he
has short changed the prep,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.350
there's actually very little
hope for the rest of us.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.420
Same thing with Bill Clinton.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.505
Somebody very close to
him said best communicator

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.820
I've ever known, I've
ever worked with,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.350
when he was prepared.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.720
But when he wasn't and all
hell was breaking loose

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.600
and we were crashing in the limo
on the way over to an event,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.990
it always showed up.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.860
So don't think that
there is an elite crew

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.350
of gifted communicators
who can just

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.180
mail it in and be
spontaneous and great.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.542
It actually doesn't happen.

00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:05.540
And when you're rehearsing,
when you're practicing a speech

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.460
or presentation-- which you
absolutely should do-- the four

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.990
words you should never say is
let's just start this again.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.730
When you make a mistake in
rehearsal, don't give up.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.970
The important thing
is to teach yourself

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.590
how you pull out of a moment
where you're having brain lock

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.150
or you've lost your transition,
or something's gone wrong.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.530
If you don't practice
that in rehearsal,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.130
you'll never know how
to do it when you get up

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.710
and give the speech for real.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.920
It would be almost like
a pilot in training

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.400
going into a flight
simulator and then

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.110
just giving totally
normal conditions,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.210
never making them fly
through turbulence

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.600
or learn how to navigate
the plane in trouble.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.720
So try to force yourself
through those rough patches

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.990
when you're rehearsing.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.980
How many of you here
battle with this?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.790
Feel anxious and you get a
little sick to your stomach?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.330
It is a perfectly natural
byproduct of public speaking,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.490
and it's what usually
keeps us from doing it.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.230
The very simple equation is
the more you're prepared,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.820
the less anxious
you're going to be.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.150
It happens every single time.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.420
And you're probably going to be
most nervous in the first two

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.230
minutes of a presentation.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.260
Until you get your feet under
you and you relax into it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.010
So really know that opening
backwards and forwards.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.070
And I mean the first line
of what you're going to say.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.170
Don't leave the first 15, 20
second warm up to ad libbing.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.080
Even know that.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.590
Whenever you hear
somebody at a podium who

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.600
has that little shake, that
little tremble in their voice

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.420
which is a dead giveaway
that they're nervous,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.670
those are a product of nerves.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.600
But it's also a result of
not breathing properly.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.210
And when we get really nervous,
we start mini hyperventilating.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.780
These short shallow breaths
which actually winds up

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.810
depleting our lungs
of air, and that's

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.970
what gives the
shake to our voice.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.020
So if you find your pulse
is running away with you

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.810
and you're extremely nervous,
find a nice quiet place

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.910
down the hallway
before you go on.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:27.200
Three or four deep yoga breaths,
long intake through your nose.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.920
Hold it.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.510
Long, slow, steady exhale
through your mouth.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.355
It's going to slow
your pulse, it's

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:34.980
going to replenish
your lungs with air,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.220
and it's going to bring
stability back your voice.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.010
Because you don't want
to be up at the podium

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.390
and looking like you're a wreck.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.270
But even if you don't
battle real anxiety,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.840
we all get a shot of adrenaline
when we get up to speak.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.540
And that can have a good result
and it can have a bad result.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.370
You're probably going to talk
a lot faster in the first five

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.479
minutes from just
being a little anxious.

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.020
So make sure you
come out of the gate

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.440
in a nice, controlled pace.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.940
Your eye movement is going to
accelerate the more nervous

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.440
you are.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.440
So right now, I'm communicating
directly with you.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.740
And I'm going to
move off and connect

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.530
with somebody else in the room.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.686
That is ultimately
what you're after.

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:22.060
What you don't
want to do is what

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.643
I'm doing right now,
which is actually

00:09:23.643 --> 00:09:26.020
ping ponging around
the room and not

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.430
landing on anybody specific.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.940
I'm looking at all of these
heads as an abstraction,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.930
or I'm drifting over the
tops of people's heads.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.920
And it doesn't have the
same level of connection

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.440
that landing on
people actually does.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.670
And we have all this
pent up physical energy

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.280
from this shot of adrenaline.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.590
And our bodies like
to get rid of it.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.850
And our feet typically wind up
being the portal through which

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.090
we like to expunge this energy.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.750
So many times, you'll
see people in front

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.070
of a room doing what I
call the stationary march.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.140
Which is, I'm not
really moving anywhere,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.420
but I'm also not standing still.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.290
There's a lot a rocking,
there's a lot of swaying.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.630
And I see this all the time.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.320
It just gives a fidgety,
nervous appearance

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.900
to your presentation.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.170
To avoid that, you want to stand
with you weight a little bit

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.890
forward on the
balls of your feet.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.830
You should feel a little bit
of pressure in your toes.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.570
What that does is it
keeps you off your heels

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.490
where you wind up swaying
and rocking the most.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.610
The only place you
want to be leaning

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.950
is actually into the audience
to connect with them.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.210
And I'm going to show you
a clip of Reed Hastings who

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:37.990
commits this.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.670
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:00.107 --> 00:11:00.940
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.780
BILL McGOWAN: Reed's feet
actually never planted

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.090
that entire time.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.460
They were in constant
motion, and it's

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.120
only because his body
is trying to get rid

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.250
of that excess physical energy.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.180
It looks a little antsy.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.940
And you should probably
stay away from it.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.500
Good news is all
that nagging we got

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.160
as children was
absolutely right.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.440
Don't stay up until 3 o'clock
in the morning working

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.310
on a presentation you
have to do at 9 AM.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.100
You'd be better off going to
bed early, getting up at four,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.450
and finishing it.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.010
You're going to be
a lot more alert.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.910
And never do anything--
public speaking,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.700
presentation on
an empty stomach.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.040
It's been proven medically
that the synapses in your brain

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.300
do not fire as
efficiently if you

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.440
don't have fuel in your body.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.470
We just talked a little
bit about making sure

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.580
that you're not slumped.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.770
And if you're tall-- anybody
really tall in this room?

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.442
Don't be apologetic
about your height.

00:11:57.442 --> 00:11:59.400
There's a lot of times
I see people just trying

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.220
to compensate for their height.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.460
Totally own your height
in the front of a room.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.000
And we talked a little
bit about that connection.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.110
This is even true across
a conference table

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.930
when you're having a meeting.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.430
The fact of the matter
is we can concentrate

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.210
on what we say a lot better if
we're looking into abstraction.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.730
Looking at the
pattern in this rug

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.670
gives me a lot more
privacy to think

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.750
about what I want to say
than looking directly

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.970
into your eyes.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.100
It doesn't have the same
level of connection.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.690
And if anybody saw the
piece in the New York Times

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.680
this Sunday in the
week in review,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.630
there's an amazing piece
in there about eye contact

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.570
and how incredibly
important it is

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.030
to the signals you send to
the person you're talking to.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.820
So if you find looking
at the person you're

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.110
talking to too unsettling, it
doesn't give you that privacy

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.150
to think, then move your
focus off just slightly.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.980
Like you could look at
the stem of my glasses,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.380
or you could look at
a woman's earring.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.110
Keep it in this general range.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.500
No one is going to know that
you're just slightly off.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.880
And it gives you something
small and private zone

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.460
in on that doesn't
make the invasiveness

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.910
of the other person's stare
back at you unsettling at all.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.870
And I find that
sometimes we're so

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.970
concentrating on
being technically good

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.840
and not making any
mistakes or stumbling

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.680
through a presentation
or a speech

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.840
that we wind up flattening out.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.990
Your focus really
shouldn't be getting

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.640
through the thing
technically perfect.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.080
That should not be your
definition of success.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.940
Your definition of success
is showing a real palpable

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.690
enthusiasm for the
value of the information

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.560
you're sharing
with other people.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.040
If you don't lead
by example, they're

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.800
not going to think it
matters and they're

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.470
going to start tuning you out.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.040
And there are a few things
our mothers did not tell us.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.839
If you want to avoid developing
a frog in your throat

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:03.630
where you have to
[CLEARS THROAT] every two

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.700
minutes be clearing your throat,
stay away from cheese, yogurt,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.710
milk that morning.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.900
It creates congestion
and wind up--

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.490
people smiling, absolutely true.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.450
Make sure you get to
the room ahead of time.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.520
If it's a stage where
you're presenting,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.550
you don't want to be up on that
stage in a strange environment

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.202
when you're doing it for real.

00:14:26.202 --> 00:14:28.820
Try to get in the night
before and check out

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:33.220
what the audience looks like
and have it be familiar to you.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.010
Also make sure all
of your tech is

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.280
in place-- batteries
on a clicker.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.320
My assistant back
in New York got

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.510
me the best holiday gift ever.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.170
She got me a pair of cuff-links
that actually come apart

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.090
and it's a USB drive.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.190
And believe it or
not, I actually

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.540
download my presentations
on this cuff-link.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.990
Because I've had a couple of
occasions where the file got

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.190
corrupted that I emailed
to the place ahead of time,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.110
and I've had to pull that thing
out and actually work from it.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.190
And it just happened
this afternoon.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.940
I've coached a bunch of
people here a year or so ago,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.870
and so I have permission
to be on the Google Guest

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.340
wireless network.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.360
And I don't have
to click a thing.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.200
It just automatically kicks in.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.490
I learned the hard way
that you should always

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.740
turn your wireless off.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.110
At another presentation,
at a client

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.370
that I arrived at on
a subsequent visit,

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.720
I didn't do it.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.650
And I'm merrily clicking
along, and in the middle

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.540
of slide four or five, all
of my email notifications

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.810
from the night before
start bonging up

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.990
in the corner of the screen.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.650
Which was not exactly what
you want to have happen.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.440
So turn your wireless off.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.390
Quit all programs
that could wind up

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.470
sending you a notification
in the middle.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.520
When I say work the
room, I mean see

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.600
if you can say hello
to people beforehand.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.570
Or maybe you're at an
off-site and there's

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.360
a coffee urn and some
snacks in a separate room.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.510
See if you can get around
say hello to people.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.470
And just a series of 60,
90 second conversations.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.360
It's going to accomplish a
number of things for you.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.340
One, it's going to keep you from
huddling away and obsessively

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.730
worrying about the presentation
you're about to do.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.480
It'd be better to get
your mind off of it.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.420
You've probably done all
the prep you need to do.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.270
And in talking to people,
oftentimes they'll

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.530
tell you something
that you can work with.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.006
Or somebody tells you a
story at the coffee urn

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:41.630
and you realize, you know, that
would actually be a great thing

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.390
to insert in the presentation.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.100
A little quick
story, because it's

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.130
so interwoven with the whole
point of my presentation.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.090
That can be a great way to
give a feeling of spontaneity

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.000
to your presentation,
to actually reference it

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.170
in your speech.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.100
And it also brings the
audience up with you

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.350
a little bit closer.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.180
It also helps you understand
is this a tough crowd,

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.420
is this an easy crowd?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.040
How hard am I going to have to
work to keep their engagement?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.609
And ultimately, if I have
a conversation with you

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.829
over the coffee, I'm no
longer a stranger to you.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:24.240
And so you're going to be a
lot more likely to be invested

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.180
in listening to me closely.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.600
If you and I talked
beforehand, I

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.730
guarantee you're not going
to take your phone out.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.860
You're going to feel too
bad that somehow I'll

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.150
feel slighted.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.630
So what it also
does is it sets up

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.770
people in various
areas of the room

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.520
to bolster your confidence.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.220
And think about your room
as broken into quadrants.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.750
So I have near right, far
right, far left, near left.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.850
And what I want to do is find
four people in the room who

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.740
are good, enthusiastic listeners
who are smiling and nodding

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.620
and helping me realize,
OK, this is coming through.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.120
They're engaged.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.470
And if you get freaked out by
talking to a hundred people

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.070
or more, make this a
conversation with four people.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.197
And I guarantee you
nobody in the audience

00:18:12.197 --> 00:18:13.780
is going to know
that you're basically

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.370
talking to four people.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.940
What you don't
want to do is catch

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:23.420
the eye of the person
who now is doing that.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.180
That is going to be an
absolute confidence killer.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.240
So while you want to be
able to read the room,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.360
I often tell people
don't over read the room.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.000
You may very well find a crowd
where the faces are blank

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.160
and you're getting nothing
back from them whatsoever.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.790
Don't let that little
voice on your shoulder

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.150
convince you that this
is going terribly.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.580
Because many, many times
I've had the most checked

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.820
out looking person
in the audience

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.860
come up to me
afterwards and say,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.765
I found what you
said so fascinating.

00:18:57.765 --> 00:18:59.640
Can you tell me a little
bit more about that?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.390
And my initial
reaction was, wow,

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.640
you looked absolutely
on another planet.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.440
I cannot believe you're
the person coming up to me

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.430
afterwards and
asking me for more.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.390
So don't let those
blank faces throw you.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.260
You need to warm up.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.230
Athletes do it.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.780
Singers do it.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.370
And there's a big
fundamental difference

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.850
between silently imagining
in your head what you're

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:27.550
going to say and in your kitchen
that morning making coffee,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.240
saying the first two
minutes out loud.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.990
It's a very
different experience.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.450
And when you hear
yourself, you're

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.100
going to be better able to
edit yourself and make changes

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.960
if it doesn't feel
right that day.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.870
So I think getting
started is always

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.990
a very difficult
thing for people.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.600
How do you grip people right
from the very beginning?

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.420
One thing I want to
make sure you never do

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:00.470
is have sentences that have
inherent apology behind them.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.900
And I've heard just about
every time slot of the day,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.570
whether you're 8:30 in the
morning, 11:30 in the morning,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.520
two in the afternoon, or
4:30, apologize for the time.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.020
So listen, I know
it's really early.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:16.710
It's 8:30.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.650
Everybody's kind of
groggy from last night.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.730
But I'm just going to
very quickly walk you

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.770
through some things.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.980
That in and of itself says I
know you don't want to be here.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.670
I know you're being
made to be here.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.360
But don't worry, I won't
be belabor the point.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.270
Don't do that.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.267
Or at 4:30, don't
say, listen, I know

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.600
I'm the only thing standing
between you and the cocktail

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.610
hour.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.110
Uh-uh.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.940
That is not what you're doing.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.396
You're trying to
present an image where

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:43.270
I know you're going to
find this interesting.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.930
I know this is going
to be valuable to you.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.850
That's what you want
to be protecting.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.617
Also, I know we've been
ingrained to think, tell them

00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.950
what you're going to tell
them, tell them, and tell them

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.170
what you told them.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:00.820
It is such a dusty, outdated
method of presenting.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.660
And everybody does it.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.460
And my advice to you is don't
sound like everybody else.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.510
Because when you hit
this conformity zone

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.270
of your structure and your words
sounding like everybody else's,

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.240
that's when your
audience tunes out.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.250
Try to find a different
way of starting.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.810
We'll talk about
that in a second.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.620
And then there
are the people who

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.860
get up and do the
table of contents.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.360
All right.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.632
So I'm Bill McGowan.

00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:26.840
I'm from Clarity Media Group.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.620
I'm going to talk a little
today about public speaking.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.310
First of all, don't
ever talk about what

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.640
you're going to talk about.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.800
That's the biggest
waste of language ever.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.980
And don't say so now I want to
share with you a little story.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.780
Don't.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.360
Just go right into the story.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.580
Don't constantly play traffic
cop and flag me on what

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.700
you're about to do.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.030
If you took all of those
things out of a presentation,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.850
I guarantee you'd be two
minutes later right off the bat

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.730
without losing any content.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.300
So in the book, I take
the agenda setting starter

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.200
and I realized it was a
very apropos acronym here.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.580
Try to see if you
can avoid that.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:11.040
So my new favorite speaker is
a guy named Geoffrey Canada.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.540
I don't know if any
of you know him.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.270
He's an education expert.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.430
And I want to show
you a clip of what

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.880
I think is just an outstanding
way to start a presentation.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.650
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.780
-I'm a little nervous because
my wife, Yvonne, said to me,

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.250
she said Geoffrey, you
watch the Ted Talks?

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.290
I said, yes, honey,
I love Ted Talks.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.970
She said, you know
they're really smart,

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.802
talented-- I said,
I know, I know.

00:22:35.802 --> 00:22:41.822
She said, they don't
want the angry black man.

00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:43.530
So I said no, I'm
going to be good honey,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.405
I'm going to be good.

00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:45.850
I am.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.190
But I am angry.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.596
And the last time I looked--

00:22:51.596 --> 00:22:56.033
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:56.033 --> 00:23:01.030
So this is why I'm
excited, but I'm angry.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:06.220
This year, there are going to
be millions of our children

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.117
that we're going
to needlessly lose.

00:23:08.117 --> 00:23:08.950
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.324
BILL McGOWAN: So
the reason why I

00:23:10.324 --> 00:23:12.880
think this is the
perfect beginning--

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.070
and I realize this is probably
a more theatrical setting

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.360
than what all of us
find ourselves in.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.170
But the structure applies.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.930
And that is he's not
starting off with a joke,

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.610
some random joke that
could bomb and throw

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.190
your confidence completely.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.010
He's starting off with
a story that allows

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.030
you to feel like you have
access to a conversation he

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.490
and his wife had.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.190
And the story has
humorous elements to it.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.310
But the payoff to the story
is central to the theme

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.900
of what his overall talk is.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.470
So the punch line
is that he's angry.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.150
But the theme of
the talk is he's

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.630
disappointed and frustrated
with how little we've

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.360
moved the needle in
education in this country.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.010
So there's a point to the story.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:02.910
It's not just a random
drop-in to get a laugh.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.590
And the laugh, of course,
probably relaxes him

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.730
and helps him on his way.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:14.580
We focus a lot on just word
selection in what we do.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.650
And we believe and agree with
all the great literary minds

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.460
and geniuses
throughout time that

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.710
adhered to this
idea of simplicity.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.550
Don't over complicate something.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.090
If a $0.10 word is
perfectly good to use,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.530
don't use a $0.50 word and
make it more elaborate and more

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:37.900
wordy.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.140
Simpler is better.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:46.530
And I find that there's also a
lot of new word creation going

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.090
on.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.740
Planful, choiceful, all
this ridiculous stuff I

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.510
hear coming out
of people's mouths

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.780
that if you were to write
it on your computer,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.992
there would be a red line
underneath that word.

00:24:58.992 --> 00:25:00.950
And if there's a red line
underneath that word,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.930
that means it's not a word.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.180
You shouldn't be saying it.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:03.680
OK?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.660
If your computer rejects
it, you should too.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.120
And this stifling jargon
that just infects and invades

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.490
all the communication
that I hear going on,

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.460
the more you can jettison
that, the better.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.937
And it affects
people at all levels.

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:22.911
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.461

misunderestimated me.

BILL McGOWAN: The
English language

00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:30.362
gets butchered all over.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.390
BILL McGOWAN: And this
spot is 10 years old,

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.470
but still applicable.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.414
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:38.414 --> 00:25:39.830
-What are you guys doing?

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.390
-We're ideating.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.290
-id--what?

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.040
-Ideating.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.700
-What's that?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.136
-Coming up with new ideas.

00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:46.510
-Why don't you
just call it that?

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.562
-This is different.

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:49.270
-We need to rethink
the way we do things.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.330
-Structure.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.830
-Process.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.197
-We need to innovate.

00:25:52.197 --> 00:25:53.510
-How?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.750
-We haven't ideated that yet.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.425
-Good luck.

00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:59.260
-Thanks.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.700
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.450
BILL McGOWAN: The reason
that spot is so funny

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.270
is it's so close to the truth.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.210
It's barely an exaggeration.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.935
So I'd like you to really
look through your content

00:26:09.935 --> 00:26:13.670
and think not only can I strip
this down to make it simpler,

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.870
but how can I take some of the
stifling jargon out of the mix.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.640
And it's one of the reasons
why I want to do this book

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.410
and share some of these ideas.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.955
And I break them into
a number of principles

00:26:24.955 --> 00:26:27.310
that I think are good to follow.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.100
One of them is this
idea of brevity.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.860
And in the book, I call this
the Pasta Sauce Principle.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.070
I actually wanted to call
it the Puttanesca Principle,

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.644
but my agent worried that
not everybody cooks and not

00:26:39.644 --> 00:26:41.310
everybody would know
what Puttanesca is.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.660
Anyway, so we made it the
Pasta Sauce Principle.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.740
And the premise is very simple.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.170
When you have a pot on the stove
and you boil that thing down,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.390
and you reduce it, that thing
has more dynamic flavor.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.220
If you keep adding
more volume to it,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.820
it basically tastes
very bland and it's

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.320
thoroughly forgettable.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.690
So I'd like you to
think about talking

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.320
the way you think about cooking.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.320
See if even in an email--
like go back and read an email

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.350
and think, could I take
20% out of this thing?

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.290
Probably easily, right?

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.000
See if you can contract
just about everything.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.170
And when we speak, I
find that most people

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.650
are pretty good about getting
out of the gate of their idea

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.000
and getting to the crux of what
it is they want to talk about.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.010
But then wrapping
the whole thing up

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.140
and getting to the finish
line gets sometimes

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.200
to be a little bit of a
messy journey in which we're

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.510
a lot less strategic,
a lot less planned,

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.520
there's a lot more ad libbing
and spontaneity involved.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.100
And that's usually
where we wind up

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.700
just having excessive
length to the idea

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.390
we're trying to communicate.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.760
And usually bad
things happen when

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.210
we're off the trail
and unplanned.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.510
In fact, if you look at any of
the analyses of big PR blunders

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.220
by notable people,
you'll find that where

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.720
they made the mistake
was right about there.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.640
Right before they finished
up when they were not

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.190
going according to what
they had planned to say.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.277
So rather than thinking,
all right, well,

00:28:22.277 --> 00:28:23.860
my answer to this
question should only

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.630
be 35 seconds or 40
seconds-- I don't

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.620
want you to think
in terms of time,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.650
because everybody's a
little bit different.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.530
But here's the
principal I'd like

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.390
you to see if you could follow.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.810
By the time you open your
mouth to start talking,

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.130
I'd like you have a
general idea of what

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.230
the full arc of your thought is.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.020
I'd like you have
a general sense

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.870
of what the finish
line looks like.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.980
And I don't mean in terms of
a verbatim scripted answer

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.630
that you're now just reciting.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.040
But I do think knowing
the components of what

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.210
goes into your
thought are important.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.830
What's my point and how am I
going to illustrate that point?

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.010
How am I going to bring
it to life for people?

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.450
And that illustration can have
a number of different styles

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.060
to it.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.700
It could be storytelling.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.690
You could be citing
a specific example.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.300
Or maybe there's
a compelling piece

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.620
of data that also
serves as a supporting

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.250
point to your main point.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.920
And I find especially
in technology,

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.740
what I'm often working
with with clients

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.850
is you've just built something.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.320
It solves a basic
problem for people.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.100
And you're launching it.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.200
I have to put out a
compelling narrative

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.930
as to why you should
download this thing.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.680
So coming up with even
a hypothetical example

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.730
of how you'd use it and how
it would solve a basic problem

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:47.380
is an important thing to
think through ahead of time.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.170
I find most people plan what
their point is and they leave

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.540
the illustration part of
their answer way too much,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.900
they're just trying to
pull it out of thin air.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.160
That should be as
well planned and well

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.580
thought out as your major point.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.020
And if you can't
see the finish line

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.890
by the time you
start talking, that's

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.150
a clue you're talking too long.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.200
See if you can get in the
habit of having control

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.090
over where you're ending
up with this idea.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:22.060
Another principal in
the book is this notion

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.660
of thinking of
yourself as a movie

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.150
director in the front of a room.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.020
And the fact of the
matter is all of us

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.570
are very visual creatures.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.860
We all have this movie reel
spinning through our heads.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.800
We crave images and we
play off them mentally.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.290
And I in the front
of the room, I

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:48.070
need to be dictating what images
are spooling through your mind.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.150
Because if I don't
do that, I don't

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.641
try to influence the
visual side of your brain,

00:30:53.641 --> 00:30:55.890
your brain is going to go
off and make its own images.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.570
And that's what's
called distraction.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.140
That's daydreaming.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.410
That's actually going to be
resulting in disengagement.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.010
So see if you can maximize
the amount of time you speak

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:14.780
visually, anecdotally, and
limit the amount of time you're

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.890
speaking in a very
theoretical and abstract way.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.130
You want a certain
balance there.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.740
And the fact is that if we
embed information and facts

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.600
within a story,
it winds up being

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.270
22 times more likely to be
recalled and acted upon.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:40.240
And also, images are
so much more memorable

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.510
than just facts or words.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.660
So this notion of
story telling-- I

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.450
know we've heard it a
lot-- has been proven time

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.200
and again as being such
an important component

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.240
of your communication.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.730
So what I would
really recommend is--

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.350
I'm sure you all have
these books you write in.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.710
Realize that on a
daily or weekly basis,

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.150
things are happening to
us at work, when we're out

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.460
talking to maybe just
people who use the platform.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.030
They say things or do things
that you realize, wow, actually

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.510
that would be a
great little story

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.660
to tell the next time I
have to present on this.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.880
Jot it down.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.750
Because I guarantee you if
you don't write it down,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.090
you're going to forget it.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:22.317
And the night before a
presentation is not the time

00:32:22.317 --> 00:32:24.400
to be thinking, OK, do I
have any stories to tell?

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.130
Damn, what's been
going on lately?

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.900
You do not want to
be in that situation.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.510
So start amassing these stories.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.775
How many of you deal with
just filler language?

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.040
Yeah.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.910
It's something we
all struggle with.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.290
I have my own little
filler language

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.990
issue that I'm always
constantly thinking about,

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.570
I'm trying to work on.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:57.020
And to get over this idea
of relying on filler,

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.440
I'd like you to
accept for a moment

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.450
this notion that your
brain and your mouth

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:02.940
are two cars on the road.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.590
OK.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.880
And your brain is the lead car.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.470
It's always about a millisecond
ahead of your mouth.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.050
It's figuring out
what conversational

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.980
road you're going to go
down and what words you're

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.500
going to use to
articulate that thought.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.430
And then your
mouth follows along

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.200
once it gets instructions.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.480
And we'd like to think that
when your brain comes up

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.030
to that intersection, it
makes those decisions very

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.390
efficiently.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.630
But that's not the case.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.550
Sometimes we get to the
juncture and we start pondering,

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.790
what word should I use?

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.880
Or maybe I shouldn't
tell this story.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.340
And it creates this delay
in which your mouth now

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.230
needs to wait.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.630
And while your mouth
is waiting, that's

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.690
typically where filler happens.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.170
Filler language is what happens
when your mouth is waiting

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.750
for your brain to
come up with a plan.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.090
So let's accept the fact
that we're not always

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.200
going to make these
decisions efficiently.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.700
I want you to embrace this
principle that the less certain

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.920
you are about the
next idea coming out

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.820
of your mouth or the next
word you're going to use,

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.260
the slower you
should be talking.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.560
What you should be doing
is building the equivalent

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.570
of a safe car length
distance between your mouth

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.389
and your brain.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.550
The less certain you are,
the slower you should talk.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:25.889
You should be building
in more pausing as well.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:28.730
So many of us feel
uncomfortable with silence,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.099
and that's why we go to
fill it with like, kind of,

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:34.469
sort of, you know, whatever.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.310
It's the language
that absolutely

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.460
saps the appearance
of our professionalism

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.050
and our gravitas.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.409
We don't want that
stuff creeping in.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.659
Sort of and kind of is
a big one right now.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:51.340
And I find that when especially
in tech companies where

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:55.270
you want to have a certain
humility to what you do,

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.200
we use those words
a lot because it

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.540
makes us sound less arrogant,
less opinionated, less certain.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.550
And I just would advise
you not to overuse them.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.560
Because I think it really
waters down your conviction

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.190
substantially.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.770
OK.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:16.060
So I like to typically end with
something everybody finds fun.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.970
We didn't talk about
body language that much.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.200
We talked a little
bit about standing,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.740
but-- anybody want to take
a crack on the seven places

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.592
you shouldn't have
your hands when

00:35:23.592 --> 00:35:25.050
you're standing in
front of a room?

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:25.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:26.520
Come on.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.780
Let's go.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.530
Who's got an idea?

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.030
Yeah?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.470
AUDIENCE: Pockets.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.386
BILL McGOWAN: Pockets.

00:35:30.386 --> 00:35:31.800
Very good.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.695
Next?

00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:33.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.390
BILL McGOWAN: Very good.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.890
OK.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.620
So this is a good one.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.460
Our saying is when your hands
drift above shoulder level,

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.037
nothing good is happening.

00:35:41.037 --> 00:35:43.370
And that means that you're
either playing with your hair

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.990
to get it out of your eyes--
I had a guy the other day,

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.140
every 15 seconds
pulled his nose.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.520
And he has no idea
he's doing this, right?

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.060
But there it goes,
every 15, 20 seconds.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.990
Or you're scratching your ear or
you're playing with your beard.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.340
No hands above shoulder level.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:57.840
OK?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.471
So pockets, shoulder level,
not behind your back.

00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:01.970
Right?

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:03.350
Way too apologetic.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.890
This has an I
totally don't deserve

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:08.860
to be up in front of
you, but I'm here anyway.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.808
Anybody else?

00:36:10.808 --> 00:36:11.919
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:12.710
BILL McGOWAN: Good.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.420
Very good.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.810
Totally cuts the
audience off from you.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.490
You're not nearly as accessible
to them as you should be.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.580
So folded across the chest.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.667
Not on your hips.

00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:25.500
Not in your pockets.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.610
We had that one.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.050
This is the fig leaf, right?

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.630
It's too low.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.590
This is praying.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.910
That's too high.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.040
So that's not in the mix either.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.160
One of them is a little
counter intuitive,

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.520
and that is just dangling here.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.310
I've never seen anybody
look comfortable

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.590
standing in front
of a room like this.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.810
In fact, the weight of your
arms gives a little droop

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:49.550
your shoulders.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.910
And you can look very slumpy.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:57.080
So what I'd like you to do
is move from this position

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.980
and just create a right
angle with your upper arm

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.150
and your forearm.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.450
And your hand should
come together right

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:04.620
around your belt buckle.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.270
OK?

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.820
Not like you're ready
to kill somebody

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.810
with a very rigid
clasp, and nothing

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.930
shaped that's really obvious.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.000
I just want your
hands very loosely

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.450
and relaxed overlapped right
around your belt buckle.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.350
And the reason I
like this position

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.080
is I want to talk
with my hands, but I

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.420
don't want it to be a big
choreographed gesture that

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.380
winds up being the
center of attention.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.690
I want it to be very
organic and natural.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.500
So from here, they have
a very short distance

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.590
to kind of get in
the action-- See?

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.720
Kind of get in the action.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.160
Not good.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.780
They have a very
short distance to get

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.800
into the action and a very
short distance to rest.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.349
Whereas down here when I go to
use them and I want to stop,

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:47.640
they've got a long way to fall.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.799
In fact, a guy the other
day I was working with,

00:37:49.799 --> 00:37:51.340
he went to stop and
his arms actually

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.210
swung from the
downward momentum.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.440
So it may feel a little odd at
first, but it absolutely works.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.510
And if you're giving
a presentation,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.750
this can anchor your hands
in the right position.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:08.020
Just hold onto your
clicker with two hands.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.975
In terms of gesticulation,
don't over think it.

00:38:10.975 --> 00:38:13.130
The only things you
want to stay away from

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.230
are repetitive
motions where I'm sort

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.250
of doing the same
thing all the time,

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.180
and now this starts
to get really

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.200
distracting and annoying.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.680
And you see politicians do that.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.950
They do the air
punch all the time.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.360
And I wind up stopping
listening to what they're saying

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.160
and I start timing the
intervals of-- and I realize,

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.610
OK, I'm not listening
to this guy anymore.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:38.260
Or anything really manic where
I'm just in constant motion

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.710
and I'm not stopping, and
the hands are never resting.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.690
Realize that your hands have the
ability to bold and underline

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.409
an important thing
you want to say.

00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:49.200
If they're moving all
the time, then you're

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.410
punching everything
and nothing stands out.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.780
So realize if I'm
giving a presentation

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.200
and I'm coming up
to a big idea, there

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.130
are a number things I can do to
put that big idea on a pedestal

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.660
and have it be more noticed.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.290
One is I can use my hands.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.360
But I also want to
manipulate my voice

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.010
to change up the sound of how
it's coming at the audience.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.160
Two good ways to do that are
to slow down and pull back.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.660
You don't actually want to
punch your big idea louder.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.800
See if you can pull
back on your volume

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.770
and keep up your intensity
to make the audience come in

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.737
and listen to you a
little bit more closely.

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:26.320
It's a really effective
tool, and it's

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.750
a little bit counter-intuitive.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:32.170
I usually see people hammer that
thing like harder and louder.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:36.190
That's not always
the best way to go.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.970
So I'm more than
happy to address

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:44.210
any questions anybody may have.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.690
I often say to
people too, if you're

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.090
going to take questions
after a presentation,

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:56.260
it always good to come with what
I call your own first question.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.810
And that's because the most
awkward part of a presentation

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.410
is when you stand
up and say, OK,

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.010
so anybody have any questions?

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.440
Chirp, chirp.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.610
Nobody wants to go first,
nobody's raising their hand.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.820
And you don't want
to end on that note.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.690
So always come
equipped with something

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:17.320
and say, typically when I give
this presentation, what people

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.680
are most curious
to know is how much

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.700
rehearsing is too
much rehearsing.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.700
Just come with your
own thing to kick start

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.900
the Q&amp;A. Because a
lot of times, nobody

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.920
wants to be the first
one raising their hand.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:34.104
Or what you say could trigger
an idea somebody else has.

00:40:34.104 --> 00:40:36.770
AUDIENCE: A number of years ago,
I think it was on Public Radio,

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:40.570
I heard about a study where they
were looking at speeches given

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:47.039
by CEOs of dot coms I think.

00:40:47.039 --> 00:40:48.580
And they found an
inverse correlation

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.960
between how much of the
time they were lying

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.420
and how often they said um.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.540
So the ones who didn't say um
at all were lying a lot more.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.760
And I was wondering
if you'd heard of that

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.010
and what you think
is going on there.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.520
BILL McGOWAN: I think there is
a desire for a lot of people

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.220
to try to create
a thoughtfulness

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.850
and a spontaneity
around something

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.980
that's very well rehearsed.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.540
So I think what
you may be finding

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.930
or what that study
may be finding

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.760
is if they have some talking
point that's been scripted

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.280
and approved by the lawyers
and the communications people,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.670
somebody training them may
say don't blurt this out

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.860
like it's a rehearsed,
memorized thing.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.420
Bring some sort of feigned
hesitance to this idea.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.892
Like, so, um, yeah,
I think-- I think

00:41:37.892 --> 00:41:40.430
what we did here was
the right thing to do.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:45.010
Even though on paper, that says
what we did the right thing.

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:47.950
Anyone who's been
coached tries to create

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.760
the feel of spontaneity.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.120
But if they're at
a very high level,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.377
I guarantee you that's been
removed from the equation

00:41:55.377 --> 00:41:56.710
if they know what they're doing.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:59.190
So it may be a
completely planned thing

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.730
to make it sound like this
isn't our message point here,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:06.262
this is actually coming
from my heart and I mean it.

00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:07.720
AUDIENCE: As a
speaker, what do you

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.080
do if somebody in
the audience is,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.490
I want to say heckler,
but not really a heckler,

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.820
but trying to
attack you or trying

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:21.170
to divert you to a
different direction

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:25.180
and keep asking questions
that are not really relevant.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.790
So how do you deal
with such situations?

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:34.190
BILL McGOWAN: I had a client in
the valley earlier this year,

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.520
and he was giving a keynote
at a big tech conference.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.990
I forget in what country.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.380
And there was one
part of his speech

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.550
that we knew could
touch a nerve.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:49.710
And so what we did was I
heckled him in rehearsal.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:54.100
And we planned what three or
four possible shout outs could

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.420
be and what our responses
would be to those.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.570
But short of practicing,
it happens spontaneously

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:04.040
and you're not prepared
for it, what you want to do

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.680
is not look rattled by it.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.980
I think what you want to give
the appearance of is being

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.070
welcoming of the conversation,
but just not right here.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.900
So you could say
the person, what

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.130
you raise is a
totally valid point.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.090
I'm more than happy to have
this conversation with you

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.560
after the presentation,
because this is something that

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.850
obviously matters
to you individually.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.470
I'm speaking to the
general crowd now.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.605
So come find me afterwards.

00:43:33.605 --> 00:43:38.290
You don't want to just
slap it down and look

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:43.010
like this has
totally rattled me.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.900
AUDIENCE: Can you suggest
some gracious ways

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.059
to handle someone who's
constantly interrupting?

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:49.600
Like say you've got a few points
that you need to get through

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.030
and they're kind
of asking questions

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:52.870
of the next few things
you're going to say.

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.540
What would be a gracious
way just to put them off

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.430
without looking like
it's rattling you?

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.020
Or what's a gracious
way to handle that?

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.530
BILL McGOWAN: And
this person you

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.440
obviously want to maintain
a good dynamic with.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.670
BILL McGOWAN: Instead of
saying, would you stop,

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:09.530
would you butt out?

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:10.155 --> 00:44:12.440
Like a team member,
maybe on a smaller scale

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.800
where you're trying to
present a few key ideas--

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.591
BILL McGOWAN: I think
what you want to do--

00:44:15.591 --> 00:44:17.960
and this is advice I
give to clients when

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.150
they have a potentially
confrontational situation

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.930
with a reporter-- and that
is don't pick a fight.

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:27.360
Don't immediately say
I'm getting to that,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.480
and do something
that feels annoyed.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.310
But you can say I love the
fact that you're really

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.090
eager to get the whole story,
and we have the whole story,

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:38.650
more than happy to take
any follow up questions.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:42.130
But it's all in here,
so stay with me on this.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:42.760
OK.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.700
You almost want to
create the feeling

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.460
that you like the fact that
they're so into it that they

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.230
can't wait to find out about it.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.770
You try to view it through
the positive prism.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.360
Because when you slap
them down and make

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.780
it look like would you
please stop doing that,

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.560
it doesn't really help.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.170
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.630
We would all love to
have a coach like you

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.400
before our presentations,
but for us that

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.570
don't have coaches, what are
some tips that you could give

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.670
us that we could do for
just practicing, preparing,

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:16.490
anything?

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.573
BILL McGOWAN: Try not to
sit down at your computer

00:45:18.573 --> 00:45:20.270
and write it out.

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.330
So if you need to
come up with a script,

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.990
I'd much rather you make
an outline on index cards.

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.660
And so make yourself
a structure.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.090
And then take your
phone or your tablet

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:41.500
and prop it up and roll
video on yourself doing it.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.240
OK?

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.790
And just organically
talk through what

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.340
you would say to the outline.

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.130
And if you want then
to go off of-- if you

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.950
want to have a text, like a
verbatim thing, what I'd rather

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.620
you do is take the
transcription of that video

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.640
and make that the basis
of your presentation.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.530
Because what that will
be is a really accurate

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.650
written out version of how
we talk conversationally.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.390
Most people, when they
sit down a computer,

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.640
unless they've written for TV or
radio, don't write for the ear.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.090
They write for the eye.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.550
And that usually makes it
hard to deliver the content

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.960
in a way that sounds
natural and organic.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.390
So if you have the
time, see if you

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.640
can make this
transcription the basis,

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.822
and then start shaving it down.

00:46:36.822 --> 00:46:38.280
Because obviously,
you're not going

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.340
to probably want to
use the whole thing.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.470
And see if you can rehearse
it enough into your phone

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.370
so you can see how
you're coming across.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:50.280
And see if you can whittle
it back to that outline form.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.360
So you're never reading
big chunks of text

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.190
on the PowerPoint or-- we didn't
even talk about that today.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.790
But I trust all of you--
try not to read your slides.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.280
Try to use imagery
as much as possible.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.150
Try to keep the information in
the data as sparse as humanly

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:09.190
possible.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.590
But that would be
my major advice.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:15.150
And use that as a
self critique tool.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.990
And just think to yourself,
what are my big ideas?

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:20.490
What do I want these people
leaving the room thinking?

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.570
And am I teeing
up these big ideas

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.950
and putting them up on
that pedestal enough?

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:28.450
AUDIENCE: As a rule
of thumb, do you

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:32.360
offer any guidance about how
much somebody should present

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.670
for a certain type
of presentation?

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:38.180
So for a 30 minute presentation,
how many hours of prep time

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.500
do you recommend?

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.860
BILL McGOWAN: I think
it's somewhat individual.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:50.990
But I think that it's more
important about not obsessively

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.760
rehearsing right up to
the minute you go on.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.830
In fact, I think sometimes
in that last half

00:47:55.830 --> 00:48:00.110
hour, 45 minutes, it'd be great
to take your mind off of it.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.740
Sudoku, Words With Friends,
a crossword puzzle,

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.780
any mental game you
have that relaxes you,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.410
I think that's a lot better
to do right before you go on.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.420
Because I find when
you obsessively

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.961
concentrate on what you're going
to do when you go out there,

00:48:12.961 --> 00:48:14.280
you can get kind of tight.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.238
AUDIENCE: At the beginning
of the presentation,

00:48:16.238 --> 00:48:18.180
you mentioned
sometimes people could

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.829
tend to sound very tight or
nervous in the beginning.

00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:22.370
And then you mentioned
that breathing

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.885
is important to help with that.

00:48:23.885 --> 00:48:25.510
I was wondering if
you could elaborate.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.050
Because just recently, we had
a presentation and someone

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:32.401
seemed so nervous that I ended
up getting nervous for them.

00:48:32.401 --> 00:48:35.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:40.210
BILL McGOWAN: I had a woman
introduce me not too long ago.

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.780
And see, Chris
was totally on it.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.110
Was calm and cool.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.110
But this woman who introduced
me, she had a piece of paper

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.552
with my bio on it.

00:48:49.552 --> 00:48:51.010
And she got up in
front of the room

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.340
to introduce me on
good communication,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.650
and her hands were shaking.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.960
And you could not only
see the paper vibrating,

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.720
but you could hear it.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.470
It was very hard to go on after
that and not acknowledge it.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:15.060
I think you have to look at
other people doing things that

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:20.990
may work and may not work
and think, all right, well,

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.370
I like to look at the people
who are doing really well

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:28.420
and try to actually dissect
why they're effective.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.460
And realize, oh wow, she
does that every time she

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.750
comes up to a big idea.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.080
That that's not random.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.110
That's actually intentional.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.500
Let me try that out next time.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.150
So it can be really
boring sitting

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.970
through other people's
presentations.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:49.070
So if you took out
a pad and created

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.500
two columns for
yourself on the pad when

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:57.540
you watch other people,
effective and not effective,

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.560
and write down the
techniques you feel

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.760
are working for this person
and working against them,

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.860
and see if any of
those in the for column

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.450
are tactics and strategies
you could actually

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.430
experiment with yourself.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:14.980
And that's, I think, how you
learn from good presenters.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.360
So for instance,
I've seen somebody

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:22.180
in how they move around
the room be very strategic.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.850
And what they do is
they move in transition,

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.370
but then when they
come to the big idea,

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.520
they stop before the big idea.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.530
They're never giving
something of importance

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.820
when they're moving
and looking down.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.620
That's going to mute the
impact of what you're saying.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.847
So even how you move
around a stage matters.

00:50:42.847 --> 00:50:44.430
And these are some
of the tips I think

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.691
you can pick up from
watching other people.

00:50:46.691 --> 00:50:48.940
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks a lot,
Bill, and thanks everyone.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.273
BILL McGOWAN: Thanks for coming.

00:50:50.273 --> 00:50:51.280
[APPLAUSE]
