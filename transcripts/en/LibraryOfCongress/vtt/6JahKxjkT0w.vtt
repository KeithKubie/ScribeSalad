&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.660
And I am Grant Harris.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.480
I am Chief of the European division
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.920
We are happy that you're
joining us today.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.810
This is a really good
crowd we've got.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.500
Can you hear me all
right through the room?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, good.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.400
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: All right.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.700
Very good.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.840
I want to thank all of
you for coming out here.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.810
Before we introduce our
guest speaker, Flora Nikolla,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.300
who will talk about the Albanian
press, I do want to thank a number

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.320
of people here, especially from the
Washington, D.C. chapter of Vatra,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.790
the Pan Albanian Federation
of America.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.270
Thank you for being here and
for helping organize this event.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450
And I appreciate having
an interpreter

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.880
for this occasion from Vatra.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.100
So Ms. Nora Bucaj will help us
with the interpretation up here.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.380
I'd like to recognize Ms. Mamica
Toska from the Republic of Albania,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.150
Thank you for being here.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.770
And also the Minister
Counsellor at the Embassy,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.180 position:56%
Mr. Visser Jerte [assumed spelling].

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.030
Thank you for being
here, and any other's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.360
who may be here from the Embassy.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
Very briefly, let me say that
the Library of Congress is proud

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.190
of our Albanian Collections.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.690
We have about 17,000
volumes at this point.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.450
We believe we have the
largest collection,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.790
certainly in the Americas.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.560
I would say it's actually
doubtful that there is a library

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.690
that has a larger collection than
the Library of Congress other

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.340
than libraries inside
Albania itself.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.680
We currently receive about
350 monographs each year

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.610
from or about Albania.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.690
Most of those are in
the Albanian language.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.030
The collections are particularly
strong in history, language,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.380
and literature, but also the
humanities, the social sciences.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.430
So we have really a lot of
great materials; not only books

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.820
and periodicals -- maps,
recorded sound, sheet music,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.140
just really incredible
collections here,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.820
so I am proud to be the
specialist for Albania.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.120
I cover several languages.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.560
Albania is certainly not my first
language, but I'm very happy

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.460
to cover that country,
and Kosova as well.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.250
And I've been to both
a couple of times each.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.940
So now for the inevitable
announcement for your cell phones.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.390
Just take a look at those if
you haven't don't that already.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.510 position:56%
We want this to be a nice recording.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.400
This is being recorded by
the Library of Congress.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.930 position:56%
We hope to make a webcast out of it.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.930
It's not a live production here,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.450
but it takes us a few
months to make it that way.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.740 position:56%
So now, finally, getting to the main
point, I'm very pleased to be able

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.990
to introduce the journalist
and editor, Flora Nikolla.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.970 position:56%
She is the Editor-in-Chief of the
Albanian Telegraphic Agency, or ATA.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.340
It's been that agency for a long
time, Albania's main press agency.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.420
Her career with Ata has covered
most of the years since 1993,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.390
working as an editor, a
journalist, and a script writer

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.420
for ATA's magazines and on other
projects such as Spanish radio,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.140
she speaks Spanish, and
the Albanian Film Festival.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.600
Ms. Nikolla will discuss today the
Albanian press after Communism.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.190
If there is time, she
may delve into speaking

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.800
about the Albanian diaspora.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.460
She knows a lot about the
diasporas in many countries

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.690
and its relationship to Albania.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.550
But her main topic today is really
the press and a history of that.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.580
So please help me welcome her.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.050
And I should say also that
our interpreter today --

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.110
I may have mentioned
her name -- Nora Bucaj.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.500
We're very happy to have Nora here.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.440
I'm not sure where
she's sitting right now,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.600
but she'll -- there -- outstanding.

share these microphones, so.

I would say today that no one
is a professional by accident.

And I want to say that
I don't believe

this profession, a noble profession

I recall today that
I first connected

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.020
with journalism in
my early childhood.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.770
There was an entire generation of
remarkable journalists and writers

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:17.250
at that time that would become a
comprehensive list of personalities

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:24.220
like [foreign words], and even
the decadent ones persecuted

My dad, a journalist for 45 years,
25 of which as Editor-in-Chief

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:45.870
of <i>Hosteni Magazine </i>, considered
as the only opposition magazine

of a one-party Albanian Nation.

They were people who were
always around during my youth.

subconsciously, without knowing,

I started to fall in love with
my profession, a noble profession

can be all-consuming

this is how I became familiar

desire to write and tell the truth.

As a kid and later on when I was
older I heard this in experience

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.190
through my dad who ran the
magazine <i>Hosteni </i>for 25 years,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:04.190
a comedy magazine that satirized
the negative appearances in society

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.980
within Communist norms, which
were actually great limitations.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.350
It was supposed to be the
opposition in a country

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.530
where opposition was banned.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.590
This was basically impossible.

know my father's pain.

that was never realized

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.990

believed in it.

I came to know his
unspoken rebellion.

On another way I recognized the
suffering of his close friends

and colleagues, convicted for
breaking the Communist ideal which,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.600
in fact, turned out to just
be a utopia because, actually,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.920
a political regime should be in the
service of carrying out the rule

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.760

for conforming to the opposite.

So you mentioned that

it's because a lot of millennials

read the news anymore

because they have no power over
what's happening in politics?

Do you think that the reason why
newspaper sales are falling is not

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:22.250
because people don't want to read
the news, but because they feel

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.650

cannot control what's going

Oh, okay. So what Flora summarized
was that basically the role

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:18.440
of ATA has diminished, has
diminished significantly,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.190
but still it remains good because
there is no contest from those

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.110
who receive the news through ATA
because it still stays faithful

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.070

the norms that ATA has.

nice idiom there.

She said that all the online

there are so many that it's like
the mushrooms after the rain,

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.680

there is many of them,

But although the role
has diminished,

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.390
that was the key substance
of her explanation,

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.170
that although the role is
diminished, it's still the facts

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.450 position:56%
that there is no one there -- she
mentioned that the foreign embassies

that are based in Albania,
