00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.930
Star Wars fans have a lot to look forward
to, as the franchise's universe is going to

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.760
get a whole lot bigger in the next few years.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.950
Aside from a new trilogy and spinoff movies,
there's no telling how many animated or live-action

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.140
TV shows are coming.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.860
But fans might not even realize that there
are chapters in the Star Wars saga they've

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.940
missed completely - chapters that shouldn't
slip by unnoticed, for the best possible reasons.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.890
Here are Screen Rant's Amazing Star Wars Spin-Offs
You've Never Seen.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.750
The Star Wars Holiday Special
When Star Wars proved to be a massive hit,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.909
CBS came up with a plan to bring that success
to the small screen, pitching George Lucas

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.520
on a holiday variety show.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.649
The director agreed, but only if the story
centered on Chewbacca's Wookie family: his

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.280
father, Itchy, his wife, Malla, and his son,
Lumpy.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.710
Aside from some small cameos from the movie's
cast, the special was a random mix of unrelated

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.859
skits that disappointed almost everyone who
watched it.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.909
It was aired just once, before George Lucas
could buy all master copies of what would

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.340
come to be known as "the worst two hours of
television ever" by TV critics.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
The worst part?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.160
The short cartoon that introduced bounty hunter
Boba Fett was so good, it left fans wondering

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:22.570
why a full series wasn't greenlit to do what
the variety show failed at.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.140
Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure
Three years after the first Death Star was

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.340
blown to pieces, while Luke, Leia and Han
were helping the Rebels gain an edge, an entirely

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.320
different adventure was taking place on the
forest moon of Endor.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.750
The made-for-TV movie follows Mace and Cindel,
a brother and sister stranded on the planet,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.190
who team up with the Ewoks to rescue their
parents from a strange monster.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.770
After the embarrassment of the Holiday Special,
George Lucas crafted the story himself, with

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.200
the art director of the original films, Joe
Johnston, overseeing the production design.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.750
The result was an award-winning adventure
celebrated for its special effects, and the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.130
start of a new franchise within the series.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.970
Ewoks: The Battle For Endor
The made-for-TV sequel to the first Ewok Adventure

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.220
follows an older Cindel, who is soon orphaned
and tossed into the forest with the Ewok hero

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.811
Wicket, to find an old hermit who will help
them save the moon from invaders.

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:15.660
The movie was, once again, overseen by Industrial
Light and Magicâ€™s creative leads, and the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.000
story crafted with the help of George Lucas
directly.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.270
The movie gave Wicket even more attention
after his well-received appearance in Return

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.530
of the Jedi, and earned the studio even more
acclaim for pioneering a new form of camera

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
work on a relatively small budget.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.880
Star Wars: Droids
George Lucas's second trilogy may have told

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.670
the origin story of Anakin Skywalker, but
it wasn't the first prequel series to fill

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.620
in the events of the galaxy far, far away,
happening before the original series began.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.020
Set in the period between the rise of the
Empire and A New Hope, the animated series

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.980
follows C-3PO and R2-D2 in one adventure after
another, as the pair of droids always seem

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.940
to have a knack for getting into trouble.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.630
The cartoon included appearances from fan-favorite
characters like Boba Fett, IG-88, and too

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.760
many space pirates, smugglers and gangsters
to count.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.370
With Anthony Daniels still supplying the voice
of the cartoon 3PO, and the prequel trilogy

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.800
referencing the cartoon years later, it's
a serious part of the series canon.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.170
Star Wars: Ewoks
Droids are fine for a few laughs, but the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.910
miniature, walking, talking teddy bears in
Return of the Jedi were a cartoon creator's

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.650
dream - and the main reasons that the animated
Ewoks got almost three times as many episodes

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.810
as the saga's star droids.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.670
With the cartoon set years before the events
of the TV movies, the first season of Ewoks

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.489
was surprisingly high quality, and enjoyed
by kids and their parents.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.230
The second and third seasons' writing and
story lines instead aimed squarely at younger

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.980
viewers, but boasted some talented writers,
including Paul Dini, years before he's create

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.670
the animated Batman and Superman cartoon.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.890
The Ewoks series also offers a major twist:
since the cartoon characters all speak Basic

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.840
English, we assume George Lucas was revealing
that the Ewoks were only pretending not to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.390
understand the Star Wars heroes.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.629
And we thought they were friendly.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.570
Star Wars: Clone Wars
To be clear, that's "Clone Wars," not "The

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.120
Clone Wars."

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.080
Before the CG TV series became a reality,
this hand-animated cartoon followed the saga's

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.460
star Jedi between Episodes 2 and 3.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.780
Establishing why General Grievous was a villain
to be feared, the series of short episodes

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.750
- drawn by the same artist as Dexter's Lab
and Samurai Jack - showed the Jedi Knights

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.800
using their Force powers in the ways fans
always hoped to see.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.770
The short series is often overlooked in favor
of the lore-heavy computer-animated show,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.560
but it shouldn't be: it includes some of the
best moments in the entire Star Wars story.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.280
Those are the key spin-off stories of the
Star Wars saga that most modern fans may have

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.250
missed, and are still worth visiting today
- for a variety of reasons.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.560
