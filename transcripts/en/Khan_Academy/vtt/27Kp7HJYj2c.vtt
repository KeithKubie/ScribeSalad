00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.980
Welcome to the presentation
on level two addition.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.590
Well I think we should get
started with some problems, and

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.100
hopefully as we work through
them, you'll have an

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.491
understanding of how to do
these types of problems.

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:18.650
Let me make sure the
pen tool is correct.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.480
Let's say I had 11 plus 4.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.570
So first you'd say hey, Sal, 11
plus 4, I don't know how to

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.250
add two-digit numbers yet.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.960
Well there's a couple of ways
we can think about this.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.720
First I'll show you how all you
have to know is how to add

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.210
one-digit numbers and you can
use something called carrying

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.510
to solve the whole problem.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.610
Then we'll actually try to
visually represent it to show

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.100
you how you could actually
do this type of problem

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.640
in your head as well.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.860
So what you do with these types
of problems is you first look

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.040
at the right-most
digit on the 11.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.510
We call this the
ones place, right?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.410
Because this 1 is 1, and we
call this the tens place.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.180
I know I'm going to confuse
you a lot, but that's when

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.570
everything looks
easier later on.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.780
So you look at this ones place,
you say there's a 1 there.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.820
You take that 1 and you add it
to the number right below it.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850
So 1 plus 4 is 5.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670
You knew that, right?

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.920
You know that 1 plus
4 is equal to 5.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.680
That's all I did here.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730
I just said this 1 plus
this 4 is equal to 5.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.300
Now I go to this 1.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.520
This 1 plus -- well there's
nothing here other than a plus

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.870
sign and that's not a number.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.030
So this 1 plus nothing is 1.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.560
So we put a 1 here.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.770
And we get 11 plus
4 is equal to 15.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.590
Just so you know that this
system actually works, let's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.490
actually draw it out in a
couple of different ways

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.620
just to give you the
intuition of 11 plus 4.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.260
So if I had 11 balls -- one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.910
seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.720
That's eleven, right?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.840
So that's 11 and we're
going to add 4 to it.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.740
So one, two, three, four.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.430
So now all we have to do is
count how many total circles

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.060
or balls we have now.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.000
That's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.570
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.130
I don't recommend that you
do this every time you do

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.000
a problem because it'll
take you a long time.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.070
But hey, if you ever get
confused, it's better to take a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.350
long time than to get it wrong.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.650
Let's think about another way
of representing this, because

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.300
I think different visual
approaches appeal in different

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.480
ways to different people.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.210
Let's draw a number line.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.010
I don't know if you've seen
a number line before but

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.930
you're going to see it now.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.690
And a number line, all
I do is I draw out all

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.795
the numbers in order.

00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:14.310
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -- I'm
doing them small so I know I

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:35.910
can get to 15 -- 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.450
And so on.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.610
And these arrows mean that
the numbers keep going

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.180
in both directions.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.923
I know this is a little early
for you to learn this, but

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:43.890
actually the numbers can
actually keep going to the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.260
left below zero as well.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.810
I'll leave you to
think about that.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.990
But anyway, so let's go
back to this problem.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.180
So we have 11, so let me circle
11 -- let me see where 11

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.980
is on the number line.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.210
11 is here, right?

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.820
This is 11.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.520
And we're adding 4.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.020
So when you add, that means
we're increase 11 by 4.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.120
So that when you increase we're
going to go up the number line,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.010
right, or we're going to go the
right on the number line

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.410
because the numbers
are getting bigger.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.300
So we'd go 1, 2, 3, 4 -- bam.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.910
We're at 15.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.930
Once again, this takes a long
time, but if you ever get

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.450
confused or you forget what 1
plus 4 is, although I don't

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.620
think you should, then you
could just do it this way.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.500
Let's do some maybe
harder problems now.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:41.300
Let's do 28 plus 7.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.660
8 plus 7 -- I'll tell you,
frankly, even to this

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.560
day, I sometimes get
confused with 8 plus 7.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.700
If you know the answer then you
already know how to do this

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.450
problem, you can just write
whatever the answer

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.770
is down here.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.570
But let draw it on the number
line, because I think a little

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.620
bit of more basic addition
practice isn't unwarranted

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.750
at this point.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.920
So we could do out with
the number line again.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.690
8 plus 7.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.570
I'm not going to start at 0,
I'll start at like 5, because

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.440
if you keep going you'll
get to 0 eventually.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:29.600
So let's see 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.276
16, 17, 18 and so on.

00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:35.500
It'll keep going all the
way to 100 and 1,000 and a

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.480
million billion trillion.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.600
So what are we doing?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.450
We start at 8 because
this is 8 plus 7.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.405
We want to figure out
what 8 plus 7 is.

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:46.780
So we start at 8.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.790
We're going to add 7 to it.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.540
Let me change colors.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:58.030
So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.580
Oh, that's 15 shows up again.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.590
So 8 plus 7 is equal to 15.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.500
Over time as you do practice, I
think you'll memorize these

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.240
that 8 plus 7 is 15 or
whatever, 6 plus 7 is

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.710
13 or any of these.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.420
But in the interim it actually
doesn't hurt to do this number

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.370
line because you actually are
visualizing what's happening.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.260
And you can do it with
the circles as well.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.590
So we know 8 plus 7 is 15.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.280
So this is a new thing you're
going to learn right now.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.260
You don't write the
whole 15 down here.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.010
You write the 5 -- you write
this five right here.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.300
And then that 1,
you carry the 1.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.170
You put it up there.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.270
I think in a future
presentation I'll explain why

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.840
this works and maybe you might
even kind of have an intuition

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.862
because the 1 is in the tens
place, and this is

00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:47.320
the tens place.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.810
I don't want to confuse you.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.870
So you have that 1 and
now you add it to the

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.670
2, and you get 35.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.060
Because 1 plus 2 is
equal to 3, right?

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.050
So you're done.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.090
35.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.760
You might ask, well, does
that make sense that

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.720
28 plus 7 is 35?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.000
And there's a couple of ways
I'd like to think about this.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.800
Well, 8 plus 7 we know is 15.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.240
And I don't know how
comfortable we are

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.000
with higher numbers.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.500
But 18 plus 7 -- so
look at this pattern.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.640
8 plus 7 is equal to 15.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.360
18 plus 7 -- you're probably
saying, Sal, where are you

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.720
getting the 18 from, but
take my word for it.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.380
18 plus 7 is 25.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.930
28 plus 7 is equal to 35, which
is the one that we just did.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.710
This is a check mark.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.890
If you kept going, you
said 38 plus 7, that

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.380
actually equals 45.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.860
So you might see a little
pattern here, and then you can

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.910
just sit and think about this
for a little bit if you like.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.740
Maybe you pause the video.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.350
Another way you could think
about this if you still don't

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.870
believe me is you say OK, if I
have 28, if I add 1 I get 29,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.970
if I add 2 I get 30,
if I add 3 I get 31.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.410
If I add 4 I get 32.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.425
If I add 5 I get 33.

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:11.550
If I add 6 I get 34.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.110
And if I add 7 I get 35 again.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.150
Right, all I did is I kept
saying oh, if I had one more

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.800
I'll get a larger little bit --
the number a little bit larger.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.230
Let's do some more problems,
and I think we'll

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.940
do a couple more.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.680
Let's do it a little faster
because you might get what

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.110
we're doing here now.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.580
Let's do a hard one.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:33.300
Let's do 99 plus 9.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.400
So what's 9 plus 9?

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.670
So if you don't know what it
is, you can work it out

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.720
either using the number line
or drawing the circles.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.990
That's a fair way to do
it, although you should

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.070
eventually kind of know it.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.110
9 plus 9 it turns out is 18.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.320
You put the 8 down here
and you carry the 1.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.810
And now you just say 1 plus 9.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.150
Well you know what 1 plus 9 is.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.480
1 plus 9 is equal to 10.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.640
So there's nowhere to carry
this 1, so you write the

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.460
whole thing down here.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.280
So 99 plus 9 is equal to 108.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.820
Let's do one more problem.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:22.450
Let's say 56 plus 7.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.780
Well what's 6 plus 7.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:30.070
Well 6 plus 7 is 13, right?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.650
If you get confused, draw
out everything again.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.980
And then you get 1 plus 5.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.570
1 plus 5 is 6.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.960
63.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.770
And you might want to give
yourself a bunch of problems

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.580
and I think you're also now, if
you understand what we did,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.060
ready to try the level
two addition problems.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.580
Have fun.
