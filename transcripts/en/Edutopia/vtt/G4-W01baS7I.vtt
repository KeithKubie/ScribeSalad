00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:05.736
&gt;&gt;Laura: Good morning!

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:09.516
&gt;&gt;Every year when I present
this challenge, I wonder,

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.256
will this be the year that students
will say, "No, I can't do this"?

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:17.976
Yet, every year, I see those
kids have a story to tell.

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:28.156
&gt;&gt;So, planners out and
notebooks and pen or pencil.

00:00:28.686 --> 00:00:31.996
&gt;&gt; When I look back on my own
learning about reading and writing,

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:35.276
there was not a lot of writing
that I felt ownership over.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:40.706
I've always been most comfortable
with writing expository nonfiction,

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:46.186
and when I heard about NaNoWriMo, I
thought, 8th-graders writing a novel?

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:47.676
That's impossible!

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:49.896
And I couldn't even imagine
writing a novel.

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:53.846
&gt;&gt;You guys are ready for
the 30-day challenge?

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:56.586
&gt;&gt;As far as projects
go, this one is big.

00:00:57.386 --> 00:01:02.306
NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel
Writing Month, and it's a challenge

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:06.436
for young writers to write a
novel in the 30 days of November.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.686
&gt;&gt;You'll start brainstorming
what settings are going

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:11.576
to be part of your story.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.136
&gt;&gt;A lot of them say, "I can't do this.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:15.246
I'm afraid.

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:16.246
I don't want to do it."

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:19.636
The counselors say that kids will
show up at their office saying,

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:21.786
"Please move me out of
Mrs. Bradley's class.

00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:23.766
Does she know I'm only 13?"

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.936
So, one of the first
challenges was my own fear

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:32.986
that they would not have
stories to tell.

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:35.546
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, what's your setting?

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.486
&gt;&gt;Laura: When I had them brainstorm
their stories and then we all sat

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:43.446
in a circle and I had them share out,
one after another, I was blown away

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.786
at the creativity and the passion,

00:01:46.086 --> 00:01:49.836
the voices that they had
that they needed to share.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.586
&gt;&gt;Student: The opening scene
of my novel will be a flashback

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:56.786
to my main character's grandfather
in the prisoner-of-war camp.

00:01:57.326 --> 00:02:00.506
&gt;&gt;Student: He's eating
take-out Chinese with his mom,

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.726
who just got out of open-heart surgery.

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:05.946
&gt;&gt;Student: "And from up above,
Leo looked down at young Leo.

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:07.416
He looked down and smiled.

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:10.236
He smiled for Leo for moving
on, for saving the universe.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:11.566
Well, the two of them."

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:13.156
&gt;&gt;Laura: That's amazing.

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:15.986
&gt;&gt;These students speak
with such authority.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:18.476
They know what the characters
are going to do.

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.406
They know where the plot is going.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:23.276
They know the conflicts that
have to be worked through,

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:26.366
and they know how it all will end.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:30.046
&gt;&gt;I'm peeking over your
shoulders, and it's just amazing.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.376
I'm so impressed.

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:36.366
&gt;&gt;I remember as a student being pretty
excited to take my writing and staple it

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.736
into a pretty construction-paper cover.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.336
And that was publishing.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:46.096
But my students now are able to send
the Amazon link to their relatives

00:02:46.096 --> 00:02:47.556
and share their novel with the world.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.336
I hope that they recognize
that what used

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:55.946
to seem impossible really
is possible for them

00:02:56.456 --> 00:03:03.516
and that they leave my class going on
to high school identifying as a writer,

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:08.246
that when a teacher asks them to write
something, they in their mind will say,

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.976
"I can do this, because
I've written a novel."
