00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's do another conic section
identification problem.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:14.780
So, I have 4y squared
minus 50x is equal to 25x

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.950
squared plus 16y plus 109.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.450
So, the first thing I like to
do is to group all of the x and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.740
y terms onto one side of the
equation and leave all the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.350
constants on the other side.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.120
So let's do that.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.110
So, on the left-hand side
I'll put the 4y squared.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.190
4yy squared.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.360
And, actually, I'm also going
to group all the x and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.560
y terms in this step.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.660
So the 4y squared.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.110
Let's move this 16y onto
the left-hand side.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.840
So if I subtract 16y from both
sides of this equation, I get

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.225
minus 16y, minus 16y on the
left-hand side and of course

00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:53.930
it will disappear on
the right-hand side.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.260
And then I want to subtract
the 25x squared from both

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020
sides of this equation.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.710
So I get minus 25x
squared minus 50x.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.940
That's that right there.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.340
And then I'll leave this 109
on the right-hand side.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.220
It's equal to 109.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.696
And now that we have the x's
and the y's on the same side of

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.440
the equation, we know what type
of -- we know the general

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.490
direction we're going to go in.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.880
Because they're on
the same side.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.900
They have different
coefficients.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.930
And one is positive
and one is negative.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.120
So that lets us know that we're
dealing with a hyperbola.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.690
So let's complete the
square and get it into

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.740
the standard form.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.990
So, the easiest way to complete
the square is if you have a 1

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530
coefficient on the y squared
and the x squared terms.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.520
So let's factor out
a 4, in this case.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.530
So you get 4 times y
squared minus 4y.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.100
I'm going to add
something later, when

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.670
I complete the square.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.990
Minus 25 times x squared,
plus, let's see, minus 50

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.190
divided by minus 25 is 2.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.400
Plus 2x, I'm going to
add something later.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.550
Is equal to 109.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.500
And the things we're going
to add, those are what

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.340
complete the square.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.770
Make these things
a perfect square.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000
So, if I take this, you
have a minus 4 here.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.210
I take half of that number.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.980
This is just completing the
square, I encourage you to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.550
watch the video on completing
the square where I

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.760
explain why this works.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.230
But I think I have a minus 4.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.570
I take half of that,
it's minus 2.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.010
And then minus 2
squared is plus 4.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.970
Now, I can't do one thing to
one side of the equation

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.220
without doing it to the other.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.585
And I didn't add a 4 to the
left-hand side of the equation.

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:39.660
I actually added a
4 times 4, right?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.990
Because you have this 4
multiplying it out front.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.965
So I added at 16 to the left
side of the equation, so I

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.390
have to also add it to
the right-hand side

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.740
of the equation.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.980
Right?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.720
This is equivalent to also
having a plus 16 here.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.050
That might make a little
bit clearer, right?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.340
When you factor it out,
and it becomes a 4.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.090
And we would have added
a 16 up here as well.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.930
Likewise, if we take half
of this number here.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.020
Half of 2 is 1.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.780
1 squared is 1.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.990
We didn't add a 1 to the
left-hand side of the equation,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.860
we added a 1 times minus 25.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.180
So we want to put
a minus 25 here.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.630
And, likewise, this would
have been the same thing as

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.560
adding a minus 25 up here.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.170
And you do a minus
25 over here.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.780
And now, what does this become?

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.420
The y terms become 4
times y minus 2 squared.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.580
y minus 2 squared.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.740
Might want to review factoring
a polynomial, if you found that

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.090
a little confusing, that step.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.740
Minus 25 times x
plus 1 squared.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.170
That's that, right there.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.620
x plus 1 squared, is equal to,
let's see, 109 plus 16 is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.140
25 minus 25, it equals 100.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.000
We're almost there.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.130
So we want a 1 here, so
let's divide both sides

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.020
of this equation by 100.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.470
So, you will get y
minus 2 squared.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.910
4 divided by 100 is the
same thing as 1/25, so

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.490
this becomes over 25.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.160
Minus, let's see, 25/100 is the
same thing as 1/4, so this

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.620
becomes x plus 1 squared
over 4 is equal to 1.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.390
And there you have it.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.480
We have it in standard
form and, yes, indeed,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.470
we do have a hyperbola.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.780
Now, let's graph
this hyperbola.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.600
So the first thing we
know is where the center

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.410
of this hyperbola is.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.020
Is the center of this hyperbola
is at the point x is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.080
equal to minus one.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.340
So it's an x is equal to
minus 1. y is equal to 2.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.340
And let's figure out the
asymptotes of this hyperbola.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.240
So if this was -- this is the
way I always do it, because I

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.090
always forget the
actual formula.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.200
If this was centered at 0 and
it looked something like this.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.020
y squared over 25 minus x
squared over 4 is equal to 1.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.460
I do this to figure out what
the asymptotes would have been

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.570
if we were centered at 0.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.560
Because it's a lot easier to
deal with these equations

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.690
than to deal with these.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.370
So we could solve -- we
multiply both sides by 100.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.590
We're kind of unwinding
what we just did.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.070
So if you -- actually, let's
multiply both sides by 25.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.670
So then you get y squared
minus 2 over 4x squared

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.490
is equal to 25.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.130
And then, I'll just
go right here.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.390
And then if I add 25 over 4x
squared to both sides, I get

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:49.090
y squared is equal to 25
over 4x squared plus 25.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.970
And so, y is equal to the plus
or minus square root of 25

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.800
over 4x squared plus 25.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.350
And like always, the
asymptotes, the hyperbola will

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.410
never equal the asymptotes or
intersect the asymptotes, but

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.740
it's what the graph approaches
as x approaches positive

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.950
and negative infinity.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.570
So, as x approaches positive
and negative infinity, and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.490
you'll learn the concept
of limits later on.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.320
But I think you get
it at this point.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.220
Because that's what the idea
of an asymptote even is.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.195
Is that as x gets really
larger, approaching this line

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:29.800
-- so as x approaches positive
or negative infinity, as we've

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.840
done in the previous videos,
this term starts to

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.180
matter a lot less.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.610
Because this term is huge.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.630
So then y is approximately
equal to plus or minus the

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.990
square root of just this term.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.370
Now, the square root of
just this term is 5/2 x.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.640
So those would be our
asymptotes if we

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.430
were centered at 0.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.710
But, of course, we're
centered at negative 1, 2.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.030
So let's graph that.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.350
And then we could figure out
if it's a upward-opening

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.660
or downward-opening graph.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.580
We're centered at
negative 1, 2.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.826
So I want to be in the,
that's my y axis.

00:07:13.826 --> 00:07:16.970
This is my x axis.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.830
And we're centered
at minus 1, 1, 2.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.585
That's the center.

00:07:26.585 --> 00:07:31.470
And this would've been the
two lines of the asymptotes

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.870
if we were centered at 0.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.750
But now this tells us the
slope of the two asymptotes.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.160
So the asymptotes are going to
intersect at the center of

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.940
our hyperbola, so to speak.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.540
So these are the slopes
of the two asymptotes.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.030
And one is positive 5/2.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.510
So, positive 5/2 means
if we go over 2, so 1,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.260
2, in x, we go up 5.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.970
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.930
So we'll end up
right over there.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.120
So I can draw that line, I just
need two points for a line.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.470
So that line would
look like that.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.850
And the other asymptote
is minus 5/2.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.110
So for every 2 we go over to
the right, we go down 5.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.230
So, 1, 2.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.820
1, 2, 3 4, 5.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.800
So we end up right about there.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.680
And so that line would
look like that.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.170
Good enough.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.130
So those are the two
asymptotes, and they go on

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.030
forever in those directions.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.460
And now we can think
of it two ways.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.190
We could either say, OK, if
we look at -- actually,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.670
look at this one.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:45.230
If it was centered at
0, could x equals 0?

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.370
Well, sure x could equal 0.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.620
If x is 0, then y squared
over 25 equals 1. y

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.560
squared equals 25.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.850
y would be plus or minus 5.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.590
So, in this case, this
term could be equal to 0.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.165
So we could say that x
could equal negative 1.

00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:06.050
If x is equal to negative 1,
then y minus 2 squared over 25

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.610
will equal -- let's do that.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.570
Let's set.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:16.430
If x is equal to negative 1,
x is equal to negative 1,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.510
then what does this
expression become?

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.530
I don't want to lose it, so
I'll write it right there.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:27.080
So then you get y minus
2 squared over 25.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.770
This becomes 0 minus
0 is equal to 1.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:39.520
So you get y minus 2 squared
over 25 is equal to 1.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.430
y minus 2 squared
is equal to 25.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.140
Just multiplied
both sides by 25.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.310
y minus 2 is equal to plus or
minus, I'm just taking the

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.790
square root of both sides, 5.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.590
So y minus 2 is equal to
positive 5 or y minus

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.470
2 is equal to minus 5.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.330
Add 2 to both sides of this,
you get y is equal to 7.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.530
Add 2 to both sides of this,
you get y is equal to minus 3.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:13.880
So we know that the points
minus 1, 7 and minus 1, minus

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.350
3, are both on this graph.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.090
So, minus 1 is here.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:26.410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, minus
1, 7, and minus 1, 1, 2,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.660
3, are both on this graph.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.610
So that lets us know, since
we're inside here, this tells

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.830
us that this is kind of a
vertical asymptote, and another

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.580
way to guess it is, if you
see that y squared

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.770
term is positive.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.200
Or the other way to think about
it is, when you take the

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.460
positive square root, when you
take the positive square root,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.210
you're always going to be a
little bit above the asymptote.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.730
That's the other way
to think about this.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.470
That we're always going to be
a little bit -- and this is

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.780
the positive square root.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.860
The positive square
root is the top line.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.480
So we're always going to be a
little bit above the asymptote.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.150
This is the asymptote.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.870
But we're always a
little bit above it.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.370
And obviously as this number
gets larger, this starts to

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.080
matter a lot less, so the
graph is going to look

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.740
something like this.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.870
It's going to come down and
then go off, and never quite

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.220
touch the asymptote,
but approach it.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.770
So it's going to get really
close to the asymptote, and

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.030
then go off, and go off
in that direction.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.970
Anyway, hope you
found that helpful.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.480
This was a slightly hairier
problem, so it should

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.050
be instructive.
