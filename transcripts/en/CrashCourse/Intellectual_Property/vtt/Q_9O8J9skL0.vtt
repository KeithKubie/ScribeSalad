00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
Hi I'm Stan Muller. This is Crash Course Intellectual
Property and today we're continuing our discussion

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.389
of copyright law. In his 2011 book, Infringement
Nation, Professor John Tehranian conducts

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.940
a thought experiment where he tracks a guy's
encounter with copyright law through the course

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.460
of an unremarkable day. Well we're going to
try this experiment and I don't really think

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.900
it will end up being a completely unremarkable
day. I mean, in our version I end up getting

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.180
a tattoo, which for me would be memorable.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.360
Look, I don't like to front-load the animation
sequences like this, but since we're doing

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.870
a thought experiment, we're going to have
to do it in the Thought Bubble.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.620
As soon as I wake up, I check my Twitter feed.
I spend the next thirty-five minutes or so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.610
retweeting everything One Direction posted
while I was asleep and each retweet creates

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.280
what might be an unauthorized reproduction
of 1D's copyrighted text. The same thing happens

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.620
with my email, and suddenly, I'm liable for millions
in damages before I even get out of the bed.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.690
Once I'm at work, I spend the morning procrastinating
and doodle pictures of Finn and Jake from

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.489
Adventure Time TPing Frank Gehry's Jay Pritzker
Pavilion, infringing on Time Warner's copyrights

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.600
on the characters and on Frank Gehry's architectural
rendering.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.390
After eight hours of work, my doodles are
good enough to have them tattooed on my left

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.570
shoulder. I commission this infringing work made
for hire and then I head off to my water aerobics

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.600
class sporting my fresh ink.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.890
When I hit the pool and Esther and Betty and
Dorcus ooh and ahh over my fresh new tat,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.280
I've engaged in a public display of this infringing
work. Beyond another few hundred thousand

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.060
dollars in statutory liability, "The copyright
act allows for the 'impounding' and 'destruction

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.630
or other reasonable disposition' of any infringing
work." That means Time Warner can either force

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.950
me to have the tattoo removed or they can
opt to destroy me.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810
Later, I post a bunch of my friend's pictures
to my Facebook timeline, and by posting those

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.119
I'm making an unauthorized copy, distribution,
and public display of her copyrighted photographs.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.670
I then head to another friend's birthday party
where I use my phone to record everyone singing

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.369
the Happy Birthday song, which still earns
an estimated two million dollars per year

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.850
and is actively enforced despite the fact that
it likely isn't even protected by copyright law.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.670
At the same time I accidentally capture and make
a copy of the artwork on the wall of the restaurant.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.690
So at the end of this hypothetical day, I
could be liable for millions of dollars and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.030
I might be destroyed. By the end of the year,
I'd be liable for more than 18 billion dollars,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.870
and if I hadn't been destroyed, I would have a wicked
bunch of scars from all that tattoo removal.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.500
Thanks Thought Bubble.
So, this story makes a few key assumptions.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.220
Two, a court assessing the maximum statutory
damages per instance of infringement.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.840
And three, the absence of the mitigating
effects of copyright exceptions and limitations.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.430
To me, the worrying thing about this scenario
is that so much of our normal everyday behavior

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.590
me, the worrying thing about this scenario
is that so much of our normal everyday behavior

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.430
puts us at risk of infringing copyright, especially
when so much of our life is digital.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.620
To quote Professor Ian Hargreaves: "The copyright
regime cannot be considered fit for the digital

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.640
age when millions of citizens are in daily
breach of copyright, simply for shifting a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.629
piece of music or video from one device to
another. People are confused about what is

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.190
allowed and what is not, with the risk that
the law falls into disrepute." In other words,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.840
when the law is so broad that pretty much
everyone is a copyright infringer, people

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.769
stop paying attention to those laws. When
the laws fail to keep up with technology,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.019
it loses legitimacy, and we become a nation
of scofflaws.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.959
So to make copyright laws work in the digital
age, there have to be copyright exceptions

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.690
and limitations. And there are. Fair use is
the most famous exception; we'll get to that

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.080
in a minute. But there are are also some more specific
exceptions and limitations we should look at.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.840
These exceptions cover a lot of different
uses, like reproduction of copyrighted works

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.950
for blind and disabled persons. They allow
libraries and archives to preserve, copy,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.290
and distribute protected works. It also limits
libraries' liability when a patron uses the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.159
copy machine to photocopy protected materials.
The first sale rule under Section 109 means

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.330
that once a copyright owner sells you a legal
copy of a book or something, they no longer

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.489
control the distribution rights of that particular
copy of the work. You, as the owner of a lawfully

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.310
made copy may sell, rent, donate it, or whatever.
This is why libraries can loan you a book

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.760
and what allows you to sell your books and
music to secondhand stores, if anyone does

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.520
that anymore. It's also what allows the three
remaining video stores in America to stay open.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.460
So this gives you the right to sell your books
and CDs, but you probably can't sell the digital

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250
music and books that you buy from Apple or
Amazon. The courts say that the first sale

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.599
right applies only to the distribution right
and not the reproduction right. Since selling

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.169
your MP3 collection would require making a
copy of those files, that is a no-no. As the

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.959
law stands now, there is no legal secondary
market for digital works of any type.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.559
When you click on that purchase or buy button
you're really not "buying" a copy of the

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.889
work, you're entering into a type of licensing
arrangement. And that's fine. I mean that

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.069
licensing agreement is in the Terms of Use,
which I'm sure you read- No? Didn't read it?

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.610
Well, I'm sure you clicked 'accept' or even
'I understand and accept' when you created

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.619
your Apple or Google or Amazon account, so,
you're in the agreement.

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.599
Some types of works like musical compositions
and sound recordings, for example, are subject

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.430
to compulsory or statutory licenses for certain
uses. These licenses provide legal authorization

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.039
to use a copyrighted work in certain ways
and for certain purposes, as long as the user

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.659
pays the required fee and otherwise meets
the conditions in the law. The copyright owner

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.469
can't deny you permission as long as you pay
up.

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.020
This is how artists get away with covering
other artist's songs. They just pay the fee

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.889
noticed that cover versions of popular songs
are kind of a big deal on YouTube.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.059
Searching "Frozen cover" turns up about
2.8 million results. How does this work?

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.119
"Frozen cover" turns up about 2.8 million
results. How does this work?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.440
Well, in 2011 YouTube entered into an agreement
with several major music publishers to allow

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.330
cover versions of songs to reside on the site,
with part of the advertising revenue going

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.479
to the original rights holders. So those are
a few of the specialized exceptions and limitations

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.349
to copyright enforcement. But by far, the
broadest, most flexible, most controversial,

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.389
and most famous copyright exception is fair
use.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.369
Courts have said the fair use defense allows
them to quote, "Avoid rigid application of

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:42.509
the copyright statute when, on occasion, it
would stifle the very creativity which that

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.469
law is designed to foster." Fair use acts
like a safety valve. It allows for certain

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.869
socially beneficial uses that you might otherwise
get in trouble for.

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:54.020
To paraphrase an 1841 court decision: "The
progress of learning advances when the law

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.830
allows follow-on authors to bestow their intellectual
labor and judgment in reworking selections

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.929
from a prior work, without prejudicing the
profits or prospects of that work." What?

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:07.110
Who would say this? Y'know, Mark, I would
love to advance the progress of learning by

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.320
bestowing my intellectual labor and judgment
on the reworking of this prior work, but uh,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.820
I just worry about prejudicing the profits
of the prospects of that work.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.119
Anyway, fair use is an affirmative defense,
which means the defendant must show and prove

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:23.339
that the use was fair and not an infringement.
The only way to definitively find out whether

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.999
something is fair use is by having a judge
tell you it is. And this is a problem when

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.969
taking a copyright case through trial costs
anywhere from $300,000 to a couple million

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.279
dollars. Some courts have called the fair
use exception the most troublesome in the

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.050
whole law of copyright. And they are not wrong.
I mean, the term fair use isn't defined in

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.250
the Copyright Act and courts have a lot of leeway
in how they decide if something is a fair use.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.059
Courts have to consider all the factual evidence
at hand for each particular case. And every

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:50.830
case is different thanks to the huge variety
of copyrightable works and the many contexts

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.229
in which these works can be used, like classroom
lessons, blog posts, YouTube videos, or in

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.789
a project where the entire contents of a university
library are digitized.

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.240
So how to decide. Courts use four factors
to determine whether a use is fair. The first

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.740
factor is the purpose and character of the
use. Like whether the use is commercial or

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.100
is for nonprofit educational purposes. Noncommercial
or educational uses weigh in favor of fair use.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.680
In the last twenty years courts have
expanded this factor to include consideration

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:20.819
of whether the work is transformative. They
look at whether the use actually transforms

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.869
the underlying purpose of the work by adding
a new meaning or message. Courts often hold

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:29.300
that parody as a transformative fair use. Parody
functions as a critical commentary of the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.119
original work. Courts have also recently held
that a project to digitize large collections

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37.559
of works and the making available of small segments
of texts from those works are transformative uses.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.560
That makes the Google Books project
a fair use. That Google Books decision is

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.629
currently in the appeals process though, so
it might not hold up.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.899
Publishers and authors will argue that merely
copying all these books without adding expression

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:52.809
or value other than placing the work within
a highly commercialized digital ecosystem

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:57.749
in a crass attempt to attract users, is not
transformative. Google tells a slightly different

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:02.550
story. They'd say the project makes these
works searchable, discoverable, and universally

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.619
accessible, and that that is a transformative
use with significant public benefit.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:10.459
The second factor has to do with the nature
of the copyrighted work. Courts have consistently

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.479
held that the more original and creative a
work is, the more protection it's given from

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.249
copying and it's less likely that a court
will find fair use. On the other hand, the

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:22.369
more informational or functional the plaintiff's
work, the broader the scope of the fair use

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:26.629
defense. In practice, this means that fictional
works tend to have a stronger copyright protection

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:31.189
as they're works of imagination. They're basically
pure expression. Nonfiction works like news,

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:35.169
biographies, and encyclopedias are filled
with uncopyrightable facts. This means they

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.860
require less creativity to make and they're
granted less protection under copyright law.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.979
The third factor basically looks at how much
of the work you use, and there are two parts

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:47.519
to this factor. The first is quantitative
substantiality. That looks at the amount of

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:52.269
work you use, like how much of the video or
how many pages of the book. So wait a minute.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:55.949
How did we get so far into an episode about exceptions without rolling the Mongol-tage? Hit it!

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:58.120
[Mongoltage Music]

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.839
The Mongoltage, besides being awesome, is
an excellent example of this factor. We use

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:06.850
three clips for a total of three seconds out
of a ninety minute film. I think we have a

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.540
pretty good case that this use isn't quantitatively
substantial. The other part of this is qualitative

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.089
substantiality. This refers to a use that
borrows only the most valuable part of the

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:19.029
source work. While I would argue that the
clips that comprise the Mongol-tage are the

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:23.920
most important and valuable parts of 1963's
Hercules vs. the Mongols, a court would probably

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.389
find that these clips aren't the heart of
the film. Spoiler Alert! The heart of the

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:29.550
film is when Hercules kills Genghis Khan.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.350
The fourth factor addresses the effect of
the use on the potential market for, or value

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.910
of the copyrighted work. What we're looking
at here is whether the derivative work has

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.430
harmed the copyright owner's ability to make
money from the original. Courts try to weigh

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.250
any public benefit derived from the new use
with the personal gain the original owner

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.339
will receive if the use is prohibited. If
your use doesn't damage the original copyright

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:51.679
owner's ability to make money, you don't
have to show a whole lot of public benefit.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.980
It's just hard to argue that you uploading Interstellar
to your YouTube channel has any public benefit.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.120
While these four factors are most often used
to determine fair use, courts can use any

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:05.259
other factors that they deem relevant, including
broad considerations of whether the use will

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.879
advance the public interest and the goals
of the Copyright Act. Unfortunately, this

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:13.509
means that there is no clear formula for how
courts determine fair use. Fair use is designed

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:18.129
to be a flexible tool, and any rule that's
flexible is necessarily unpredictable.

00:10:18.129 --> 00:10:21.939
Yet many people have argued that fair use
has become predictable in recent years.

00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:25.319
A string of court decisions have expanded
the meaning of what is considered to be a

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:29.709
transformative fair use. Courts are carving
out policy-specific areas, like education

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:33.540
where uses are pretty likely to be allowed.
User groups have published Best Practices

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.209
documents, many of which are available online;
we've got some links down below. Authors and

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:40.579
publishers argue the courts have expanded
the breadth of fair use too far, and that these

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:45.019
best practices guides are biased in favor of
expanding fair use. In the Supreme Court case

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:50.739
Harper &amp; Row v The Nation, the majority opinion
coined what I like to call the Copyright Golden Rule.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.740
Take not from others to such an extent and
in such a manner that you would be resentful

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.620
if they so took from you. Thanks for watching.

Crash Course: Intellectual Property is filmed
at the Chad and Stacy Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis,

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.870
Indiana and it's made by all of these nice
workers for hire. If you'd like to keep Crash

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.389
Course freely available for everyone forever,
you can support the series at Patreon a crowdfunding

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:15.550
platform that allows you to support the content
you love. Speaking of Patreon, we'd like to

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.920
thank our Headmaster of Learning: Thomas Frank
and our vice principals Kathy and Tim Philip

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.990
and Linnea Boyev. Thank you so much for supporting
Crash Course. You can get awesome rewards

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.330
for your support but you don't get
ownership of our Crash Course copyright.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.610
You do, however, get to help people learn.
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.
