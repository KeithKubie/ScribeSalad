00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.850
We here at the Khan
Academy are working

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.380
on some type of a
software project.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.080
And we need to
think about what's

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.660
the optimal number of
programmers we should hire,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.120
at least think about
how much productivity

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.960
we're getting per
programmer when we're

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.549
working on this
software project.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.840
And so what I've done over
here-- this is a spreadsheet

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.880
so I'm not going to
be able to write.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.963
I'll only be able to type.

00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:23.410
This is Microsoft
Excel right over here.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.530
In this column, I have
the different numbers

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.630
of programmers.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.090
And then let's say based on
other studies or industry

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.410
studies or our past
experience, this tells us

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.800
how many lines of programming
code we can get per month.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.850
And obviously, lines
of code isn't maybe

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.980
the best way to measure
things because someone

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.290
can write good lines
or bad lines of code.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.150
But let's just say this is one
way of measuring productivity

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.509
for software engineers.

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.300
So the first thing I'm
going to think about

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.990
is what are my fixed costs?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.690
So what am I going
to spend no matter

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.080
how many software engineers
I hire for this project?

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.750
And for the sake of this
video, my fixed costs

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
will be the office space
and the electricity

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.840
and let's assume I just have
an office that can accommodate

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.670
any number of these programmers.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.770
So that's a fixed cost.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.430
That's not going
to change depending

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.024
on the number of
programmers I have.

00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:10.690
And then the other
fixed cost, let's say

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.830
I have a product manager
for this project.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.280
And I'm going to pay her
salary to essentially

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.040
help spec out what this
software should actually do.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.680
So her salary is, let's
say, $10,000 a month

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.350
and then another $5,000 a month
in office space for everybody.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.100
So it's going to come
out to $15,000 a month.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.660
And that's not going to
change regardless of however

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.004
many programmers I have.

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:36.420
So I'm going to go into Excel
and go to this little bottom

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.380
right right over here.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.580
And I'm going to drag that down.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.120
And so it's going to be
$15,000 in fixed costs

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.260
no matter how many
programmers I end up hiring.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.540
Now the variable cost.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.090
Well, let's just say that
the full compensation

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.630
for a programmer
is $10,000 a month.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.685
So if you include the
cost of their salary,

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:00.220
if you include the cost
of their health insurance,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.100
you include the extra
goodies that they

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.860
will eat from the company
kitchen, whatever it might be.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.550
So it's going to
be $10,000 a month.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.400
So my variable my
total variable costs

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.670
are going to be $10,000 times
the number of programmers.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.610
So here I'm going to write
equals, and I'm going to write,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
it's going to be $10,000
per programmer times--

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.610
that little snowflake,
I pressed Shift +

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.120
8 to get that snowflake--
times, and I could

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.790
say times whatever
is in that cell.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.640
So you see it's cell D7.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.230
And actually let
me scroll this over

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.630
so that you can see the cells.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.070
So that is cell D7.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.040
And let me press Enter.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.320
So it's $10,000 times D7, which
is this one right over here.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.770
And I just selected that.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.180
And I can press Enter.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.250
And right now, that's nothing.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.610
Let me scroll over so we can see
everything a little bit better.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.080
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.970
There you go.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.120
I'm having trouble.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.640
OK.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.650
There you go.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.010
Now, what are going
to be my total costs?

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.690
My total costs are my fixed
costs plus my variable costs.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.180
So that's going to be equal
to-- and I'm just using my arrow

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.680
keys right now-- it's going
to be equal to F7, right?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.970
That's cell F7 plus this
one, plus my variable costs.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.890
My total costs are my fixed
costs plus my variable costs.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.960
And so it's $15,000.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.520
And actually, I can make this
true for every row over here.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.311
And this is one of the
really useful things

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:36.660
about a spreadsheet, is I
defined this cell as being

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.970
$10,000 times whatever this
cell is right over here.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.710
And so what I can just do
is I can just take that,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.217
drag that all the way down.

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:48.800
And for every one
of these, it's going

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.170
to take $10,000
times the cell that's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.250
essentially three to its left.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.630
So now it's going to
be 10,000 times D8.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.990
This will be 10,000 times D9.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.794
Let's get that.

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:02.210
So that we can see
it right there.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.080
10,000 times D9.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.802
And you could, if
you click on there,

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:07.510
you can actually see
what the formula is.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.770
10,000 times D9.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.180
So by dragging that, I was
able to get the right formula

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.120
all the way down.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.660
Now the total cost
for every row here

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.075
is going to be two to the
left plus one to the left.

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:20.450
And so if I drag
that down, it'll

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.330
do that for every row over here.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.950
So now this is 25, is
the 15 plus the 10.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.590
105 is 15 plus 90,000.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.370
Our total costs are fixed
costs plus variable costs.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.862
Now let's think about
the average fixed cost.

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:36.236
And the average
fixed cost, we're

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:40.790
going to think about it in fixed
cost per line of code produced.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.030
And over here, line
of code produced is 0.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.480
So we're going to divide
by 0, which is undefined.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.860
So we could leave that blank.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.384
But we could fill this one in.

00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:50.800
So our total fixed
costs-- this is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.950
going to be our total fixed
costs, which is cell F8.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.140
I just used the arrow
keys to select F8.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.300
Divided by our total
lines of code per month.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.370
So divided by our total
lines of code per month.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.060
And so that gets me $3.75
fixed costs per line of code.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.990
And then I can do the same thing
that I've been doing before.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.870
I can drag this down.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.670
And then we see what
the fixed cost is.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.290
So if at any given point if I
take the fixed cost, $15,000,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.060
divided by the lines
of code, I get $1.38.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.730
And this actually makes sense
because the more programmers I

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.600
add on to this project, the
more lines of code I get,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.480
I'm using the same
fixed costs I'm.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.350
Using the same project manager.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.920
I'm using the same office space.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.360
So the cost of that project
manager and that office space

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.740
gets spread out along
more and more code.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.660
So the fixed cost
per line of code

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.120
goes down as we add more
and more programmers.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.110
Now what is the average
of variable cost?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.750
So once again, the
variable cost is

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.410
going to be whatever
the variable cost is

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.550
per lines of code per month.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.050
So when we're talking
about average,

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.240
we're talking about average
cost per line of code.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.640
So this is per line of code.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.790
Let me write it over here.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.570
Per line of code.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.010
And I can even say per month.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.424
Per line of code per month.

00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:18.090
Actually, I wanted
that spread out more.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.780
But the way I've set it up.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.696
So let me scroll down.

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:21.340
Oops.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.590
I'm having issues here.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.090
All right.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.149
Well these are all average
lines of code per month.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:28.690
And so let's think
about what happens

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.212
with our variable costs.

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:31.920
So I'm also going to
start here because I

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.520
don't want to divide by 0.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.050
So in this month, our total
variable costs were $10,000

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.190
and our total lines of code
are going to be $4,000.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.710
G8 divided by E8.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.120
And so average variable cost
per line of code is 2.50 .

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.350
And then what happens?

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.617
So let's do that for
every row over here.

00:06:52.617 --> 00:06:55.200
So when we do it for every row,
something interesting happens.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.830
Our average fixed cost
went down because we're

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.788
taking the same cost and
we're spreading it out

00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:00.370
amongst more code.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.900
But our average
variable cost went up.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.660
As we added more programmers,
per line of code,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.410
it actually costs
us a little bit more

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.470
on average per line of code.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.420
And that's actually,
if you look here,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.452
as we add the incremental lines
of code we get per programmer

00:07:14.452 --> 00:07:15.410
is actually going down.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.390
That first programmer
by themselves,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.530
she can write 4,000
lines of code.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.710
But then that second programmer
you're not getting to 8,000,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.710
you're getting to 3,000.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.200
And probably because they have
to coordinate with each other.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.720
They have to plan
a little bit more.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.930
It's not all in
one person's head.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.490
Then, when you're
at the third one,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.281
you're not even adding
3,000 lines of code.

00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:35.077
You're only adding
2,000 lines of code.

00:07:35.077 --> 00:07:36.660
And this is actually
a real phenomenon

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.118
that actually
happens in companies.

00:07:38.118 --> 00:07:41.020
The more people you
add on to a project,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.690
obviously they can
maybe do more work,

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.050
but there's also
more coordination.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.250
There's going to
be more meetings.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.875
There's going to be
more interruptions.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:49.610
And so each person's
individual productivity

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.981
is going to go down.

00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:53.230
And this isn't to say that
this third coder is somehow

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.170
worse than the first coder.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.920
On average, all of
them are now only going

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.400
to produce 3,000 lines of code
a month, when maybe individually

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.696
they could have each
produced 4,000 lines of code,

00:08:03.696 --> 00:08:05.570
but they have to spend
some of their energies

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.820
now coordinating it.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.890
And so that's why our average
variable cost per line of code

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.010
is going up.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.290
As we add more and more
people, incrementally it's

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.330
becoming more and more
expensive on average

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.270
to write that line of code.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.540
And now if we look at
average total cost, that's

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.380
going to be-- and
this is once again,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.380
this is per line
of code-- is going

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.820
to be our total cost, H8 divided
by the total lines of code

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.020
per month.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.390
So if we just hire
one engineer, we're

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:42.195
going to have $6.25
spent per line of code.

00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:43.570
And this is actually
just the sum

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.200
of these two right over here.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.350
And then, let me set that
formula for every row.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.370
And so we see
something interesting.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.160
When we start to
hire a few engineers,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.260
we're able to spread out
our fixed costs, even

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.590
though our average variable cost
per line of code are going up,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.470
our fixed costs are going down.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.060
So it's actually we're getting
a little bit of a benefit

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.120
because we're spreading our
fixed cost per line of code.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.960
But then it starts to
get expensive again

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.870
because, as we said,
the more people you

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.370
have working on the
project, they're

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.850
going to have spend more time
coordinating with each other

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.800
and maybe even undoing
each other's work

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.480
or redoing each other's work
as opposed to just writing

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.510
the actual software.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.960
And now let's think
about the marginal cost.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.005
The marginal cost, the
best way to think about it

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:31.300
is, what is the incremental
cost of that next set of line

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.077
of code?

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:33.660
So one way to think
about it-- so this

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.740
is going to be how much
more you're spending

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.650
divided by how much more
code you're getting.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.150
So for example, how much
more-- and this is going to be,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.200
once again, per line of code.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.000
So when we go from zero
programmers to one programmer,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.410
we're going from
$15,000 of total cost

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.270
to $25,000 of total cost.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.180
We do it in parentheses.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.000
If we're going
from 15 to 25, that

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.510
means we're increasing our
expenditure by 25 minus 15.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.060
And so that's why I'm
doing H8 minus H7.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.150
So that's how much more we're
spending in expenditures.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.370
And then, how much more
code are we getting?

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:17.819
Well we're getting 4,000
minus 0 lines of code.

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:19.860
And the reason why I'm
doing the formula this way

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.590
is so that when we drag
it down on all the rows,

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.640
the formula will be
right because it's

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.430
relatively taking the
right cells into account.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.180
And the reason why I'm
saying it's average

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.554
is because this
is saying, what's

00:10:30.554 --> 00:10:33.780
the incremental cost per line of
code for this first 4,000 lines

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.700
of code?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.870
And then we can go from there.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.580
And we can drag it down.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.330
And now this tells us
the incremental cost

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.002
per code for the next
3,000 lines of code.

00:10:43.002 --> 00:10:44.460
And once again, it
got a little bit

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.880
more expensive because we're
getting a little bit less

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.245
efficient as we add
more and more people.

00:10:49.245 --> 00:10:51.620
And there's something very
interesting that happens here.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.300
And you might have even noticed
it in these numbers over here.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.104
We actually get a
negative marginal cost.

00:10:56.104 --> 00:10:58.520
And this isn't meaning that
when we add more lines of code

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.740
somehow we're getting money.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.890
It's actually saying that
as we spend more money,

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.510
we're actually
killing lines of code.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.593
Because at some point, if
you have too many people

00:11:06.593 --> 00:11:08.680
on this one project
team, they actually

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.627
start killing each
other's productivity.

00:11:10.627 --> 00:11:12.710
And you can even see it
right here in the numbers.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.120
When we had seven
people, we were

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.942
able to write 11,400
lines of code.

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:18.150
But then the eighth person,
because of coordination--

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.130
it's not that this eighth
person is incompetent,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.088
it's just when you have
eight people on a team,

00:11:22.088 --> 00:11:23.830
everyone's productivity
goes down so

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.970
that you're only able to
produce 11,200 lines of code.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.377
And that's why you had this
negative marginal cost.

00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:31.460
Now, when you get to eight
people, all of a sudden

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.330
by spending more
dollars, you're actually

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.532
destroying some of what you
were actually trying to produce.

00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:37.990
So what I wanted
to do here is just

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.610
to really get you
behind the numbers

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:40.960
and really maybe give
you a little sense of how

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.870
you can actually do
this with a spreadsheet.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.770
And get you thinking a little
bit about how a firm's cost

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.840
structure might actually work.
