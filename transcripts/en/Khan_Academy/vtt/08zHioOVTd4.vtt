00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.370
- [Instructor] We're
asked at how many points

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.590
do the graph of y equals sine of theta

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.590
and y equal cosine theta

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.640
intersect for theta
between zero and two pi?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.780
And it's zero is less
than or equal to theta

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.280
which is less than or equal to two pi,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.710
so we're gonna include zero and two pi

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.200
in the possible values for theta.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.380
So to do this,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.490
I've set up a little chart
for theta, cosine theta,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.380
and sine theta,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.630
and we can use this to,
and the unit circle,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.280
to hopefully quickly graph what the graphs

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.460
of y equals sine theta and
y equals cosine theta are

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
and then we can think about
how many times they intersect

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.670
and maybe where they actually intersect.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.140
So let's get started.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.210
So first of all just to be clear,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.160
this is a unit circle.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.720
This is the x-axis, this is the y-axis.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.040
Over here we're going to
graph these two graphs.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.810
So this is going to be the y-axis,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.880
and it's going to be a
function of theta, not x,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.900
on the horizontal axis.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.090
So first let's think about what happens

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.830
when theta is equal to zero.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.060
So when theta is equal to zero,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.820
you're at this point right over here,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.720
let me do it in a different color,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.810
you're at this point right
over here on the unit circle,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.530
and what coordinate is that?

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.260
Well that's the point

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.320
one comma zero.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.010
And so based on that,
what is cosine of theta

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.440
when theta is equal to zero?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.730
Well cosine of theta is one

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.740
and sine of theta is going to be zero.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.840
This is the x-axis at
the point of intersection

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.690
with the unit circle, this is sorry,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.430
this is the x-coordinate at
the point of intersection

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.610
with the unit circle,
this is the y-coordinate.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.880
Let's keep going.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.180
What about pi over two?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.740
So pi over two,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.640
we're right over here.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.053
What is that coordinate?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
Well that's now x is zero, y is one.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.110
So based on that, cosine of theta is zero,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.560
and what is sine of theta?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.060
Well that's going to be one.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.230
It's the y-coordinate right over here.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.920
Now let's go all the way to pi.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.800
Now let's go to all the way to pi.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.790
We're at this point in the unit circle.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.013
What is the coordinate?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.940
Well this is negative one comma zero,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.290
so what is cosine of theta?

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.110
Well it's the x-coordinate
here, which is negative one.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.830
And sine of theta's going
to be the y-coordinate,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.170
which is zero.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.660
Now let's keep going.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.800
Now we're down here at three pi over two.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.890
If we go all the way around
to three pi over two,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.440
what is this coordinate?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.400
Well this is zero negative one.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.090
Cosine of theta is the x-coordinate here,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.230
so cosine of theta is going to be zero,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.950
and what is sine of theta going to be?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.830
Well it's going to negative one.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.150
And then finally we go back to two pi,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.510
which is making a full
revolution around the circle.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.170
We went all the way around,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.390
and we're back to this
point right over here.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.410
So the coordinate is the exact same thing

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.063
as when the angle equaled radio,

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:56.230
(laughing) equals zero radians,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.470
and so what is cosine of theta?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.660
Well that's one,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.120
and sine of theta is zero.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.380
And from this we can make
a rough sketch of the graph

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.490
and think about where
they might intersect.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.750
So first let's do cosine of theta.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.310
When theta is zero,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.450
and let me draw, let me mark this off,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.957
so this is going to be
when y is equal to one,

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:20.060
and this is when y is
equal to negative one.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.010
So y equals cosine of theta,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.747
I'm gonna graph, let's
see theta equals zero,

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:26.750
cosine of theta equals one.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.200
So cosine of theta is equal to one.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.180
When theta's equal to pi over two,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.670
cosine of theta is zero.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.742
When theta's equal to pi,

00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:39.040
cosine of theta is negative one.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.940
When theta is equal to three pi over two,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910
cosine of theta is equal to zero.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.200
That's this right over here.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.051
And then finally when theta's two pi,

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:49.680
cosine of theta is one again,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.670
is one again.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.070
And the curve will look something,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.980
will look something like this,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.190
my best attempt to draw it.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.080
Make it a nice smooth curve.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.130
So it's going to look something,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.587
something, something like this.

00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:07.760
The look of these curves
should look somewhat familiar

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.980
at this point, so it should
look something like this.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.580
So this is the graph of y
is equal to cosine of theta.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.970
Now let's do the same
thing for sine theta.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.160
When theta's equal to zero,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.080
sine theta is zero.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.803
When theta is pi over
two, sine of theta is one.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.910
When theta is equal to pi,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.630
sine of theta is zero.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.410
When theta's equal to three pi over two,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.530
sine of theta is negative one,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.210
is negative one.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.610
When theta's equal to two pi,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.690
sine of theta is equal to zero.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.638
And so the graph of sine of
theta's gonna look something,

00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:46.790
something like,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.540
something like this, my
best attempt at drawing it,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.790
is going to look something like this.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.860
So just visually,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.620
we can think about the question.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.590
At how many points do the
graphs of y equals sine of theta

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.215
and y equal cosine of theta intersect

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:03.260
for this range for theta,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.570
for theta being between zero and two pi,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.493
including those two points?

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.190
Well you just look at this graph,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.920
you see there's two
points of intersection,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.681
this point right over here and this point

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.830
right over here, just over the,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.480
between zero and two pi.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.580
These are cyclical graphs.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.270
If we kept going, they
would keep intersecting

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.530
with each other, but
just over this two pi,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.370
just over this two pi range for theta,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.290
you would get two points of intersection.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.270
Now let's think about what they are

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.190
because they look,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.160
they look to be pretty close between,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.650
between right between zero and pi over two

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.070
and right between pi
and three pi over two.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.900
So let's look at our unit
circle if we can figure out

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.733
what those values are.

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:48.850
Let's it looks like, it looks
like this is at pi over four.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.080
So let's verify that.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.130
So let's think about what these
values are at pi over four.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.490
So pi over four is that angle

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.300
or that's the terminal side of it,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.460
so this is pi over four.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.130
Pi over four is the exact same thing

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.990
as a 45 degree angle.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.350
So let's do pi over four right over here.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.540
so we have to figure
out what this point is,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.500
what the coordinates are.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.190
So let's make this,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.840
let's make this a right triangle.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.050
It's a right triangle.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.210
And so what do we know
about this right triangle?

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.870
And I'm gonna draw it right over here

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.703
to make it a little clearer.

00:06:20.703 --> 00:06:23.190
This is a very typical
type of right triangle

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.110
so it's good to get some
familiarity with it.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.310
So let me draw my best attempt, all right.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.660
So we know it's a right triangle.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.210
We know that this is 45 degrees.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.600
What is the length of the hypotenuse?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.810
Well this is a unit
circle, has radius one,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.670
so the length of the
hypotenuse here is one.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.783
And what do we know about
this angle right over here?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.500
Well we know that it
too must be 45 degrees

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.160
because all of these angles
have to add up to 180.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.620
And since these two angles are the same,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.850
we know that these two sides
are going to be the same.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.390
And then we could use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.340
to think about the length of those sides.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.170
So using the Pythagorean theorem,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.110
knowing that these two sides are equal,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.573
what do we get for the
length of those sides?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.070
Well let's call these,
if this has length a,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.000
well then this also has length a,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.720
and we can use the Pythagorean theorem

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.070
and we could say a squared plus a squared

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.760
is equal to the hypotenuse
squared, is equal to one.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.090
Or two a squared is equal to one.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.953
a squared is equal to 1/2.

00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:30.790
Take the principle root of both sides,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.470
a is equal to the square root of 1/2,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.800
which is the square root
of one which is one,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.690
over the square root of two.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.800
We can rationalize the denominator here

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.610
by multiplying by square root of two

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.880
over square root of two,

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.600
which gives us a is equal to,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.580
in the numerator square root of two,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.980
and in the denominator square root of two

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.430
times square root of two is two.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.130
So this length is square
root of two over two

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.020
and this length is the same thing.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.760
So this length right over here

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.760
is square root of two over two

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.620
and this height right over here is also

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.840
square root of two over two.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.730
So based on that,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.940
what is this coordinate point?

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.230
Well it's square root of
two over two to the right

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.170
in the positive direction,

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.570
so x is equal to square
root of two over two,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.910
and y is square root of two over two

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.070
in the upwards direction,
in the vertical direction,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.100
the positive vertical direction,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.240
so it's also square root of two over two.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.350
Cosine of theta is just the,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.420
is just the x-coordinate,

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.440
so it's square root of two over two.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.127
Sine of theta's just the y-coordinate.

00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:31.830
So you see immediately that they do,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.660
they are indeed equal at that point.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.990
So at this point they are both equal to

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.550
square root of two,

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.600
they're both equal to
square root of two over two.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.470
Now what about this point right over here

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.470
which looks right in between
pi and three pi over two?

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.530
So that's going to be,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.000
so this is pi, this is three pi over two,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.531
it is right,

00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:56.090
it is right over here.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.590
So it's another pi over four plus pi,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.290
so pi plus pi over four

00:09:02.378 --> 00:09:04.920
is the same thing as four pi
over four plus pi over four.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.270
So this is the angle five pi over four.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.390
So this is five pi over four.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.490
So this is equal to five pi over four.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.040
So that's what we're trying to figure out.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.750
What are the value of these functions

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.490
at theta equal five pi over four?

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.120
Well there's multiple
ways to think about it.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.060
You could even use a little
bit of geometry to say,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.270
well if this is a 45 degree angle,

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.440
then this right over here
is also a 45 degree angle.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.090
You could say that the reference angle

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.770
in terms of degrees is 45 degrees.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.330
And we could do a very similar thing.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.040
We can draw a right triangle.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.490
We know the hypotenuse is one.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.729
We know that if this is a right angle,

00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:47.190
this is 45 degrees.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.620
If that's 45 degrees then
this is also 45 degrees,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.080
and we have a triangle
that's very similar,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.550
it's actually, they're
actually congruent triangles.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.780
So hypotenuse is one, 45-45-90,

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.850
we then know that the length of this side

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.380
is square root of two over two

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.230
and the length of this side is
square root of two over two,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.150
the exact same logic we used over here.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.900
So based on that,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.150
based on that,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.940
what is the coordinate of that point?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.720
Well let's think about the x value.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.260
It's square root of two over
two in the negative direction.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.690
We have to go square root of two over two

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.200
to the left of the origin,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.900
so it's negative square
root of two over two.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.810
This point right over,
this point on the a-xis

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.030
is negative square root of two over two.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.250
What about the y value?

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.813
Well we had to go square
root of two over two down,

00:10:36.813 --> 00:10:39.930
in the downward direction from the origin,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.580
so it's also negative
square root of two over two.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.844
So sine of, cosine of theta's
negative square root of two

00:10:46.844 --> 00:10:49.210
over two and sine of theta's also negative

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.480
square root of two over two.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.360
And so we see that we do
indeed have the same value

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.290
for cosine of theta and
sine of theta right there.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.050
They're both equal to,

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.290
they're both at that point equal to

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.813
the negative, the negative
square root of two over two.
