00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.920
WE CONTINUE TONIGHT OUR SERIES

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.953
FROM AUSTRALIA.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.194
JOHN OLIVER LEARNED THAT

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.002
FOLLOWING A MASS SHOOTING IN

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.134
STRAUL, THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.775
GUN CONTROL, AND IT WORKED.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.749
SO HOW CAN AMERICA TAKE THIS

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.629
VALUABLE LESSON AND IGNORE IT?

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.689
JOHN OLIVER FINDS OUT IN THIS,

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.489
OUR FINAL INSTALLMENT.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.416
&gt;&gt; PREVIOUSLY I WENT TO STRAUL

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.823
WHEN I LEARNED IN 1996 THEIR

00:00:26.823 --> 00:00:28.034
GOVERNMENT ENACTED SWEEPING GUN

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:29.034
CONTROL LAWS.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.722
THE RESULT-- REDUCED GUN

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.521
VIOLENCE AND ZERO MASS

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:32.921
SHOOTINGS.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.154
SO ARE THERE ANY LESSONS FOR

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.495
AMERICA HERE?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.503
VIRGINIA GUN ADVOCATE HAS A

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:38.934
CLEAR ANSWER.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.441
&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT AUSTRALIA.

00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:41.975
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURE,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.548
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.981
EVERYTHING.

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.895
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SIMILARITY WITH

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.300
AUSTRALIA.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.735
AUSTRALIA IS A FORMER BRITISH

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.475
COLONY WITH A WORLD FRONTIER

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.183
THAT WAS TAMED BY BRAVE MEN WHO

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:55.150
ALSO WIPED OUT ALMOST AN ENTIRE

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.350
INDIGENOUS POPULATION, AND WE

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.602
ARE?

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:02.662
NOT SIMILAR TO THAT, RIGHT?

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.394
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.567
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:06.967
BECAUSE UNLIKE AUSTRALIA, WE

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:07.994
AMERICANS KNOW WHEN THE GUNS ARE

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.403
TAKEN AWAY, TYRANNY INEVITABLY

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:10.734
FOLLOWS.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.374
&gt;&gt; THE FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.983
THAT GOVERNMENTS TEND TO GROW

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:16.340
BEYOND THEIR MEANS.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.860
IN AMERICA, WE'RE STEPPING IN

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.495
THE DIRECTION OF A POLICE STATE.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.860
&gt;&gt; IS THAT REALLY HAPPENING,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.527
PHILLIP, OR IS THAT SOME KIND OF

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:27.220
CRAZY PARANOIA?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.114
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE POLICE.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.642
THEY'RE NOW WEARING NINJA SUITS

00:01:30.642 --> 00:01:31.541
IF YOU WILL.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:32.681
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:33.501
POLICE NECESSARILY.

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.461
THEY HAVE THE BLACK MASKS ON AND

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:34.860
EVERYTHING.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920
&gt;&gt; IT ISN'T CRAZY PARANOIA.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.079
YOU'RE FRIGHTENED ABOUT NINJA

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.700
POLICE.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.920
&gt;&gt; NINJA POLICE, YES.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.380
&gt;&gt; YEAH, NINJA POLICE.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.769
&gt;&gt; SADLY WITHOUT ACCESS TO

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:48.995
SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.635
AUSTRALLIANS WOULDN'T BE A THING

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.440
ABOUT REAL FREEDOM.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.035
&gt;&gt; BLOODY EARTH IS FOR FREE.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.372
WE'RE SITTING HERE DOING

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.248
WHATEVER WE WANT.

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.207
EVERYBODY IS JUST HANGING OUT

00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:58.168
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:00.095
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.136
CONCERNS ANY MORE ABOUT GETTING

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.680
GUNNED DOWN WHEN THEY'RE IN A

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.280
TOURIST RESORT.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.415
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WAS THAT WORTH IT?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.820
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.622
&gt;&gt; WAS IT WORTH GIVING UP YOUR

00:02:06.622 --> 00:02:08.288
FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS JUST TO NOT

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:10.349
GET SHOT IN A GUN MASSACRE?

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.508
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) ARE YOU

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:12.500
TALKING ABOUT?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.520
&gt;&gt; AUSTRALIANS MUST NOW LIVE IN

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.689
THIS WELL-REGULATED NIGHTMARE

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.684
BECAUSE OF EX-POLITICIANS LIKE

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:22.164
ROB WHO SMUGGLING THINKS HIS

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:23.161
COUNTRY HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.161
US.

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:25.495
&gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.140
LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.440
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.074
LIKE THIS?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.148
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY MIGHT WANT A

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.649
SAFER SOCIETIA TO LIVE IN.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.849
&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S POINTLESS FOR US TO

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.130
STUDY THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.431
BECAUSE THEIR FEAR OF GUN

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.300
CONTROL BACK THEN HAS NO

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.168
PARALLELS WITH OURS.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.003
WHAT KIND OF THINGS WERE YOU

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.205
HEARING WHEN YOU SUGGEST GUN

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:51.572
CONTROL?

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:52.472
&gt;&gt; THAT GOVERNMENT WAS BECOMING

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.875
A DICTATORSHIP.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:55.442
&gt;&gt; THAT'S ONE.

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:56.577
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WOULD

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:59.112
NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.614
THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR FAMILY.

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.782
&gt;&gt; ANOTHER THAT'S DEFINITELY

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:02.049
TWO.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.117
&gt;&gt; THAT DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.119
SOMEHOW IF GOVERNMENT DECIDES

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.354
THERE SHOULD BE A BACKGROUND

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:07.654
CHECK.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.889
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, THREE.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.429
&gt;&gt; WE'RE ABOUT TO BE INVADED BY

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.119
THE INDONESIANS.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.180
&gt;&gt; THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.380
NO ONE IN AMERICA IS AFRAID OF

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.400
INDONESIANS.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.901
ARE THEY AFRAID OF MEXICANS AND

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:19.120
MUSLIMS COMING?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.554
MAYBE,.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.762
SURE, HE CLAIMS AUSTRALIANS WERE

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:23.862
ANGRY, BUT WHERE IS THE PROOF?

00:03:23.862 --> 00:03:25.142
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE BEING

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:26.462
TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.

00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:28.142
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ANY

00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:29.702
GUNS.

00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:31.168
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE YOURS UP?

00:03:31.168 --> 00:03:31.927
&gt;&gt; NO!

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:33.155
&gt;&gt; OKAY, THERE IS IT IS.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.329
BUT HOW DID THE ANGRY

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:35.954
CONSERVATIVES FEEL NOW?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.163
&gt;&gt; MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.902
THAT IT WAS AN IVORY ACTION BUT

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:43.682
AS TIME WENT ON, THE REGULATIONS

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.088
WERE QUITE MANAGEABLE.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:46.996
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.235
GIVE UP YOUR HIGH-POWERED GUN?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.918
&gt;&gt; NO, BUT-- I FELT AS IF I HAD

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.876
A BIT OF A DUTY TO THE REST OF

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.247
SOCIETY.

00:03:57.247 --> 00:03:59.209
&gt;&gt; AND IF YOU THINK THAT SOUNDS

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.529
BAT ( BLEEP ) CRAZY, THIS

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:02.569
EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL WAS

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.380
ENACTED BY CONSERVATIVE

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:05.783
OLITICIANS AGAINST THE WILL OFP

00:04:05.783 --> 00:04:08.800
THEIR OWN BASE.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.622
OUR POLITICIANS ARE DIFFERENT.

00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:12.221
THANE THAT--

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.521
&gt;&gt; GUN CONTROL DOESN'T WORK.

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:14.854
&gt;&gt; OR EVEN IF IT DOES--

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.362
&gt;&gt; IT TAKES A LONG TIME.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.501
&gt;&gt; AND TO BE FAIR.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.876
&gt;&gt; JOHN HOWARD AND HIS DEPUTY

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.254
PRIME MINISTER TIM FISHER HAVE

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.603
HAD SINCE 1996 TO ENACT THEIR

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.140
SWEEPING REFORMS.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.169
&gt;&gt; IT LOOK LESS THAN THREE AND A

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.600
HALF MONTHS.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.160
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.100
WHAT? !

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.520
&gt;&gt; THE MASSACRE WAS ON THE

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.020
28th OF APRIL IN 1996.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.820
IN A 12-WEEK PERIOD SHORTLY

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.122
FOLLOWING THAT, THE BULK OF THE

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:39.122
LEGISLATION WAS DEVISED,

00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:42.002
DRAFTED, DEBATED, AND

00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:43.382
IMPLEMENTED.

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.338
&gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.760
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE NO MASSACRES SINCE

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.058
1996.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.428
&gt;&gt; YOU KEEP SAYING THAT, BUT IT

00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:49.954
DOESN'T WORK.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.661
MY HEAD WAS SPINNING.

00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:54.394
I HAD TO CLEAR IT THE

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.270
TRADITIONAL AUSSIE WAY.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.328
NOT THAT WAY, A WALK-ABOUT.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.460
&gt;&gt; THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.860
SACROSANCT.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.428
&gt;&gt; POLITICAL SUICIDE.

00:05:04.428 --> 00:05:18.333
&gt;&gt; FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:29.371
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE ( BLEEP )?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.739
AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE BUSH

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:40.079
WITH A GUY THERE A KANGAROO SUIT

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.200
IT BECAME CLEAR WHAT THE REAL

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.334
ISSUE WITH GUN CONTROL IN

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.107
AMERICA IS.

00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:46.771
&gt;&gt; IF GUNS AREN'T THE PROBLEM,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.567
FILL, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.187
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE.

00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:49.127
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM?

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:49.454
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.300
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.760
AFTER SPENDING GREAT AMOUNT OF

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.195
TIME WITH YOU, PHILLIP, I'M

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.801
STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.702
PARTIALLY TRUE.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.557
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.935
&gt;&gt; I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.174
PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.916
&gt;&gt; THAT IS BECOMING JUST

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.389
PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.801
AFTER INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE ON

00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:12.502
OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE EARTH, I

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.034
DISCOVERED THAT IF AMERICANS

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.062
REALLY DO WANT GUN CONTROL,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.635
THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE THING THEY

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.262
CAN DO TO GET IT.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.550
MOVE TO AUSTRALIA.
