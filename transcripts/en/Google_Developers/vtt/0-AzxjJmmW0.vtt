00:00:05.478 --> 00:00:08.964
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [FAKE SNORING]

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.950
Oh, hey!

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.460
Welcome to my living room.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm just kidding.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.910
We're still at I/O 2017.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.130
And here I am with
Spence and Nikhil,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.230
and we're going to
talk about Assistant.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.270
Spence, what's going
on in this room?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.940
SPENCE: We have a
living room set up.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.320
You're actually hanging
out in our living room.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.110
We've got a Google Home set up
with a bunch of very cool home

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.550
devices.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So you can
control all of these devices

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.670
with your voice?

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.690
SPENCE: Yes, yes I can.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, which ones?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.262
What do you got?

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:38.470
SPENCE: We've got a television,
which is a necessity,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.220
of course.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.930
We have a fan.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.680
We've got a thermostat,
two lights, speakers,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.910
and even an air purifier.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [LAUGHS]

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.770
That's awesome.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.010
Can we turn on the fan?

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.080
SPENCE: Let's try that.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.667
Hey Google, turn on the
fan in the living room.

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:55.666
GOOGLE HOME: You got it.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.520
Turning the fan on.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.270
SPENCE: Excellent.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.660
It's a little chilly, though.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.790
Hey Google, please
turn off the fan.

00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:06.127
GOOGLE HOME: Sure,
turning the fan off.

00:01:06.127 --> 00:01:07.126
TIMOTHY JORDAN: [LAUGHS]

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:08.110
That's so much fun.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.651
NIKHIL: So what's
happening over here

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:11.860
is Google Home is
basically connected

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.740
to Genie Plugs for the fan,
and it's connected to Honeywell

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.900
for the thermostat.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.810
And so it's able to
understand your query,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.030
able to understand what
the user's intent is,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.670
convert it into
a structured form

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.920
that we can then communicate
out to Honeywell or Genie

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.500
and actually fulfill the action.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.150
So it's going over the cloud.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.945
It's going over Wi-Fi and
actually getting things done.

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:35.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.897
Let's see, is there anything
else we want to try?

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.820
SPENCE: We can do the lights.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Let's do the lights.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.800
SPENCE: How about that?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.980
It's blue right now.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.970
Let's go for--

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.230
Hey Google, turn the lights
red in the living room.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.555
GOOGLE HOME: Sure,
changing two lights to red.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:52.060
SPENCE: That's a mood thing.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Whatever
the party calls for.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.130
SPENCE: It works.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.707
It works.

00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:55.915
We also have an air purifier.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.057
We have a TV.

00:01:57.057 --> 00:01:59.140
We can basically have some
fun in the living room.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.264
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's the
living room of the future.

00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:03.850
Wayne, come on over here and
tell me about the developer

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.160
angle with all of this stuff.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.520
What are developers
able to interact with?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.490
WAYNE: Well, the nice
thing is at I/O here,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.920
we've announced
the Smart Home API.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.800
So it allows developers to
build their own devices.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.130
And they've got their cloud.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.150
We've got an SDK that allows
it to plug in really easily.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.710
So all of these
device makers were

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.440
able to easily integrate
their devices like light bulbs

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.570
and thermostats in
with our ecosystem

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.950
so it can be controlled easily.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.783
And the nice thing is
that Google Home takes

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:33.730
care of all the speech
recognition, all

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.410
the natural language
understanding,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.360
and you just get simple commands
to your light bulbs that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.250
tell you what to do-- turn
it off, change its color,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.750
or whatever.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.359
So it's really easy.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.150
We've got open source
samples that show how

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.590
to build a virtual light bulb.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.730
And then you basically
just hook that

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.675
into your existing
infrastructure,

00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:47.550
and you're good to go.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.258
So it's actually really
simple, and we're

00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:51.910
adding new APIs all the time
for different kinds of devices.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.580
So we've got a couple here,
but there's plenty more coming.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.579
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.713
Well, hey, let's just hang out
and watch the game, shall we?

00:02:58.713 --> 00:02:59.754
WAYNE: Oh, wait a minute.

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:01.630
We've got watch this
video first of you and me.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.296
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
yeah, let's do that.

00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:09.418
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:11.870
[LAUGHS]

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.187
It's vintage.

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:15.960
